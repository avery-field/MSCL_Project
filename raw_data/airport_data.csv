20th March 2022,2,"""Airport is filthy""","Not Verified |  I will leave a couple of tips - Saturday night 3-19-2022 - 1) Airport is filthy - Carpet is horrible and not cleaned. 2) Seats are torn and look like they are from the 80's. 3) No Food or coffee available after 9? - you have Spirit Airlines here, you should think about they are never on time or late so maybe something for the disgruntled passengers something. 4) Maybe, just maybe update to the new century we live in - power and USB charging ports would be a fresh idea? Just some helpful tips for you!"
4th March 2022,3,"""As everyone has repeated they are rude""","✅ Trip Verified | As everyone has repeated they are rude, and give unnecessarily contradictory and complicated instructions. For example, at the check in 3/4 at 6.50 am I was told to walk forward and simultaneously push my items through on a backed up overflowing conveyor belt. I asked the female agent to clarify which she wants me to do she tells me to push my items forward. How on an overflowing conveyor belt as you are also yelling at me to go through the metal detector? Her response was a condescending “make it make sense” as if the passengers were too stupid to understand. Atlanta and Miami are always the worse with Atlanta far exceeding Miami. I know it won’t get better because this is how it’s been. I wish TSA would improve its hiring and training."
10th February 2022,2,"""What an embarrassment""","✅ Trip Verified |  What an embarrassment for a supposedly premier international airport. 2 TSA agents essentially unmasked (masks under chin) despite federal mandate, TSA agents extremely rude and aggressive. All food options closed by 8pm. Really - does the person responsible for running this place really not have a clue how poorly run and embarrassing this airport is?"
15th January 2022,3,"""Complete disorganization and mayhem""","✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived as a connection to our international trip around 8 pm, expecting that we’ll be able to eat dinner before boarding our 11 pm flight to Paris. Every single restaurant and food place in the F terminal (where I believe all international flights happen) were closed. Every single one. We were gobsmacked. Upon our return home, we had another connection through ATL. Customs line was horrifically long and the security lines to our connecting flight were awful. Our first flight was delayed, but despite that, we still had two hours to get to our connecting flight, and we still missed it. Complete disorganization and mayhem. Spent the night in Atlanta."
3rd January 2022,1,"""Embarrassing that this is a premier airport""",Not Verified |  Arrived on KLM/Delta from Amsterdam. The transition from the international to domestic terminals is awful and confusing with only rude help available at the scene. What were the designers thinking with whether no or confusing signage and a mostly unmarked maize to get from baggage recheck from Intl to domestic gates. Embarrassing that this is a premier airport. Very sad. Will avoid in the future.
31st December 2021,1,"""Food, and trash on chairs and floor""","Not Verified |  Disgusting. I got stuck over night on 12/26/21. The area for my Delta flight was disgusting. Food, and trash on chairs and floor. It was obvious it was not being cleaned let alone sanitized, four days later and I’m in line for a Covid test. Thanks!"
28th December 2021,3,"""The experience was disgraceful""","✅ Trip Verified | Aggressive, rude TSAs. My sister has sleep apnoea, to breathe at night, she must carry a CPAP machine. She has asthma, she needs a special inhaler. Her bag was pulled aside not once, nor twice, her bag was detained 'three times'. The TSA agents opened her bag, removed the CPAP machine, and failed to recognize the secondary inhaler machine as another appliance that needed to be scanned separately. Unprofessional and a waste of time. My sister was glared at, accused of being difficult, and treated with such distain and rudeness that her anxiety (for which she is on medication) spiked. Badly. It has been several hours since then, and she is still near tears when she describes her experience. An agent held his hand up in her face to cut her off when she tried to speak to him, and was spoken to both sharply and aggressively when she tried to cooperate. On top of all that, when her bags were thrown in bins to be rescanned, her brand-new neck pillow was jostled loose. Additionally, there was a forgotten black-and-red laptop that sat where it was for over 10 minutes. My sister's medical equipment got scanned three times, but nobody noticed an abandoned device for almost a quarter of an hour? Is this negligence or ignorance? The experience was disgraceful. Unprofessional is too kind a description for the treatment my sister endured."
26th December 2021,4,"""airport is genuinely insufferable""","Not Verified | This airport is genuinely insufferable. If you book a flight at 6, you might as well be prepared to leave at 10 and sit in a chair for hours. I am a frequent flyer here and I have never once had a flight that didn't have a major screw-up or set back. One would assume operating an airport would constitute having functional facilities and airplanes but Atlanta Hartsfield does things differently. I almost never write reviews for anything but Hartsfield has burnt me so many times that I felt like warning anyone curious. I'm nauseated with paying hundreds of dollars to leave at a specified time and quite literally never once having my end of the deal held up. If you have options, weigh them well."
8th December 2021,3,"""there were very few people working""","Not Verified |  Arrived from the UK on 2nd December. Despite there only being less than a hundred people or so in the queue it took over an hour to get through passport control as there were very few people working. Only one kiosk was going through passengers with special assistance/in wheelchairs and as such there was a queue of over ten people in wheelchairs waiting, I hope none of them became unwell during this time. On our return we were very surprised that in F/international terminal all food outlets closed at 7pm, considering most flights heading East depart later in the evening and at night time this hardly makes a lot of sense. This information isn't even on the website so we couldn't prepare and eat in advance."
6th December 2021,2,"""I have never had such a poor experience at an airport""","Not Verified |  The airport is very chaotic beginning with my son having to let me out in the middle of the street due to no traffic directing for departure. I have been flying Delta and a skymiles member preferring Delta due to their quality customer service until I had the most rude and disrespectful Delta agent at the luggage check in. She was very impatient barking orders for me to scan my boarding pass and not giving me time to comply before barking another order what's my name she was so impatient. I have severe arthritis and it takes me awhile to use my hands due to stiffness and lost of feeling in my fingers. I handed her my ID as the scanner did not appear to be working. She was sucking her teeth and rolling her eyes it was so uncomfortable dealing with her attitude. I ask could I check my other bag if the flight was full instead of at the gate again due to disability of having to take bags to the gate. She then saw I had my 4 lbs yorkie in her carrier and stated is that an animal. I told her yes she is a dog, I was accused of trying to sneak the dog past her. She would not allow me talk at all. I finally asked for another agent to assist me while she continued to speak to me defensively. Finally another agent come over and took care of me while she continued to fuss in front of him. I asked her please stop speaking to me you are very rude and unprofessional. She threatened to not let me on the flight. I asked why because your being rude I have never had such a poor experience at an airport. I paid the pet fee and thanked the gentleman for helping me. He was very professional. Once I went through security with my pet. The agent that tested my hands was rude and yelled at me because I set my dog down on the counter to prevent from dropping her as he asked for my other hand. Yelled at me to don't put the dog on the counter as if she had rabies. She is a 4lb yorkie. I said sorry please don't yell at me I'm trying not to drop my dog. He was very rough with swabbing my hand and dismissive. I rarely write reviews but I have to let Atlanta know you need to do better. Not coming back through anytime soon. I will also be making complaint to Delta regarding treatment of passengers with disabilities need extra time to preform request. Different airports have different requirements so more signage directions should be visible."
1st December 2021,1,"""No one was accountable""","✅ Trip Verified |  My Son and I had a 4 hour layover, found our gate and parked it right there. We spent much of the 4 hours chatting with the ""nice"" lady behind the counter and when it came close to the time we thought we should get a seat assignment to Charleston, she stated she needed to board a flight to PA and then she would get us our seat assignments. She boarded the first flight and then left. Another agent came up and we asked him if we could get the seat assignment and he stated that the gate changed 15 minutes prior. We ran to the gate (which was about 4 up from where we were) and they closed the doors and we ""missed"" the flight. We then needed to find another flight but I was hot. No one was accountable just repeatedly stating that we need to watch the monitors as it was our responsibility. Yes. I 100% agree if I hadn't been in almost constant communication with the lady who stated she would be the one to help. Everyone I talked to was rude and lacked any kind of empathy or accountability. If one more person stated that ""We change gates all the time, you need to watch the monitors"" I thought my head would explode. Whatever happened to common courtesy, or better yet, common sense? Why would I stare at a screen if the lady behind the desk stated she was the one to check us in? We lost an entire day of work and the expense was huge. Thank goodness for that free drink voucher."
18th November 2021,3,"""The lines were very very long""","✅ Trip Verified | What happened to this airport? I used to rave about this before, being one of my most favorites in the world. I travel extensively and I always prefer ATL as my port of entry. But I think after the bad experience I had today, I will be looking for another POE. The Immigration had a very long line. But I breezed through that line in less than 10 minutes. Luggage claim and rechecked no problem. After recheck, passengers were about to go through security when we were all redirected to the TSA line upstairs. This was where the mess all started. The lines were very very long, and were hardly moving. There were a few times when the lines just stopped. The smart move would have been to open more metal detectors to get the lines moving, instead the TSA officers were just standing around. They only had three conveyors/detectors opened. Why? This airport was so much better than this. Today was a major disappointment. As a result, I missed my connecting flight to Orlando. And vowed to never fly into this airport again if I could help it."
18th October 2021,8,"""Worst lost and found experience I ever had""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst lost and found experience I ever had, my phone tracker said the phone was in the lost and found and they are saying they cant find it. Also second lost and found but no way of contacting them or to go about reporting my item lost, I was just told to check the other one, why have two separate lost and founds in one airport with separate numbers and ways of reporting. They don't talk to each other and when you report it the site doesn't tell you which lost and found to contact."
10th October 2021,2,"""hope many others boycott the vendors""",✅ Trip Verified |  Most vendors no longer accept cash in this airport. Debit or credit card or no food or drink. How discriminating - some people including kids do not have a card. What happened to the dollar being legal tender? I will not buy anything in this airport! I hope many others boycott the vendors so they can go out of business.
8th October 2021,1,"""watched all aspects of the airport decline""","✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve traveled in and out of the ATL airport for the past 30 years and have watched all aspects of the airport decline. It appears that airport leadership is asleep on the job. Airport Parking is typically unavailable, construction seems to be never ending, flow of people inside & outside is mired in chaos, security is inept, food venues are sketchy and to top it all off - the unprofessional customer service attitudes reflects a growing personnel issue that seems to indicate poor training, poor work ethic, and a bizarre entitlement mentality. If you have a choice - find yourself a different airport - even if it means more connections. If leadership is actually reading my very modest review, pleaase turn this airport around and stop its death spiral."
29th September 2021,2,"""the rudest and most unprofessional agents I have ever encountered""",✅ Trip Verified | I have traveled to most every domestic airport in North America and Atlanta Hartsfield TSA employees are hands down the rudest and most unprofessional agents I have ever encountered unlike most other airports who are very professional and courteous.
27th September 2021,1,"""The TSA were completely and unnecessarily rude to my dad""","✅ Trip Verified | Currently holding a temporary residence here at Robins AFB, Georgia. My father drove my car down so that I would have transport to leave base, however, we wanted to fly him back home. I flew in to Atlanta and had just a few issues with my arrival into this airport so I figured it wouldn’t be awful if I booked a flight for my father to fly out of there. I cannot begin to describe how awful the experience was for my dad and I. The TSA were completely and unnecessarily rude to my dad who is easily confused and older, acted as if he had COVID or was diseased. The TSA agent literally looked as if she was about to draw a weapon on my dad because he was six feet away from her? Additionally the representative at the Delta check-in desk who is posted there to help guests pre-check for their tickets was also so awfully rude. Asked again, another simple question and she acted as if we were burden to ask her anything instead of just letting her stand there and ruin her uneventful day. Normally at my hometown airport, they usually let my dad come into the terminal with me to say goodbye as any day I could get orders to deploy and won’t have a chance to say goodbye before I go. But at this airport, I felt as though they were snatching him away from me and I was afraid he wasn’t going to make his flight because it is an extremely large airport and he is older and just overwhelmed easily. Thankfully and barely, he made it to his gate. He then told me that he was just extremely disappointed because the associates at the counter by the terminal were rude over the intercom every time they used it and just rude to other guests that went up to the counter. It made him so uncomfortable with the entire experience that he never wants to fly out of the airport again and would love it if I never did either. It made him so upset that he ended up crying part of his flight home. He’s concerned that somethings going to happen to me on deployment and he would’ve never gotten to have said goodbye. Simple things like this go a long way for paying customers. Having this experience, I think I will follow my dads advice and fly out from Savannah or another airport the next chance I actually get to fly home."
20th September 2021,8,"""be prepared for a long walk and a long wait/standing""","Not Verified |  Arrived Atlanta from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Be prepared for a long walk from the gate to Passport Control. The line to have your passport checked was long and took approximately 90 minutes. However, the line moved relatively fast considering there were at least 500 to 1,000 passengers waiting to be processed. I would say it was fairly well organized as they had people directing passengers to the booths. Not a bad experience. Just be prepared for a long walk and a long wait/standing. Here is my major complaint about this airport if you are arriving on an international flight. If your final destination is Atlanta and you wish to catch a ride share, MARTA or a hotel van, passengers are required to ride a small shuttle bus to Ground Transportation which takes 20 minutes. We had two heavy suitcases which had to be lifted into the bus. As we are over 65, it was difficult. Getting passengers from the international terminal to ground transportation in the main terminal is very inefficient and inconvenient."
17th September 2021,7,"""There were no shortages of shopping or eating options""",✅ Trip Verified | Transferred through ATL on 9/06/2021. This place is immense! There were no shortages of shopping or eating options. There were plenty of seats at the gates. The announcements were timely and clear. Lots of monitors around to check where your flight is departing from.The restrooms were reasonably clean. The train that runs between concourses is extremely handy as well. Can't comment on anything curbside as I was only transiting through.
13th September 2021,2,"""What are the people that run ATL thinking?""","Not Verified |  At about dinner time on a Sunday in Terminal C, about half of the eateries were closed! Trying to get something to eat just added more stress to an inherently stressful situation. What are the people that run ATL thinking? I guess they're thinking they have no competition, which is more-or-less true. I hate ATL."
6th September 2021,4,"""there is just no reason to blast the concourse with loud, undesirable sound""","✅ Trip Verified | For some reason, the airport has elected to play silly TV shows that no one is watching playing on a few screens at an incredibly loud level, like in a movie theater. Quiet is preferable and there is just no reason to blast the concourse with loud, undesirable sound that otherwise causes one to reach for earplugs or noise reduction headsets. Perhaps if the same loud obnoxious noise was pumped into the airport management offices there would be a change. There is no purpose to this noise pollution. Stop the insanity."
31st August 2021,2,"""Security was a nightmare""",Not Verified |  We were trying to evacuate Hurricane Ida. We had a group of 40 people. We were finally able to get a bus to take us to Atlanta. With the long traffic we were on the bus for 14 hours with no sleep. Arrived 4am to the airport. Security was a nightmare. Not because it was backed up but mostly because it was very confusing. Especially on 20 hours with no sleep. The woman at the security area where we were putting our things on the conveyor was literally screaming at me. I was confused and tired as she continued to scream and belittle me. Had she just explained calmly I would have understood what she was saying. Once I got through my feet were filthy with dirt and crud all over the floor. I had 3 elderly people in our group in wheelchairs. 2 of them were helped to the gate by employees. We still had one with us. Getting on the Tram was tricky. The Tram throws you around so badly that we were trying to hold the chair and ourselves. A lady had her baby trying to get her in a stroller. The baby didn't want in the stroller so she was trying to hold her and the stroller as it was rolling around. I grabbed the stroller as she tried to hold on to the baby. We found our gate around 6 am. There are many restaurants in the airport but none of them open. Once a Dunkin Donuts opened the line was all the way down the corridor.
29th August 2021,3,"""security checkpoint is dysfunctional""","Not Verified |  This airport has the most unhelpful, disrespectful TSA of any I have ever been to. The security checkpoint is dysfunctional compared to other airports. They have a lot of work to do for being one of the busiest airports in the nation. Traffic is always bad."
10th August 2021,2,"""this is one of the worst I’ve come across""","✅ Trip Verified | For a large airport, this is one of the worst I’ve come across. The gates are filthy, the information is lacking, and the online resources are lacking. We had a four hour layover so had plenty of time to find amenities, but had to search for a map or info. The one bright spot was a meal at One Flew South, a unique menu well prepared, but we barely got there before their kitchen closed at 6.30 pm. The public WiFi is pathetic. While writing this review, sitting in terminal D, I have had to reconnect a half-dozen times. And there are no visible charging stations. Another problem here is the attitude of public who are evidently, we were told, protesting having to wear masks in the airport. Can’t tell you how many people — including flight crew members — we saw walking the terminals with their masks under their noses or completely off. This may be something common in the area, but since mask wearing is a requirement of all airports — and other airports have signage about how to wear a mask — it would seem there is something Atlanta Hartsfield could make a better effort to keep their passengers safe. Clean it up, Atlanta!"
2nd August 2021,2,"""One of dirtiest Airports I have ever seen""",Not Verified |  One of dirtiest Airports I have ever seen. It looks like it's been weeks since the last time it was vacuumed. Restrooms are dirty. Dirty seats. The restaurant we ate in had torn seats. The Delta customer service we talked to looked annoyed that we were there. No charging stations in a lot of seats.
1st August 2021,3,"""TSA was chaotic""","Not Verified |  Flying back into the United States on Delta, I had 95 minutes to catch my connecting flight. US Customs ran efficiently, but TSA was chaotic. Needless to say, I missed my flight by 5 minutes."
26th July 2021,4,"""This airport is badly designed""","✅ Trip Verified | This is probably the worst airport I have been through. And I once worked at JFK with its many terminals. I had to transit through this airport from Costa Rica to catch a domestic flight to JFK NYC. There are no restrooms in the immediate area. The plane I came off had one aisle. And the flight attendants spent a good deal of time using the aisle to serve snacks. So it's not always convenient to use the restroom on the aircraft. Common sense you would think they would place restrooms near where the gate is where we got off the plane. Then it's not like you can just walk to the CBP area. We had to stand there for as much as 15 minutes and more at least twice before being allowed to proceed to the long line to present our passports. Walking from the gate to the CBP seems like 1/4 of a mile. There were hundreds of people on the line. There is a restroom in that area but with such a long line and a connecting flight less than two hours of my arrival I did not want to chance using it then getting on line. The saving grace was that the customs officer did not take long with my passport. He basically looked at my photo, asked me to remove my mask then asked me if I am who it says I am. Then I was on my way. It took over one hour to exit the CBP line. Someone took my luggage and put it on the belt to be sent to my JFK NYC flight. As soon as we walked out of that area we all had to go through security as if we had just walked off the street. I overheard one of the TSA agents telling someone that until you reach age 75 you have to remove your shoes. Well around where I live I see people who could barely get on the bus without the driver lowering the stairs. And many of these people are not even 50 years old. After going through security I checked the board but could not find my flight listed. I asked a lady at information desk. She told me I had to take the shuttle train on the right hand side one stop to area E. And go to E11. I went to E11. No such flight. I went to the Delta counter I saw when I came to area E. The lady told me I had to go to E 31 and the flight is about to leave so I had to hurry. I was the last person to get on the plane when I heard them say they were about to close the door. A gate agent came with me. She said there was no more room for my carry-on so I had to check it but not before I removed my laptop and camera which most likely would be stolen. My advice is avoid this airport if you're connecting from an international flight. Connecting domestic to international was not an issue when I was leaving. Unless you got four hours between international arrival and your departure connection don't risk it. And putting a restroom all the way in the customs area serves no purpose because most people need to use the restroom as soon as they exit the plane. This airport is badly designed. When I was leaving for Costa Rica I arrived after 8 am on a weekday morning and none of the restaurants were open. Not even a place to serve coffee. It's as if the airport was designed for the convenience of airport staff and not its passengers!"
16th July 2021,1,"""no places to eat""",✅ Trip Verified | Flight was delayed an 1-1/2 hrs. That wasn’t too bad of an issue. The issue was no places to eat. The few places that were open had line 30-40 people deep. At 10.40 am there was a place that made breakfast wraps but they weren’t open until 11.00 am?? But yet there was a pizza place that was open. Makes no sense. Literally in the concourse we were in there were only 4 out of 15 restaurants open and ready to serve at 10:40. The food service options are not worth a hoot.
13th July 2021,1,"""Bathrooms were awful!""",Not Verified |  Nasty airport. Everything closed. Arrived in at 1 am and nothing open and even vending machines empty. Bathrooms were awful! Waiting areas were nasty. No places to eat open but a few and 50 deep in line. Worse airport ever! Workers for Delta were nice but told us wrong information .
1st July 2021,1,"""I don't think it could be any worse""","✅ Trip Verified |  I don't think it could be any worse. Restrooms were disgusting (every stall was unflushed/dirty), 1/3 of the restaurants/snack providers closed, long lines to get into the ones that are open, 10 deep line to check out at a magazine/candy store, wifi doesn't work at all, NONE of the plugs at the seats work, about 1/2 of the ones on the walls work and the tram to get to/from the main area was so crowded you couldn't breathe. I got off ASAP and walked from C to baggage. I fly regularly for work. This is the worst I have experienced. It has not always been this bad."
10th June 2021,1,"""never fly out of this airport again""","Not Verified |  My husband and I are both senior citizens, My husband is significantly disabled and was in a wheel chair, unable to stand without help. We have only flown about 2 times in the last 10 years. The TSA agents just kept yelling at us. I asked them what to do and they just kept screaming the same things over and over, then stated ""its been this way for 90 years, whats wrong with you"" I was not familiar with removing my ipad from the case, they just stood there and screamed. They wouldnt let anyone help my husband stand up they just kept screaming at us. I have never been treated so badly, the TSA agents were like a wild band of gangsters. I will never fly out of this  airport again."
10th June 2021,1,"""Atlanta Airport is a mess""","✅ Trip Verified |  There are signs everywhere “we are open”. Three weeks ago there were NO restaurants OIE. On terminal F on departure. On return today there were no restaurants except Burger King open in the terminal so I did t have anything to eat waiting on shuttle to Athens z, Ga. also, I arrived in International. Immigration and customs took 2 minutes. Luggage more Than 45. Waiting for the shuttle to the domestic terminal made me miss shuttle to Athens. And there were 45 people waiting for about 20 seats. I have no idea what the others did. They were told a shuttle would come again in a half hour. The Atlanta Airport is a mess. All international airports I went through on my travel were operational and efficient. Atlanta airport sucks. Maybe it should be taken over by the state. Avoid it if you can."
7th June 2021,1,"""No one wants to help""","Not Verified |  Worst airport on the planet. Terrible to try to figure out where you are going. No one wants to help. Not ready for the volume. Bad planning, bad staff. Restaurants closed while people stand in line for hours. Tell the mayor of ATL to call Fl if she has any questions about how to reopen."
7th June 2021,1,"""not at all equipped to handle volume""","Not Verified |  Airport not at all equipped to handle volume. Absurd lines at all [open] restaurants, not enough seating at terminals, overall a total failure. Embarrassing."
6th June 2021,1,"""food places everywhere and every single one is closed""",Not Verified |  This airport is a joke. There are food places everywhere and every single one is closed. Get your act together! All of your restaurants close between 5 and 6pm. Do you people not eat dinner here?
21st May 2021,2,"""there are 8 restaurants in the food court and only 1 is open""","✅ Trip Verified | I travel through this airport a minimum of 4-times a month. On my return trips I typically arrive around 6.30 to 6.45 pm. Almost all restaurants are closed. It's the strangest thing. This is not an occasional situation. It's every evening visit. Who is managing this airport? Why is this the case? After talking to employees at the information center, I've found out the restaurants close at 4:00 +/-. Now there's a couple of the larger restaurants open like TGI Fridays open, but most people w/ connectors don't have that much time. Currently, I'm in E terminal and there are 8 restaurants in the food court and only 1 is open [McDonald's]. Now there like a 100 people in line so that's not an option. All but (2) of the he convenience stores are closed and those have huge lines. The restaurant services should be for the peoples convenience and not the restaurant's convenience. Why hasn't the management observed this and made adjustments? I don't think they should stay open all night, but this is a little ridiculous. I'm sure they will blame this on COVID, but this has been going on long before COVID (I've been traveling through here for years). My guess it has a little to do with the controlling power of the political power of the mayor and her cronies."
9th May 2021,1,"""TSA is an absolute joke""",Not Verified |  Arrived at the airport more than 2 hours early and the flight had to be held so my wife and I could sprint through the airport to make out flight. This is because TSA is an absolute joke. It took more than 2 hours to get through the line with is absolutely unacceptable. I have flown into countless airports domestically and internationally and never had such an awful experience. I absolutely will never fly into or out of this airport again and I strongly suggest that no one else does either. I will gladly pay more money to fly in and out of a smaller airport. Atlanta’s international airport’s TSA division needs a total overhaul if they ever want to give individuals a positive flying experience.
9th May 2021,3,"""the most unorganized airport I’ve ever been to""","Not Verified |  This is the most unorganized airport I’ve ever been to. They had us going every which way, but the right way. It all started getting off an international flight where we had to walk half way across the airport. Then after going through the gauntlet of passport control then I stepped in a room of mass hysteria to get my luggage, then drop it off. Then I was directed to go upstairs to check in for my connecting flight, only to be told they don’t have TSA precheck. After going through the security check then I had to go back downstairs to catch a train to go to my terminal which was filthy. The only light to this was the handsome CBP security officer who stopped to check my passport. He was the highlight of me coming back from Puerto Vallarta! This airport needs to do better. It was a complete disaster!"
2nd May 2021,2,"""TSA security/staff are extremely rude and unprofessional""","Not Verified |  The TSA security/staff are extremely rude and unprofessional. Need better training or need to find a new place of employment. We are already viewed as ride and ghetto, very embarrassing."
10th April 2021,2,"""it is appalling""","Not Verified |  This airport wins the prize for the world's most expensive yet disgusting airport food and the unfriendliest food court staff. It was my first ever transit/visit via US, so I cannot compare to other US cities. However, having traveled a lot for over 20 years, it is appalling. There is hardly anything to eat, other than McDonald's at Terminal D, so I had to go to Terminal A. Well, the prices are mad, you pay 5.99+tax for a cup of coffee and 10.99+tax for a chicken salad. I asked them for any oil or sour cream or anything for my salad but they only have mayonnaise or mustard or ranch sauce. They DO NOT understand the concept of food allergies. If you have any kind of allergy or intolerance, do not go to this airport. Other notes - very crowded and noisy, you cannot get anywhere to rest quietly. I am giving it 2 rather than 1 because it's relatively clean. Avoid at any length of you can!"
9th April 2021,2,"""It is not okay to bark at people in a disrespectful manner""","Not Verified |  The TSA agents in the North Terminal are beyond rude and need to be trained to deal with the public more appropriately. For some reason, they use their jobs as an excuse to abuse any power they think they may have and make you feel like an idiot. It is not okay to bark at people in a disrespectful manner. The screener at The North Terminal that just stands there and motions for you to go in yelled at me for putting my boarding pass in my back pocket (which I have done 100% of the time on my many travels with not one issue). If this is a problem for him, he needs to learn to ask nicely, I am not below him in any capacity and will not be treated this way. Atlanta: Get your employees in line!"
29th March 2021,4,"""How very unprofessional!""","Not Verified |  The maintenance woman decided it would be best to blow the pollen from the street where people were standing waiting for the international shuttle! One lady was on the curb and got a whole yellow cloud to the face, and the little girl working at the shuttle post was doused in pollen and debris from the road! Everything on the sidewalk was covered in pollen and leaves, etc.. and the girl working there had to go get the lady and ask her to reblow it all back off of the sidewalk! She then had to rewipe everything at her station. How very unprofessional! Can this not be a task that's completed earlier in the morning when less people are on the curbs?"
28th March 2021,2,"""Looks like ATL is working on being the new LaGuardia""","Not Verified |  Looks like ATL is working on being the new LaGuardia. I counted two outlets that worked in D terminal for everyone to charge their phones. They have removed all books from the gift shops that are open. Food vendors that are open were rude. Bathrooms were dirty even when there was an attendant in them. Areas felt like the AC wasn’t working. While they have blocked seats in the hold areas, it’s just resulted in loads of people standing in the isle. ATL was always “decent” to fly through. But the decent apparently doesn’t apply during a pandemic."
21st March 2021,2,"""TSA at Hartsfield Jackson Airport is as rude as ever""","Not Verified |  Haven’t traveled in a year, but TSA at Hartsfield Jackson Airport is as rude as ever. They treat you like you are a complete idiot who is deliberately annoying them. They make up the rules as they go along, and shout out orders to befuddled travelers. If you fail to understand their mumbling, or the process known only to them, they treat you like a criminal. I have TSA pre-clearance, but conveniently they had shut down the TSA Line and wordlessly passed me a card. I was supposed to have held onto it until I went through the scanner myself. What would be so hard about posting the process on a whiteboard for all of us to read. By the way, my job is training workers at large corporations. If you tell people what you want them to do, they will do it."
18th March 2021,4,"""Extremely limited spots to recharge electronics""","✅ Trip Verified | Extremely limited spots to recharge electronics. Worse - many seat sections 'look' like they have outlets under the seats to recharge - but then the power to the seats is not on! Literally - all through the length of Terminal D there are dozens of pre-fab seats, and the cord that would normally attach to a wall outlet is just sitting there, unattached, lying on the floor. So - the many outlets placed under the seats are rendered useless. C’mon Atlanta. We travelers don’t ask for much. A couple of food options, a place to sit, and a place to recharge our phones. It’s how we use our time - by doing work on our laptops, staying in touch with loved ones as we travel, and entertaining ourselves with what for many is a few moments to ourselves. We even bring our own equipment - we just need access to outlets. I think we pay a tax to travel through - right? Please fix this big oversight. (Shout out to the sections between terminals, if one chooses to walk. Beautiful and informative displays! But - hard to remember when I couldn’t charge my phone)."
10th February 2021,3,"""This behavior is unprofessional""","Not Verified |  Airport employees have absolutely no respect for travelers. They sit in the gate areas with their cell phones on loud volume playing inappropriate music and videos as if the travelers are not customers. I sat and watched an employee approach Gate D3 where there were restless travelers who looked to be exhausted. The employee sat directly behind them and commenced on playing loud videos that included abrasive language and music. I was totally shocked! Shortly thereafter, another employee with a ABM uniform (Who had just finished cleaning the DS4-2-E1) Women's Bathroom who worked for housekeeping found her way over with a bag of chips and a sprite to have a lengthy conversation on her cellphone on loud speaker. After she got off the phone she had the audacity to burp out loud! Disgusting! Low and behold as I look up and ahead there is another employee with a PrimeFlight uniform on pushing a empty wheelchair eating yet another bag of snacks! All of this activity took place between 9am and 10am. This behavior is unprofessional. No wonder people look at us as ignorant unprofessional selfish individuals. I am sometimes ashamed of my own people."
10th February 2021,1,"""can you all really afford to allow this behavior?""","Not Verified |  I travel for business through Atlanta fairly frequently. I traveled today and in perfect ATL form I had the absolute misfortune of dealing with the rudest person at the security check point. I’d like to tell you this is the first time, but it’s not. Why are these airport workers so disgustingly rude? Why is everyone ok with this? There are plenty of other busy airports that have respectful employees. When travel has declined so much due to COVID can you all really afford to allow this behavior? These employees take advantage of travelers just because! I’m sure this review, like the others, will fall on deaf ears, just look at all your current reviews-shameful!"
2nd February 2021,2,"""approached for money whenever we pass through""",Not Verified |  The number of homeless persons in the airport terminals are growing each time I travel through this airport. My wife and I are approached for money whenever we pass through. I am wondering if this is part of the customer experience that the airport strives to achieve.
6th January 2021,6,"""could save a lot of money by ditching the monitors""","Not Verified |  I detest CNN, sadly one has no choice but to be bombarded by this former news channel turned propaganda outlet. Being stuck in ATL for for hours provides an unpleasant reminder of why I abandoned the main stream media. ATL could save a lot of money by ditching the monitors, and letting the passengers interact with the smart phones we brought with us in peace."
15th December 2020,2,"""It took 20 minutes to be in line""",Not Verified |  Terminal E at 9 am only had Caribou Coffee open in the food court with minimal people working. It took 20 minutes to be in line to get waited on. What's up with that?
14th December 2020,2,"""They need motivation and structure""","Not Verified |  Worst customer service experience ever. Employees were hateful, rude, no patience, and not the least bit helpful. They need motivation and structure. Everyone of them looked like they hated their job."
9th December 2020,1,"""Terrible airport to say the least""","Not Verified |  I travel often on business and was horrified at the behavior of TSA at the security checkpoint today. I left food in my suitcase in error and what they put me through was horrible. The screaming in your face during Covid, lack of social distancing at all. The women TSA agents were the worst. The level they got to in their voices and body movements was terrifying and abusive. Terrible airport to say the least. The TSA needs to be investigated for abuse of power."
8th November 2020,1,"""no one is policing the masks requirements!""","Not Verified |  Atlanta needs people to feel safe and fly to bring revenue to the city and airport. We will not be flying because no one is policing the masks requirements! Airlines can only police in their aircrafts. I saw several w/o masks in the train and many more at the boarding gate. They would sit with their backs to the gate agents (who do not have any power, except on their planes)! I saw many of the gate cargo workers from DGS at the food court, with no masks sitting talking on their phones. The Chiropractor on concourse A didn't even have a mask on and when I asked her where was her mask, she cut me a look! So many people, if they had a mask, had it below their nose. Atlanta Hartsfield has failed again. We will not be flying any more. A sign on the entrance door requiring a mask is not working."
17th October 2020,1,"""unprofessional and down right rude behaviors and attitudes""","✅ Trip Verified | It is unfortunate that people have to experience unprofessional and down right rude behaviors and attitudes when purchasing products. My husband and I decided to grab lunch from Subway in terminal T today while waiting for our plane to board. The two ladies working behind the counter (both making our sandwiches as well as the cashier) were unbelievably rude. We could have purchased our lunches from another establishment, but decided on Subway. These ladies weren’t doing us any favors, they acted as if we were bothering them. Excuse me! Never again will I purchase anything from this establishment while traveling through the Atlanta airport. In addition, almost all the employees at this airport are rude! If you do not like your job then quit! Nobody is paying for my travels nor is it free. At the very least, be courteous. If we weren’t traveling you wouldn’t even have the option to have your job. All flights staff have been kind and courteous, if only the employees in the airport would follow their lead."
8th September 2020,10,"""this place is immaculate""","✅ Trip Verified | I am so proud of Atlanta Hartsfield! I don’t know if it’s the entire airport or just the Delta Terminal but this place is immaculate! The ladies room was super bright, clean and totally automated! My processing through check-in was seamless! So proud to say this is my hometown airport! Great job!"
20th August 2020,1,"""Rudest employees I’ve ever encountered""",✅ Trip Verified | Rudest employees I’ve ever encountered! This was less than 30 min here. I will never visit this airport again. Judging by the reviews this happens to be their norm!
10th June 2020,1,"""Queuing is awful with unfriendly staff""",Not Verified |  I was exchanging here. Queuing is awful with unfriendly staff. Delta is good but not their hub. I am never going again and you shouldn't.
6th April 2020,1,"""Extremely rude and unhelpful workers""","Not Verified |  Extremely rude and unhelpful workers. My parents speak limited English, however written instructions as well as verbal information was given but everyone they came in contact with in reference to getting from the international terminal to domestic were rude. They actually came on a repatriation Flight due to a lockdown in India because of covid-19 through the US government and this airport was the only place it ended from Mumbai. I was hoping to avoid this airport for them but due to the circumstances I couldn’t. Sadly, even our beloved Southwest Airlines counter agent who was checking them into their Chicago flight was not nice to them. My exhausted parents eventually made it to Chicago but unfortunately I was compelled to write an honest review of their experience. I hope that during training or pep talks everyone is reminded that kindness doesn’t cost anything. Hopefully if we learn anything from this pandemic it’ll be compassion."
6th March 2020,3,"""never seen the line as long""","Not Verified | I’ve been TSA precheck for near a decade and Clear precheck over 2 years and I have never seen the line as long as it is today. First, it started just before South terminal baggage claim by doors S3, winds along the right side of the hall to the south terminal then crosses the hall and winds back up the left side to the entry door of Clear. Then the shared hall with regular TSA Lines. Looks like at least one of the Clear machines is broken. But the TSA lines and regular Clear lines look to be as long or longer. What gives? I almost wonder if general boarding is shorter. It took us over 35 minutes and the line is much much longer now than it was 30 minutes ago."
9th February 2020,1,"""will never fly through ATL""","Not Verified | This is the reason why I am cutting out traveling by punishing me to traverse the entire airport to the entrance to have a cigarette or a vape hit. Making me now have to leave security. It is my right to have a place too. The non-smokers and health conscience individuals I am by no means stating you have to be around my smoke just like I don't want to drink your juice or eat your vegetable burger. I, as a conscientious smoker, try to remember that everyone has a right but now you are removing my right as an American to enjoy what I enjoy. I will never fly through ATL and will advise any other smokers to avoid it like the plague since we don't matter either now. I would give this airport a minus number but they are biased against that as well."
28th January 2020,1,"""The worst TSA ever!""",✅ Trip Verified |  The worst TSA ever! Waited 45 minutes to clear security despite TSA pre and Clear. The website wait times are never updated and routinely state wait times that are 30 minutes shorter than reality. I travel across the world and am diamond with Delta. ATL has the longest wait times in security in the USA.
25th January 2020,1,"""I’ll never transit through the US again""","Not Verified |  I have never stood in such a long security line in my life in all countries I have been to, including many third world ones. Only two lines for non us citizens on a busy Saturday afternoon. I’ll never transit through the US again!"
25th January 2020,1,"""smoking rooms are gone""",✅ Trip Verified | Was very disappointed to find out the smoking rooms are gone! That was the entire reason I always chose this airport! I will not do so anymore! What is the point of removing the smoking rooms? It’s not going to help or make anyone quit smoking - it’s only going to increase the number of angry passengers. Before at least you could chill out with a smoke before your flight and/or get a smoke in between flights - helped with the mental stress of flying! Not having that break in between made my travel day horrible! And the rooms were not bothering non-smoking people nor polluting the air around them - non-smokers never had to go anywhere in those rooms if they didn’t want to so that would not be a good reason to remove them either! I really don’t understand it. I won’t be returning to Atlanta airport.
22nd January 2020,1,"""airport is a nightmare""","Not Verified |  Can I give this place a zero? Honestly this airport is a nightmare. We had a 5 hour layover, which is approximately 5 and half hours longer than I would like in hindsight. The rudeness of everyone who works here is unreal. Being my first time in Atlanta, and the South being renowned for genteel manners and politeness I put on my best manners and did my very best not to be just another horrid Yankee. Workers were rude to me, my wife, my 9 year old ... I think they would've verbally abused my luggage if I wasn't in transit."
18th January 2020,1,"""Every experience at this airport is miserable""","Not Verified |    I travel about once a month. Most of my destinations are flying through Atlanta airport. Every single time I've encountered the most extreme rude behavior from staff at this airport. Delta customer service in Atlanta - horribly rude. Fast food workers on the tram - rude, discussing buying guns at obnoxious loudness, laying feet up so disabled and elderly can't sit down, etc.. This time I was in Savannah's candy kitchen and a girl came out from the back room and ran directly into me because apparently I was in her way of trying to leave work. I was standing in line trying to buy something. Every experience at this airport is miserable. I'll take the longer way next time."
17th January 2020,2,"""airport outgrew itself a while ago""","✅ Trip Verified | That airport outgrew itself a while ago and it is a mess. I sometime feel less cramped at New York Grand Central at Peak hours. Among the worst is going through security! There was a failed attempt to innovate screening with the worst luggage pre-scan staging invented by a 3-year old that obviously did not have any idea what he was doing. Then there is the useless Clear which ends up being slower than regular TSA-Pre most of the time. Finally there is that weird attempt to reduce TSA-Pre load by randomly picking people in the line to give them a privileged queue which is annoying everybody else that will be left in there for another 10 or 15 mins. After Security there is really nothing to make you forget the bad start, it is an average or bad experience at best, specifically if you want to sit quietly and even worse if you think about working."
7th January 2020,10,"""got treated very well""","Not Verified |  Very sorry to read other people had a bad time. I am a wheelchair user, and got treated very well going through Atlanta. There was a priority line at passport control for disabled people. People at security were polite and considerate. The young man assigned to push my wheelchair was lovely. Food was mostly good. Concourse D had a good selection. I had a horrible experience at Dulles (Washington, DC) spring 2019, and found Atlanta to be just the opposite."
6th January 2020,1,"""staff were rude and unhelpful""","✅ Trip Verified | The queue for immigration at this airport is ridiculous, over 2 and a half hours, staff were rude and unhelpful, we told 3 airport staff we had a connecting flight but we were told to just 'wait in line' they deliberately let us miss our connecting flights, they didn’t care they were not interested at all. Other passengers were letting us go in front of them but we had no chance, it was impossible. All they had to do was let us go to the front of the line, what was even more frustrating was we had to catch a cruise ship the next day. Immigration say sort it out with your airline, absolutely disgusting I would avoid this airport never have I come across so bad manners. No customer Service at all."
2nd January 2020,2,"""doesn't give a very good impression""","Not Verified | Passed through Atlanta each way on a 12-day trip to Belize. On each occasion, the immigration queues were well over 1 hour, and on the return trip after 1hr 20 mins, I had to ask people if I could jump the queue as I was in danger of missing my connecting flight to the UK. At least half the booths were unused. Asked a member of staff if she could help but she just said: ""you'll just have to wait in line"". I thanked her for her help. Perhaps they weren't expecting a large number of people arriving all at once? Is this an example of American efficiency? It doesn't give a very good impression to anyone travelling through!"
26th December 2019,2,"""it is worse than they say""",Not Verified |  Everything said is true except it is worse than they say. And now no Mobile Passport Control. Although it was horrible when they did have it. Rudest customer service and TSA people in any airport I have been to. And I go thru ATL slot. Always bad. This gives a really bad image for Atlanta.
19th December 2019,1,"""lines were extremely long""",✅ Trip Verified |  The lines were extremely long. The TSA staff did not communicate well with others. They were extremely rude.
3rd December 2019,1,"""Long lines. Rude TSA""","✅ Trip Verified | Long lines. Rude TSA and Clear Personnel. Too loud, shouting on a Monday morning. The lines for TSA was too long. Almost missed my flight. Can't they be more polite"
2nd December 2019,4,"""Workers are more than rude""","✅ Trip Verified | Workers in this airport are more than rude. When trying to find TSA Precheck, representatives refused to answer a question and over talked me not allowing me to show them I was TSA precheck therefore not needing general boarding. I don’t understand what has happened to customer service in Atlanta Airport. Please check your workers. If they would get off their phones and stop having personal conversations with each other and smile and assist customers it would make all the difference."
28th November 2019,1,"""short, rude and condescending""","✅ Trip Verified | I found upon arrival as I went through security, TSA workers were short, rude and condescending. They seem to dislike the job and made you feel as though you are bothering them. Very different at Chicago airport."
27th November 2019,1,"""a huge queue and very few staff on duty""","✅ Trip Verified | We had to connect through Atlanta on a flight from London Heathrow to Orlando. We had enough time for the connection and as the plane landed slightly early there should have been no problem. When we got to Passport and Immigration control there was a huge queue and very few staff on duty. We waited well over an hour in this line before we were allowed to go through. Then to our horror we found that we had to go through security again even though we had been through security at Heathrow and had not left the airport. Going through the channel for connecting flights should have made things easier but the staff seemed to not be aware or didn’t care that people had other flights to get to. The security channel was chaos - there was no proper line, it was totally disorganised and the staff were surly and unhelpful. Lots of people were in danger of missing their flights but they just didn’t care! They seemed to take pleasure in working as slowly as they could. We had to run to our departure gate but it had been closed and even though it hadn’t left we couldn’t board. We weren’t the only people to miss that flight and we met lots of people who had also missed their connections because of this incompetence. As we couldn’t get another flight till the next day we had to pay for overnight accommodation. I would never travel through this dreadful airport again."
19th November 2019,1,"""Never been treated so badly in my life""","Not Verified |  Never been treated so badly in my life. The employees at ATL airport especially TSA are so rude and disrespectful and need to be retrained in customer service and social skills. The reps are calling people stupid and actually using that term. After literally being screamed at I had to interject when a rep screamed at my daughter. I refuse to allow anyone to disrespect me and my family, this is the second time I had to fly out of this airport and will be the last. She and her colleagues upset me so much, I believe they use their positions to be very controlling. It was a total embarrassment but I’m not a child and will not be treated like one. After going off on the TSA rep telling her she don’t have to talk to people in that way She advised me “if I didn’t like the way it was, to go elsewhere, and let her move before she got snappy”. I wish I would have gotten all their names."
29th October 2019,5,"""No luggage storage lockers""","Not Verified |  No luggage storage lockers in the world’s busiest airport! Hard to believe, but it’s true! If you have a long layover and don’t want to carry around any luggage, you will have to at this airport!"
21st October 2019,2,"""Not disabled friendly""",✅ Trip Verified |  Not disabled friendly. I am deaf. Train doesn't announce when leaving or opening doors for the deaf. No lights to know when to get off or get on. Deaf lives matter
1st October 2019,1,"""Terrible airport""","✅ Trip Verified | It’s bad enough that the paying customers have to go through the extra trouble of rechecking in our luggage’s during international connecting flights, but no explanations are given, and the airport does not explain or apologize why it takes them so long (this time, it was about an hour!!) just to get the carousel going with the luggage! What happens if someone misses their connecting flight? Will they just say “too bad?”. Terrible airport — moving forward, we will make sure never to have a connecting stop here!"
23rd September 2019,2,"""work on their customer service""","Not Verified |  I understand that you may scroll pass this review and not even care, but with all due respect, I feel that all employees should have a friendly, inviting, professional personality and I feel that Atlanta's Airport lacked this. After my mom and I got off our flight, we proceeded to the exit and asked the gentleman if he could help give us directions to the gate of our next flight. He looked up and I quote, ""Look at the T.V. screen. I don't know about that."" I don't know if he was just being lazy or if he really did know his job. Anyway, I walk away and overhear some of the other passengers talking about the same flight so I followed them. Still doubting myself, I ask three other Atlanta Airport employees and they all said the same thing; that they had no clue to that too. At last, I finally had enough of the same answer; knowing that my boarding time was closing in, I asked a pilot if he could help me for a second and he did. I feel terrible that I didn't even catch his name, but I am so thankful that he was able to spare a second to help. Again, I hope that Atlanta's Airport works on their customer service."
17th September 2019,1,"""First time I have missed a flight in over 30 years""",Not Verified |  Mind-boggling how poorly managed this airport is. A recurring problem is understaffing at TSA lanes when the airport admin clearly knows how many passengers will be traveling at any given time. Today TSA decided to run a canine check in the middle of the busiest Monday morning rush hour leading to lines way down the hall and shutting down all priority lanes. First time I have missed a flight in over 30 years and I travel weekly. I explained to airport staff directing people that my flight wears boarding as time passed. Nothing they could do. Except they would take others randomly who were rushing and brought them to the front of the line. Big disruption in one day emergency trip.
22nd August 2019,2,"""airport is not in a hurry to do anything""","Not Verified |  Slow, slow, slow. This airport is not in a hurry to do anything especially immigration and baggage. Get a grip or discover quite quickly that it’s better to connect elsewhere. Get a separate crew line and special assistance line."
21st August 2019,1,"""the worst airport experience I’ve ever had""","Not Verified |  Awful. We had a late flight, and were in the airport starting at 11pm. Staff members all over the airport - in the terminals, the shuttle, the gates, were all cursing and obnoxious. At 2am, a guy at gate D2 was opening one of the stores, and blasting hip hop music. This is at a gate where our flights had been delayed by hours on end, everyone is cranky and sleepy, and this dude blasting music without a care in the world. This is the worst airport experience I’ve ever had in all my years."
11th August 2019,1,"""Every single person working there was very rude""","✅ Trip Verified | Returning from Rome was a nightmare. Every single person working there was very rude. Even the airport police. I have never been treated so bad in my life. The officer literally screamed at me for not hearing him. I am a senior with a hearing disability and I am not a criminal. I also do not appreciate to be yelled at. He upset me so much. They made us late and we missed our flight out. They have zero social skills. They need to be retrained. I believe they use their positions to be very controlling. I will never fly through that airport again. First time I ever have and will never return. All the staff were rude, but this officer about had me in tears. It was a total embarrassment and I’m not a child, and will not be treated like one. The money exchange lady, had no name tag and she was also very rude. She told me if I didn’t like the way it was, to go elsewhere. All I did was clarify a question. I wouldnt doubt she ripped me off. Horrible people there. I will spread the word around my neck of the woods to ‘Don’t travel through Atlanta’ if at all possible. The bathrooms were least desirable as well."
16th July 2019,2,"""staff in Atlanta airport are rude""","✅ Trip Verified |  Delta seating was spacious and clean, onboard staff were friendly and attentive, complimentary snacks and beverages, and the flight was on time.  I paid $1057 for myself and 2 kids to fly one way for a total duration of 1.5 hrs. This airline promised free WiFi but the WiFi doesn’t work. The ground agents/staff working in the Atlanta airport are rude. When checking my bag in, the rep looked at me as if I was bothering her. She never greeted me with hello or a smile. I was clearly confused as the Atlanta airport is 5x the size of my hometown airport and even said out loud, “I don’t know where to go”. She just ignored me and looked away. I eventually figured it out but it would’ve been extremely helpful if she just pointed or simply said that way. I’m sorry but if I’m paying Delta over 1k to fly I’d at least like to receive decent customer service. I think Delta should invest in customer service training. This was my first experience flying with Delta and my last."
3rd July 2019,6,"""Poor choices and poor service""",✅ Trip Verified | I’m in Terminal D at Atlanta Airport a few times a month. The choices for sit down restaurants are terrible. It’s best to pick a restaurant in a different terminal. Poor choices and poor service. I usually resort to 5 Guys.
26th June 2019,1,"""Is this a conspiracy by the vendors""",Not Verified |  Is it too much to ask to have a working drinking water fountain. I was in terminal D and went to 4 different drinking fountains and none of them worked. Is this a conspiracy by the vendors so that you have to buy water? Really ridiculous.
24th June 2019,1,"""employees are incompetent""","✅ Trip Verified | 9 of us were supposed to fly out of the Hartfield Jackson airport to go to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic for a family vacation. We were supposed to travel by Swift Air, a small charter company. Atlanta Airport is huge and all of us were at the airport international terminal 3.5 hours before our flight. We have looked around for Swift Air signs but did not see any, so we asked 3 different airport customer service representatives, showed them our travel documents, and all of them told us that we have to go to the Domestic terminal, even though it was an international flight. We also stopped by the information desk at the international terminal, showed our paperwork, the customer service representative checked something on her computer and also advised us to go to the domestic terminal. It takes at least 20 min to get to the Domestic terminal plus the waiting time for the shuttle. Once we got there and run around through the whole terminal, asked several staff members, who had no idea where Swift Air was, we finally got to one of the TSA members who used his radio to find out that Swift is at the International terminal. After we spend $50 on the taxi for 20 min drive, since we were running out of time, we got back to where we started. We ran through the whole terminal and finally found Swift Air counters all the way in the back of the terminal with no signs in the whole airport to guide people where to go, except for the signs on top of the counter. Also, all of the international terminal staff members had no clue where Swift Air counters were! We got to the counter 45 minutes before the flight, but we were denied boarding, as well as another family of 5, who went through the same ordeal. I do not understand why airport employees are incompetent and not knowledgeable. No one knows which airline is located at what terminal. Due to all of this, we had to purchase new tickets from Birmingham, AL with a connection back in Atlanta, for the next morning. We had to rent 2 cars, drive 3 hours to AL, fly back to Atlanta to finally board to Punta Cana, all due to the incompetency of staff working at the airport. I always thought that one of the largest international airports in the US would have exceptional customer service, but I was so wrong."
23rd June 2019,1,"""behavior was unacceptable""","Not Verified | I fly through ATL several times a week. Today I had a few hours between my connecting flights so I stopped through the E concourse food court area to grab a bite. I purchased food from Nature’s Table Bistro. I sat down, ate, made some calls and about an hour later, I started to make my way over to my next gate. I had quite a bit of food still left on my plate since I got full very fast; but don’t like traveling with unnecessary baggage. When I went to throw away my plate, a man was changing out the trash bags. When I handed him my plate, he opened the lid and very rudely told me how wasteful I was and that I shouldn’t be throwing away fresh food. When I walked away, I could hear him talking about me to his coworker and he continued to shake his head at me. I was irritated because I purchased the food with my own money and I’m not obligated to defend the amount that I choose not to eat. Every time I fly through ATL, I prepare myself for this kind of treatment because it happens more often than not. I only wish there was someone I could talk to directly about him. His behavior was unacceptable."
20th June 2019,1,"""This is the pits""",Not Verified |  Just awful. I travel for my work and use international airports almost weekly. This is the pits. The check in (admittedly not the airports fault) took over half an hour at the front of the line to check in for business class. Someone checking in 16 bags in the first class line but not flying first or business. Then endless queues for passport checks and photos and an inordinately long wait for luggage checks with queues snaking round the block and just two screeners. Took over an hour to go from check in to the departure lounge. No one smiled or apologised. Then the lounge was like a zoo. Nowhere to sit and sandwiches with the bread curled up and hard. I had asked for help with lifting my bags even through I’m only three weeks post op with a large bandage and dressing on my neck. I would do my best to avoid in future.
20th June 2019,3,"""cleaning crew had all the men restrooms blocked off""","Not Verified |  My family and I took a Delta flight from LAX Los Angeles arriving at 12.05 am, June 15 at Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson airport. We departed the plane, entered the airport and the janitorial cleaning crew had all the men restrooms blocked off as if they were cleaning them, but what's strange is they were standing in front of the ropes off area preventing entrance or use of the restroom. It's sad that you cant use the restroom in the airport."
14th May 2019,2,"""The layout is just crazy""
","✅ Trip Verified | I was unfortunate enough to have to attend a meeting in Atlanta, unfortunate not because of Atlanta but because I had to pass through this airport. The layout is just crazy with incredibly long terminals so be sure to where your walking shoes. TSA is a nightmare as all passengers for all airlines pass through a central checkpoint which is so incredibly slow, the slowest service I have ever encountered (including Orlando which at least spilts to two terminal wings) and I’ve been through a number of airports. Even the TSA Pre line had about a half hour plus wait. The airport itself looks old although clean and seems to lack some of the new tech like charging stations for devices that you would expect to find in this day and age. I flew JetBlue out of JFK for this trip and what a difference between JetBlues own terminal 5 and this hole in the wall. If you can avoid passing through this airport I highly recommend it as many of the people don’t really seem to care about the travelers passing through and if you have a connecting flight that’s either at a distant gate or concourse you may miss your flight as they are so far away. There are no terminal shuttle carts like you would find in other big airports like Dallas or Raleigh Durham."
12th May 2019,3,"""extremely congested""
","Not Verified |  The condition of the property seemed to be OK, could have definitely been cleaner. Concourses also seemed ""closed in"", especially when compared to other major airports. The day/time I traveled through, extremely congested, difficult to get where I needed to go. Finally, couldn't help notice they had cnn on the TV's - disappointing."
9th May 2019,2,"""not friendly or helpful""","Not Verified |  Horrible service, not friendly or helpful. Horrible TSA service, special service line was the slowest and no help on directions or why the main lines were moving faster and we stood forever."
4th May 2019,4,"""meet mass confusion""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airport that I have ever been to. Considering that I have traveled to over 50 countries and all over the United States, that says a lot. I have been in and out of Atlanta at least 10 times in the last six months. I have TSA Pre and Clear and still I meet mass confusion when I’m checking in. This airport is a busy airport for business people, so there are lots of early flights. Maybe TSA doesn’t know that because there’s always one end of security that’s closed. Picking someone up from here isn’t any easier. Departures are both up and downstairs and the signs are last minute so you may miss it. Of course there’s major construction going on so when you miss it will take a while to get back around. Good luck and have a nice flight"
1st May 2019,1,"""Customer service awful""","Not Verified |  By far the worst airport I’ve ever travelled to, 1.5 hours in security queue and only 1 agent on with 4 standing around chatting! Customer service awful as poor children needing to go to the toilet and one person behind counter really doesn’t care."
25th April 2019,1,"""it just seemed dirty""",Not Verified |  Worst airport. The man checking our passports for airline connections was horribly rude. They were disorganized and it just seemed dirty. Will try to avoid this Airport. There were not enough seats. Just a mess and when you are tired from 10 hour flights you hope for a better greeting when returning home to the states!
20th April 2019,1,"""the worst airport to travel to""","✅ Trip Verified | I travel weekly for work all over the country and for the last 10 weeks, I’ve traveled to Atlanta. ATL is hands down the worst airport to travel to. The majority of the people who work at the airport are bitter, rude and ready to take it out on you. It’s a huge airport and they don’t really think AC is necessary. Especially when they heard you into crowded stalls for TSA. Every flight in and out is delayed. I’m not the only one - ATL is a legend in the field. Avoid it at all costs they say. Wish I could!"
18th April 2019,1,"""Staff surly, unfriendly and unhelpful""","Not Verified | Never ever going to this airport again. Staff surly, unfriendly and unhelpful. Massive lines at immigration, for foreign and US citizens, took 1 hour 50 minutes to get through. Has about 14 booths each side, and only 2 or 3 open at any one time, and the staff walk the slowest I have seen. Missed our connection due to this, asked about moving ahead, no, was reply each time!"
14th April 2019,3,"""No maps anywhere""","✅ Trip Verified |  No maps anywhere. When eventually you find it after asking 5 employees, the screen is dead. You also notice there's minimal signage that's flat to the wall which is why you couldn't find it. Delta rep said it's down half the time. Apparently there are terminal maps on the ATL website which they should communicate this at their poorly functioning electronic directory screens. No easy way to report these kinds of problems to the airport"
9th March 2022,3,"""found the airport extremely uninspiring""",Not Verified |  This was my first visit to the United States and the airport experience is quite horrible I must say. I used Terminal 3 for my flight and found the airport extremely uninspiring for a long wait. There are hardly any seating areas which are comfortable or allow you to rest without being in the middle of crowds all the time. The charging points are very few and uncomfortable to use. The options for food are limited and crowded. Not really sure why such a developed country has airports which are a trial to be in.
7th March 2022,1,"""tired decor and ripped and torn seats""","✅ Trip Verified |  The C United terminal screams “America’s best days have long departed”. Limited food options, dirty tables, stale packaged food from the kiosks. Overflowing trash bins, tired decor and ripped and torn seats. If I was a lived in Chicago I’d be ashamed to have guests arriving at this terminal. My wife an I travel to many developing nations and most have airports that are newer, cleaner and better."
22nd February 2022,1,"""I will not go through another experience like this in the future""","Not Verified |  My flight from Europe was late arriving and I was provided a special boarding pass to fast track through the airport and get me to my final destination in Appleton. The first stop was customs. They didn’t care that I was in a hurry to get through to catch my flight. The workers were yelling at people and gave me a look of contempt when I showed them my boarding pass with a red outline which was to guarantee quick access as well as holding my flight through the airport. By the time I got to the counter to check my bag the clerk smiled and said you are 6 minutes too late to catch my flight which wasn’t leaving for 35 minutes. She said I can reschedule you for a flight leaving tomorrow at 3.30 and provide you a discount for a hotel. I lost it after being up for over 24 hours and encountering so many rude workers at that airport. A manger heard me even though I didn’t raise my voice and offered to help. He was able to reschedule me on a flight to Green Bay which was to leave at 7.30. That flight was delayed until 10.30, no reason provided. We didn’t arrive in Green Bay until 11.30, and didn’t arrive home until 12.30. This horrible experience has ended any future travels. As much as I love to travel I will not go through another experience like this in the future. The sad part about my experience is this is the norm not the exception at this airport."
3rd February 2022,1,"""an embarrassment for the USA""","Not Verified | What an embarrassment for the USA. Filthy airport, rude staff, poorly organized, no help at all with directions, border agents very rude, took two hours to clear customs and immigration, staff barking at people, long queues and To repeat, so very rude and unhelpful staff."
21st December 2021,1,"""awful airport to transit through""","✅ Trip Verified |  An awful awful airport to transit through. Immigration treats you like animals, ventilation is close to nothing, the airport seems to never be on track with time, packed with people and the cleaning is horrendous, the inside looks like a forcefully decorated prison facility. It would be generous to call this an airport. To top it off: a bottle of water bought from inside the domestic airport can’t be taken to your international flight. "
17th December 2021,1,"""astonished by the horrible conditions""","✅ Trip Verified |  I am so astonished by the horrible conditions at this airport. Omicron in the US and people running around maskless. The charging stations seems to be from 2005. There is zero social distancing. Every bar in the place was so jammed with people you would think it was 2018. I have flown through this airport before and thought it was pretty old and poorly run. Now, in the middle of a pandemic and the poor management is shining like a hazard light."
18th October 2021,4,"""this is incompetence, terrible management and a black eye for our city""","✅ Trip Verified | You would figure that of all the problems we face in Chicago that at least we could get the ATM tram up and running again. But alas no luck there. Mayor Lightfoot blames this on the pandemic and Canadian boarder closing (contractor) but I remind her that the completion date was originally 2019 before the pandemic. More recent testing showed that the trams had problems in winter weather. Did we forget to mention that we have that in Chicago? As a 100,000 mile a year traveler based here, I'm saying that this is incompetence, terrible management and a black eye for our city, its inexcusable."
6th October 2021,1,"""Almost no one wore a mask""",Not Verified |  Almost no one wore a mask. Airport police walked right past people without masks and said nothing. This place is a covid petri dish. Long lines in which no one social distanced.
23rd September 2021,2,"""Train Shuttle has not been working for years""",Not Verified |  The Train Shuttle has not been working for years and so you’re forced to catch buses between Terminal 5 and the other 3. Buses that frequently get caught up in traffic jams. Now for some bizarre reason they’ve put the Covid Test Site far away on the Bus Terminal meaning a huge long ride if you discover you need to take a test. This wouldn’t be so bad if the train system was working. Unfortunately I live in Chicago and am obliged to use this awful place.
21st September 2021,3,"""tables were also dirty""",✅ Trip Verified | I hope I never have to use this airport again. The staff was rude as I went through security. They assumed I knew their procedure and barked at me with what to do. Finding an outlet to charge my phone wasn’t easy. Was at a table and an entire side had dead outlets and USB ports. The tables for eating and charging stations were also dirty. Did not look like they had been wiped down all day. Is covid not on the rise again?
19th August 2021,1,"""Incredibly nasty employees at this airport""",✅ Trip Verified | Incredibly nasty employees at this airport. They are treating the travelers with disrespect. Yelling at me and a group of my friends was their way to get documentation for travel on a domestic flight from Europe. The same at baggage check. I have been to a lot of airports but this one was the worst of the worst. Being treated like a criminal or prisoner is not something I’m used to or enjoy. The wifi was not working and the waiting area was covered with trash. And internet was not working. Shame on you that you employ such nasty people! There was not one employee who would be kind and greeting with a smile. Shame on you that you don’t keep the airport clean. I will always avoid this airport in the future.
14th August 2021,1,"""an absolute garbage airport!""",Not Verified |  This is an absolute garbage airport! There's directions to a drive thru covid testing center for travellers that doesn't exist! I spent a half hour looking for this imaginary testing site. Of that wasn't bad enough when i dropped off my rental car there were no signs to the covid testing center anywhere in the airport! So i kept wandering around asking where i need to go getting conflicted directions! For those of you who don't know its in terminal 2 across the street from the Hilton in the bus shuttle center. I hope that saves you a headache and a back ache. There was at least one nice employee that helped me but most of the staff are always rude! If you can avoid this airport!  They tried telling me i needed a PCR test when the country guidelines clearly said antigen is acceptable for my destination. If i listened i would have had to pay an additional $375 on top of the outrageous price of $120. In Germany they sell a similar antigen test for 3 euros or around $5. If you can avoid ohare do it!!
8th August 2021,7,"""the service has improved significantly""","Not Verified |  I have flown several times through O’Hare. Overall, the service has improved significantly but be ready to walk and leave enough time for transit. The food options improved significantly as well. One problem however for international is the transit between terminal 5 (where most but not all international flights leave) and the other terminals - the train between these terminals has been under construction for several years with no end date set (which is absolutely bad management) so avoid international travel if you until the work is done."
1st August 2021,1,"""No organization, no information""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst ever. 3 hours in line to leave. I will never fly here again. Mexico was put together better. No organization, no information. The worst airport I have ever been to."
30th July 2021,1,"""Felt like a Covid breeding factory""","Not Verified |  Worst experience ever coming through customs from Munich. A 2.5-hour line, winding around and around and around before finally getting to the customs line. Everyone in line was disgusted. Felt like a Covid breeding factory. Even though face masks were on, the lines were so long and the area was hot, people had to breathe and dropped masks below their noses. Totally the worst experience I've ever had going through customs at any airport anywhere."
10th July 2021,1,"""I feel this airport is in need of an entire retraining program!""","Not Verified |  We flew in late on a flight from Seattle and had to fly from gate G all the way through the tunnels to gate L to find our gate to Syracuse. We were famished after being on the tarmac in Seattle for what seemed like hours! We came upon the one and only food burger ""restaurant"" on this side of the tunnel and we were completely taken aback when they announced that the restaurant was closed! What? Who is in charge of coordinating this airport? I understand it's late in the day and we are just coming out of covid, but this is ridiculous and, on reading the other comments, I feel this airport is in need of an entire retraining program!"
30th June 2021,1,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,"Not Verified |  My daughter, special needs unattended minor was left abandoned at this airport by prospect escort and this airport tried to send her off to an outside hotel when she is developmentally delayed IQ below 70 and cannot read or write. I had her on escort services and they abandoned her, thankfully her phone was not dead and I could advocate her and demand they watch her like they were supposed to do. This airport is horrible. I hate what they have done to my daughter and they will do nothing about it except say I should not let her travel in their care."
25th June 2021,1,"""no food being served in this area""",Not Verified |  I’m sitting in the concourse that covers gate L 20 to L 24. There are food service counters in this area but there is no food being served in this area. Air travel has been picked up for two weeks now but it can’t open it’s food services when people start traveling. I will be looking at options up to and including changing airlines to avoid this airport in the future. With the people tell you when you ask them at the counter is that it’s due to the pandemic.
16th June 2021,1,"""ORD provides the worst airport experience I have ever had""","Not Verified |  If I could rate this airport 1 star, I would. Does Gordon Ramsay fix nightmare airports too? Our flight was delayed with no notification. Gates changed twice, without notification on the loud speaker. Thank goodness I read the email. Our plane was small, hot, and in poor condition. Staff at the help desk were reluctant to assist me, once they assumed I ""had a long story"", which I didn't even. It was one sentence. The airport itself has dirty restrooms, one of the smaller Starbucks was in a shocking condition. Power outlets throughout the airport do not work. Very sketchy taxi drivers are stationed outside the lower level. This airport in one of America's largest cities should be the standard, American flagship-model airport that other airports around the globe should wish to emulate. Instead, ORD provides the worst airport experience I have ever had! And I have traveled to many different states and countries. This facility should be absolutely ashamed of itself."
15th May 2021,3,"""the staff there were super rude and disrespectful""","✅ Trip Verified | Rudest staff I have ever met. Me and my family were looking for help to print our boarding pass and staff were extremely rude and did not help, the staff member treated us as if we were stupid, we just needed help and his attitude was not necessary. After we went in through security and the staff there were super rude and disrespectful. I am very disappointed, If I don’t have to I will never fly here again."
27th February 2021,1,"""It was just shameful behavior by staff""","Not Verified |  It is upsetting to know that O’Hare airport is part of our current cultural problems. I am a lifelong resident of the Chicagoland area, and I always believed that we had a pretty good airport. I recently returned home from an international, work-related trip and came across two different employees in Terminal 5 that were extraordinarily rude and disrespectful to not only me, but fellow travelers alongside myself. Instead of helping us along the extensive additional requirements that Covid has brought upon us, employees were incredibly rude. In fact, the final pass through was with a lady that screamed at everyone to stay in line and get their papers ready. I was shocked, and actually already had the paper she was screaming about in my hand. She acted as if we weren’t allowed to travel and shouldn’t be there. Well...here’s reality, I am a single mom with two kids in college, so when my company asks me to travel I do it. I am respectful, had my mask on and bags already in hand and also had the paper she was yelling at us about ready to show her. It was just shameful behavior by staff in terminal 5 at ORD. I am sorry if you hate your job so much that you take it out on people just trying to make it in these difficult times. This is the reason why people are leaving Chicago...let’s all just try and be peaceful and nice."
11th January 2021,5,"""a reasonable airport though crowded""","✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago O'Hare is generally a reasonable airport though crowded (at least in non-COVID times). I was arriving on United and departing on Turkish, so I arrived at one extreme end of the airport and then had to exit security and take a bus for a long time to get to Terminal 5, then go through security again. Terminal 5 is a weak point of the airport, though it looks like there is a train going in (still outside security). In January 2021 half the lounges are closed and my airline hasn't bothered to make an arrangement with the ones that are open, though that is not exactly the airport's fault. In my past experience, the lounges here are lame compared with those in the United areas, which I could not use since there is no way to get through without leaving security. ORD should organize the Star Alliance carriers to depart from the terminals United uses since international connections are common, it would save all kinds of difficulty for travelers. Terminal 5 may as well be a different airport since you have to allow at least half an hour to get there and leave security, you could make it to Midway airport in not much more time."
10th January 2021,2,"""everything was closed at 6.30 pm""","Not Verified |  Flights were delayed, unavoidable. I was actually appalled at the restaurants on concourse C. Waitstaff were slow, rude and everything was closed at 6.30 pm. 6.30 pm?! It’s Chicago!"
3rd January 2021,1,"""The service is absolutely deplorable""","Not Verified |  O’Hare airport (United) is the worst airport I have ever been to! And I have traveled extensively all over the world. The service is absolutely deplorable. Lazy, arrogant and downright cruel sums up the creatures who work at this place. They lost my luggage and finally after an hour found it back at our gate. They would not bring it to baggage but instead reissued me a boarding pass so I could go back to the gate and get it myself. I was traveling alone with two young children. They had zero compassion and were zero help! Avoid United and this airport from hell!"
4th December 2020,1,"""Very rude and unfriendly employees""","Not Verified |    Requested wheelchair service to American Airlines gate. Upon arrival told to sit in handicap area and someone would help me. Waited and not one person arrived, next employee said check in at kiosk. Did that, told to sit in handicap area again. Very rude and unfriendly employees. A young man arrived with a wheelchair to get another passenger and asked if I needed help. He told me go to baggage to get a special ""pass"" and someone would come with a wheelchair. My flight was at 1.05pm, Dec 2, 2020. I was at the airport at 10.40 am. I had to get up two more times to ask if someone was coming as it was 12.15 pm and my plane was boarding. One employee snatched it out of my hand to call and see when someone would get me to take me to gate. The purpose of a wheelchair service is so I did not have to walk around everywhere yet I had to anyway to get help. Finally a nice woman arrived, stopped to let me get water and took me all the way on the ramp into the plane. She was kind to me and very apologetic, the only person that was. There was no wi-fi and the place is filthy. I do not think a nonstop flight was worth the nightmare I endured with rude indifferent employees. On that note they could learn from the considerate employees and the cleanliness of the South Carolina airport. Upon returning today, Dec 3, yet another rude employee when I got off the plane she was there with a wheelchair but couldn't sit in it due to other passengers waiting for luggage. Walked the ramp myself then she wheeled me to baggage only after I insisted. She did not speak, just looked at her nails. Very strange young woman, I asked where the restroom was and she said over there somewhere. Big zero rating"
3rd November 2020,1,"""The fact that this airport promises any sort of WiFi is an absolute lie""","Not Verified |  The fact that this airport promises any sort of WiFi is an absolute lie. I tried for hours during my layover to get any sort of a connection to the internet, with no luck. If I was just bored, I would have shrugged my shoulders and moved on, but I had time sensitive work I needed to submit before my flight departed. Thanks to O’Hare and their joke of a WiFi network I wasn’t able to submit assignments for my College classes or do work for my actual job. When you promise your customers WiFi on your website, maybe you should actually make sure, y’know, you can deliver! I absolutely blame O’Hare for this embarrassing problem that hopefully won’t affect my standing at my job or with my professors. Unacceptable! I will go out of my way to never, ever, ever use this airport as a connector on flights ever again."
14th May 2020,5,"""have plenty of time to spare""","Not Verified |  Chicago O'Hare Airport is big, very big. You have to take a bus to travel between terminal 1 to terminal 5 which is an International Terminal, may take many hours to pass thru security. It is crazy with a lot of people everywhere. You must prepare ahead, get a good map, direction and know where to go Leave home early and have plenty of time to spare."
13th March 2020,1,"""the gate was filthy and rundown""",✅ Trip Verified | My family and I were at gate L5 at Spirit this morning. There was a mouse running around as the gate was filthy and rundown. We reported the mouse and were told by gate agent that it was fine and it would not hurt us. He proceeded to do nothing. I will never fly out of here again.
17th February 2020,1,"""such horrible service""",Not Verified | Flew through United For the first time ever and I just wanted to say that I have never experienced such horrible service. They have so many people standing at the kiosks for no reason at all. Because everything I needed assistance the people was just talking amongst each other and we’re no help at all. I had to go walk and get a lady (the only one that was helping clients) so she could help me too when there were at least 10 other people there. Will never use United from O'hare anymore that’s for sure
13th February 2020,3,"""How ridiculous for late flights""","Not Verified |  Spirit had a 3 hour delay. No problem I could deal with it due to bad weather. We flew out of L9, supposed to be 8.30pm but wound up being 11.50, the area was like an oven, so so hot. Because of the delay we we wanted food and drink. Nothing after 9.30pm unless you wanted McDonalds. How ridiculous for late flights. They cater to early flights and don’t care about people taking later ones. Come on why close the place, it’s crazy."
28th January 2020,1,"""Get it together""",Not Verified |  Seriously every time I fly out of Chicago there is a ridiculous delay. This time another plane was just parked at our gate. Get it together - we’re over a half an hour late which to someone needing to get a connecting flight is beyond annoying.
19th January 2020,1,"""Complete chaos, inefficiency and lack of knowledge""","Not Verified |  We had a connecting flight to to RSW. As soon as we got to customs, it was chaos. People were packed into the large room waiting for others to wander around looking for an available kiosk to scan their passport. So unorganized. How about putting the kiosks in a row for people to use while in line? Once finished, we had to stand in long lines again waiting to get checked through. There were only 7 windows open for hundreds of people to funnel through. And, not to sound like ""that guy"", but they were speeding the non-citizens through a lot faster. 2 were for working visas and students, 5 for citizens and tourists. They should be putting the tourists with the non-citizens. They should also have a line for connecting flights because this is the second time we almost missed our flight due to this mess and we weren't the only ones stressing over a connecting flight. Once we eventually got through, getting our bags was pretty quick and easy, but after that, there were no signs saying where to go next. We just got in the super long line with everyone else. My wife went ahead to talk to someone to make sure we were in the correct place. That person told her that we needed to go outside the huge room to a different place so she ran back and got my son and I and we did as he said. Once we got out and the doors closed behind us, we found out that we were in the right place before and now we had to wait for someone else to come out so we could go back in. We went to to counter to talk to them again and they said to just leave our bags there and go to our flight and they would scan them in for us. I didn't feel comfortable about just leaving our bags next to the counter while they were checking in other people who were waiting in line, but we had no choice. Our flight had started boarding and we were nowhere near the terminal. We missed using the family lane for going through security twice because the lane was roped off. Someone who works there saw us and opened it and they were genuinely surprised that he had to tell us to use it. In all the chaos, we lost one of our boarding passes, so we had to rush to the ticket counter to get a new one printed. She insisted on reprinting all 3 passes even though we only needed 1. After that was done, we started to run to the next step when my wife checked and saw they printed the wrong name on my boarding pass. We decided to just use the old one since it didn't need to be reprinted anyway. It was like she was deliberately wasting our time when we had none to waste. We ran to the tent outside (by the way, we weren't dressed for cold weather because we had no plans to leave the airport so my 7-year-old was freezing right along with us) where we were told to wait for the bus. There were so many people that we had to wait for the next one. We knew we had to go to terminal 1, but when the driver stopped, he never said anything. He just opened the door. Now, I could assume that the first stop is terminal 1, but I hate to make assumptions and get off the bus at the wrong terminal when we're already pressed for time.Luckily, someone else said they could see a ""1"" outside, so we got off and ran. We made it to our flight while they were almost finished boarding. 2 hours should have been enough time to get through, but it almost wasn't. Complete chaos, inefficiency and lack of knowledge at O'Hare. Can't rate some things because we had no time to use them."
18th January 2020,2,"""horrible and disrespectful""","✅ Trip Verified | Believe me here when I tell you. I travel for a living as an airline pilot. Forty years + and running. We get moved around on other commercial airlines throughout countries worldwide to and from our trips. The arrival ORD CBP/DHS terminal 5 culture here with our country is so screwed up. They're focusing on the wrong things here. Goods purchases overseas preoccupation and then the fruits, vegetables, fruits, cheeses and the US citizen exemption amounts. When we should be concerned with perpetrators, impostors, criminals and those who wish to our country's entry and to create intentional ill will. Or drugs, etc. The human treatment here is horrible and disrespectful towards it's 'right to be here' US citizens. Especially towards it's born, legal to be here citizens! We're missing the big picture folks."
13th January 2020,1,"""extremely rude and degrading""","Not Verified |  The customer service at this airport is deplorable and the worst that we've ever experienced at any airport! The customer service interaction/communication at security was unpleasant and down right rude, unprofessional and demeaning! No one smiled or provided eye contact when speaking to you. They were extremely rude and degrading. The desk attendant at Spirit counter was also extremely rude while speaking and giving his speech over the intercom! I pray I never have to fly into this airport again!"
25th December 2019,2,"""not enough seating""","Not Verified | My impression is that they are doing everything so you pay extra and enter a business lounge. Crowded and not enough seating facilities, A/C is bad and shops awful. Don't even want to check the bathroom and still have nine hours until my flight. Coming here for a connecting flight had to exit, going through a tent, waiting for a bus."
15th December 2019,2,"""service here is deplorable""",Not Verified | My wife can’t walk so we needed a wheelchair for her. We have waited over an hour and still no wheelchair. The service here is deplorable. We we told that getting wheelchairs has been privatized and they are pretty slow. We also have a dog that needs to pee and all there is here is concrete. Not very accommodating. This may be our last time flying to O'hare if this isn’t fixed soon.
5th December 2019,3,"""pretty shocked at how run down it is""","✅ Trip Verified | The last time I was here was 11 years ago and I am pretty shocked at how run down it is. We're sitting in Terminal C - the seats are broken, the seats are torn in some places and the bathroom are dark and dingy. What's up Chicago? Millions of people travel through your hub every year! Why do you present your city like this? An environment like this also likely causes decreased morale in your staff, they don't seem very happy."
26th November 2019,4,"""Done, no more""","Not Verified | The cowboys that drive those buggies through the terminals beeping and beeping for you to move need shut down. I'm tired of moving off to the side so they can zip through loaded with people too lazy to walk. I'm 72 and I walk. I'm done giving way to those maniacs. Hit me if you want but I'm not going to the wall so you can zip through. Done, no more."
20th October 2019,1,"""delayed delayed delayed""","Not Verified |  It's almost not even a thought that if I fly out of ORD, I will be delayed, no matter what. It's always technical issues. I can understand weather, but technical and maintenance issues are insane. At least the last 10 flights including the one I get to be stuck on right now is delayed delayed delayed. I never ever fly out of here on time. I hate this airport."
12th October 2019,3,"""the experience was a real mixed bag""","✅ Trip Verified | I've never had any particularly negative experience in the times I've flown in and out of O'Hare (although they did lose my luggage in 2014, which was quite annoying). In 2019, the experience was a real mixed bag, first things first, most people I met working at the airport could not have been friendlier or more helpful. A true positive. Even the TSA personnel and incredibly overworked gate agents were patient yet efficient, though, I know this isn't always the case, as with the overworked yet strangely entitled and lackadaisical barista at Starbucks. Oh well, there always seems to have be at least ""that one"" in airports. However, while I've never had particularly negative experiences, this airport is still not easy to like or embrace. It's clearly outdated, outmoded, and overused, if you've ever watched ""Home Alone,"" which came out in 1990, I'm pretty sure the airport looks today just as it did in 1990 (and even earlier). The airport is dirty all the way around and not well taken care of, even smelling what I can describe as dank and damp in certain areas. Gate seating is not ample. While there are plenty of dining and shopping options both pre- and post-security, many of those options have a sort of dingy feel, no matter how well run they are and how friendly the staff are. The lighting and flooring suck, and even the sporadic display of attractive, futuristic-by-1980s-standards artwork doesn't change that fact. Even though the area of Chicago in which O'Hare is located is generally nice and middle-class, the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) train station below the terminal has a strangely uncomfortable feeling - and the station and CTA trains are just filthy, even though the station is less than 30 years old (that's CTA's fault, though). Back upstairs, ride shares take longer to arrive and drop off than at many other large airports, even when things aren't particularly crowded. In all, O'Hare provides a poor introduction to, and representation of, an otherwise friendly, vibrant and unique city called Chicago. What a shame."
6th October 2019,1,"""this was one of the most unpleasant experiences""","✅ Trip Verified | It was quite busy when I arrived and went to the TSA line # 8. The woman who scanned my boarding pass was just lovely and I couldn’t be happier with her. She took time out of her day to ask how I was and truly meant it. When I went to get my things from the conveyer belt, the woman who was handling the baskets with the basket cart was coming through and I must’ve been in her way and couldn’t move quick enough. She screamed ""excuse me!"" (Every single person in that line looked at her with wide eyes because of how obnoxiously loud it was) with a huge attitude. So I moved out of the way and I said ""oh, I am sorry ma’am"". She walked on by ignoring me and then rolling her eyes and laughing with the other TSA woman doing the pat downs. I’m sorry, but I should’ve never been treated that way and this was one of the most unpleasant experiences I have ever been through in an airport. I will make every effort in the future to avoid this airport."
4th October 2019,1,"""had to wait an excessively long time for my bag""","✅ Trip Verified | Before I even left my original destination the pilot was told not to take off yet because ORD had too many planes in the air. So we were late taking off. Then we land, have to taxi for 20 minutes to our gate, and then are told our gate is occupied and we have to wait. I had to wait an excessively long time for my bag (had to check it at the gate before leaving my original destination). And then I had to sprint to my connection only to be told boarding closed literally seconds before I got there. The worker surprisingly wasn’t too rude about it, but I was still angry that they couldn’t hold the flight for 2 minutes for myself and 3 other passengers from my original flight. It’s not like the plane left on time anyway. They rebooked me on the next flight out (an hour later) and luckily it wasn’t delayed, but it still took forever to actually take off!"
25th September 2019,1,"""Unbelievably badly organised""","Not Verified |  Unbelievably badly organised. The staff try to mask this by constantly shouting at customers and by treating them as if they have perpetrated serious misdemeanours and are under arrest. Guys, we know about security. We really would like your owners to give you better organisation but this isn't our fault so kindly stop yapping and tàke up your issues with management. Also, wearing a uniform does not entitle you to be impolite. I actually experienced a customs officer mimicking my accent. And in the obvious culture of workplace bullying that flourishes in this airport, I was acutely aware that this man clearly wanted me to react so he could pullme out of line. BTW I am an obvious little old lady. The city authorities of Chicago need to be aware that this airport represents them to their incoming visitors, and it does it badly. Really very badly."
15th September 2019,1,"""the rudest TSA personnel ever""","Not Verified |  Worst airport ever! Do not use for international flights. Absolutely the rudest TSA personnel ever. Very rude when they were screening my carry on. We had very little time for connecting flight and my daughter was using wheelchair assistance - helper was excellent - he was the bright spot. However they held us up as they wiped down wheelchair - which had come from inside a security checkpoints. They also completely patted me down, including crotch area and all over my person. Unbelievably rude bag screening personnel. This was the second horrible experience here coming from London. They also sent our luggage to the East coast. I would avoid this place like the plague. "
23rd August 2019,1,"""I’ve seen much better""","Not Verified |  Horrible! You must leave the secure area, go outside and take a bus to transfer from the international terminal to a connecting flight. The bus is rundown, and there are no markings or PA announcements regarding the various terminal stops. Terminal 2, Concourse E is old, narrow, has inadequate seating at the gates. I’ve seen much better in third world countries!"
20th August 2019,1,"""Awful! Just awful""","Not Verified |  Awful! Just awful. Hard to find Frontier in the first place, sign is on the back side of the board and not visible from the road, once inside I felt like I was in a cattle car. Gates M1 and M 2 were posted nowhere, hundreds of people milling around, no rep from my airlines anywhere! ne poor airport employee with no mic trying to board people and de-plane multiple persons from multiple flights at the same time. SRO, no room to sit or walk. No flight status updates available in terminal at all and the on line and app info was always at least 1 hour behind actual info. Never again will I fly Frontier or any other airlines through this terminal. I can only hope that Frontier’s attention to operational and customer service details in the air will be 100% better than it is on the ground today!"
8th August 2019,1,"""Terminal 5 is shocking""","✅ Trip Verified |    Terminal 5 is shocking. Nothing works, the train is broken, the toilets are clogged, the security lines are long (and terminal 5 does not even accept precheck!?). The shops are scarcely stocked (except for sundries and candy). Free WiFi requires payment when you click on. Food outlets are overwhelmed. Lounges are among the worst of any major global city. This is Chicago? A world class city? If I had to move my company to Chicago and use terminal 5 I would have to pay extra hardship allowances for my management. Third world conditions affecting the staff who care less about service because they are treated like animals instead of ladies and gentlemen. The board at chicago O’Hare should resign because of the long lasting horror show at terminal 5. And the airlines that pay to use this service should be questioned as well."
27th July 2019,1,"""airport is poorly designed""","Not Verified |  My trip home from Brussels was scheduled to connect in Chicago O'Hare, arriving at 1 pm and departing to Houston at 4 pm. My experience in the O'Hare airport was a total nightmare. There were multiple flight delays, and they changed the departure gate three times, with the last change forcing all passengers to go from the C terminal to the B terminal. In the end, the flight to Houston departed at about 10 pm, a delay of 6 hours, and for me a total of 9 hours spent in O'Hare, not knowing when, or if, there would be a flight to Houston that day. There was almost no place to sit, so most of the passengers were forced to stand for hours. This airport is poorly designed, managed horribly, and it does not have enough gates. Anyone returning from overseas should NEVER use O'Hare for a connecting flight."
22nd July 2019,2,"""an embarrassment for international guests""","✅ Trip Verified | Never ever use Chicago for international arrivals. After four different passport and customs checks, complete with lines, (oh and a ceiling light crashed to the floor 1 0feet to the left of me, fortunately missing the people walking in that area), you then have to go with your full baggage on a bus to a separate terminal where you get to wait in another bag drop line, then you get to go through the full security all over again. This brings you to terminal 1, where exhausted and hungry travellers are met with only fast food options with food courts, no sit down restaurants with a full kitchen. Ok, there is a sit-down hot dog restaurant, and a sit-down sandwich counter, these do not count. Even the pizza is by the slice and warmed up. This is an embarrassment for international guests arriving in America."
20th July 2019,1,"""Rude staff members""","✅ Trip Verified | What a disaster! After a two hour queue at Heathrow due to baggage failure we arrived at O'Hare only to find a plane occupying our stand, another half an hour on the plane before we could get off, only to join a three hour queue to get through passports and customs. Rude staff members. No seats for anyone, no available drinks, no information given and finally after all that no luggage. If I could given 0 on stars I would."
16th July 2019,1,"""arrival gate was not available""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flew thru Chicago O’Hare from Tucson to Madison and back. On the way out we waited on the plane for 1/2 hour after landing before we got to a gate. On the way home we circled the entire airport twice since our arrival gate was somehow not available? They didn’t know we were coming? After over an hour they found us another gate, although we couldn’t GET to it at first due to other planes being in the way! Many missed their connections - we were ok because the next plane was late too. Oh and no outlets in Chicago  OHare seem to be working. Never again."
16th July 2019,2,"""Don’t use for international connections""","✅ Trip Verified |  Don’t use Chicago O'Hare for international connections. It’s worse than HRW To go from T5 (International arrivals) to domestic terminals you have to line up under a tent (boiling Summer temperatures), board a bus (off and on at each terminal). It takes an hour. Horrible experience on 2019-07-15."
12th July 2019,1,"""No fast food outlets anywhere""","✅ Trip Verified |    I have been traveling internationally to Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East frequently for about 25 years. I am very familiar with international terminals in all these places. Unfortunately, I live near Chicago, so I must fly in and out of O'Hare's international terminal (Terminal 5) regularly. I have three complaints: One, I'm used to airport food concessions being rip offs, but at least elsewhere there are relatively low-priced options. But not O'Hare's Terminal 5. No fast food outlets anywhere - only expensive restaurants. Last time I was there I had two hours to kill and was hungry, and I ended up paying $20 for a cheeseburger and a bottle of water. Two, other airports have decent bookstores. Schipol in Amsterdam comes to mind. But not Terminal 5. I guess in our dumb country people don't read books. Three, when you arrive for departure at other airports, there are free luggage carts available. But not O'Hare - they're $6.00. O'Hare sucks!"
30th June 2019,2,"""Extremely poorly managed""","✅ Trip Verified | Easily, without even having to dig into my brain, the worst airport in the country. Extremely poorly managed and the dirtiest I’ve been in. Understaffed for the quantity of fliers for the given day. The restaurant choices are also nothing to be pleased with. I’m a regular flyer with work and I will be avoiding Chicago airport like the Black Plague."
26th June 2019,1,"""Poorly managed airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Poorly managed airport. Constant delays, traffic on the tarmac. My plane was delayed almost 2 hours and the plane spent 40+ min on tarmac. Couldn’t get to the gate."
22nd June 2019,1,"""will not be traveling through ORD again""","Not Verified |  I can overstate how truly awful it is to have ORD as a connection point for an international flight. The degree of disorganization, coupled with the overall sprawl of the airport, makes for a bad experience. The bussing of passengers between the international and domestic terminals resembles something analogous to cattle being herded into a milking contest at the local county fair, the signage indicating what to do and where to go is very minimal and confusing. Between the bare-bones number of TSA screeners on shift and being selected for additional screening/pat down, I missed my connecting flight by two minutes. The airport workers made it very clear through their half-mumbled non-responses that they did not give even care about trying to help me identify who I should speak to regarding the situation. If it were possible to rate the airport staff as a zero I would do so. I will not be traveling through ORD again under any circumstances unless it is my final destination for a trip, I would recommend to others to do the same."
21st June 2019,1,"""Staff are rude incompetent""",✅ Trip Verified |  Staff are rude incompetent and had no empathy to passengers. They have no system in clearing passengers and did not care if they are late to their connecting flights. Took hours to get processed and had no translator for foreign speaking passengers. Tokyo airport who’s staff speaks little English will put this airport to shame. Staff on their cellphones instead of attending to passengers. Not courteous at all. They ate the worse. A lady asked a staff member if there is another line as she is getting late for her connecting flight. The response she got was “everybody has a connecting flight. The nerve of these people. I think they are taking their uniforms too seriously to intimidate passengers. If this represent the people of Chicago tourism would collapse in this city. They are not professional and needs to take a course on customer service.
20th June 2019,1,"""will definitely avoid this connection in the future""","✅ Trip Verified | If you want to get a stroke definitely fly through this poorly staffed and designed airport. I think to get a job here you need to write in your resume that you just don’t give a damn about people needs and feelings, I’ve never experienced such ruthless and humiliating way of treating people when they are shaking and sweating begging them for help, I wasn’t alone and you feel like they move and talk in a slow motion, talking on their cell phones (are they allowed to make personal phone calls on a clock?). Going from terminal 5 to the domestic terminals is a horrific nightmare if you have a short connection, you probably will miss your flight, the driver of the bus was collecting employees on her way to my terminal after I’ve asked her politely how long would be a drive that I’m afraid not to make it to my gates. I’m sure my review will not change anything and the way this administration hires its people, but I will definitely avoid this connection in the future."
17th June 2019,2,"""a terrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  What a terrible experience. Upon arrival, there was no wait to find a kiosk for printing luggage tags and boarding passes, however, after that there was a 45-50 minute wait just to drop your luggage off. The line was so long that it looped through the concourse making it confusing to know where it began/ended. The people who were supposed to be helping were pushy and short as if we were inconveniencing them and not the other way around and several people missed their flights because of their mess. Tsa workers were continually shuffling which security areas were open which made the wait longer (a couple who arrived 30 minutes before me made it to the same gate at the same time because they had gates closed just as they were about to enter security twice). It was just unpleasant, unprofessional, and disorganized. For context, I fly out of LAX 2-3 times a year and this airport made LAX seem like a well oiled machine."
8th June 2019,5,"""a pretty unpleasant experience""","Not Verified |  Concourse C, while beautiful, is sorely lacking in places to enjoy an adult beverage. There are only 3 places to get a drink which is absurd in the today’s world of having to arrive to the airport exceedingly early. The bars are packed - total madhouses, which makes for a pretty unpleasant experience. It’s time to come up to par with other more sophisticated airports. And, I can’t imagine the revenue they are missing out on! Get it together O’Hare!"
29th May 2019,5,"""are all gates really booked""","✅ Trip Verified | I have never been able to fly out and reach a gate on time ever. How is it so difficult to find gate every time the flight lands Don’t they know about the arrival, are all gates really booked?"
23rd May 2019,1,"""What an awful experience""","✅ Trip Verified | What an awful experience, I will never book a flight to Chicago O'Hare again. We waited around two hours once off our Norwegian flight to go through to passport control. You have a self serve machine where you have to put information into and then queue again to do the very same. The women who are supposed to be helping you don't and the two I came across were so rude. I asked a question and the young girl looked at me, turned around and walked off! I am horrified to think that they are in a job! If this was London Gatwick or Heathrow Airport they would not be in a job! We had similar timing issues at the airport for our departure where there were just four men checking the security on all international flights going through terminal 5! Very disorganised. O'Hare being a large hub airport and looking at other reviews here, they should take on the feedback and learn from this in moving forward. First impressions has left a lasting impression where I will not be returning!"
20th May 2019,3,"""We will not be returning""","✅ Trip Verified |  Traveling is already a stressful occasion. Here are some tips to make it easier on people. The attendant that is supposed to check if flyers are “pre-checked” or not should actually do their job. A guy behind us literally said they aren’t sure if they’re pre-checked and she never stopped to explain or check his pass or anything. she just hurried him along in line. Some people are first time flyers. Be patient, be helpful, do your job. help educate them so next time things can go smoother. Next — allow families/groups to stay together. When one attendant is pulling one-by-one from three different lines, the person or people I am traveling with could be very far behind me. This is not conducive with groups of minors. It can be scary and allowing them to stay together is a small courtesy that could be extended to help out. Teach your workers patience. It was terrible here. Back home our airport is respectful and understanding, this was a huge shock for my group and I. We will not be returning. It’s about to be a long day and this experience has made it longer."
20th May 2019,1,"""a truly awful experience""","Not Verified |  Landing here was a truly awful experience! Took nearly 3 hours to get through immigration! It took another 45 minutes to queue up for the bus to take me to a different terminal! The airport is so badly organised, an actual joke. The staff there aren't interested in helping they just roll their eyes and give you short answers to get rid of you! No organisation, no customer service Avoid avoid avoid, I know I will be in the future!"
16th May 2019,4,"""security lines are a nightmare""","Not Verified |  You need to arrive an extra 30 minutes earlier than you usually arrive if traveling through O’Hare. The security lines are a nightmare. I have been flying through O’Hare for 20 years and the problem only seems to have gotten bad over the last 3 years. When you arrive to the airport, you’ll be surprised to see that there’s a line out the door for TSA. This line takes minimum 30 minutes to go through. Once you’re past a certain point, you see how much unused space there is & start to wonder why they’re not using that space for TSA."
10th May 2019,1,"""Customs is an absolute joke""",Not Verified |  Customs is an absolute joke at O’Hare. They make you wait in line for hours to then have to scan your own passports. Both of our scanning machines didn’t work so after an hour in line I had to ask for help. I do want to point out a customs employee flagged us down and let us cut in line because we were traveling with small kids but that was after an hour. Total time was 2 hours and that was with them letting us cut in front of a the whole line.
5th May 2019,3,"""make the experience unnecessarily unpleasant""","Not Verified |  Deliberately unhelpful ""helpers"" at immigration lines. The immigration staff themselves were fine, the two women on duty to manage the lines were downright unhelpful and nasty. They re-directed the line multiple times until there were about 10 people waiting for one immigration officer while the remainder of the line were filtered through about 3 other officers in the same time. Even when the 3 staff had processed the longer line, one of the women refused even to acknowledge a polite question by someone in front of me as to whether we could move back to the main line. So ridiculous and ironic given that she was wearing a jacket labeled ""I can help you."" She was just as rude to people who did not speak English and refused to answer other perfectly reasonable questions about where people should go. Staff like this just make the experience unnecessarily unpleasant, and detract from the good work that other people at the airport are doing in a stressful environment."
3rd May 2019,1,"""Horrible place""","✅ Trip Verified | Being rude, dismissive, grumpy, and pretty much just don't give a damn attitude must be required to work here. Every single person not just one or two are this way. The people working for the various airlines are totally different - nice, kind and polite. The contrast is shocking. Lady next to me was basically dumped from her wheelchair into a seat and left. No conversation with her at all. Absurd. Horrible place. I had forgotten why I don't fly from here! Now I remember! I won't do this again. Darn shame people. Darn shame."
19th February 2019,3,"""We were treated like criminals""
","Not Verified |  What’s up with the customs officers in this airport? So very rude - including Global Entry. We’re Americans re-entering our own country. We were treated like criminals. Such a poor experience for us, but worse yet for international visitors. ORD customs officers need customer service training! You’re a bad example for our country."
22nd January 2019,2,"""Not disabled friendly""","Not Verified |  Not disabled friendly, airport does not have runways itsvery extensive, lacks water fountains, places for people to lounge/stay while in transit overnight. Staff at stands lack sympathy, empathy and good manners, airport has lots of plant adornments and is beautifully decorated with great photographs and some restaurants but lacks standards to make it accessible to for instance a diabetic, a person with impaired mobility and someone who needs accesiblity to fresh water fountains or quick transportation between far gates if they travel with kids or are disabled, diabetic have asthma or breathing or walking challenges. Lack of runway or belts like in other smaller airports (Colorado, Dallas 5 star for instance). Cleaner, more comfortable and more accessible is better than nicely decorated. Lack of chargers and electrical sockets to recharge pumps and medical equipment and phones and laptops those at the rotunda do not work. Nice plants though. Tables broken, not enough seating space, cluttered."
20th January 2019,1,"""the signage was not clear""","Not Verified |  We had to change planes in Chicago and go from domestic to international on January 2/3. The airport was decently clean but the signage was not clear about where to go. The biggest problem I saw was the TSA agents in the international terminal. Never have I seen such a bunch of ill tempered, unhappy and condescending people in my life. This is one reason why we don't usually fly through Chicago."
30th December 2018,1,"""airport is filthy""",Not Verified | After experiencing delays with United airlines a waitress at a restaurant was so rude to me and so insensitive. The bathrooms smelt like an outdoor toilet and they had not been cleaned in years the airport is filthy and they can do a much better job with training their employees at Customer Service.
26th December 2018,3,"""Worst experience ever""","Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. First I was stopped at customs for about 30 minutes while all my bags were emptied and searched. Then i was forced to unlock my phone so it could be searched. I was asked rude and invasive questions during the searches. When i asked why my phone was being searched i was told it was ""random extra searching."" Finally finished that and was given bad directions by an airport official for transferring terminals. This led me to exit and enter security again which was painfully slow. After getting through security I learned that i was again at the wrong terminal (i was too early for my flight to be posted and both security and airline officials directed me to the wrong terminal.) I was in Beijing, Manila, Phnom Penh, and Macau airports this trip and was shocked to see how much more run down and inefficient O'Hare was compared to all of those. I will never transfer through Chicago again. Good luck to you if you decide to."
22nd December 2018,4,"""It's been like this for years""","Not Verified |  Why do none of the power outlets at the changing stations ever work. It's been like this for years, I travel for a living and dread getting delayed here with no way to power my phone or laptop, avoid all connections from this dump."
18th December 2018,1,"""beyond disappointing TSA""","✅ Trip Verified | Unprofessional, rude, beyond disappointing TSA. How do these people have a job? TSA agents were rude from start to finish. Screamed at travelers in line to get in a different line in the rudest way possible! Laughed at people in line etc. I was disgusted."
11th December 2018,2,"""Rude, aggressive, apathetic staff""","Not Verified |  It’s been several visits to O’Hare. Rude, aggressive, apathetic staff and TSA agents. People who are clearly irritated working with the public and want you to know. From the TSA ID reader at security checkpoint 7 near American Airlines in Terminal 3 who wants you to extend your left arm to place your phone on the reader but not move your body at all, and when you accidentally do, becomes angry and tells you how unhappy he is b/c people don’t listen, or the other agent who doesn’t explain how to place your bag on the roller but is very disappointed in your actions by yelling, “Do not push!” I get it. You hate me, you hate people, and you hate your job. I have traveled back with students from abroad to be greeted with angry agents who separated my students from me, sending them to separate security checkpoints, and rushed us so fast through lines my kids kept screwing up. TSA didn’t care. Kids were crying and the anxiety spiked. They still did not care. If you want to feel worse about your existence, go to O’Hare. They will let you know through their tones, angry looks, and aggressive actions. Something needs to change."
18th November 2018,1,"""complete incompetence""",✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely terrible experience at Chicago O’Hare. I had just finished flying 15 hours from Dubai where I was greeted with a very rude and unhelpful airport staff. I then had to wait in line for over 2 hours for shuttle bus to get to the terminal for my connecting flight (some of which included standing outside in 38 degree weather). I had given myself 4 hours between flights and still barely made it to my gate on time. I got there as they were boarding. I heard so many people say that they were going to miss their flights because of this complete incompetence. Unacceptable.
10th November 2018,1,"""inefficient, rude and unhelpful people""","Not Verified |  Worst experience ever returning home after a 25 hour flight from Thailand. Made it through the kiosks and stood in line for 30 minutes getting closer to our turn when we were redirected to another section of kiosks - I asked why we were redirected and the girl started saying it wasn’t her fault and she didn’t know. Now I found myself standing in an even longer line. I’ve never experienced such inefficient, rude and unhelpful people at O’Hare in my life. I also don’t understand why us citizens and green card holders are in the same lines as visitors. Used to be a breeze getting through customs - not any more!"
8th November 2018,1,"""made me feel unsafe and violated""
","Not Verified |  My first time traveling internationally. The TSA that went through my luggage were completely unprofessional, condescending, rude, and disrespectful. He said ""it's not my fault you don't know how to read signs and you are traveling"" (after I told him I wasn't sure I was in the right place and needed guidance for my first time traveling internationally). I am Human Resource Manager, I am so disappointed in the verbal treatment from this male TSA. I understand they have a job to do. It does not include verbally abusing paying travelers. We are all tired and stressed (airport staff / travelers). In any other United States job this gentlemen would have either been terminated or severely disciplined. He made me feel unsafe and violated."
2nd November 2018,7,"""it was okay overall""","✅ Trip Verified | I was flying in to Minneapolis from Hong Kong, and having chosen United, needed to pass transit at either Chicago or San Francisco- seeing as he overall travel time would be shorter via Chicago, I opted for them. Despite most people I know telling me that O’Hare is awful, I thought it was okay overall - in fact, I found them quite efficient. I arrived in a Chicago on a Thursday. Being Canadian, I was able to breeze past immigration through their automated clearance system, and got through in 10 minutes. The immigration officer had a serious expression, and waved me through really quickly. My bags arrived shortly after I reached he reclaim area. Seeing as my flight arrived 2 hours early, I tried to get switched to the earlier flight, and after the United ground staff dealt dealt with the frustratingly lengthy process of rebooking my flight, she was able to land me a seat on the flight and helped me ensure that my bag would be checked in to that flight despite there only being a one hour window to departure. This also meant that I needed to rush to Terminal 1 from the international terminal. Rushing to Terminal 1 is normally easy, seeing as they have that automated people mover, but it’s undergoing long-term maintenance/being rebuilt in sections, so it’s closed on weekdays. This meant that I was at the mercy of the shuttle bus, which was obviously slower to board and arrive, due to the very peculiar traffic design between terminals. There was this one intersection that allowed one bus through at a time and took close to 10 minutes to clear. Despite all that rushing, I was still able to get to my flight in time, partly due to their speedy TSA crew that in dealing with the backlog decided that’s passengers could go through with their shoes on. My flight back from Minneapolis occurred without a hitch, though arriving with a 3 hour layover gave me a chance to really soak up the architecture and movie filming locations in the 3 main terminals. I probably could’ve also tried their dining, but alas, I have not. When it comes to waiting for flights, the seats at Terminal 1 are old, but adequate. I appreciate their provision of outlets near seating for device charging, but it would probably be even better if they also provided USB ports on the outlets, and fitted universal outlets seeing as travellers may not have the correct adaptors. Also, Boingo is still the main WiFi provider in the airport, but they now offer a few hours of unlimited wifi every time you watch an ad. The ads aren’t that long, so I’d argue that that’s okay, and for cost recovery, it’s not too annoying."
18th October 2018,2,"""rude, unfriendly, unhelpful""","Not Verified | The most rude, unfriendly, unhelpful, and unprofessional employees. If I politely ask for your help, don’t tell me “I’m not getting involved, you know the rules, you have to figure out what to do.” I’ve only flown once before, 3 years ago - your job is to help me. You get paid to help me. I’m not saying you have to be the nicest, but the attitude from all 5 employees I came into contact with, is just inappropriate! Horrible.."
14th October 2018,4,"""have more buses at least""",Not Verified | Horrible. Seriously O’Hare get your transit up and running. After landing I had to wait over half an hour outside for a bus to come pick us up and take us to the parking lot. Unacceptable if you’re going to shut down the train have more buses at least.
22nd September 2018,3,"""a horrible experience""","Not Verified | I had a horrible experience at Chicago O'Hare recently. On September 3rd, we had an international layover on our way to Italy for our honeymoon. There were some weather issues which caused our incoming flight from Seattle to circle the airport for a while before we were finally able to land. No problem, I get weather issues. Once we were able to deboard the plane, we had to find the international terminal. The airport had very poor signage for this, so we stopped to ask a staff. He told us the quickest way would be to go to the end of the G gates and take a shuttle to the M International terminal to avoid having to exit the airport and go through security again. Once we got to G17 where the shuttle was, a female airport worker told us she needed to see our boarding passes and passports. We handed them over and she said she couldn't allow us to be shuttled until she confirmed our flight was still there. I told her that my Delta app confirmed that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes. I had also heard an announcement that all flights were delayed from the weather since no planes were able to take off or land. She insisted on checking Google Flights for her update as well as got on her walkie-talkie to ask someone who was in the international wing if our flight was still there. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking and we need to board our plane. This person who works at the damn airport would not use the airport computer to check our flight status and continued to rely on Google Flights. She told us that she would not shuttle us over because apparently our flight had left. I told her she was wrong and she refused. I was furious. I grabbed our passports and told my husband, ""I don't trust that she is right. I think we still need to make a run for it and go to the international wing by ourselves."" We exited the airport, caught the rail train and went through security with 10 minutes to spare. We finally made it to our gate and what do you know, our flight was still there! We were able to board and had about 5 minutes."
6th September 2018,1,"""Avoid this airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Avoid this airport if at all possible. Horrendous experience both arriving and departing. When we arrived it took over half an hour to get off the plane because information on connecting flights had be posted just outside the exit and caused congestion. We then made our way down to immigration control which was in chaos. There were no proper signs just some people shouting instructions which nobody could understand. We followed people and ended up in the wrong place. After 10 minutes we were then told where we needed to go by somebody we could understand. This was the longest queue I have ever seen, It took us 15 minutes to get to the back of it. When we got near the automatic machines we were stopped for about 15 minutes because the queue after the machines was too long and was clogging up the machine area. When we used the machines our documents were rejected. We later found out that the machines were rejecting 95% of people. This was the basis of the queue. Because of this we had to go in the next queue to be dealt with manually. Altogether it took nearly 3 hours to get through the immigration. Departing was not much better. After checking in, which took about 40 minutes because BA do not have a bag drop option and only 2 desks open for Economy and Premium Economy passengers we were then faced with another huge queue for immigration. It was so long it spilled out onto the check in area. Once through immigration the security check was relatively quick although I had to be body searched because I left a plastic comb in my pocket! It took over 2 hours to get through. One of our worst experiences at a USA airport, although departing from here was also bad a couple of years ago, so a place to avoid."
3rd September 2018,10,"""security efficient and friendly""","✅ Trip Verified | Airline travel is not always the easiest thing to do. The more stresses that can be eliminated from it, the better. I think one of the biggest stresses is the time it takes to go through security. O’Hare’s security is efficient and friendly allowing travelers to place their items on the scanning belt at their own pace without holding up the rest of the line. We were able to get in a through security in less than 20 minuets which is fantastic. Great job!"
28th August 2018,4,"""most restaurants were closed by 9pm""","✅ Trip Verified | Check-in area in terminal 5 is far too small. One airline had two flights leaving within an hour but was assigned a limited number of check-in counters. This caused the line to spill in to the hallway and blocking foot traffic. Once you clear check-in, the immigration and final security is done in a small area where there is not much of a system. Lines can crisscross and you really need to be patient as you go through the process. I had a red eye flight and I wanted to get a meal before boarding. Unfortunately most restaurants were closed by 9pm. As expected the one open restaurant was swamped with customers. The restaurant staff could hardly cope with orders taking a long time coming. There appears limited seating in both check-in and boarding areas. Wi-Fi was not working in all areas."
25th August 2018,7,"""an abundance of restaurant choices""
","✅ Trip Verified | I feel like O'Hare gets a bad wrap overall for a few reasons, but some issues are legitimate, and the experience will vary greatly depending on which terminal you go through. For starters I usually fly United, and usually go through Terminal 1 or 2. I don't fly through Terminal 3, and my experience in the International Terminal has only been for one arrival recently. That said, I can break down Terminal's 1 and 2 which are good overall in my view. For starters the main issue with United is connecting flights can take a little while to get around. Terminal 1 is separated into two concourses connected by an underground walkway. In theory you could have a connecting flight on United Express which are mostly located in Terminal 2 despite your regular United flight may land at the C-Gates in Terminal 1. Therefore, you may have to walk from the end of the C-gate to the central area to reach the underground tunnel, go underground the tarmac, pop up at Terminal 1, then go to the end to reach the walkway to Terminal 2, then you'll cross into Terminal 2, and finally you are at your gate. It sounds like a long walk because it is. I recommend at least have 30 minutes to transfer flights. Then the other issues at O'Hare can be queue times for TSA, or some restaurants. I can say from personal experience the TSA at O'Hare have been relatively quick, as in no more than 20 minutes to get through during most times, however, during some peak times such as 4-6 pm, then lines can get long and take over 30 minutes. It has been random since sometimes during ""peak times"" things have been quick. I finally got TSA pre-check, so I'll see how that goes when I fly out tomorrow. Finally the last big issue is the poor wifi. It's Boingo which is too expensive, and at times it doesn't process your purchase correctly. Try to get into a United Club for wifi. I have gone through some personal negatives, and likely negatives for flyers in Terminals 1 and 2. The good news there are pluses. For one, the food choices are good. There are some local chains including Rick Bayless own chain which has solid Tex-Mex sandwiches, and amazing Guacamole. I believe Wow Bao is located in O'Hare, and there is a local tea chain as well. Meanwhile there is an abundance of restaurant choices such as steak, Italian, seafood, cafe food, etc. From my experience I haven't had a bad meal. Keep in mind, don't expect Michelin star restaurants, but if you have a good layover, then you can get a good meal. Finally the bar scene isn't bad, but prices are airport prices. At least Goose island has bars with local tapped beer. Finally the last positive is the location. The blue line connects to O'Hare, 24/7, to the Loop. It's near I-90 and I-294 which help drivers get around anywhere in the Chicagoland area. That said, if you are going to Northwest Indiana, or Joilet, then it'll take a good hour to get there from O'hare. That said, the taxi stand is outdated and slow. Expect to spend a good 30 minutes to get a taxi. Overall it is a good big airport. It's not perfect, nor the best in the world since I've been to LHR to Narita, however, as a large US airport it's one of the better ones in my view. Especially compared to EWR or elsewhere."
16th August 2018,7,"""very far with no moving walkways""","Not Verified |  Experience was ok. Because of delay at Rapid City Regional, I was late but the man at the desk quickly informed me I would have no trouble catching my flight to Madrid if I made my way quickly to the departing gate. Distance to the gate was very far with no moving walkways. Turns out I had plenty of time. Flight was delayed for over an hour."
14th August 2018,3,"""garbage over flowing everywhere""","✅ Trip Verified | We are sitting in front of McDonals in terminal L. There is garbage over flowing everywhere, all of the tables are disgusting and dirty. I see no one cleaning in the vicinity. Why treat customers this way? Have the food places clean the charging tables and other tables throughout the terminals as people are using the tables to eat their food. Have a cleaning person dedicated to specific areas so that it stays clean."
11th August 2018,1,"""why cant the staff be understanding""","✅ Trip Verified | My flight was cancelled due to weather, which I understand is not anyone's fault. So considering how understanding I was, especially in comparison to other very unhappy people. So you can imagine how upset I became when I was berated for moving a cot 3 ft into darker lighting. I was not aware this was a rule. I apologized and moved it back. Even after that I was harassed by the same staff member for not moving it back ""right"". Look, I was understanding about being stuck on a cot here after purchasing a 400 dollar ticket so why cant the staff be understanding and accommodating to me as well. It all just makes me never want to fly again."
1st August 2018,2,"""Understaffed and rude""",Not Verified |  Understaffed and rude. I mised my connecting flight due to delay with previous flight as American Airlines had overbooked their flight. They try to provide Express support to people with short connecting flights but they failed miserably due to lack of coordination. The staff at the boarding counter were rude and laughing at the time they were telling me that I missed my flight. Then they started speaking to each other in Spanish in front of me. Very rude staff.
27th July 2018,3,"""too small for the volume of passengers""
","Not Verified |  Terminal 5 is simply not fit for purpose, security screening area is far too small for the volume of passengers. It took one hour 15 minutes to get through a tortuous winding and sweaty queue - one of my worst ever airport experiences. Once through the size and selection of the duty free shopping area is tiny - and the options on where to eat very limited and expensive. Chicago you can do way better than this."
19th July 2018,3,"""passes on phones not adequate for TSA approval""","✅ Trip Verified | You can tell by looking at my boarding pass that I’m TSA approved. But I was patted down because I was wearing a skirt (that’s what the TSA officer said.) I’m a 60 year old lady, who just had knee surgery and I was quite embarrassed by the this. The officer was extremely kind but I do not understand why my boarding pass on my phone was not adequate for this situation. There should be at least signs indicating that boarding passes on phones are not adequate for using your TSA approval."
11th July 2018,1,"""lazy, and unhelpful staff""","Not Verified |    Horrible, lazy, and unhelpful staff. So many open spaces where they could cut down the lines but they just lean against the wall, laugh and chat up with other security, and I even saw some sleeping on the job. After I asked 1 of the staff there for help on my gate number, they told me to google it and went back to leaning on the wall. I asked another one and they misdirected me to 2 different terminals before I finally found it on my own. They also were disrespectful and made jokes about us like "" can you even see "" and laughed about it with a co worker. I highly advise anyone that plans on a trip to steer clear of this airport."
8th July 2018,1,"""employees rude, unfriendly, and unhelpful""","Not Verified | Arrived from Phoenix on our way to Copenhagen. Signage is basically non-existent or useless in this airport, and it took forever just to find someone to ask where to go to catch our connection. Apparently information desks are only staffed when they feel like it. Probably the worst thing was the employees - rude, unfriendly, and unhelpful. My daughter kept saying, ""can you imagine being from another country and trying to navigate this place?!"" Oh, and don't come hungry if you need to travel overseas - everything in that terminal closes really early. I planned our trip so far in advance, and we were not supposed to transfer in Chicago, but unfortunately the airline changed our flight and we had to experience the hell that is O'Hare. Try very hard to avoid this airport!"
6th July 2018,1,"""lazy, rude, and disgruntled""","Not Verified |  The first thing I noticed was that employees in every area were lazy, rude, and disgruntled. They leaned against walls and chatted about their social plans while ignoring travelers. I believe the employees may purposely misdirected you if you ask for help. They tell you to go in the opposite direction. The airport must be managed by the same types who run Chicago. Masses of travelers bottleneck at crucial checkpoints where clearly it needs to be staffed by several employees, only one or two employees check documents when hundreds of travelers are trying to move to connecting flights. I don’t recommend that you ask anyone for help because they will lie or treat you with terrible rudeness. The entire airport is filthy, covered in food debris and dirt. It’s a little piece of Hell."
1st July 2018,1,"""avoid this mess""","✅ Trip Verified |  Typical ORD experience late in by an hour delayed out twice so far, travelers have experienced two gate changes and I suspect the final act of uncaring rudeness will be a cancelation. Take my advise - and I know this is hard too do - avoid this mess. Yes it's worth driving to alternative airports, yes it's worth timing headaches. Do not fly through this aeronautical gyer."
28th June 2018,1,"""disorganized, unhelpful disgrace""","✅ Trip Verified |  I sincerely hope I never have to travel via this airport again. It is the most disorganized, unhelpful disgrace I've ever encountered and I've travelled extensively including 3rd world airports which function far better than this place does. I had the misfortune of transiting through O,Hare on my way back from LAX, which isnt much better. On arrival in T1, I looked for the ""In Transit"" signs or directions to any sort of ""Transit"" desk or information. There was none. I walked for what seemed miles, looking for some sort of information or advice on how to proceed. The flight information board didn't show my connecting flight either so I had no way of knowing where to go or which terminal I should be looking for. The information desk was unmanned. Eventually I found a young lady who was on a security checkpoint. She advised me that I should make my way via shuttle bus to Terminal 5. Having done so, I then stood for 11/2 hours at security before I reached the gates only to find that there were no flights form my carrier (United). Again, I spent ages trying to find someone to speak to for information. Eventually I found a woman pushing a trolly. She advised me that I should be at T1 as that's where United fly from. By now my 3hr transit window had all but gone. I returned to the shuttle bus and the Queue was over 200 people deep. I approached an official with a yellow jacket on who was supposedly in charge of the queue and explained I have an extrememly short connection, he refused to allow me on the bus and told me to join the end of the queue. I had no option but to barge through or I woould miss my flight. Eventually I made it back to T1 and through security AGAIN and eventually to my gate with 5 minutes to spare. Frustrated, harassed and sweating. An absolute disgrace! No information and some very unhelpful staff. I don't blame the young lady I spoke to at T1, it was not her job and she made an honest mistake but the rest of the staff where totally uninterested and rude."
24th June 2018,1,"""unorganized, chaotic, and hectic""
","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is the most unorganized, chaotic, and hectic airport I have ever been to. I have flown through Chicago twice - the first time my flight was delayed for 6 hours and I didn't get to DFW until 4am the next morning, and this time my flight was delayed 5 hours and then canceled. I slept on the airport floor and my flight was rebooked to next day making it a 21 hour layover when I was only supposed to have a 3 hour layover. Now we are sitting in the airplane waiting for departure but now we cannot take off from the gate until the gate agents tell us we can. We are currently 30 minutes past our departure time. I have never been more frustrated with an airline, an airport, or the customer service received. This airport needs some serious help with organization and efficiency."
22nd June 2018,2,"""can’t cater for passengers after 8pm""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at O’Hare Terminal 5 on Monday evening around 8pm after a long trip to get there. We were hoping to get through security and then sit and have a drink and a meal as our flight wasn’t till 11:40pm. By 8:30pm nearly all the shops, bars and restaurants were closing or closed and we couldn't find nowhere serving food. The one Hudson shop open had queues snaking around the shop continually and was the only place available to get any kind of food. The services were completely inadequate for a large airport! If you can’t cater for passengers after 8pm - don’t have any flights from this time."
23rd December 2021,1,"""nowhere near enough space or seating""","✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airport I have ever experienced in the USA. People are crammed into the departure gates like cattle as there is simply nowhere near enough space or seating. My pregnant wife was left sitting on the hard floor for hours while we waited, being stepped on and over the entire duration. With covid in full force, I felt very uncomfortable in this incedibly claustrophobic small space. I have never felt the need to review a single thing in the past but felt it was important to draw attention to the situation lax has allowed, leaving their passengers trapped, exposed and abused. Expand your airport or do not allow your airport to reach this capacity. This is unacceptable in today's social distance world and masks are not sufficient. Also, I feel it is worth mentioning that if you manage to find a spot to sit and eat, the food is beyond horrible."
2nd October 2021,1,"""Do not fly your pets through this airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  Do not fly your pets through this airport, especially if you're checking in. If the right people are not working, they'll refuse you a private room for screening, and make you wait at the normal security checkpoints. Theirs is super disorganized. They made us wait 15 minutes while holding our cats in our arms. After they let multiple people pass us without pets go, we asked when we would be able to go through. The person working the line got angry with us and said you're going last. We had to wait for a few too many more people out of their spite. You all just lost my business."
8th August 2021,1,"""the people who work there are uncaring and unhelpful""","Not Verified |  Dirty, no parking, smells like marijuana and the people who work there are uncaring and unhelpful. You are processed through from baggage to boarding like cattle. Even the LAPD assigned there for traffic duty are unprofessional. I watched as three of them in vests marked traffic control stood and cussed and gossiped while the traffic was mayhem. There are other airports in S. California, use them."
15th July 2021,1,"""LAX continues to be the worst airport""","✅ Trip Verified | LAX continues to be the worst airport. Coming back to travel after COVID and transmitting thru LAX was so disappointing. Not enough seats for passengers at the gate. Few bathrooms. Buses from regional planes instead of airjets. Terminals still not connected past security after twenty years, you have to take a bus or go out and back thru security if you change terminals. They should hire whoever made MSP awesome. I avoid this airport like a plague, very disappointed I had to connect thru here."
12th July 2021,1,"""Barely any places for people to sit""","Not Verified |  This is the worst airport ever - from my experience. Barely any places for people to sit and long lines all over the place. TSA workers are rude as anything here. They like to yell and talk to you in a condescending tone, like you're dumb - typical character. Their training must be to treat every individual like a threat. Always the worst part of my trips whenever visiting this city. Horrible signage on shuttles for car rentals as well - no thorough instructions posted like Vegas Airport."
29th June 2021,1,"""they will miss their flight due to this inefficiency""","Not Verified |  Reviewing for my sister and brother in law, who are in line trying to get to their plane. They were in CA to care for our 94 year old father, who was hospitalized, then recovering at home, not a vacation. The terminal was unable to handle the numbers of people, and there are two blocks lined up outside the terminal for checking baggage. Although they were at the airport hours early, they will miss their flight due to this inefficiency. They are now in another extremely long line at Special Services. There is no reason for this other than extreme inefficiency on the part of the airport, and the over-booking by American Airlines. Travel for family emergencies should never be this difficult."
23rd June 2021,8,"""Thank you so much for your efforts""","Not Verified |  This review is specifically for a woman who worked in over size baggage, Serena. Thank you so much for your efforts. This woman not only throes to find my children’s tickets information, but she personally ran with my kids and I to make our flight. She took my children to their seats I felt like we were in the movie home alone lol. I saw what our surroundings were and it was chaotic. Thank you for night just telling me to turn left turn a mother left and have a good day. You were amazing. My kids made their flight to see their grandparents today because of you. I hope you have a great day and I hope someone acknowledges you for your work."
11th May 2021,1,"""got to be the worst airport in the world""","✅ Trip Verified |  Literally the worst airport I have been to - barely any place to sit, dirty and literally just had 4 or 5 pathetic food joints (Panda Express, KFC etc.). If that was not enough, I have never had to deal with a more rude and uncouth staff than here. I was travelling with a couple of tech items and the rude lady at security started screaming (yes, screaming) contradictory instructions at me while I was simply getting everything on the trays. Later, while I was trying to remove and assemble my things from 4 trays after passing through security, I have another lady telling me thrice to stack up my trays. In which airport is that the job of a passenger? Every airport I have ever been to either uses belts that automatically stack these up or airport personnel do this manually. How is a passenger supposed to be stacking trays with hands full of expensive things that need to be repacked? Would recommend flying via SFO instead because LAX has got to be the worst airport in the world in every possible aspect."
9th May 2021,1,"""the worst airport I’ve experienced""","✅ Trip Verified | LA international airport is the worst airport I’ve experienced, seriously, in the world. And I’ve travelled to a lot of places. I felt the same way when I came through this airport about 5 years ago, but it was under construction of some kind so I assumed there was good reason. Nope, still appalling. No construction today but equally dismal. Shocking really, an embarrassment to America. Nowhere to sit other than the gates and a handful of dirty tables in a food course (7!) – and no plug points available for people needing to charge devices (well all apparently deliberately turned off), despite the obvious necessity), and no real food – all fast food, at absurdly exorbitant costs. I paid $20 for one fish taco (takeaway fast food) and a beer. As my first stop in my homeland after 3 years, I feel like getting on the next plane out again. Shame on you LA airport designers! Horrific. Then one is bombarded by continuous loud repetitive messaging from megaphones. Seriously, take a trip to Paris and learn a bit of class for pleasurable airport environment – that is, if you care about customer experience."
28th March 2021,1,"""The airport is even worse than it used to be""","Not Verified |  I have always avoided the LAX airport given how busy and lacking of services I have found in the past. Our flight was changed and rather than connecting through San Francisco we connected through LAX. The airport is even worse than it used to be. Extremely dirty, and run down. I am sure there are some Covid restrictions in play but this is the only airport to which I have traveled where almost all food establishments are closed. For the entire Alaska terminal there were just three very busy very dirty places in operation."
14th March 2021,1,"""rude and unhelpful behavior""","✅ Trip Verified | I am writing this because of the rude and unhelpful behavior that was portrayed. I was attempting to locate a bathroom and terminal 2, when I accidentally walked through the exit gate. I walked 15 feet into the hallway and realized my mistake. I did attempt to return through the gate and was stopped. I explained that I was trying to find the bathroom and I just got off a plane and was connecting to another. The security person wanted to look at my boarding pass so I showed it to her. She said this is not a boarding pass and would not let me return to the terminal. I said I just got off a plane and I am not going to go through security, I had to reprint my boarding pass, wait in line for tsa screening. I just made it back to my gate as it was boarding. No one was helpful. I was very very angry at the situation."
11th December 2020,1,"""LAX should not be open at all""","✅ Trip Verified | You haven't seen and experienced the worst part of this LAX airport. This is an update of the review I posted yesterday. I missed two consecutive days of flights at LAX because of Copa Airline's lack of communication, systems malfunction, and also the incompetency of the Copa Airline's rude staff at LAX airport. I now found out that my return flight for this trip that didn't happen has been mysteriously changed to a day earlier. I didn't make a request to change the return date because I never make it to the destination. I'm waiting until later today to get to the Copa counter to talk to someone there and make my request, so I do not understand how this happened. If this is the way LAX lets airlines conduct business LAX should not be open at all. "
10th December 2020,2,"""not enough seating for the crowd""","You haven't seen and experienced the worst part of this LAX airport. International terminal Tom Bradley gates 137+, where some of the Latin-American (Copa) airlines operate. They have three gates in a small area, it's overcrowded of people flying to different Latin American countries, no air flow, rude staff, nowhere to plug a phone, they literally had covered all the plugs. There is an area on the other side of the wall of the room that has tables but all the media plugs have been purposely covered, so no phone plugs. There is not enough seating for the crowd, I felt so bad for all the old people that were there, people were seating and laying on the floors, kids crying no place to seat. Nowhere close by to get something to drink or water and everything is overpriced. I heard an announcement over the speakers that said "" make sure to use the toilet before boarding because the bathrooms in the airplane are restricted"" we are talking of more than a few hours flinging. I got stuck at LAX from 8 pm to 7 am. I landed at LAX Gate 70 terminal 8 or 7 and I have to run about 1/2 mile to get to gate 137 where my connection was taking off to Panama and because Copa's airline systems were down for a moment and also the inefficiency of the staff, I lost my flight. I have to wait until 3 am to be able to talk to a Copa representative she did not help me to rebook. I asked her to cancel and credit the return flights from Panama and this person  told me that I didn’t need to cancel the flights. She said ""just don't show and the credit will be processed, but I didn’t believe her and I realized I was wasting my time talking to her so I’ll have to go to SFO airport and talk to someone else there. After all this, I didn't felt like traveling and went back home. It was hell so I quit and moved out of the area and booked myself a flight to go back to San Francisco the next morning. This is abusive and If this is the way that LAX airport management lets airlines and staff operate LAX should not operate at all. I have to mention and I won't forget that I asked a cleaning staff guy for directions of where to found a water fountain and he gave me one of his water bottles, that was nice. I felt better and I was able to sleep a bit in the airplane on the way to San Francisco."
19th October 2020,1,"""just unacceptable behavior""","Not Verified |  Worst experience I’ve ever had within the first 10 minutes of being here. Now let me preface this with a large thank you to those working under the circumstances of a pandemic. This is not easy work and I appreciate those who come to work everyday. I understand that many things have changed and are changing to accommodate COVID-19 mandates and regulations. With that being said, I am still a customer and expect a certain standard of customer service.  First we walk in and have already checked in online so no need to go to the kiosks. My father and I walk over to go through TSA. A gentleman asks to see our boarding pass. This ain’t where they scan the boarding pass by the way. So my father shows him his boarding pass on his phone and the gentleman walks away from us. A few seconds later he walks over to us and in a raised tone asks to see my boarding pass. So my father shows him my boarding pass on his phone. The gentleman proceeds to tell us in a raised and non-neutral tone that why would we think to not to shows the other pass. Okay, I get your point but isn’t it unprofessional to speak to people that way. AND you didn’t even look at the boarding pass. So we go in line, ignoring the guy still ranting to us and go to scan out boarding passes. The names were switched for our seats and were showing up wrong on the phone and his scanner. Instead of being patient and working with us to see what was wrong, he rolls his eyes and says “my computer says something different so I can’t let you pass”. Again, totally understand that is a rule that you must follow. However, there’s no need to roll your eyes because we are just as confused as you. We the. Go through TSA. What an absolute mess. Everything is so backed up by the continue to let people go through. So after you go through the scanner you need to wait in line AGAIN to get your belongings. And by wait in line I mean for 5 minutes. Doesn’t seem like a long time but ideally it should take one minute for my belongings to be checked after I have been scanned. There are workers standing around chatting it up instead of helping their coworkers. What kind of team is that? I just don’t understand what kind of place would allow their workers to speak to customers in those tones. Now, it’s not like we raised our voices first. I’m all for customer service employees to stand up for themselves when being disrespected. No one should have to put up with that. However, we never raised our voices or put blame onto the workers yet we were disrespected because? Don’t forget those workers who are doing their job. Especially with a pandemic, there’s no reason for extra people to just be standing around. You are increasing their risk and the risk of others. This is just unacceptable behavior."
11th October 2020,1,"""this airport has some serious issues""","Not Verified |  Don't fly in or out of here! This airport is a joke, and I’ve flown all around the country, by far this airport has some serious issues with pretty much everything. The terminals are being remodeled, so we got off and onto a bus that dropped us off at a door that then took us back into the airport to get extremely lost because, why would you put direction signs? Getting your car from the car rental is another chore that you get to wait for a bus to take you to. Don’t let me get started on that complete mess, no organization, poor customer service, it took us from the airport to actually getting the car over an hour! On our departure, we got dropped off at the bottom level baggage claim by our lovely, being so sarcastic here, car rental bus driver. Again, no signs of directions to anything! Finally figuring things out on our own, because apparently no one works here at 6 am, getting through TSA was pure hell! I’ve never been talked down to, yelled at, or felt like I was doing something wrong, this is exactly how I felt the entire experience going through TSA. It really solidified me never flying into or out of LAX ever again. Fly into Long Beach of John Wayne Orange County."
15th April 2020,1,"""Worst airport I have experienced in the USA""",Not Verified |  Worst airport I have experienced in the USA. Endless mazes to walk through when entering from international. Dirty. Crowded. Staff yelling at people and this was at 6am. Avoid this airport. I saw signs that 1.2 billion was being spent to modernize - will it be enough? Door alarms repeated sounded and many people had to cover their ears. I gave an overall rating of 1 - I did make the connection (barely) and got through the place but it was an unpleasant experience all around.
14th March 2020,1,"""Avoid this airport like the plague""","Not Verified |  Complete dump. Falling apart, stinks, and the workers are absolutely incompetent. Avoid this airport like the plague. Makes me never want to fly again"
24th February 2020,2,"""airport is very out of date""","Not Verified |  This airport is very out of date, it is impossible to find where you’re going because of the poor signage. The sidewalks are so narrow and you have to walk outside of the airport because it is under construction, there is nowhere to sit in the terminal, the staff are not helpful or friendly and the food is ridiculously overpriced."
23rd February 2020,1,"""poorly managed by airport staff""","Not Verified |  My goodness the worst airport experience ever. Queues, queues and more queues, two hours nearly missed my flight. Shouted, herded and poorly managed by airport staff. Not a good advert for hospitality for a visitor. If travelling to NZ again I will not be going to LAX. I would advise anybody transiting through to think twice. I have nothing positive to comment about the experience within LAX airport. If I could give zero for queuing and staff below I would do so."
14th February 2020,1,"""Endless queues, complete chaos""","✅ Trip Verified | Hell on earth is the only way to describe the passport control. Endless queues, complete chaos, no one offering any assistance other than yelling orders. Will avoid flying into LAX at all costs in future."
7th February 2020,1,"""I missed my connecting flight ""","✅ Trip Verified | If you are not a US or Canadian citizen, you are made to queue in the one and only queue for transit / arrival. The staff/officers on the ground are rude and are not helpful at all. I checked with 4 different officers, that I have a connecting flight in 2 hours and my visa type is L2. I was just told with a loud voice ""I said, all passengers in one queue"". Result: I had to wait in the queue, go to the kiosk, enter my details which only indicated that the kiosk does not accept L2 visa and I need to continue to go to the customs queue (what a waste of time!). And then the customs queue again was one single queue (All visa types, all transiting passengers). I missed my connecting flight and had to wait 6 hours for the next flight. Had even one officer said, your Visa goes directly to the customs queue or if there was clear signage, it would have saved 6 hours of my life! Safe to say, for a passenger the airport staff is the first contact with the country. And LAX is failing miserably at representing the USA. If someone from the airport is reading this review, you only need the following queues at immigration: 1) US and Canadian citizens --> Use the dedicated mobile passport area (no queuing required) 2) One queue for Transit cardholders (to a country outside the US) 3) One queue for connecting flight (within the US) boarding pass holders 4) One queue for people actually immigrating It will only make passengers but also your life easier. One thing is for sure, I'm not transiting from LAX ever again."
2nd February 2020,1,"""Customer service is non existent""",✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely terrible place to fly in or out of. Customer service is non existent. Incredibly rude to all passengers. Joking about coronavirus as we are getting off a flight from Asia and yet not one of them smart enough to wear a mask. Will pay whatever extra money it cost to never come back to this dump again!
15th January 2020,2,"""the most inefficient time consuming process""",✅ Trip Verified | This is by far the most inefficient time consuming process for catching a taxi or Lyft! I travel all the time to various airports and what a joke! It took 45 min to get to the point to even catch a car! The worst ever!
14th January 2020,2,"""there was no clear signage"" ","Not Verified |  I was on my way to pick up my roommate from Southwest Terminal. Since I am new to living in LA, I didn’t know it was Terminal 1. Took my 40 min to drive 10 miles and when I got to the terminal there was no clear signage that stated where to pick up arrivals. I called my friend and while I was on the phone with her, within 10 seconds, an airport cop told me to keep driving and go all the way around to pick her up. He knew very well that it’d take me another 30-40 min to do that. I responded “my friend is right there!” as she was walking towards us. Within a minute, he decides to write me a $100 ticket. I’ve been in NY all my life - been to JFK, LGA and other airports. Never In my life have I received a ticket at an airport. A minute cost me $100. I was devastated. This guy was seriously just being a jerk."
13th January 2020,4,"""This is not a 21st century airport""","Not Verified |  Almost one hour spent in a car rental shuttle to get to my terminal and it is not my first bad experience. All major airports in the US and even smaller ones across the world have an air train system that ease congestion and reduce pollution. Why not LAX? This is not a 21st century airport, far from it. Please elect the people who want to make a change to this place!"
7th January 2020,1,"""wont be getting a transit through LAX ever again""","Not Verified |  I've been through quite a few airports now and this has to be the worst airport ever. I got a transit from London through to Auckland here, and I spent nearly 3 hours getting through all the different checks and security, just to get back on to the same plane, to take me to Auckland. Safe to say I wont be getting a transit through LAX ever again."
7th January 2020,2,"""we were stuck in standstill traffic""",✅ Trip Verified | This is the third time I have had to get out of my Uber over a mile from the airport and walk with my bags to the airport because we were stuck in standstill traffic. This is a ridiculous and appalling standard for what is meant to be one of the biggest international airports in the USA. I know the reason is that they're building a train but this should have been done years ago and having your customers walk for 30 minutes with their bags or risk missing their flights is not an option. They have largely solved the Arrivals traffic issue by having the rideshare cars now pick up at LAX-it - why not do the same for the Departures?
5th January 2020,1,"""LAX is hopelessly jammed with traffic""","✅ Trip Verified | LAX is hopelessly jammed with traffic, but worse, is the fact that they removed 95% of their seating outside the security entry points. Imagine flying from abroad into LAX, having to go through customs with your bags, but not being able to check your bags for the flight out to wherever you live, as the flight leaves more than 4 hours from arrival. You are stuck outside the security checkpoints, yet have no place to sit, except on the concrete floors. (I was told the reason is that the 100s of homeless people took all the seating, so they removed it!)."
17th December 2019,1,"""Absolute farce""",Not Verified |  Absolute farce. Why do transit passengers have to go through the 3! stages of passport control just to board their original plane? Passport control staff were (quote) “at the end of shift” and were more focussed on leaving work than getting the backlog of passengers through. Eventually transit passengers were “fastracked “ through with a simple stamp. Why can’t this be done in the first place? 2 hr layover - 5 minutes to get to the gate after passport control. Ridiculous.
16th December 2019,3,"""Worst 4 hour layover ever""",✅ Trip Verified | Worst 4 hour layover ever. I landed at 12:40am and my next flight isn’t until 6am. The temperature in the terminal is so cold my joints ache after sitting here for 4 hours. It’s maybe 50 degrees. There are approx 10 other people here and everyone is freezing. Turn on some heat!
14th December 2019,2,"""I had to sit on the concrete ground""",Not Verified |  The Delta terminal is awful! Not one place to sit if you are waiting for someone. No one wants to help either! DO not fly Delta into LAX. I flew in and waited for my daughter to fly in 2 hours after me. I had to sit on the concrete ground.
12th December 2019,2,"""in need of a serious upgrade""","Not Verified |  Entered LAX on the way in from Melbourne Via Auckland and again from Cancun to LAX, not a lot has changed since last year, still found this airport in need of a serious upgrade and adjusting of a few attitudes, sure your airport is busy, however there is no reason to be rude to people, we are bringing in money to your country. I still find it hard to believe if you are in America you go through a different line, can anyone tell me why? I do sense that this airport is under staffed, every time I fly to the USA I Dred going through LAX customs. Another hint for your departure, put clear signs up for what you want, shoes off, computers out ECT, we are not mind readers and it is stressful enough with lining up for hours to get to your destination."
6th December 2019,1,"""TSA staff were all extremely rude""","This is the worst airport. The TSA staff were all extremely rude. I was returning from an international flight when I was stopped because of a bottle of olive oil (under 3 liters) in my bag. Without unwrapping the bag to see the size two TSA agents told me I could either go to the back and check it or throw it. I told them it was 100ml (under the max amount), the female TSA continued to argue and said it didn’t matter. I gave up and said throw it. I watched as the male TSA finally unwrapped the bottle and realized it was okay for me to take. I watched as 4 TSA agents passed the bottle around laughing. When they noticed me watching he walked over and said he didn’t realize I was waiting for it and gave it back to me. Awful and very rude. I would gladly pay extra to fly out of any other airport."
23rd November 2019,1,"""the worst airport available in the USA""",Not Verified |  Absolute garbage. Bring back the Uber’s and cabs to pick up area. There is absolutely no one with any intelligence in charge of designing the customers experience at the airport. Hands down the worst airport available in the USA.
22nd November 2019,2,"""Horrible outdated airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible outdated airport. We always dread flying in and out of LAX. The airport is confusing, busy, outdated and dirty. Not to mention very unpleasant to look at and lacy of amenities. Do yourself a favor the avoid LAX whenever possible and drive the extra distance to another airport."
20th November 2019,10,"""the TSA was terrific""","Not Verified | For all of the bad press they receive, I have to say my experience with the TSA was terrific. Because I have metal implants, I needed a body scan machine. The nice man walked me over to the machine, held my phone while I went through and then walked me back to my husband. He was terrific. Thank you, TSA for keeping us safe."
14th November 2019,1,"""Airport is too crowded""","Not Verified |  This Airport is too crowded, it took us 1 hour to arrive at terminal 7. Then there is no parking spot. We had a flight at 9.30, we left our home at 5.00 am and arrived at 7.00 in LAX but unfortunately took us another 1 hour to reach terminal 7, we missed our flight because we weren't able to check in before 1 hour, we were late by 10 min and then I talked to customer service who wasn't very helpful and was just showing an attitude and replying that no you can't get on that flight. I'm sure there is always a way to take care of your customers."
6th November 2019,1,"""a complete and total disaster""",Not Verified |  The new ride share and taxi pickup lot is a complete and total disaster. It is the Fyre Festival of transportation. Everyone that is involved in its planning and implementation should be shot into outer space. It is one of the most comprehensive expressions of failure I have ever witnessed.
4th November 2019,1,"""can’t get a taxi at the curb""","Not Verified | World's worst airport. You can’t get a taxi at the curb, you have to walk or shuttle to a funnelled location and stand in line for 30-minutes and then fight with traffic trying to leave cause everyone is funnelled to one location. Ridiculous that you can’t get a yellow cab curbside. Uber and Lyft (discount providers) should be the only ones that have to be outside the airport. Tack on an extra 45 mins for commute time just to get in a car and out of the airport."
23rd October 2019,3,"""Severe traffic congestion""","Not Verified |  Severe traffic congestion at 10pm. Emerging from Freeway 105 will take you an hour or so to World Way street. The road leading to the terminals are inadequate to handle the private cars, shuttles, taxis, buses, etc. Make serious time adjustment before departure or else you will miss your flight."
22nd October 2019,5,"""Arrival into TBIT not too onerous""",Not Verified |  Arrival into TBIT was not too onerous overall but beware if your departure from TBIT is from gate 138 or thereabouts as these are described as bus gates. The whole part of that building was bus station like with only one small shop. It was very much amateur hour that evening on gate 138 because the check in staff had been looking without success for a bus coordinator for the last 90 minutes. No bus coordinator equals no bus!. We eventually boarded a bus and were taken out to a remote stand (not BAs fault as they were also keen to point out). Then we had to walk up a series of ramps to board the aircraft. Terminal 4 at this airport is a lot nicer overall.
19th October 2019,3,"""this has to be the worst""","✅ Trip Verified |  Been through many airports and this has to be the worst, check in and security were excellent, but terminal 2 is tiny, very limited seating, expensive and limited food, no lounges you can purchase, just Delta and Virgin clubhouses. Terminal is a stretch, it’s just a gate! Never want to use it again, and we are only in it for 3hrs!"
20th September 2019,1,"""grossest departure spots""",✅ Trip Verified | They give us one of the grossest departure spots ever seen. It smelt so bad and was very dirty. I mean gross. They give you poor choices for food and they cram you in like sardines. Barely anywhere to sit. I give it ten thumbs down if I had ten thumbs. I don’t know why we give them a good area. I guess that's why we're one of the best countries on earth.
8th September 2019,1,"""This airport is a joke""","Not Verified |  I've been holding this rant in long enough, I'm gonna let it out. LAX is the world's fourth busiest airport. I was there for 12 hours. No people-movers, you have to walk for miles. No grocery stores like in France. No bars. No vending machines. I spent the first six hours trying to find a place to charge my phone. There are a few outlets next to the restrooms, but they were all taken. This is the worst airport I've ever been to. The last six hours were spent trying to find a place to sit! This airport is a joke. I've been to many, many airports and this is the least passenger-friendly airport I've ever been to. Rant over."
6th September 2019,3,"""What a dump""","Not Verified |  What a dump. I have travelled for the last twenty years across many continents but LAX is one of the worst airports I have been through. No signage, limited elevators (required when travelling with kids), unhelpful staff (with exception of immigration) and severe congestion. Avoid if you can. An unwelcome welcome into a great country."
20th August 2019,1,"""difficult to know where to park""","Not Verified |  LAX is the worst airport I have ever used. I was there to pick up a passenger arriving on KLM from Amsterdam. It was difficult to know where to park. It was impossible to know where to meet arrivals. We were sent by an employee to Terminal 2. It was a very long walk from Terminal B, where it turned out we should have been to meet the passenger. There was very inadequate signage. Non-existent information with current arrivals and flight time. Very unfriendly employees. We are both in our 80’s. Not enough seats. Physically grueling. We needed a wheelchair and one was not available. This was a terrible experience."
18th August 2019,1,"""Queue after queue""","✅ Trip Verified |  Landing, to walking out the airport, was around 2 hours 15 mins. 15 mins waiting for a slot to alight us. 2 hours (no joke) to get through passport control and baggage reclaim. Baggage reclaim was 10 mins and only because the oversized baggage guy didn’t have a clue or certainly didn’t want to help. The convoluted entry system, really?? That’s no way to treat people, non US citizens or not. It’s disgusting. Queue after queue, long and slow. Hang your heads is shame. To be fair, outside of the oversized baggage guy, the staff were good; embarrassed but good."
12th August 2019,5,"""No proper seating available""","NotVerified |  No proper seating available. Terminal 3 is very small. Seating arrangements are very uncomfortable with a lot of people sleeping on the floor. Only 2 to 3 food chains available, hard to find vegetarian food. Staff are supportive. Wifi is disconnected often."
31st July 2019,1,"""treated with such disrespect""","Not Verified |  On Tuesday, July 29th 2019, at 1:24PM, while picking up my husband (in my car), at Delta Terminal 3F Arrivals, an officer vaguely motioned to me. In confusion, I pulled over and asked for clarification and direction. Within 10 seconds, my husband entered the car, but I noticed the officer noted my plates. Still in confusion, I asked the officer what he was trying to tell me in motioning. He refused to explain but told me I would be getting a ticket. He refused to provide his last name. This, with a very smug attitude, leaving me in further confusion, now in stress. What was he motioning to me? Why was he noting my plates? Why did he say he was ticketing me? Why wouldn’t he explain? Why was he so smug and disrespectful? I've never been so confused, stressed, and treated with such disrespect. I'll be escalating this issue until an explanation is provided and an apology is granted."
27th July 2019,5,"""heavy traffic""","✅ Trip Verified | All international terminals at major airports are busy during peak hours of departure or arrival. These are my specific complaints about my July 24, 2019 flight out of Bradley Terminal at LAX: cell phone service stopped working the moment I entered the aircraft, flights were delayed getting in line for departure due to LAX's heavy traffic."
5th July 2019,1,"""6th worst airport design in the US""","✅ Trip Verified | A simple search shows LAX being ranked as the 6th worst airport design in the US, this doesn’t surprise me. It’s like do we just keep kicking the can down the road or overhaul this hell hole. Has the worst parts of Philly airport, taking busses between terminal transfers, but none of the good things. I get this place was planned out way back in the day but get with the program, maybe they can’t overhaul LAX because Cali is bankrupt, who knows. Can the architects and planners take a trip to Atlanta please, when you go bring your notepad."
26th June 2019,1,"""trash and food everywhere""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta has two terminals which are specific to your flight, yet the receipt to the flight did not specify what terminal which I find irresponsible and uninformative. Then on top of our flight being delayed 2 hours and 45 minutes without a reason why, we were forced to wait near the terminals where there was about 1/3 of the seating as there were people in the terminals. Tons of empty space there could have been seating installed. Floors absolutely disgusting with trash and food everywhere on top of broken down restrooms. By far the most awfully designed and maintained terminal I've ever had to wait in my life, including 3rd world countries I've traveled to and from that were more nice than this. This place should be shut down especially for how greedy they are with flight prices on top of every single flight I've booked this month being delayed and only one being from an actual weather issue which I understand is out of the airports control and didn't make a fuss about. However, now its like they're simply taking advantage of the people not having any other option to traveling in most cases."
2nd June 2019,1,"""These guys could not be more rude""","Not Verified |  Every airport I’ve been to in every state in every country has been better than LAX except for Newark. Newark is the worst but LAX is a close second. TSA is usually at least ambilavent with their attitude but slow always. There is never enough chairs in the terminal, I usually sit on the floor. Much worse though, is the attendants outside who shoo away people trying to pick up their loved ones. These guys could not be more rude about this literally every single time. The power goes to their heads in such a pathetic way. I’m waiting for my mom and he asks me to go all the way around again, but I can see her she’s just zipping up a bag and this guy starts writing my license plate number down and taking pictures of me. Even when you do move like they want you to, they will just harass you again when you come back around. They act like you came to the airport just to annoy them and there is no necessity for their job. I feel bad because they do just want to keep the line moving but I’ve never seen the arrivals get that cramped that they need this weird pickup queue gustappo."
25th May 2019,3,"""unhelpful and very poorly organised""","Not Verified |  We found this airport to be unhelpful and very poorly organised. We arrived with a reasonable amount of time to met our connecting flight. We arrived at the at immigration to find a huge very slow moving queue. They only had about a quarter of the booths open and no one wanted to help us at all. It took 1.5 hours to be processed. We asked several staff if they could help us get to our flight on time and not one person offered any help at all. There was no one to help us get from terminal B to 6 so had to run, which is no mean feat when you are in your 70s. We later found out there is a shuttle which no one told us about. We made our plane but only after member of the public let ups jump the xray queue. On our return trip through your airport we found the signage difficult and at no stage could we find directions to shuttles. This time we were on terminal 7 going to B. We took the wrong option and walked all the way. There is so much you could do to improve your service and I hope that by our next experience things may have changed. For goodness sake fully man you immigration booths when you have so many aircraft arriving."
15th May 2019,3,"""only has barstool style seating""
","Not Verified |  Because of my ridiculous 13 hour layover I couldn't check my bags until 6 hours before my departure. Unfortunately the area of the airport that you can access with bags that still need to be checked only has barstool style seating, or you could just sit on the ground. I have a bad hip. So you know how much it hurts to have to either sit on barstool type chairs, which are really high, or sit on the ground, which is really low, when you have a bad hip? Obviously not or you'd put some regular chairs in somewhere for your handicapped, but not handicapped enough to want to be embarrassed by using a wheelchair when you don't need to, customers. Oh and maybe fix your WiFi so it works in the bathrooms."
15th May 2019,1,"""has no notion of efficiency""","We touched down at 8pm and it was another 45 minutes before I could set foot in the terminal building. This is a massive airport that has no notion of efficiency. I only had cabin luggage, but even then, from entering the terminal until getting a cab took another twenty minutes. Few airports in the world are so inefficient and poorly designed."
14th May 2019,1,"""overwhelming incompetency""
","✅ Trip Verified | Oh, where to start. I've been through Riyadh airport (apparently the worst in the world) during a blackout and had a better experience than transiting through LAX. Twice. Both times 4 hour layover, first transit waited for almost 3 hours at immigration and had to run to make my flight. About a third of fellow passengers missed their connections. There were 3 or 4 officers checking passports and another 15 or so mall cops standing around barking orders and generally being unhelpful. Return trip, went through immigration in about 15 minutes but was then told by three seperate employees to go to the wrong terminal. The last was 'Information' desk who told me, with rather shameless dismissiveness, not to worry that my flight wasnt on the departure board. Then went through security to find, surprise, surprise, I was in the worng terminal. There is no information desk airside, eventually had to accost some maintenance workers who kindly made some calls to direct me to the correct terminal. Why this was so hard is incompletely beyond comprehension. Note, I had checked in at the time if my first leg, so gate details were not on my boarding pass. Eventually got to the gate to find people flayed across the ground - for some reason the gate had no seats. By this stage the overwhelming incompetency became comical and I had a good laugh. There were another few terrible encounters with outright obnoxious staff at LAX which on another day I would have cared more about. Allow at least 4 hours for transit and also meditate or pray beforehand (depending on your disposition). I would say avoid but unfortunately there aren't many options."
13th May 2019,3,"""customer service non-existent""","Not Verified |  Very bad, layout is not good, customer service non-existent, security was rude and talked about inappropriate things out loud. Had to deal with incredibly rude people while trying to figure out that my terminal was 10min away and I had to walk outside while everyone is arriving or leaving which was chaos. Shocked by this experience after coming from Heathrow airport."
9th May 2019,9,"""I think this is an excellent airport""
","Not Verified |  A lot of the reviews for LAX here are harsh and exaggerated. Personally I think this is an excellent airport, especially the Tom Bradley Terminal. I flew in from Sydney on April 15 and was through immigration and customs in less than 10 minutes. For those of you thinking that was a lucky fluke, this was not my first time getting through this airport quickly on arrival, despite numerous other international flights arriving around the same time (6am). The staff were all courteous. I admit the other terminals need some work and the traffic is bad but they are doing a lot of construction. Orlando and JFK remain the worst airports in the US. LAX and DFW are both excellent."
2nd May 2019,1,"""only worthy of condemnation""","✅ Trip Verified | Joe Biden once compared decaying Airports in the US pretty similar to 3rd World Countries. Ladies & Gentlemen : Exhibit A The Los Angeles Airport A 3rd World, 3rd Class Airport. LAX got its last renovation back in 1984 when the Olympics were in town. Thats about 35 years ago! That is the type of vibe Los Angeles Airport has. The Airport that time forgot. One of the major paradoxes in the world is that Los Angeles gets more visitors than practically anywhere else in the world. Fourth to be Exact for this year. And yet it is an International embarrassment to walk to one and through one. This is even far more true for domestic travels. Yes, I'm pretty sure Joe Biden flew into LAX and that is when he famously is quoted for ""Some of these Airports we have here in the US are 3rd world in class."" There is nothing in these Airports you will ever take your camera and pose with. And that - is tragically - pathetic. How do you spell LAX? P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C. You have Hollywood right here. Legions of iconic celebrities. Monroe. Hepburn. James Dean. Legions of classy world class photographs and you see not one anywhere in this sorry excuse of an airport. How bad Los Angeles Airport is, it a testimony to how pathetic the city's leaders are. No vision. No Class. Just like their airport. A 3rd World Airport. I was here, unfortunately, just this month in April for a flight out with United. Dear God, will someone take a photo of this horror - this sorry excuse for an Airport - and put it next to photos from the Airport in Munich, Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore or anywhere else in the world. Suffice it to say, Los Angeles Airport - for a world class destination - is firmly cemented in a 3rd world class reputation. If you can avoid the LAX Los Angeles Airport - do so - it is like a Plague. Its not like me to criticize without offering resolutions. Disney. Universal Studios. Have them sponsor a renaissance into the world of tomorrow. Have them foot the bill sponsoring something more World Class than 3rd class, 3rd world class, only worthy of condemnation, by the likes of Vice President Joe Biden."

16th April 2019,1,"""Food choices really bad""","✅ Trip Verified | Food choices really bad. KFC had a a massive queue and didn't stock much choice at all. So I went over to the Mexican restaurant and made an order, then seated at a table; eventually a waitress turned up and asked if I'd ordered - she seemed angry about the fact that my reply was: 'yes I think I have'. 'Did you pay?' 'No, not yet - I was...'. '- then you haven't ordered' - was her interruption, given at such volume most of the customers looked up. I left very quickly to avoid further conflict with an angry, rude waitress. Nowhere else left to eat. Let me out of here asap."
10th April 2019,1,"""overcrowded, dirty and noisy""","Not Verified |  Delta terminal at LAX was overcrowded, dirty and noisy. I felt like it was entering a germy toxic atmosphere. The bathrooms were terrible, people had nowhere to sit, loudspeakers were loud because of crowding. People were getting anxious. I felt there wasn’t enough security or services for handicapped. More help was needed to cleanup! I will avoid going to LAX. Get it together guys!"
29th March 2019,4,"""Gate area totally inadequate""","Not Verified | Flew Delta Airlines DTW-LAX 03/22 and LAX-DTW 03/25. Both flights used Terminal 3: Arriving - Landed and to gate within 5 minutes and left airport within 30 minutes (including stop at baggage claim). I consider that a successful journey, so no complaints. Departing - Gate area is totally inadequate for the number of flights arriving/departing. I would say there's seating for roughly 1/4 of passengers, with most standing wherever possible. In addition, the eating options are very limited. It was an unpleasant two hours. However, I will say that TSA Pre-check took less than five minutes and everyone we encountered was courteous."
25th March 2019,3,"""crowded, dirty and poorly planned""","Not Verified | We are elderly and I use a cane. I have been diagnosed with severe degenerative disk disease and cannot walk very far at a time. We set out from a domestic terminal at one end of the airport to the international terminal. We had our suitcases in a cart and kept asking employees which way to go. When we reached the end of the building, I asked a group of chatting employees how to reach the international terminal for our flight to Singapore. The female of the group said to go outside and walk about ten minutes and we would be there. She could see my cane, there is no doubt we are elderly and that my husband was pushing a large cart of four suitcases. I asked if that was the only way since it was raining outside and she smiled and said yes. She gave us no indication that there are shuttle buses for travelers so we started walking. It might be 10 minutes for a young person, but it took us at least 30 minutes. Time was not a problem, exhaustion was. We finally made it to the international terminal where there are very few seats...maybe one per 50 passengers. Our airline counter was not yet open so we stood and waited as seats became available. After a couple of hours, I needed to find a restroom which was a very long walk from where we were. No seats and no restrooms. Once we checked in, we were told that it was a very long way to our gate. That was an understatement. Our airline, Singapore Airlines, was the last gate at the farthest end of that terminal. We walked and rested and walked and rested. We were passed up by many carts carrying people. How are you supposed to get a cart? I had asked before we flew if we could get them and was told you just had to happen upon them. We never did, but others sure did. Later I realized that many people waited at the plane upon exiting and the carts were brought to them yet I was told this could not be done for us. The capper to all of this was when we were finally allowed to board, we were taken out into the rain and very strong wind to a bus, from the bus, we climbed stairs onto our plane. I felt like I was back in primitive 1970s Iran. Upon our return, we had a very tight connection and had to get from the international terminal to a domestic terminal. The first employee I saw when we deplaned was a nice man who handed us two orange express connection passes. We took those and rushed for our baggage so we could go thru customs before boarding a domestic flight. We thought those passes would help, but they served no purpose whatsoever. We went to the back of the line just like everyone else. They would have signs directing us to the express connection lines, but they were no faster than regular lines. At least this time I found a kind employee who told us there were shuttle buses we could take to the domestic terminal. That was very helpful, but we rushed as fast as we could and were told there was no way we could make our flight. We will never go thru LAX again. Why no help for disabled travelers? Why do you have to go outside to another terminal? Visit Changi airport in Singapore to see a truly amazing airport. They have lounges you can sleep on, free foot massage machines, clean restrooms, lots of seating, helpful employees and even a nature walk. Even the tiny airport in Dunedin, NZ, is better organized and cleaner than LAX. LAX is crowded, dirty and poorly planned. I consider it the slum of airports and I've seen some pretty pathetic ones in the Middle East."
28th February 2019,1,"""Staff were extremely unhelpful and rude""
","Not Verified |    Worst airport ever. Staff were extremely unhelpful and rude. My wife missed her connecting flight because of tarmac delays when she landed, and was a nightmare to change her flight. 2 different people working for the airline shrugged and didn't know what to say when she asked how to go about getting on another flight. She didn't know her way around LAX very well and when asking employees of the airport and airlines, they acted like they didn't have time for her. I will never fly to this airport again. John Wayne will be where I go, even if it is out of my way. If you plan on flying to LAX and have a connecting flight, good luck."
21st February 2019,7,"""really easy and very accessible""",✅ Trip Verified | The airport is located in a great location which makes it close to everything. The check in is really easy and very accessible. The security might take a little while. Inside the airport is really nice with plenty of stores and restaurants. Of course everything is quite expensive but as in other airport.
21st February 2019,1,"""Terrible airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Terrible airport! The assistant staffs at the immigration Zone who dress in red are rude! All the staffs including the immigration officer work terribly slow, it had been like that for so many years but never ever tried to improve. Definitely not a city that welcome the tourists to visit! I wouldn’t choose it as my transit stop in the future! Or else you just prepare to wait for 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours just to get through the immigration, bearing with their bad attitude."
5th February 2019,1,"""we deserve to be treated better""","✅ Trip Verified |   The airport lady personnel at the exit after baggage claim was very rude. It was not busy when we arrived Feb 5, 2019, 7:30am so after almost 25 hours travel time we were walking slowly and she said ""move faster, what are you afraid of?"". Then the male personnel at the customs was also rude when he pointed us to the secondary inspection. He said ""go to letter a, don’t you know letter aaaaaaa?"" We are Filipino American professional friends who vacationed together and we are slower but not dumb. We understand the letter a. We were treated way better in other international airports and to be treated this way by our fellow Americans is just unacceptable. The screening of our bags did not produce any ""banned items"" like they ""expected"" coming from the Philippines. We came from Incheon airport and I accidentally forgot to eat a fully wrapped individual banana and the male personnel made it appear a intentionally committed ""crime"". He asked for my passport back and obviously typed something on the computer. When I asked what’s with the passport, he said ""what we do with your passport is none of your business"". What a rude response. There should be a major overhaul of airport personnnel training in customer service and emphasize that we pay for airport services and indirectly their salaries and we deserve to be treated better."
5th February 2019,1,"""Avoid this awful place""","Not Verified |  Rudest employees of any company I have ever met in all my years. I've had interactions with over 20 airport employee's (TSA, food service, others) and haven't heard the words please or thank all day. All employees have a staring problem. If you ask an employee for help of anykind be ready to receive the wrong directions and be ready to figure out the problem for yourself. Avoid this awful place at all costs."
2nd February 2019,2,"""has got to be the worst terminal""","Not Verified |    Terminal 4, 01 Feb 2019. This has got to be the worst terminal I have ever been through. Very frequent business traveler. Poor seating. Poor food choices. And one, yes one (1) working restroom from gates 40 to 49. The terminal is packed. Tempers are getting heated. The data signal here is non-existent, a slow wifi is your only connectivity. This the best you can do LAX? You should be ashamed!"
1st February 2019,2,"""awful ordeal""","Not Verified |  Horrible transit experience in LA on 18th January. I have travelled this route several times over the last few years and never experienced quite such lengthy and convoluted queues for Immigration. We reached the automatic scanning machines reasonably quickly but then were made to join another queue which spiralled around the arrivals hall, it took 2 hours to reach the manned desk where we were obliged to undergo repeat fingerprint and photography. Why twice for passengers who are only waiting for a plane to be serviced during a 2 hour transit? All that our airline staff could do was to call out that the plane would wait for us! I was then subjected to aggressive questioning around the item which I was legitimately carrying as documented, checked in luggage safely stowed in the hold of the aircraft. Officers threatened that they would unload my luggage for inspection and I would be forced to miss my flight. My passports were confiscated during this process and I was made to wait on the border with no id documents. Three officers discussed this between themselves, none of them asked me for the documentation and I was treated like a criminal. When their supervisor finally arrived after about 20 minutes of this she instructed them to let me go and board the plane which was by this time waiting for me. I sincerely hope don't have to go through this awful ordeal again."
21st January 2019,2,"""the signage was dreadful""","Not Verified |  The airport was dingy, the signage was dreadful, most of the staff were unfriendly and very abrupt, I don't think I saw a smile from any of the airport staff, the general system for organising and directing passengers was a shambles. The experience was rather like entering a third world country. This is the second time I have traveled through LA airport and I am not impressed. I would like to say this not a reflection on the American People, who generally I find extremely friendly and helpful, including the excellent LA police department. It is a shame that visiting such a delightful part of America is spoilt by such an awful experience."
17th January 2019,1,"""Another bad experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Another bad experience in this State of the Art Airport due to horrible employees, misinformed or possibly just stupid. Bathroom was worse than Lima, Peru. Start hiring people who actually care and people might change attitudes regarding this dump. 2 out of 5 stars is not anything to be proud of. This is my 5th time here in a year and my 3rd bad review. The other 2 times I didn't have enough battery on my phone and there wasn't a charging station or plug in working at the gate."
20th December 2018,1,"""airport was disappointing""","Not Verified |  To say this airport was disappointing would be an understatement. International arrivals is a complete cluster. Luggage transfer was a real joy. Why they have a ramp going up makes no sense other than makeing it more difficult for families, elderly and anyone who may have difficulty moving their luggage. Signage is awefull. Good luck finding which way you need to go and employees are no help other than saying keep moving. TSA was a real joy as well. No communication skills at all. Xray machine broke and instead of letting us know they had started moving our stuff to another line we were all just standing around looking at each other wondering whats going on. Little to no seating in the gate areas. I fly quite often for work and this has to be one of the worst. Will definitely try and avoid in the future."
16th December 2018,4,"""so congested""",Not Verified | This airport is such a disappointment. It’s so congested and not much seats to sit. I really don’t like transiting through LAX. Too hectic. This was my first trip into Lax since 2000 and I can see why I would avoid this airport again.
16th November 2018,1,"""it is getting worse""
","✅ Trip Verified | This is without a doubt the worst international airport that I have ever traveled to and it is getting worse each time I visit. The staff are incredibly rude, unfriendly and poorly trained. The queues are ridiculously long and the environment is appalling."
13th November 2018,2,"""horrible unfriendly airport""","✅ Trip Verified | What a horrible unfriendly airport. Arrived on a domestic flight (QF12) from New York directly into international departures area. Told to go to Level 1. There are no directions to luggage retrieval. No signs to ""Arrivals"". No help desks. Police sent us the wrong way. Eventually ended up on level 1 and could not get to the luggage carousels because they are in secure area. Eventually found our luggage unattended sitting in a public area beside a small conveyor belt. So much for security. Lucky our bags were not destroyed! LAX needs to get together with Qantas and sort out this shambles"
11th November 2018,5,"""too small, cramped and claustrophobic""","✅ Trip Verified | There is really only one major problem with LAX airport: it is much too small, cramped and claustrophobic, in fact. This is the historical result of politics and N.I.M.B.Y.ism. I have used this airport many times, and the staff have generally been patient and courteous. The prices for food services do amount to gouging, but this is normal for airports and LAX is by no means one of the worst offenders."
3rd October 2018,5,"""extremely expensive""","✅ Trip Verified | I am disabled and needed to get something to eat. The wheelchair assist people dumped me at the gate and I had to beg to get someone to help me get to a food vendor shop. Over crowded and barely friendly people. Everyone walking around with a ""superior air"" about them. Everything is extremely expensive. Too big!"
24th September 2018,2,"""inconvenient and time consuming""","Not Verified |    I often travel for work and leisure both continental and internationally, and this is by far the worst airport I've ever been to. I have been here multiple times now, and at this point I had to write a review. Staff are unfriendly and not very clear or helpful when giving directions. I also feel like this place is outdated in design and convenience. Having to take a bus to get from terminal to terminal is inconvenient and time consuming. There are times I want to get food at the limited selection of restaurants, but don't have time to go because the bus schedules are unpredictable. So then your option is the very underwhelming gas style deli counters and vending machines. I'd understand if this was a small airport, but this is a major international hub. I can honestly say when I book flights, I got out of my way to make sure I never connect to this airport and on the few rare occasions I get diverted here because some kind of airline problem, I always groan."
6th September 2018,1,"""surliest, most miserable, rude""","✅ Trip Verified |  The inbound trip from Heathrow was great until we arrived at LAX. Herded like cattle for our turn with the TSA agent we waited 45 minutes, (hoping our suitcases would still be at baggage reclaim) to have our passports checked by the surliest, most miserable, rude and non welcoming person I have ever met in another country. He is a very poor representative for America and he could do with a course in customer service. I didn't expect a brass band for my arrival but his attitude was appalling. The return journey was disappointing too, no good eating places and expensive shops, even duty free."
4th September 2018,2,"""Staff are extremely rude""","Not Verified |  Staff at LAX are extremely rude. Not a very good gateway at all to a pleasant America experience. We had a tight turnaround time to transfer to another flight. There was no assistance from staff to make this easier. We were sent to wrong queues, no empathy was given when airport delays contributed to us being late for our next flight. When we experienced frustration at being told by one staff member that we need not take anything out of our bags when going through security checks and then another reprimanded us for not taking anything out we were told not to come back to America. Staff need to be aware most travellers are just coming off long international flights and just need them to engage in a welcoming manner. A smile occasionally is welcomed. International travellers are not all criminals. We have lives and families just the same as these ‘welcoming’ staff members. As this is the second time we have experienced poor behaviour at this airport, in future we will be attempting to use a different gateway airport into the USA. When leaving the LAX airport staff were wonderful. We were expecting similar behaviours to our arrival experience,but I am happy to report we were pleasantly surprised."
30th July 2018,4,"""problem was the lack of care""","Not Verified |  I was on an overseas flight. When we arrived at the airport, I had about two hours to get where I needed to go. Plenty of time, except for the delay. I do not blame the airport of any of the airlines for the delay to clarify. I am unsure as to why they had a delay, but imagine it could have been technical - these are overseas planes we are talking about and I am all for them being as safe as possible. The problem was the lack of care I experienced at the airport. When I relayed my nerves about getting to the place on time, the staff seemed apathetic about it. Sure enough, I missed my flight by about five minutes. Like my luggage made it on, but not me kind of close. Now if even one of them had cared enough to offer me a ride or radio the plane to wait, this could have been avoided. Most of them could see that the time was close and even remarked on it, but made no move to actually help me with the problem. But instead, through no fault of my own, I am currently waiting an over six hour layover with no guarantee I will even get on the next flight. The staff for rescheduling were fairly sympathetic and patient about dealing with a very tearful me, since this was not the first major thing to go wrong for me."
25th July 2018,1,"""poorly air conditioned""","Not Verified |  Terminal 3 is terrible. TSA agent was very rude and I saw him throw a bag across the rollers hitting the plastic bins. Get into the terminal to find that it has a relitively small waiting area that is poorly air conditioned. Temp inside was 78 and muggy, you couple this with some people not bathing properly and it makes for a bad wait. Keep the air cool."
21st July 2018,2,"""hot, humid and smelly inside""","✅ Trip Verified | It was the worst airport experience I’ve ever had! I arrived in the terminal where there were no family restrooms and when I asked about it I was sent to the nursing room instead. The nursing room is another bad story! It was next to the restroom and didn’t have any ventilation. It was hot, humid and smelly inside. After couple of minutes with my baby I felt sick and we left. In the therminal we find a family restroom but with other name. It was “All genders restroom” guess what? They all were busy because everyone wants to go and check the restroom so we have to wait and wait. One of the doors in “all genders” restroom was broken. It let you in but you can’t go out. I pushed an emergency button but they didn’t care and I was rescued when other mom with a baby pushed the button from outside. The people on the checking point were rude! I had to wait a long time for my stroller because they placed it on the side and forget to check it, finally when it was cleared, they told me go back to the scanners and pick it up but in that time my baby was so tired and frustrated so he laid down on the floor (very dirty by the way) and cried so I couldn’t move anywhere and I begged them to bring the stroller to me and they just stayed there. Finally one of the passengers brought the stroller to us. I changed 5 different planes in two different countries that day and LA airport was the worst!"
21st June 2018,1,"""Worst customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | I was forced to check a small backpack even though it was small in size, fit under the seat in front of me on the way to LAX and was much smaller than everyone else’s carry on items. They forced me to check because I was carrying a very small cross strap purse around me and considered that multiple personal items even though every other female in line had a purse and backpack or carry on item. Worst customer service at LAX airport than I have ever experienced in my life."
20th June 2018,1,"""Worst arrival delays in 25 years""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst arrival delays in 25 years of coming to LAX: stalled queues, exit queue serviced by only 4 agents. Terminal 3 elevators: 1 not working and the other does not take you to a door. Third world mobile/cell coverage in the terminals Restrooms in T3 smell."
9th June 2018,1,"""Shame, shame on you""","✅ Trip Verified |   LAX should be ashamed of themselves, treating your customers like cattle. The stress of arriving to (and from) the airport (and it's not just the new construction). Cattle going to the slaughter house are treated more humanely than the unfortunate people who frequent LAX airport. The only slight relief was the refreshment area which lasted one second till he told me the price of a bottle of water. Shame on you. Were we paying for all that excessive marble and advertising glitz in Arrivals? (Thats a whole different complaint). You should be looking at how other airports address the traffic. Barcelona for one, who separate the buses, shuttles, taxis etc from the cars. Its a great stressless experience. Great unassuming restaurants that you pay reasonable prices, shops that cater to the masses instead of the wealthy. Your mantra seems to be grab as much money as you can from the unsuspecting victims and then wait for them to complain. Shame, shame on you. The employees are miserable and rude, not a smile or welcome from any of them. Being shuttled like cattle to the airplane in a miserable over crowded bus. Shame shame. Look at Gatwick airport, where they have a hotel in the airport for early morning travelers, where they have a train station that is an elevator floor away from check in. Stressless and a great experience. LAX is a stressful money grabbing people barking orders mass of confusion. Hateful experience. I would like my money back for the excessive price of the bottled water. Shame. When I return I will no doubt have a horrible experience but when I glance at the marble and the glitz of the advertising my thought would be ""why did they spend the money on this instead of finding a way to eliminate the lines, the traffic, the confusion, the miserable employees, the expensive shops and the the most unwelcome airport ever."
2nd June 2018,1,"""wait through immigration is insane""",✅ Trip Verified | The wait through immigration is insane. Spent over 90 minutes just waiting in line. The people there are so rude. After a long flight the last thing you need is to be standing in a hot airless area for a ridiculous length of time. Been to many airports all over the world and this is by far the worst. My main complaint is the arrivals immigration debacle. Not a great first impression for people arriving from other countries. It’s an embarrassment.
11th May 2018,1,"""had a miserable 5-hour layover""","✅ Trip Verified | On a recent trip, I had a miserable 5-hour layover at LAX on a flight from Dallas to Eugene. American Airlines flights to Eugene are out of the American Eagle regional flight​ annex at LAX, which resembles a third-world airport more than a major US facility. These 9 gates are a long bus ride on the tarmac from the main domestic terminal. They might as well be in Long Beach. There is a huge traffic jam getting to and from these flights, with passengers waiting up to 20 minutes to even board a short bus. The annex terminal has few services, with only a small deli for food. They do have a lounge out there, but were not selling day passes that day, due to construction at the lounge in another concourse. Like most of LAX, you get kicked off the WiFi every 45 minutes, unless you watch an ad or pay. While my flight was fine, the ground services and facilities from American Eagle at LAX are as bad as it gets."
6th May 2018,1,"""TSA needs to improve""","✅ Trip Verified |   TSA needs to improve, they are rude, unorganized and plainly the worst employees. The process is slow and they treat us like criminals without reason and to make it worse we pay the consequences of their inefficiencies. No one is holding them accountable something needs to change and improve the process. They need more training and made me miss my international flight after my bag was re-scanned 3 times because the bin “was dysfunctioning” and the scanner did not “take a picture.” That occurred multiple times before changing the bin. Then my partner was calling to relay information to the gate, but they would not allow me to even answer my phone which was ringing right in front of me, they treated me like a criminal for wanting to answer my phone. So I missed my international flight. I wanted to make sure this did not happen to others so I submitted a claim/complaint but nothing happened and no one did anything, we didn’t even get an apology let alone reimbursement or an assurance that they will improve and not let this happen again."
5th May 2018,2,"""main criticism is the baggage carousel breakdown""","❌ Not Verified |  After arriving I was put on a later connecting flight to Seattle with Delta Airlines instead of Alaska Airlines due to the delayed arrival of my Qantas flight, from Australia. The nightmare started after I entered the LAX international terminal, The first bad experience was the baggage carousel, which was going to handle my flights luggage, broke down. They waited for 30 minutes before deciding to bring my flights luggage through another carousel. This was putting catching my new connecting flight at risk. I finally got my checked luggage, cleared customs and was directed to the connecting flights area. After another 30 minute wait, my luggage was checked in on a Delta Airlines flight and instead of a boarding pass, given an A4 piece of paper and told curtly to go to terminal 2. At the crowded terminal 2 I was curtly told by terminal 2 staff to use one of the check in kiosks. The kiosk would not accept the information on the sheet of paper. Luckily some Qantas passengers, who were in the same predicament as me found someone who finally gave me my boarding pass. I finally got to the boarding gate with 10 minutes to spare. To sum it up, my main criticism is the baggage carousel breakdown and their refusal to bring our flights luggage through a different one and the unpleasant and impersonal airline staff who treat anybody who is unfamiliar with the terminal like a sheep."
17th April 2018,2,"""I hate this airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  I hate this airport. The security line took longer than ever, I somehow set off the metal detector (I don't know how!) and the agents told me to stand on the side and I waited there for 15 minutes and no one ever told me what would happen next! Eventually an agent rubbed my hands with a cloth and told me to keep moving. I don't understand what that was all about. Next I went into the terminal 8 first class lounge and they wouldn't let me in because they told me it is for international flights only. Seriously? Most flights in that terminal at that time were domestic! I saw people holding boarding passes that said LAX-IAD on them being allowed inside the lounge! There is hardly any good seats in the gate areas. It is always way too loud and hectic in the terminals and the WiFi does not work at all. Finally, my flight was delayed by 10 minutes because the runway was so overcrowded that the aircraft took 20 minutes to get to the gate after landing. Then only good thing about this airport is that there are no TVs playing CNN like in every other US airport I've been to."
14th April 2018,3,"""Staff are offish and ineffective""","❎ Not Verified | Despite the automated passport control machines, most people still have to queue for manual recheck and those that don’t still have to queue for the person to stamp the entry card. Staff are offish and ineffective. My 14 year old daughter was pulled for an immigration check and we nearly missed our connecting flight as we were sat in a waiting room for 2 hours. In that area, 2 people worked running the checks, one person sat on the front desk taking passports and handing them on, another “supervisor” sat and watched the TV and two more (maybe security) wandered around the waiting room occasionally in between sitting down watching TV and napping. One man was told by the lady at the desk to stand by the vending machine, a while later he was shouted at by another staff member for standing there and told to stand in the other corner. He said that’s where he was told to stand so she shouted “well now I’m telling you to stand over there ao you go stand over there” Even if it’s a connecting flight, LAX require all luggage to be picked up and then taken to another area for it to be checked in to the final destination. This makes LAX a poor choice for connecting flights. Toilets very dirty landside but better airside. The security screening is moderately rapid but there are no signs up to explain what should be done (shoes off, liquids in a bag etc) which means it’s mainly managed by staff yelling at the guests - usually with conflicting instructions. We got through OK but some less experienced travellers were left quite flustered. Overall, better than JFK and Newark but worse than any other US airport in my experience."
5th April 2018,1,"""lack of compassion and common courtesy""
","❎ Not Verified |  This airport and the employees here are the worst! We had a connecting flight that we were rushing to make & everyone here seemed to make it as difficult as possible for us along the way. The Southwest agent checking our bags wouldn't let us go ahead even though everyone in line said we could go first because our flight was leaving before theirs. Then comes the lazy, sluggish, rude, and inefficient people at the screening point. They have lines backed up and don't seem to have respect for anyone. When they pulled my backpack for an extra check, they left it sitting there and they slowly went through other people's stuff. When I told them my flight was leaving in 5 minutes, the guy shrugged and said, ""I guess you'll just have to wait"" then proceeded to talk to his colleagues and ignore me. I'm embarrassed this is in America, I'm dumbfounded that people are so blatantly rude, and I'm ashamed of their lack of compassion and common courtesy. Also - the airport is ugly, the layout makes no sense, and things run so poorly here. No wonder they're rude - their jobs must suck. Everything comes back around."
24th March 2018,2,"""this is one of the worst""","✅ Trip Verified | Nothing new for LAX, this is one of the worst airports in the country/worldwide. The experience typically starts with huge traffic jams to reach the terminals and then you get to enjoy some of the worst public transportation facilities. To be fair this review is focused on T3 which is really bad both on the public and airside. There is nothing to enjoy in that terminal. It is old, there is nothing good about it."
9th March 2018,1,"""lines are ridiculously long and inefficient""
","✅ Trip Verified | The lines are ridiculously long and inefficient. Employees seem like they are all on their first day of the job. My pregnant wife was berated by a sassy airport employee during her pat-down, and was denigrated for bringing food for the flight. People selected for additional screening were waiting an average of 20 minutes after passing through security just to have someone pawing through their personal effects aimlessly. There was no privacy for the pat-down, which they required for us to bring our baby's food through security. Every time I route through LAX I spend at least 20 extra minutes on the tarmac, and every time I think the same thing: this is the worst airport I have ever flown through. Also, there is no skytrain between terminals, so if you need to transfer between terminals, you also have to pass through security again! Incredibly inefficient-like most of California."
8th February 2018,2,"""Unbelievable wait for clearing TSA""",❎ Not Verified |  Unbelievable wait for clearing TSA—over 30 minutes at American Airlines to board a domestic flight. This after checking in Priority. Earlier this week I arrived at LAX and the Super Shuttle was located in an outdoor smoking area. This sometimes feels like a third world country airport.
7th February 2018,1,"""not rocket science to organise a good airport""","❎ Not Verified |  Worst airport in the world award goes to LAX Airport. Have been to many airports in the world but nothing like this mess of a place that is called an international airport. People are treated like sheep because the place has been set up as such. The workers there have to be given a medal each to manage to work in such a place which has no vision of what an airport should resemble. All they need to do is look at other airports - Singapore, Auckland, London, Paris and see how they are managed. It's not rocket science to organise a good airport."
20th March 2022,1,"""I would stay away from DFW at this time""","Not Verified |  I am writing this review as a warning to others: transiting through DFW as a foreigner is absolute hell. It is chaos, stressful and inefficient and on top of that now also sort of useless as our passports were not even checked upon reaching the front of the line, we were simply waved through. We transited from international to international twice and the waiting time was close to 3 hours both ways. With just 1 or 2 officers serving the line (and for certain intervals none at all as the officers led passengers to secondary) of up to 500 arriving foreigners it was pure agony to see the time tick away realizing soon our connections would be lost. The foreigners section is shared with the wheelchair passengers and I have never seen so many wheelchair passengers in my life, only when those lines clear an additional officer will serve the waiting foreigners. The previously installed machines where you would do your passport reading, photo and fingerprints are gone, so that option of - sort of - fast tracking is no longer available. And mind you, we are still far away from pre-covid travel volumes. I can only imagine what the situation will be like further in the season. Oh and one more thing, customs is also gone, so that saves you some time. My advice: do not plan any connections under 5 hours. Apart from this, I find DFW a pleasant airport, once you are airside things are spacious, calm and organized. Retail wasn't quite fully operational but the offer seems solid. I especially like entering through the B-terminal that is small scale, with quick and easy security. Once you are in you can reach every terminal quick and easy using the train. Entering the USA as a foreigner has always been hit or miss depending on travel volumes but I would stay away from DFW at this time."
10th March 2022,1,"""quite literally the worst US airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  This is quite literally the worst US airport I've ever been to, and I've been to a few and they're all bad. I'm not fussed on all the opportunities for shopping personally, I just want to be able to get through the airport quickly and efficiently. This airport seems designed to keep you trapped inside. Not only is it badly designed from an architectural and passenger processing standpoint, TSA and US Customs checkpoints will take over an hour to pass through without fail. I highly recommend if you arrive at this airport to expect a 2 hour wait to clear customs. If you are departing, expect 1 hour delay for the TSA."
7th March 2022,1,"""toll booths are not at all staffed""","Not Verified |  The toll booths toll road going out of the airport are not at all staffed so if you get up to the booth and there is a problem, there is no one to help. People are reluctant to back up so you are stuck. Took 20 minutes to extricate out of that position today."
5th January 2022,2,"""Baggage delivery was also very poor""","✅ Trip Verified | I will not ever travel through airports like Dallas or any major US Airports like this ever again after this last trip. Worst airport ever. If you want WiFi, you need to pass security first before access it. Immigration is even very long and not so many immigration counters were open. Baggage delivery was also very poor. Airport was also less cleaned. I believe American standards has been in decline for a long time. JAL service was also bad much as this airport too. The next time when I travel, I will try my best to never fly through this airport again and I will also avoid flying JAL and next time, I will fly another airlines like Emirates, Qatar etc when flying from Indonesia."
4th December 2021,1,"""This airport baggage claim is completely garbage!""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport baggage claim is completely garbage! I flew in to Memphis, TN from Dallas, and they lost my baggage and wasn’t aware I made it to Memphis last night. There is literally a computer system tracking where the passenger is going and it wasn’t applied. I had to get a BSO attendant in Memphis to call the BSO in Dallas just so the attendant can put my bag on the plane herself. I have military clothing and items in my bag that are irreplaceable. I have my moms wedding where I walk her down the aisle and I haven't prepped my uniform. The early flight was going to Memphis and arrive at 10am its 11am now and got put on the second flight. Do your job! Somebody please brief sternly to the workers because they are subpar in their only job to put a bag on an airplane. Its not rocket science. Anybody viewing this review make sure you keep your bags with you. You cannot trust the simplistic worker. I even confirm with my AA representative that my bag was put in the plane and she said yes. What a lie - fix this issue."
12th October 2021,2,"""terrible experience on the Terminal Link busses""","✅ Trip Verified |  I had a terrible experience on the Terminal Link busses tonight. I landed in terminal C. I took an A & B bus trying to get to B6 where my car was parked. The bus went to A first and everyone got off except me. I said that I needed to go to B and he said to get on the bus behind him and that it was going to B. I got on the 2nd B & D bus and it went B first. It stopped at the first B stop for the higher numbered gates. He told me that my stop was next. After a few minutes of winding roads, I asked him if he skipped my B6 stop. He said, oh, yes I did. I had to travel on to D and then get on a 3rd bus that took me back to B. It took me 1 hour to get from terminal C to my car that was parked in terminal B! What a cluster. I will not be parking at the terminal again. Drivers are clueless."
9th October 2021,1,"""This place is filthy""",✅ Trip Verified |  This place is filthy! No wonder Covid spreads when you travel. If TSA wants to protect people they should start cleaning the filth and fluids off the walls.
23rd September 2021,10,"""thank you to the three employees who helped me""","✅ Trip Verified | I want to say thank you to the three employees who helped me. One took me to the right skyline and rode with me to my stop. One saw I was confused how to get out to find my car and gave me the assistance #. One stayed on the phone with me when I couldn't find my car and was exhausted and panicked. She found my exact parking space and led me to it even while I was distraught. I arrived 9/21 around 10.45pm, flight 462."
1st September 2021,1,"""I witnessed zero enforcement of federal mask laws""",Not Verified |  I witnessed zero enforcement of federal mask laws in this airport (August 2021). It's a cesspool of disease and rude people without masks. My 11 month old can't wear a mask. He relies on others to follow and enforce the rules and they failed him. Spend the extra few hundred dollars and have your layover at another airport in a region where they take public health seriously. You'll be glad you did.
29th August 2021,1,"""never coming back to this airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  I'm never coming back to this airport if I can help it.  Even a 4-5 hour layover might be cutting it close. The TSA here are the worst people I've ever encountered in air travel.  First time through TSA they not only rescanned my bag 3 times, but over 20+ people were waiting for their bags to be checked/rescanned. TSA agents kept saying that the picture was cut off and they were only allowed to rescan the tray. Hand checking not allowed. I suggested after the 3rd re-scan attempt, if they could please separate the tray as it seemed it being overloaded was causing issues with the scanner or if they could use another x ray machine. The TSA agent looked at me and said that was not possible and that the only way was to rescan it...again. I repeated myself because I just couldn't believe they didn't understand what I was saying, that the tray was too full and it might be better to split it into two trays. He took that as aggression and in turn chose to escalate the situation by saying ""you keep repeating yourself"" in a certain tone. Unfortunately, people need to repeat themselves when the other person doesn't understand a simple question. Not my fault you don't have basic comprehension skills. I noticed that there was a lady that seemed to be the head and I politely asked her if it was possible to split my tray up next time it comes up to be scanned. She reluctantly agreed. And it went through. Something that could have been resolved immediately with what you would assume be experience and knowledge doing the job. 45 mins of waiting around for that. Anyway, the skytram sucks. It takes about 30 mins or more to get to another terminal. The airport is so large, yet disorganized you really have to know where you're going if you want to make your connecting flight. On the way back from my trip, we got delayed (again because of how disorganized DFW operations is) and only had 40 mins to make it to our connecting flight in another terminal. TSA was NOT helpful in getting us expedited through security although it we were not at fault for the rush. I've seen other airports rush connecting flights through TSA if they were pressed for time, but they did not care at all. I asked the TSA agent at TSA precheck if he could please let us through so we can make our connecting flight, he said no. I then said what do you expect me to do to make this flight, and he said I needed to get in line or ask the 300+ people waiting in the security line to cut in front. So I did exactly that. I turned around to the line of 300+ people and yelled ""I apologize, but this TSA agent won't let me pass through without asking all of you if it's ok to cut in line, again I apologize but my connecting flight leaves in 30mins and I wont make it if I can't cut right now"" No one objected and I went through. No thanks to TSA."
4th August 2021,3,"""Security was worse""",Not Verified |  I had never flown from this Airport. I checked in no line the lady at the checkin for flight was rude had a attitude ask her question she almost screamed. Security was worse like you were wasting their time. The only helpful person was another customer behind me explaining how things worked. I am not a seasonal flyer haven't flown in years. I will never use Dallas Fort-Worth or the American airlines again .
12th July 2021,3,"""There is no meaningful signage""","Not Verified |  I will never use this airport for arrivals or departures again. It took over an hour after we landed to get my luggage. And then it took about 30 minutes to get to the car rental terminal. In order to go back to the airport to pick up my family flying in on a different flight, I found I needed to know exactly which gate they were arriving into. That meant I had to wait for them to land and get off the plane. My plan was to park and go inside to help them with their luggage and the babies. But since I had no idea where to go before they landed, I barely was able to even get to the correct terminal and gate before they were trying to collect baggage by themselves - 2 babies and a mom. There is no meaningful signage to direct a person to car rental return location. And I asked 3 different employees how to get there - 2 Terminal Link drivers and a TSA agent who just happened to be on his lunch break, thank goodness. The 2 Terminal Link drivers had no idea. The TSA agent said he was pretty sure I would have to exit the airport then turn around. He thought the car rental return location was only outside the airport. Considering I had been driving around for what seemed like a lifetime, I did as he recommended. But the signs only said “rentals,” not “car rental return.” I followed this sign and ended up in front of the car rental terminal, not the right place. At first the Hertz agents tried to direct me to get back in their vehicle and drive somewhere else. I lost it. The agents then whispered to themselves - probably deciding if they needed the men to bring the white suits - but then one of them agreed to look at the vehicle and drive it to the correct location herself. I can’t say how much I appreciated that, I was so supremely frustrated at that point. But, seriously, never again will I put myself through this frustration."
26th June 2021,1,"""disappointed with their attitude""","✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived and missed a flight due to long lines at immigration. Our family got in another long line at guest services, as we just stepped out to purchase a drink while we waited. We got directed to TSA and they were extremely rude and talked back in an ugly way. We went back to get our Boarding passes (with missed flight time) went BACK to TSA and in their words they didn’t wanna deal with that situation and we could not even go back inside with the only boarding passes we had at the moment. Very disappointed with their attitude and how they handled the situation after traveling ALL DAY. Not only were we the only ones with the same situation, another male as well as a kid getting left out here by himself."
17th June 2021,3,"""The driver was very curt and drove too fast""","Not Verified |  I need a wheelchair to get through the airport and upon arrival from CMH a chair was waiting. When we got into the airport from the plane I had to get out of my chair and onto some kind of cart with 3 bench seats on each side. It was difficult stepping up onto the step to the bench seat. The seat was very narrow and did not have adequate hand holds. The driver was very curt and drove too fast for the amount of walking people, weaving around and making it hard to stay on the bench without sliding around. We arrived at an elevator and he told us to get off and go down and another cart would be waiting. We had to get off the cart and on to another cart. Then that driver did the same thing to us. Made us wait for another cart. Then a third cart arrived. At that point we chose not to get on that cart. I walked very slowly to our gate which thankfully wasn't very far. When someone needs a wheelchair it's because they can't walk far or not at all or their mobility is compromised. After we boarded our flight to Kona we had to exit the plane due to an electrical problem. When I exited the plane I told a flight attendant I needed a wheelchair. I waited outside the door for awhile and another attendant told me I needed to go back to the gate. I told her I needed a wheelchair. I ended up walking again back up the ramp where we waited 2 hours while the plane was being repaired. One of the gate attendants came and apologized and said they haven't been able to hire enough people. This was the worst experience I've had at any airport since I have had to use a wheelchair when flying."
14th June 2021,2,"""I was so disappointed and enraged""",Not Verified |  The dirtiest and rudest cleaning and airport staff. After a week away I was so disappointed and enraged by this place. Terminal D had no real food and no one to talk to. Charging ports were old and hard to reach.
6th June 2021,1,"""the worst airport in America""",Not Verified |  Once again this airport keeps its standing as the worst airport in America. Half hour lightning storm has now shut down airport for going on it’s third hour. Circled for 44 minutes sat out on tarmac for another 40 minutes and now no bags for 90 minutes and counting. Already have a hotel because these idiots can’t put you within half hour of your gate from the one you arrive in ever. Bigger and busier airports never run like this one. Avoid at all costs. Never again for me . I’ll pay more money to go elsewhere.
12th May 2021,1,"""They have no customer service skills""",Not Verified |  The staff here at Dallas Fort-Worth were completely rude! They have no customer service skills. When there is already rain and weather delays you would think they would be helpful but no they were completely rude and want you to go to a customer service center that line is a mile long. Has workers at a gate doing nothing but doesn’t want to help anyone. Just keeps running away and sending people to customer service. American Airlines is definitely not hiring quality that’s for sure.
2nd May 2021,1,"""The bathrooms are disgusting""",✅ Trip Verified | Terrible. Security slow. TSA agents standing around doing nothing while limited lanes are utilized. The bathrooms are disgusting and the stall “monitor” is inaccurate. Running water at faucets - wasteful. Nasty stalls and soap dispensers empty.
14th March 2021,1,"""What a pathetic excuse for an airport""",Not Verified |  What a pathetic excuse for an airport. Plane landed at 7:30 pm and there was not a single restaurant open to grab dinner. What is the reason to have restaurants if you aren’t open past 6pm. Make your connection through another airport. I’ve seen small rural airports operate at a higher level than DFW.
31st December 2020,1,"""I'll never use this airport for anything again""",✅ Trip Verified | Every time we have a connection to and from DFW it's delayed from this airport! Last time it took 10 min just to get someone to let us off the plane and we missed our connecting flight be 3 minutes and they wouldn't open the door with the plane still there. Whoever is in charge should get fired! We are now sitting in Seattle trying to get back to San Antonio and guess what? We're sitting in Seattle because DFW is holding us. Again! I'll never use this airport for anything again! We are going to miss our connecting flight again! Thanks DFW!
27th December 2020,8,"""I would definitely recommend this airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Construction of a portion of the runway/taxiway caused a much longer taxiing time to the gate. Additionally, the layout of the taxiway caused another delay as the aircraft in front of ours was unable to move and we could not manoeuvre around. Inside the airport, however, was a different story. The SkyTrain was very quick and easy to access. We were in our departure terminal within minutes. The food options were quite diverse. Terminal C featured a TGI Friday, Chick-fil-a, Auntie Annie's, Pizza Hut, and McDonald's. I had never seen this many chain brands at an airport and was satisfied with the choices. Power outlets were available at certain spots, and some seats had footrests, which I have never seen before. The airport has good wifi and all other necessities needed even for a long layover, if you had to have a connection, I would definitely recommend this airport."
27th September 2020,10,"""the agent was very compassionate""","Not Verified |  I was at the customer service counter to try to get on an earlier flight. I observed another lady quite upset, after handling my issue, which was resolved quite adequately. I went over to the station where the lady was in distress. I asked the agent, what was the issue, and if the lady needed help. The lady could only speak Spanish, and crying so it was hard for the agent to get at the crux of her problem. After sorting it out, she didn't have the funds to get a new COVID test for entrance into Guatemala, (Guatemala has changed their requirements). Anyway, the agent was very compassionate and spent as much time as needed to explain and help her to understand what she needed. I had inquired if I could help, some things, of course, could not be corrected by me, but this situation. I could help. She just needed money for the test. The American Agent, explained in Spanish to the lady and that I was going to help her with the funds. I am sure that this lady would still be at the Dallas airport if not for the help of the American agent that took the time to help her."
8th July 2020,1,"""Rudest TSA ever!""","✅ Trip Verified | Rudest TSA ever! They acted so miserably! Before we even got to them they were yelling and getting annoyed with people to get their boarding pass and ID out way before they even got to the front. Rushing everyone. Then we were making sure we had the proper stuff out of our bags and we asked to make sure and the guys says ""well if you would listen to what I'm saying you'd know."" Wow. Then another person got mad because our bag wasn't catching on the belt and the lady started yelling at us! If you hate your job so much leave. It's not hard to be a nice person and if you hate people don't work around them!"
2nd March 2020,10,"""Best experience ever""",Not Verified |  Best experience ever. Already knew what gate we were arriving at and connection board was right at gate exit. Sky track was very easy to get to and use. Washrooms were clean and well maintained. Our best experience was the fact it had fast food restaurants. Our other airports we went to had high end sit down restaurants which were slow and kiosks where you paid ten dollars for a simple sandwiche. Very happy! 
1st March 2020,1,"""Worst experience with TSA ever""","Not Verified |  Worst experience with TSA ever. We arrived at the airport and needed to make a connecting flight. Our carry on was flagged, the only thing that was in it was an Aero bed (an electric inflatable air mattress). Funny how we had no problem with it going through security for our previous flight a few hours earlier. 4 of your TSA workers thought it was a big joke that we were going to miss our flight because no one was there to check bags that had been set aside and were having a great time laughing and joking instead of actually working. Loved how our suitcase was manhandled when finally checked, and when we arrived at our destination after two flights, driving, being up all day and helping family pack up their belongings in preparing to move in the morning, our bed which we planned to sleep on tonight won’t hold air. (Oh, it was pretty new before this as well)."
29th February 2020,1,"""Terminal link system is pathetic""",✅ Trip Verified | Terminal link system is pathetic! Should not take an hour to transfer between terminals. Call the terminal link and the response was they are busy and the busses are full. Should have a the necessary amount of busses to accommodate! Very rude drivers as well when questioned!
23rd February 2020,9,"""Just know the system and its absolutely fine""","✅ Trip Verified | My usual entry point into the US on Qantas. Now the flight from Sydney gets in at 1pm so the customs and immigration formalities are completely painless (usually). That means straight to the machines, swipe the passport and check finger prints and to the usually very pleasant (he was) officer who asks purpose of visit. Being a regular visitor and departing on time always, this is a cursory look and smile. From departing the aircraft to pulling up at a local airport hotel took all of 45 minutes. Now compare to LAX. Terminal D is my departure point also. Now being dropped off at the curb to entering the terminal proper via a check in and TSA process took all of 10 minutes. A big thank you to the Qantas desk for the upgrade. The TSA checks were painless. You just have to know what to take off (shoes, belt, bulky clothing) or out (personal toiletries, laptop) or leave behind (water). Folks it is not that hard. Just know the system and its absolutely fine. The TSA have a job to to so work with them. Terminal D is a fine place. Very large and lot of places to eat and sit. One thing I think a terminal of this size needs is a decent bookstore. There used to be one but now has become very small and added to a coffee shop. I dont eat in the terminal as I have lounge access but plenty of choice. A trip to 7/11 to load up on snacks. The WiFi in terminal is fine also. Superb experience all round at DFW."
20th February 2020,1,"""this airport is a nightmare""","Not Verified |  Operationally, this airport is a nightmare. Statistically, there's a certain number of bags that need to be reviewed manually. This airport took every other back out and hand searched it. There were probably 30 people waiting for their bags to be manually searched after already waiting in the security like for 1hr + (some with flights about to leave). When they took out my liquids (which were correctly packaged and had previously gone through Logan's airport security no problem) they slammed the ziploc on the counter, broke a couple of products inside of the bag and as I'm trying to put the products into the bag they provided, they are yelling at me telling me I need to move quicker going as far as taking products out of my hand and forcibly grabbing the bag out of my had and shoving the open bag in my carry on where the broken product then spilled all over the contents of said carry on. I have never been treated this way going through security. Definitely the worst airport experience I have ever had."
8th January 2020,6,"""a great and frustrating airport""","✅ Trip Verified | I don't know how many times I've flown into and out, and transited through, DFW in the last several years. I semi-joke that one has to transit through DFW to get to either Heaven or Hell, as one can easily see all walks of life represented in the customers in this airport. Heck, I even saw Trace Adkins (American country music star) standing around one time. But honestly, DFW is a great and frustrating airport simultaneously, I like it, but I neither love nor hate it. Despite its size, the terminals are all very well connected by a very modern tram, and are very modern and clean, yet each terminal feels like it's the size of the City of Fort Worth and often requires much walking once in the terminal. For another catch, the personnel in this airport lean toward the friendly side overall, but you never know if you're going to catch that one airline staff member who just enjoys barking at their customers (I'm looking at you, American Airlines!), or that one TSA officer who can't get over their breakup with their significant other last month. Personnel are either very helpful, or have the worst attitudes, and there isn't a lot of in-between. Aesthetically, this airport provides a beautiful, spacious, ""Texas-sized"" introduction to visitors to Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas, and the USA altogether. However, while signage anywhere you need to go within the terminals and around the airport property is ample, it can still be a chore to finally reach the always-slow baggage claim, then the car rental facility, or light rail (again, because of those long tram rides and long walks to anywhere). Lastly, as this airport is in the Dallas area, there's usually either a pushy nouveau-riche soccer mom or a testosterone-fueled redneck who doesn't travel much, who is impatiently trying to push ahead of other people in the airport, whether to order a burger, check a bag, or get on the plane. Something about Dallas, I tell you. This airport does much to make you go, ""Wow!"", before rendering you with such a mixed reaction."
6th January 2020,1,"""you either get barked at or mumbled at""","✅ Trip Verified | I am so sick of TSA agents acting like they’re not employees. No one is on the same page, you either get barked at or mumbled at, and I find it annoying when they won’t even address you. A woman tried to move me through security with her eyes and then got upset when I wasn’t following her non verbal cues. However, I noticed she had no trouble speaking clearly to the gentleman after me or in assisting him with luggage retrieval. Please stop acting like your agents priorities are safety (it would be one thing if they actually took care of that), they are, instead, simply rude and this bunch would rather be surly, roll their eyes, and not speak or direct traffic. Even another agent was having trouble getting an answer from agents who were clearly new and didn’t know what they were doing during screening. Dallas Love is miles better."
22nd December 2019,3,"""airport is very unclean""",Not Verified |  This airport is very unclean. I understand it’s hard to clean an airport that has flights going in and out 24/7 but Mccarran Airport in Vegas probably has close to the same volume of people and manages to keep the place spotless. These people with the cleaning carts just aimlessly walk around and don’t make an effort. Cleanliness should be a top priority.
28th November 2019,2,"""the most unfriendly group of agents""","Not Verified |  I wanted to relay my experience with the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, especially as it pertains to the TSA. I’ve been all over the place and seen a lot of rude TSA individuals, however this bunch really have it down to a science. They were absolutely the most unfriendly group of agents that I’ve ever seen. This must be where TSA sends the most crotchety agents to retire. “Get your tickets out, we’re not standing here making you sandwiches!”, exclaimed the TSA jerk in the middle of the line. The only individual not barking orders was the drug sniffing dog. Truly a horrible representation of the airport and the US. I will never go through Dallas-Fort Worth again. They need to fix that bunch."
27th November 2019,2,"""signs are horribly inaccurate""","Not Verified | The signs are horribly inaccurate and don’t represent actual roads. I went to parking for Terminal E for gate 13 and it shows 4 roads, with the left lane-splitting into parking with a big P for gates 1-10 and 11-38. There are 3 roads. So I took the left lane that splits off into two roads and stayed on the right. Nope, apparently you take the middle lane and just stay there. Makes zero sense. Whoever mapped out these signs has a horrible sense of understanding what a person who is driving for the first time will choose when the sign shows essentially 4 paths but there are only 3, and the left lane states parking but you have to go in the middle lane."
17th November 2019,3,"""the furthest thing from helpful""","Not Verified |  Customer service was about the furthest thing from helpful. I needed help to make my connecting flight after some delays in my flight, but they didn’t even try to think of a way they could help me."
7th November 2019,1,"""worst terminal connecting buses""","Not Verified | By far the worst terminal connecting buses ever!! I waited 45 mins for 1 bus to show for term A. When he arrived he said he has just started, but every other terminal bus came by, 1 even twice before this guy shows up. All the other drivers were trying to call him he wouldn’t even answer! Horrible customer service"
2nd November 2019,2,"""currently on 45 minutes waiting for my bag""","Not Verified |  I travel 100%, each week, no exceptions, worldwide. The baggage handling process at DFW is by far, the worst I’ve experienced, slow, priority bags processed like all others, inaccurate scanning, etc. Here’s the problem, there is nothing you can do about it! Thanks for listening (as I am currently on 45 minutes waiting for my bag)."
31st October 2019,2,"""baggage delivery is the worst""","✅ Trip Verified | I've flown all over the world and baggage delivery from flights at DFW is the worst. When you ask, you are told it could take an hour. This is what happens when unions run things."
24th October 2019,2,"""it utterly failed""","✅ Trip Verified | This was my first experience with this airport. For a first impression, it utterly failed. It needs better signage. That would have completely altered this entire experience for the better. I tried parking in remote parking. I got turned around, twice, and was lucky it was not more. Remote parking is remote. Not quite Timbuktu, but by the time you figure out the signs, it feels similar. I ended up parking in the south remote parking. When I took the exit, there was a T in the road, and there was a sign that said this road this way, that road that way, and absolutely nothing about where I might find remote parking. Seriously. Nothing. I turned the wrong way, because I am an idiot sometimes, and Murphy has a law. Then the shuttle dropped me off at an elevator for E33 instead of E12. There was no signage for E12 anywhere. He said to go up the elevator and down the hall because he doesn’t stop down there. So I ran half a mile after the kiosk didn’t work (add on to all this I was later than planned, so couldn’t check-in at the kiosk to print my pass), and kept having to ask where it was I was going, as there were still no signs. I got my boarding pass and tried to find the right security. Those also are not signed. They make their employees answer the same questions all day every day from clueless people like me. I felt horrible. Angry (at myself and them). Frustrated. So frustrated. Stupid. Because DFW failed to properly communicate. They made it so difficult to have a smooth, calming experience. As a result, it shall take me a considerable amount of time to get this taste out of my mouth. Perhaps it will leave when they improve the usability of their signage. It would be such a simple fix! Until then, I shall try to find some redeeming quality. My fellow passengers seem nice. The sun is rising now, which looks quite beautiful. The temperature in here also seems decent. And there’s a pretty piece of bubble-like artwork at my gate that does a nice job of catching the eye."
8th October 2019,6,"""take lessons from functional airports""",✅ Trip Verified | It’s my 3rd airport today and I wish Texas could take lessons from functional airports. Having to go completely out of the secure area to go back through sub-par security to catch a connection is bad. It’s the only airport that doesn’t allow water - most airports do a water check. Also where it eventually brings you up to enter they closed that station so we had to walk even further. After 3 flights in 12 hours it was aggravating. After using free WiFi today out of the country - I tried here to answer the survey. No go. Couldn’t connect obviously strings attached for free. It should be simple so foreigners can connect without needing to read in English.
14th August 2019,10,"""a great place to arrive and depart from""","✅ Trip Verified | There are so many negative reviews abut DFW that I wonder whether I'm at the same airport as some of those reviewers. It may be the other terminals are more perfunctory than Terminal D, international. In many trips through DFW I have not encountered a problem save the occasional wait at TSA security. Arrivals are a walk in the park. Like all security the world around, it becomes easy if you simply take your time, remove everything and just do what you are expected to do. No shouting or anger on either side. The food outlets in D are great although I have lounge access and so generally eat there. One thing missing is a good bookshop but that is being renovated and should be around soon. Compared to LAX and JFK, DFW is a paradise and in my view comparable to places like Changi and Hong Kong but without the crowds. What could be improved: DFW operator, please please put in a decent coffee shop so we don't have to put up with the brown stuff that masquerades as coffee. Otherwise a great place to arrive and depart from."
31st July 2019,1,"""a courteous manner costs nothing""",✅ Trip Verified | I recently experienced one of the most aggressive and rude security experiences in all of my visits to the USA. I beeped coming through security and she yelled step out I didn’t understand so she got very loud and then yelled at my 14yr old who she had told to come through! I spoke to a supervisor but he also looked terrified of her. Such a shame when I had such a great impression of Dallas and Texans to have left under such a cloud. I fully understand that you are trying to keep people safe but a courteous manner costs nothing - not good to encourage visitors to Dallas area! So disappointing.
26th July 2019,2,"""an extremely rude and overtly condescending manner""","✅ Trip Verified | My flight was delayed due to an emergency on the runway, that’s fine, I know stuff happens and there is no one at fault. I was flying into Dallas to transit for out of country travel. Anyways, due to the emergency, I missed my connecting flight out of country. American Airlines gave me a hotel for the night and rescheduled my flight for the following day. I lost my scheduled car rental day, hotel and a tour on my first day of vacation. After I returned to customer service post-trip, I tried to talk with one of the reps and was given some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Any question I had without hesitation was met with a head shake under the dismissal of “we don’t take care of that, headquarters does”. This was done in an extremely rude and overtly condescending manner. It’s fine if there’s nothing to do, but at least offer some alternatives and don’t make the customers pull teeth to find out information. I will not likely be recommending American to any of my friends or family."
25th July 2019,3,"""so dirty it is unbelievable""",❎ Not Verified | I had a two hour layover at this airport. It is so dirty it is unbelievable and employees walking around seem lazy and like nobody cares. My far cry from the other airports in the US. They should be embarrassed here in Dallas!
4th July 2019,1,"""Never using this airport again""","Not Verified |  The pure laziness and indifference by the baggage handlers at the baggage claim is embarrassing. I was waiting for 30 minutes for an oversized item to be delivered through the baggage claim, while the baggage handler walked around aimlessly. When I went to the desk to ask where my baggage was because I was going to my miss my connecting flight, the gentleman at the desk went and checked and turned out the conveyor was not turned off, and asked the moping rock head why it was turned off he just shrugged his shoulders like the neanderthal he is. My baggage was literally right behind the screen and I missed my flight by 30 minutes. Never using this airport again."
27th June 2019,3,"""the rudest I've ever experienced""",Not Verified |  TSA has to be the rudest I've ever experienced. I've been to quite a few airports and this group of agents are nasty to everybody. They definitely need some better training.
23rd June 2019,1,"""will pay extra money to avoid Dallas""","Not Verified |  This is the most backward operated airport that I have ever experienced. Delays, multiple gate changes, non smoking, and freezing air conditioning (June in Texas is 100 degrees outside) 55 degrees inside the airport. I will pay extra money to avoid Dallas in the future."
22nd June 2019,3,"""None of the underseat power supply ports worked""","Not Verified |  None of the underseat power supply ports in the E terminal from 18-34 worked. It is difficult to believe that DFW has been designated as a highly rated international airport. We are from Minneapolis, and that is truly a first class airport! Things are actually maintained and work!"
13th June 2019,3,"""it was a very unpleasant experience""","Not Verified |  It had been a long time since I had a layover at DFW and unfortunately it was a very unpleasant experience. The American Airlines terminal there was disgusting. It was a Tuesday morning and the restrooms in the A10 terminal waiting area were filthy with hair and faeces on the floor. The boarding/waiting area carpet was loaded with trash, spilled drinks and pieces of food on chair seats and carpet. We did not see any person in the act of cleaning anywhere nearby. Shame on you AA and DFW for your lack of cleanliness for your airline customers."
1st June 2019,1,"""experience was terrible""",✅ Trip Verified |  The service is awful. 2 men in uniform in terminal D had accents and didn't seem to fully understand me when I asked for help finding American Airlines desk to obtain boarding pass. The AA desk was empty. Then the TSA lady at check-in was rude and unfriendly complaining to her colleague next to her how she disliked her job as she checked my pass. The TSA staff at the scanners gave little guidance and talked over me. I rarely travel by plane and this experience was terrible.
21st May 2019,1,"""Avoid if you can""","Not Verified |  My checked bag was accidentally taken by someone and the airport staff refused to help me retrieve it. I had to run across the whole airport myself to find it! The airport staff instructed me to exit through a set of doors and ensured that I’d be allowed back inside, which I was not. So I had to wait for my parents to arrive for 3 hours outside the airport. The American Airlines staff and baggage claim staff were as rude as could be as I kept my cool and was polite through the whole situation. Avoid if you can!"
20th May 2019,2,"""Really upsetting""",✅ Trip Verified | I had a 5 am flight along with 28 other passengers and we all missed our flight and were given incorrect info at the security gate. We were told the only security gate that was open was the one that opened at 4:30 am. We then all missed our flight due to not getting through security in time. We are now all on standby for the next flight. Spending $1000 on a cruise out of Miami might not even happen now and will all go down the drain. Worst experience of my life. Really upsetting.
19th May 2019,2,"""the worst experience I have had at DFW airport""","Not Verified |  Upon arrival at airport the instructions on the plane say to sign into mobile passport for faster customs checks. So we did this and have used these services before with no problems. We went to the line mobile passport just to be put in line with everyone else. Then moved to another line with even slower service. When the staff was asked why the mobile passport people had to go through the line. Nobody would answer the question and just say to stay right here. After getting through the line, I found another staff member and asked him the same question and he said ""just keep walking good bye"". So with no answer how am I suppose to know what to do next time. As an American citizen we are being led around by people that cant understand nor hold a conversation in English. We fly have flown American Airlines for a long time but things need to be corrected. I will be doing some comparisons with Southwest from now on. I dont normally leave reviews but this evening 5/16/19 coming in on AA1385 was the worst experience I have had at DFW airport."
14th May 2019,1,"""Avoid this place if you can""","Not Verified | Possibly the worst airport I have been to. Ridiculous entry arrangements. The automated system is marshalled by staff, many of whom can't speak English and those that do don't have a clue what is going on. When you finally clear the automated stuff you then queue for ages and then do the same stuff over with a over officious ""guard""who is basically a little man in an important uniform. Very rude. Whilst this long protracted chaos is unfolding they are playing on a loop a glossy video saying how welcome you are. Well it doesn't feel like it. Then comes the chaos of the bag reclaim you have been in security so long there are numerous flights per carousel and no indication of which one your bags may be on. The staff are generally lazy, non English speakers, unclear of what is going on and/or downright rude. Avoid this place if you can."
10th May 2019,1,"""border patrol better than TSA""","✅ Trip Verified | How is it that customs and border patrol have better service than the TSA and airport staff? The dog sniffer ran into me twice. I waited 10 minutes to have my bag checked. The lady who was supposed to be waving me through the metal detector treated the foreigners in front of me like animals. She was waving at them so indignantly I was horrified. I bet she would have reacted violently if someone had done that to her. Then, on our way to the gate, my friend was almost run over by the vehicle transporting people. To top it all off, they were broadcasting CNN. Give me a break!"
18th April 2019,3,"""TSA was a joke""","Not Verified | Was flying through DFW from San Jose del Cabo to Chicago on April 1. We had an hour 45 min layover. There were approximately 400 people in the immigration area trying to get through three lines. TSA was a joke, very disorganized, slow, and TSA people standing around doing nothing. We were able to get through a TSA check at ORD quicker with three times the number of people in line on our way to Mexico. My husband waited 10+ minutes for someone to go through his bag, as it needed extra checking. We arrived at our gate to find to doors already closed. We were put on standby for the next/last flight to Chicago. There were 34 people on standby for that flight. My family did get to fly home that night but shame on American for overbooking all three of my flights on this trip."
18th March 2019,2,"""a whole different level of ick""","✅ Trip Verified | We took our daughter into Terminal A this morning at 8:30 to check her in for her flight back to school. We entered through A15. As we walked up to the door, we were met by an overwhelming sewage stench. Once through the door, we saw people asleep on the chairs (one man with his pants down to his knees, thankfully, he was wearing underwear) and on the floor, they had been there for awhile. I don't think they were passengers, as they were far removed from baggage claim and ticketing. As far as I know, there was no weather - or airline-related reason for people to be sleeping in the terminal. My daughter reports that the sewage stench is prevalent at her gate (A15), so this isn't just an isolated situation. What's the deal, DFW? The airport suffers from lax housekeeping in general, but this is a whole different level of ick. Are the homeless allowed to sleep in the terminals? Is someone on the sewage thing? Dallas is a world class city with a third-world airport."
8th March 2019,10,"""focuses on excellent staff""",✅ Trip Verified | This airport focuses on excellent staff and that makes all the difference. Additionally with the exception of one terminal the airport is clean and modern. Here’s to hoping the fix terminal C!
19th February 2019,1,"""it is the slowest system""","Not Verified |  I don’t know what DFW paid for this new check system at A22 security checkpoint, but it is the slowest system I’ve seen in my 30 years of flying! Absolutely unbelievable waste of money and time."
29th January 2019,1,"""has the worst security employees working""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas Fort-Worth has the worst security employees working. I fly weekly and have never experienced the attitude like they have at DFW. I walked through security 1/28 – 7.44pm – Term A Gate 22 and asked about the new luggage bin system because I’ve never seen it. Security smarts off that it’s been here for a year and I need to fly more to be aware, unreal, then he continued to laugh and repeat to other flyers that I need to become more aware. It’s unreal to me how DFW allows security to act like this."
29th January 2019,1,"""Mass confusion""","Not Verified |  Immigration was the most confusing I've ever seen. Honestly, was embarrassed to have a US passport that bad. Poor signage. Employees don’t communicate. Mass confusion. Whomever is in charge of the operation should be talked to. The time spent in line is not the issue. It’s when nobody knows where to go or what to do and when employees do not communicate clearly (or at all)."
5th January 2019,1,"""Extremely rude TSA agent""
","Not Verified |  Extremely rude TSA agent. Staff member was rude to me when my flight was boarding, I’m in first class and in the priority line and he did not allow me to pass. This TSA agent was also rude to multiple flight attendants and pilots, and multiple other priority guests. I understand the job can be stressful but negativity should not be transferred to the guests."
2nd January 2019,1,"""Nothing makes sense""","Not Verified | Dallas Fort-Worth airport was apparently built by low IQ imbeciles. Nothing makes sense, inside or outside. Driving to and from this airport is like getting castration without pain killer, every time. Just when you thought you're learned this atrocity they throw you a new curve. One time all roads and lanes to the airport were blocked, and no detour signs anywhere. Apparently we were supposed to leave our cars there at the barricades and walk to the airport, in the dark at 4:30 am. Yesterday I was picking passenger at terminal A. To get there I needed to go through parking garage?! Next, due to so much traffic at the curb side, and being night time, I didn't see my party after driving the entire length of the terminal A. I figured I'll just take the ""exit"" sign and loop around. Wrong, this took me clear out of the airport. As I was paying my toll and bitching to the attendant he told me I could take the immediate first left turn and go back in. OK, fine - except - I was at the stop sign and needed to cross 20 lanes of onrushing cars to get to the rightmost lanes on the entry side - the ones for people paying cash. I was never this scared - absolutely the worst, most retarded, demented architecture and infrastructure on this planet. Third world airports are better and easier to navigate. Unless you are in need of adrenaline rush, stay away from this excuse for the airport."
2nd January 2019,1,"""Shame on your employees""",Not Verified |  I was appalled when riding the SkyLink between terminals. There were 3 employees that sat down instead of offering their seats to an elderly passenger. I ended up assisting her so not to fall with the movement of the train. Shame on your employees!
29th December 2018,2,"""Don't fly through DFW""","Not Verified |    My family and I were flying out from San Antonio to NY but our connection flight was DFW. Our flight was delayed over 1 and a half for “weather delays” when there was no forecasted rain for the day, not only that when we arrived at Dallas we missed our 8:30 flight due to delays. Arrival was terrible, we had not only one plane in our terminal in our spot but also a line of about 20 planes which could of also caused for the our flight being missed. Rule #1 - Don't fly through DFW."
22nd December 2018,1,"""this is not the first time""",Not Verified |    We arrived from Jamaica and went through the customs process where we told a customs agent that we were going to miss our connection. There were six of us so she said there’s too many of you to let you in front of others and because there are so many of you they will hold the plane. Needless to say they did not and of course the airline did nothing to help us blaming a customs issue. Sadly this is not the first time I have missed a connecting international flight due to customs. The worst part was watching my 80 year old Mom trying to run to make the flight. Good job DFW.
16th December 2018,1,"""delays are extremely long""","Not Verified |  Literally worst airport ever. Planes are always breaking down, and the delays are extremely long. Don’t recommend going to this garbage airport if you want to reach your destination on time like most people."
24th November 2018,1,"""Horrible. Beyond horrible""","Not Verified |  Horrible. Beyond horrible. The worst travel experience of my life. Both my husband and I have travelled and flown quite a bit, but this was personally my first time flying through DFW and never, I repeat, never again! I usually fly Southwest because I love them as an airline and have always had great experiences with them, well to save on flights this time I chose American which meant flying out of DFW instead of Dallas Love. I’ll try to make this review as short as I can, but no guarantees considering the entire trip was horrible. First: Our flight left at 05.15 which meant boarding around 04.45. We got to the airport around 03.30. We had two children (2 years and 7 months) with us. Pretty sure there was only one counter area open that was checking bags. Thankfully though, we made it through there relatively quickly. Next is security/TSA. They didn’t even open their lines until almost 04.00. Okay, not a big deal, we were TSA precheck so still would have plenty of time. Nope. No TSA precheck open. So we had to go into the normal lane which was very long. Again, no big deal, we all have flights and we should be able to get through pretty quick, right? Nope. They had one, I repeat, one person checking IDs for both general and priority lines. One flipping person that was also taking her merry little time and then they had one line open to go through the security and have bags scanned for 2 long lines of people. Holy hell did we all barely move. Around 04.30-04.40 they finally started opening up TSA precheck line. We asked if we could jump to that line since we were TSA precheck. We were literally ignored and they walked by and let another long line of people come up and start through their line. We even had people in front of us asking if they would make their flights on time because they were needing to get to their gates for boarding. And they were ignored. Okay, now let’s jump to when we finally got up to go through security (around 04.40 when we needed to be boarding at 04.45): again, it’s me my husband and our two kids. Took forever to even get us through the scanners. We get through the metal detectors and now we have to wait for our bags and car seat. TSA pulls every one of our bags for a check. It’s probably because of the formula and kids snacks. Nope. They wiped everything down and then told us they had to open every single one of our ready to feed formulas to make sure they were actually formula. The formula was still sealed! And if you are at all familiar with RTF formula, once opened it goes to a short expiration date. So all of our formula for the trip now was being moved to a 24-48 hour expiration date assuming our cold packs kept the cooler cold enough, if it didn’t, they put all of our formula expiration to 1 hour. It’s not like we could find formula around the airport for him if he gets hungry since our formula is no longer good because you had to break all the seals! So here we are getting progressively more and more angry as we are also supposed to be boarding our flight at the other end of the airport. So I take the kids and start heading/running down to our gate while my husband waits for them to finish opening all of our formula up. We literally get to the gate as the last people to board. Never again!"
21st November 2018,1,"""Worst airport I have ever been to""
",Not Verified |  Worst airport I have ever been to for on time departures. I have been to this airport a total of 4 times and every time it has been at least a 2 hour delay. This needs to be resolved.
14th November 2018,4,"""rude and irritated at us""","Not Verified |  It was 6am when we got in line at security. When we reached the podium my husband began to follow me and the TSA agent yelled at him saying ""sir! Nuh uh one at a time!"" I told her he was my husband and I had both our boarding passes on my phone. She asked a second time. ""So you're together?"" When I nodded she said, ""Fine then scan it."" I scanned mine then went to show her his she again scolded again and said ""give me your thing"" in a hurried tone. I made a guess that she wanted my ID and I gave my ID slowly and at this point very irritatedly. She was rude and irritated at us. I've been flying frequently for work for a year now and getting through security does not require this level of power-tripping rudeness."
13th November 2018,2,"""difficulty in finding the train""
","✅ Trip Verified | Finding the DART station for a train to downtown Dallas is confusing. I followed signs to “ground transportation” and was directed to a jitney and told to go to terminal A. The jitney driver was extremely unprofessional, did not announce information about stops, and yelled at me when I got off at the wrong terminal A stop. I was the only passenger boarding the train, which comes as no surprise given the difficulty in finding the train. Returning to the airport, I learned from another passenger that I could enter the airport at the train station and take the skylink to my terminal. Why isn’t skylink connection to DART listed clearly in airport signage? It is no wonder few people seem to take DART to downtown!"
27th October 2018,1,"""attempt to call an airport""",Not Verified | I would rather be water boarded then spend 1 minute in DFW. I will pay extra and take extra flights to go around that place they attempt to call an airport.
19th October 2018,2,"""difficult to find two seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Long lines at both standard and Pre-check lines in terminal C. This apparently was due to construction. It seems as if it could have been planned better. The pre-check line spilled out of the queuing area halfway down the hall. Signage to get to the proper line was poor and required asking directions of personnel rather than simply following the signs. Despite arriving at the gate over an hour and a half early, it was difficult to find two seats together for my wife and I. I would not say that the airport was filthy but it certainly does not look as if it has been cleaned up, particularly in the gate areas."
4th October 2018,10,"""modern, spacious and clean""","Not Verified | I visited Terminal D which is the international terminal. Aiport connectivity is excellent. The terminal is modern, spacious and clean. Security lines were really short. On the air side, there are plenty of restaurants, libraries and even boutiques! Duty free service is excellent!"
3rd October 2018,8,"""super efficient in retrieving it""","Not Verified |  Thank you to the airport police who found my lost bag which I set under my seat and then moved away from. They were super efficient in retrieving it. Thank you too to the airline staff at a nearby counter who suggested airport police. By then I had tried the cleaning team, the lost property at several terminals, my own airline (who was boarding), and security. The staff suggested not to call the regular police but gave me the airport police number instead. The bag held my passport, airport police had recorded it but not paged me or liased with other departments, despite jet-lag memory fail I made my flight thanks to regular staff and am very grateful! PS Security trainee here gives overzealous pat downs as if ensuring all crevices are airtight and flightworthy. Avoid at all costs."
6th September 2018,1,"""Worst airport I've been to""",Not Verified |  Worst airport I've ever been to. Myself and a few others missed our flight because the airport concierge told us the directions to the wrong gate when I showed him our itineraries. We then proceeded to ask for help and no one that worked there would help us and talked to us like they had no clue as to what needed to be done to get another flight out. Have to purchase another plane ticket out for three days from now. Also extremely hard to navigate this airport. Even the parking lot attendant gave me wrong directions on how to get out of the airport! Extremely dissatisfied. Won't refund my money and was charged for my bags that I had to wind up carrying the entire time!
30th July 2018,1,"""confusing to navigate""","Not Verified |  This is absolutely the worst airport I’ve ever had to use. It’s very difficult and confusing to navigate, directional signs inside and out are extremely vague. Decided to use valet parking because I was traveling with children and I had a broken arm. Valet is a joke! Made a valet reservation on the app and selected “yes” for the baggage assistance option. Pulled up to valet, was just stared at for a few seconds so I parked my own car! Then when I mentioned help with my luggage, the guy acted like he’d never heard of such a thing and asked what I wanted him to do because I’m just going “right there” as he pointed across the way to the airport! So not only did I have park my own car, but I had to trek the exact same distance as I would have if I just opted for self parking, and I’m trying to hold onto kids and drag a 50 lb suitcase to the terminal with a broken arm!! All while being charged $31/day! Upon return, my car had never even been moved. This lack of service cost me a total of $205! Someone please explain to me how this is valet? Contacted customer service, the guy said he couldn’t help me but would pass this on to his manager and she would call me back that day, that was four days ago. Regardless of the valet issue, DFW is awful, majority of employees I’ve encountered are rude, and everything about the airport makes travel very stressful. Dalas Love Field airport is my preference. Everything is easy and flows so smoothly there and all areas of customer service are wonderful!"
17th July 2018,2,"""Process improvement needed desperately""","Not Verified |  Entering from Europe with Mobile Pass. Supposed to be quicker than other options. Not here. Process was painful with those that were in charge of the lines and no throughput ideas. The Mobile Pass line was the slowest, when we finally got to the immigration officer he asked us for our passports. I thought the idea was ""mobile"" passport. I did not see why he needed to check these with as other cities do not. He also was very nice but painfully slow with chit chat. We were trying to make a connecting flight and wanted to just get they immigration. Those in charge need dedicated Mobile Pass lanes. There were families leaving Mobile Pass and going into the kiosk lanes as those moved quicker. Process improvement needed desperately."
10th June 2018,5,"""very difficult to navigate""","Not Verified |  This airport is very difficult to navigate. The bathrooms smell and appear to never be cleaned beyond wiping the countertop and the toilets. The rental car return is beyond confusing. On the way to return my car I passed two areas for my rental agency that we’re not for the return. It is disorganized chaos, but it does have a great app that helps you to navigate the airport and track flights. Also there is only one area with tsa pre check in each terminal so regardless of where you think your gate is, you will likely have to trek to a different area to use pre check."
12th May 2018,2,"""the most poorly organized airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Perhaps the most poorly organized airport I have ever been to, and that includes airports from countries in the third world. Everyone knows TSA is slow, but at DFW they take that already high standard and push it even higher. The lines are abysmal. Worry not - staff seems well aware, and they try to speed up the lines by frequently redirecting passengers to other lines. This is where my negative experience begins. A lady in Orange redirected about the last 30 if us to ""TSA Pre-Check"", verbatim. ""Go down the hall to TSA Pre-Check"", she said. A a result we all moseyed our way down to the pre-check line and the line was not short, but it was moving unlike the previous one (when a line doesn't move for 15 min, something is wrong). Those in the group told to move all waited at pre-check until we were at the very front, and only then did a man start yelling at folks that the line was for ""TSA Pre-Check only"", when the lady in Orange clearly told us to wait in that line. Nevertheless we were all relocated to yet another endlessly long line. No signs to mark the line, no staff to usher people to the proper line, and no announcements were made at the appropriate time. As you can guess, many of us missed our flights as a result. This is my second negative experience at DFW, and the reason I felt compelled to leave a review. Everyone understands that security takes time, however DFW abuses that understanding greatly. Sadly one doesn't have much of a choice when choosing an airport , but I'd avoid DFW if given the option. It's not the amount of people that's the issue, it's the rate that they process those people and apparent lack of organization/communication. So congrats DFW, to being one of the largest, and most poorly operated airports in the world."
9th May 2018,2,"""no soap in the bathrooms""","❌ Not Verified | What’s going on with the Gate 26 area? No food, no drinks and no soap in the bathrooms! Are you closing this area? How about a sign near the other gates that once you come over here you will have nothing. Thanks Dallas - one of the largest airports in the world. Unbelievable!"
8th May 2018,1,"""this one is by far the worst""","✅ Trip Verified |  Of all the airports I've been in, this one is by far the worst! 5 terminals spread out over an unbelievable amount of land, signs that lead you in one direction only to stop giving you directions, and, above all extremely rude staff. Rental car return area is a 2-3 mile bus ride, understaffed, and again, extremely rude. People driving the busses both to and from the terminals didn't speak very good English, and though I tried to explain that I was leaving out of terminal B, was assured that the terminal E bus would get me there as he took my bag and loaded it - it didn't go to B. No one at terminals to help. Ended up paying a shuttle driver $40 to take me to B. One TSA check point for 30 or 40 gates, combined with bad information, almost caused me to miss my flight even though I pulled in to car return 2 hours before my flight was scheduled. The sign that led to nowhere led me to a door that said ""no re-entry"" once you pass through. I opened the door and stuck my head out to see where I was only to yelled at by a security lady. She threatened me stating I had to come on out even though my entire body (minus my head) was still inside the door. When I tried to ask where I needed to be the yelling got worse. To the point she threatened to have me arrested if I didn't come on through. I've never been treated as rudely at an airport as I was at this one. Never again will I use this airport."
6th May 2018,1,"""the worst smelling airport""",❌ Not Verified |  The E22-E30 concourses were absolutely the worst smelling airport ever. Reaked of urine. I will not return to this airport just because I can’t handle the stench. It really is very sad you spend a lot of money on plane fares and you have to come into airport that is just repulsive.
25th April 2018,1,"""no end in sight""","❎ Not Verified |  People running immigration are clueless. 8 officers for esta line, 2 for wheelchair and 2 for people with actual visas. Need to hire people with some mathematical common sense. Been here for nearly an 1hr and no end in sight. Avoid this airport at all costs."
16th April 2018,4,"""dirty and poorly maintained""","❎ Not Verified |  Terminal is dirty and poorly maintained. Escalator was broken and some lethargically applied signage confused the passengers about how to navigate. Overall signage approaching the airport is terrible, especially the rental car return route. Signs have you exiting one stop prior to when you should for rental car return. Rental car shuttles are too long between busses. No excuse for the place being dirty though."
15th April 2018,5,"""saw them being rude to several passengers""","✅ Trip Verified | I passed thru Dallas Forth Worth in transit to Mexico City for an international legal conference and must say that I agree with others regarding the confusion that initially greets international travelers when one arrives here! The support staff do not appear to have any clue of what they are doing and I saw them being rude to several passengers. On the plus side, the immigration and customs guys were great and professional though the lines were long as they had only three counters open to cope with many passengers who were arriving through several flights. I am not sure why they could not open more counters. It was worse on return. Coming back from Mexico, all of us missed the connecting flight to Doha as the lines were even longer, thanks to the American Airlines officer at the airlines desk counter, she managed to get us on the next day direct flight to Doha. My question is as to why transit passengers who do not wish to enter the US are not processed quicker and without needing to go out of the airport, like in most other international airports? I had an entry visa but was not intending to enter the US at all. This would simplify matters really."
15th March 2018,1,"""kept sending people to the wrong lines""","✅ Trip Verified | We arrived at the international arrival in terminal D about 4 pm, the Mobile passport for the 3 of us malfunctioned and as we arrived at the desk all information was erased from our 3 phones, their instruction to submit it within 4 hours but all information disappeared after less than 3 hours. Then you are treated like criminals by very nasty employees who do not know what they are doing and should not be employed in those positions as they kept sending people to the wrong lines causing more delay and problems to the arriving passengers, with a lot of them missing their connecting flights. Then your are forced to exit the security area and go again through security to get to your connecting flight. I hope the management of the international arrival at terminal D look at this and try to improve the service which on March 12 was a real disaster and nightmare. I have been in business more than 40 years with many employees, if I see any employee of mine treating the customers the way the arriving passenger were treate , I would fire them on the spot together with the manager."
13th March 2018,4,"""not happy at all with the service""",✅ Trip Verified | This will be the third time I've had to stop in Dallas to go to Jacksonville Florida. Im not happy paying almost $800 for a round trip ticket and I'm sitting here in the airport for another 4 hours before I can leave. This is the third time this has happened to me in this airport. Delayed for 4 more hours. How much money do you people think we have to spend at the airport to arrive at are destination on time? I feel like they do it to make more money when they have plenty of it. I'm not happy at all with the service.
12th January 2018,9,"""one of the easiest airports for connections""","✅ Trip Verified | I fly weekly for business, and for the past year I've been flying on American from Michigan to California. I connect semi-regularly through DFW - makes sense, as it's American's headquarters and largest hub. I'll say right here that I love connecting through DFW. It is one of the easiest airports for connections that I've ever experienced. The concourses are wide and open, seldom choked by clusters of boarding passengers. The physical layout of the concourses minimizes the need for airplanes to wait on the tarmac ""for traffic to clear the alley,"" as happens at other airports like O'Hare. Best of all, the SkyTrain at DFW absolutely flies, and can connect you from one corner of the airport to the farthest other corner in about 9 minutes. I'll accept a tighter connect at DFW than I will almost anywhere else, because of that SkyTrain. Dining at DFW is varied and generally good. B Terminal is a little skimpy, but otherwise I have no complaints. Restrooms are generally large enough for the number of travelers, and generally clean. I've had loo-oong layovers, and have walked the entirety of all terminals at DFW...and can report that they are basically all consistently good and competent. The biggest detractor I can find is that there's no airport WiFi. At least, I haven't ever found one to sign into. I agree with a previous reviewer that a lot of the hateful reviews must come from passengers who are generally unaware of the requirements of modern air travel (which is okay; not everyone flies weekly like I do) but don't want to admit when they've made a mistake. ('Muricans, in other words.)"
24th November 2017,1,Dallas Fort-Worth Airport customer review,"❎ Not Verified |  Myself and my friends were flying through Dallas for a trip to Las Vegas, our flight was around 15 minutes late, but we still had time to get through and transfer onto our next flight, well thats what we thought. We arrived at the automated desks to put our esta details through and received a receipt, if you have an x on this there is additional security which is fair enough but when 5 out of 6 of the same party are put in that queue, bear in mind there was over 100 people in this queue and only 3 desks open out of a possible 20 desks that isnt good enough. I asked a member of staff as to why there are no staff on to deal with the amount of people in the queue I got a shrug of the shoulders and told to move, they were not interested in the fact we were going to miss our connection because of this and we were not the only ones this happened to. Once through, which had taken well over an hour to get through, we had missed our connection. Went to the American Airlines desk as we had missed our connection to be told there are no more flights tonight and would have to fly at 07.04am the next day, I told the lady that we would require a hotel for the night for the 6 of us, was told as we flew in on a BA flight we would have to see them in regards to that. I kindly told the lady that American Airlines is part of the same alliance as British Airways and would she call them to do so, eventually we were given a hotel and were told to go upstairs to the BA desk where they were waiting for us. Surprise they knew nothing about it, so took our passports went into an office and we waited over 20 minutes for them to give us voucher for this. I will unless necessary for the customer avoid going through Dallas again."
19th November 2017,1,"""Appallingly organized airport""
","✅ Trip Verified | Appallingly organized airport. An hour waiting in line for the so-called 'automatic passport system', which then did not work, so a further 40 minutes for a human being to rescue the system. Very bad-tempered staff who were surly and rude. The Customs and Passport officers themselves were great. No complaints there. It is a management disaster propagated one imagines, by a company selling efficient machines to replace people. What a joke, and what a bad first experience of the the great state of Texas."
13th November 2017,9,"""Travelers, just smile, relax""","✅ Verified Review |  People are very hateful when reviewing DFW. I fly in and out of DFW at least three times a month. As a frequent flyer I can attest that the negative reviews come from nervous, irritated or clueless travelers that can’t follow basic instructions. No you can’t bring the water, yes you must remove your shoes, no a knife is a knife no matter what size it is, priority means priority not general boarding, etc. I have to say I haven’t really been to too many airports where the fault is with the airport it is always the rude travelers. Why everyone flying feels like the only reason they are there is because their private jet is being worked on is beyond me. Travelers, just smile, relax ask the TSA agent how his day has been going and you will get through security quickly and stress free. You must also remember that if you had to deal with so many jerks on a daily basis that your temper might be a bit elevated. Let’s just take a breath, board and get on with our lives."
7th November 2017,10,"""treated us with respect""","❎ Unverified |  During our vacation my girlfriend lost her ID, the agents and everyone we encountered treated us very pleasantly and professionally. They treated us with respect throughout the entire process. The airport as far as accommodations has many restaurants and shops to make last minute purchases."
26th October 2017,1,"""an absolutely terrible experience""","✅ Verified Review | This airport was an absolutely terrible experience. The customs is a total disaster. For an airport of this scale, you’d think they knew how to organize things better but they don’t. Lines are beyond ridiculously long, and security check personnel (those who look at your passport and ask about your bags and those who inspect your bag after the X-ray) are completely hateful and treat you like they are above you and you are just cattle. I will never layover or use this airport ever again. Avoid this place at all costs. "
24th October 2017,2,"""Terrible experience going through customs""","❎ Unverified |  Terrible experience going through customs. Personnel not friendly and treat people like cattle. Most personnel speak very poor English and it was hard to understand. FInally many of us were sent to the wrong line, the green line, for those who do not have checked baggage,. By the time we realized this, we were out in the terminal and not able to claim baggage and transfer to connecting flight. Tracking baggage was an additional nightmare. Personnel should be trained not to rush people and orient them onto the correct line."
19th October 2017,2,"""a very disturbing experience""","✅ Verified Review |  Being a 21 year veteran of the U.S. Air Force I've travelled to many airports in my life. My experience with DFW was by far the worst airport experience of my life. The TSA personnel at the security check in treated us no less than like basic trainees first entering the armed forces! We were constantly yelled and treated like kindergarteners. At one point an officer told the woman in from of me in a very rude tone to remove her jacket and put it on the conveyor. When I followed suit and removed mine, he yelled at me telling me that he didn't tell me to remove my jacket. Do as you are told, he yelled. Very, very rude people and a very disturbing experience. I've only touched the surface of all that happened during the check in. The rudeness was so widespread among the staff that I feel that it is definitely a reflection of a serious leadership problem with the TSA at the airport, or at least that portion of the terminal."
16th August 2017,4,"""An airport to avoid""",✅ Verified Review |  Facility seems decent but follows the worthless trend of disrespect to smokers. This is one of the airport that force you to leave the terminal area and have to go back through security just to smoke! Airports like this are why when I can even if it takes way longer I rather drive. Thanks a lot Dallas Ft Worth airport! An airport to avoid.
9th August 2017,1,"""staff aren't exactly welcoming""",❎ Unverified | Dallas Fort-Worth airport is a joke. The staff aren't exactly welcoming. And the immigration system is long winded. Forget a quick transfer between flights and avoid the airport if you can...it won't make your trip better.
26th July 2017,3,"""Dallas-Fort Worth is a zoo""",✅ Verified Review |  Dallas-Fort Worth is a zoo. American dominates it. We sat on the ground for 30 minutes waiting on a gate and almost missed our connection. We came in on B and had a departing flight on C concourse. We followed the signs and found some C gates but only 1 through 5 or something. Reached a dead-end. We had to backtrack 15 or 20 gates and go up one level to the people mover to get to the balance of the C gates.
20th July 2017,5,"""parking/transportation departments are dreadful""","✅ Verified Review |  As is typical, any effort to park in a lot at DFW is rewarded with frustration. For years now, I have tried to avoid parking here at all costs. Shuttle bus service is erratic, and drivers routinely ignore passengers waiting. Lot attendants are typically rude and standoffish. Unfortunately on my last trip, there was no Uber available at 4am, and I had to drive and park at DFW. When I returned to DFW a week later, the Remote South bus pulled up near the stop, the driver looked at me as I waved, and just continued on. This has happened to me multiple times over the past two years, either in the lot or at the terminal pickup stop. Drivers stare at you, ignore, and roll on by. This time I had to wait another 15 minutes in 100 degree heat with my wife and two young children. DFW may be well run in some areas, but their parking/transportation departments are dreadful. No sense of customer service whatsoever."
16th June 2017,9,"""great amenities, extremely logical""","Best airport in the USA. Efficient ground ops and control, great amenities, extremely logical and convenient layout, tall ceilings and huge windows. I fly several times per month and Dallas Fort-Worth is my preferred airport hands down. It's easy to park here too which is a feat for such a large airport. Minus one until they finish remodeling the last one or two terminals."
14th March 2022,4,"""it's mass confusion, with absolutely zero signage""","Not Verified |  This airport used to be at least a decent experience but has turned into a circus. The moment you walk in it's mass confusion, with absolutely zero signage or directions of any use. Hopefully you enjoy wandering around and didn't try to bring too much carry on to lug with you, because asking for help from some of the staff is a Russian roulette of what type of attitude you're going to get. I'd be more sympathetic, but I've also worked long hours interacting with the public, and there's no reason to be abrasive so long as people are being polite. TSA was the most pleasant part, and that's because they kept any interaction to a minimum so that the line could keep moving."
12th December 2021,1,"""Absolutely horrible airport""",Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible airport. Security and check-in areas are as inconvenient and congested as it gets. Most outlets at the gates don't work and no staff is willing to help with any questions or concerns. Should just be torn down.
29th November 2021,1,"""have never seen such rude behavior out of law enforcement""","✅ Trip Verified | Police officers outside extremely rude. Several people in line outside waiting on family to get to vehicle and told to leave. The police were having lots of fights with people in Arrivals line telling them to move and shining their flash light in their faces or into the windshield of cars making it hard to see to drive off. My children were literally walking out the door and the police officer told me to move now, I told him my kids are right there, he said no move now, go back around. I had to circle around 4 times to get my kids because they wouldn't allow you to stop more than 2 minutes. I was stopped a total of 8 minutes and told move now and was yelled at. Several people treated the same way. I use the airport 15 times a year every year and have never seen such rude behavior out of law enforcement. Worst experience ever would not recommend using again to anyone. Searching for a new airport to fly out of all year."
24th November 2021,5,"""What a complete disappointment""","Not Verified |  They manage to mess up TSA preapproval. Previously had two locations so that it was convenient based on which airline you used. Now they have, and they use the word consolidated, so there is only one TSA location so instead of having 50% roughly of the customers who are TSA pre approved going to each location you are forced to go to one location therefore there is literally no time advantage. Took about 30 minutes, so absurd. The only remaining advantage of course is you don't have to take your shoes off. What a complete disappointment, big government gone wrong. I don't care what the rationale is, fix it."
7th November 2021,2,"""It is 11pm and there is no place to buy water""",Not Verified |  It is 11pm and there is no place to buy water. McDonald's is the only place open and the line is endless. No vending machines around! Only water fountains. Not useful under covid or without a container. It is a shame.
1st November 2021,2,"""TSA lines are awful""",Not Verified | The TSA lines are awful! DIA is an airport you cannot count on because of all the inconsistency through security. This problem needs to be fixed. Why do they have everyone go through the same TSA lines? Unlike other airports that have their own TSA for a specific terminal or even airlines! Awful experience
29th October 2021,1,"""the worst airport I have ever used""","Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst airport I have ever used. It's not just this flight it's my last 3 flights out of Denver. TSA is incompetent. I stood in line for 20 mins at that and was told to walk to the south check point, walked down stood there for 10 mins and was told to go to another check point. 1 hr 30 mins total to get through just TSA. Missed my flight by 10 min, I will never use this airport again."
12th October 2021,1,"""Very poor and confusing signage""","Not Verified |  I have been to many large and small airports across the US and international airports. Denver airport joins Paris Airport as one of the worst. Very poor and confusing signage. Long long hikes especially to retrieve luggage and no options for assistance for those with walking difficulty. (I have MS making long walks difficult). Many of the escalators and walking sidewalks were closed. Inadequate seating at gates. No tables and limited seating after security to gather items, put on belts etc. I would say the single worst point about Denver airport is the confusing or lack of adequate signage."
1st October 2021,2,"""Overpriced parking""","Not Verified |  Overpriced parking, $145 for 24 hour garage. Construction for over a year, a mess as you can not walk through to even get to the restrooms. The absolute rudest people are at this airport. I am not sure what it is, as I travel a lot. From the ticket agents that are either screaming about electronic check in, or at the check in desk. The American Airlines agents are the worst! To the screaming TSA agents, who are always yelling something, shoes on, shoes off, in the bin, out of the bin. The only thing good I can say is that the airport is clean."
25th September 2021,1,"""ongoing construction project that never ends""","✅ Trip Verified |  I have always enjoyed Denver International Airport. Perhaps not the fanciest, but reasonable, navigable, and manageable. The last two+ years however have been pure travel hell.  This ongoing construction project that never ends is a nightmare. Still no food in the main concourse. Still a disaster area ever where you turn. This place should qualify as a blight and get disaster funding. When does this nightmare end Denver?  Outlying parking lots are still closed because they have no drivers. The crowded trains that run on the strangest schedules. Never enough, always loaded to over-capacity.  The ridiculous security lines. Enough said. Ridiculous and unacceptable. Just ridiculous. Closed bathrooms. Don't pass one if you see one. All the broken floor tiles around the baggage areas. I am sure the ground moved, but really this is our airport? Every trip through there is another experience in ""worst airport ever"". So sad."
21st September 2021,3,"""an absolute nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified | I rarely write a review, and then only if it's positive. Denver International, however, is the exception. Almost everything about this place is bad. TSA check in is an absolute nightmare. TSA precheck line had maybe 500 people. Non-precheck had 2 lines with maybe 1000 people each. Everything is dirty. Especially the bathrooms. The airport has the feel of a Soviet-era prison without all the glitz. Sure, most airports today aren't fun. Weird TSA security layouts, understaffing, closed facilities. It's just the way things are. Denver takes it to another level. For example, the rental car facilities are dirty and understaffed. I waited almost an hour and a half in a rental car pickup line before I cancelled the car, walked out, and took Uber to Colorado Springs. The on-site gas station was unbelievably filthy with trash spilled all over the ground. If you're arriving on an international flight and have bags, you have to collect the bags and transfer them. This process is standard. At Denver though, you have to collect your bags, take them upstairs and outside to a curbside pickup, then return inside and downstairs to go through security. I might be able to overlook all this if the airport weren't in Colorado and 30 miles from downtown Denver. If you get stuck at DIA, you're spending a lot of time and money finding a hotel or a new wait out of the state. It's just not worth it. Play it safe and use SLC, Vegas, or Phoenix. If you're in Colorado, enjoy the breath of fresh air that is Colorado Springs Airport. You've been warned."
23rd August 2021,1,"""the filthiest airport I have ever seen""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the filthiest airport I have ever seen. The bathrooms are atrocious. Several of them hadn't flushed, paper towels all over. The entire airport smells of urine. There is a place for dogs to pee and poop, but no easy access to outside to smoke. The people who work here are rude and not helpful at all. I will never fly from or to Denver ever again."
5th August 2021,1,"""I had nothing to drink for several hours""","Not Verified |  This airport should just shut down. I was there for an extended layover and I thought I was in the twilight zone! I had nothing to drink for several hours, not allowed to bring beverages through security, and nothing was open for purchase! Not one place. There were no drinking fountains either, so I had no choice but to drink the warm water out of the bathroom sink. The airport was very difficult to navigate as there were no signs giving any directions! Construction everywhere I looked, escalator out of service, I walked so much that my feet were swollen! When I got lost, I couldn't locate any help, except for one employee who shooed me away when I started asking him a question. Terrible customer service! Every worker that I came into contact with was flat out rude. That's unacceptable, especially because I am a very kind person. I suggest you visit another airport and take notes. I will do everything in my power to avoid Denver International Airport."
3rd August 2021,1,"""Worst airport in the country""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport in the country. I’ve lived here in Colorado over 30 years. Loved Stapleton but realized we needed a larger airport to accommodate the influx of new people to the area. DIA was built not long ago but super short-sighted as it has never operated efficiently for travelers. For many years, it’s been under construction causing delays/obstructions and it seems no one can figure out what to do to fix the many problems with this newly built antiquated airport. If you’re building a billion $ hotel here - it can be erected quickly. I’m a frequent traveler and am planning to move from Denver Metro area so I never need to travel to DIA again! I'm writing this while on the train to Union Station, which was closed with little notice when I was heading to DIA a few years ago."
1st August 2021,1,"""Worst airport in the country""","Not Verified |  Worst airport in the country. Trying to figure out where to go after arriving, forget it. There is no one to ask and no signage. I ended up jumping to a completely different terminal and my ride couldn't find me. No idea how it happened, I just walked down the concourse towards baggage claim then hopped on a train. Then departing, so much construction is going on security cannot be found. The escalators are unsafe, too steep. No decent food is available after 9. The place is filthy. No charging stations work in the terminal seats."
29th July 2021,1,"""the worst airport we have ever been to""","Not Verified |  This is the worst airport we have ever been to. Construction in check in area, escalators being worked on, longest walks we have ever experienced, not to mention the longest lines and the worst TSA security check point service we have ever had in our 50 plus years of traveling! I wish I would have gotten the name of the awful woman who ‘frisked’ me and 3 members of my family. Really? I think she should be fired. All in all we were thrilled to get out of there and will never book a flight that takes off from Denver International. Shame on you for treating people the way we were treated today!"
26th July 2021,1,"""DIA never fails to disappoint""","✅ Trip Verified | DIA never fails to disappoint. TSA has always been the worst at DIA. Then there is always some type of construction. I typically brace myself and 'deal with it'. But yesterday the pre check on north security was closed and there was a full line waiting for regular check. I raced to the south side. TSA pre check had 3 lines and the clear queue funneled to one gentleman. Frazzled I held up my pass and he gave me the 'lady put it on the scanner look'. At least he apologized when I complained about booking a terminal length to go through his line on the south. Finally through TSA and down the stairs to very backed up and broken train the terminals. After three trains I was able to get one to the C gates. I charged to the gate with a few minutes to get some water for my asthma which was now flaring up from all the people, the humidity in the terminal and my perspiration soaked mask. I asked where the water was to fill my bottle and was told it was 30 gates away back in the center. I did not want to risk missing boarding so I went to vending and found one machine half empty with only pepsi and mt dew. No water. In desperation I got a pepsi. Then I went to the restroom - the stall floors were littered, soap dispensers empty. The germiest place on earth is a bathroom and without soap or even hand sanitizer I cannot follow covid protocol. Disgusting and contrary to the mask mandate. Understood and even flexible that Covid has taken its toll on everyone but the lack of signs, supervisors, and basic needs is unacceptable. I recommend more supervisors on weekends and make sure they are visible and available - it is season! Prioritize cleanliness of restrooms and provide clean drinking water."
17th July 2021,1,"""TSA experience was terrible""","Not Verified |  The Denver TSA experience was terrible. Every person had to stand next to another person and walk about 50 ft while a dog was put on them to sniff for whatever. It was demeaning and reminded me of the scene from Shindlers list. This was a clear effort to control and abuse passengers, not for security purposes. Dogs are discretely used in airports, no problem. This was control by an abusive government. I have called my congressman about this issue. Arrival at the baggage area, no vending for water. It was over 100 degrees out. Nobody to help, no information booth. I had to ask airline employees for information. I will never fly out of Denver again and would only use it for a connection. It is a terrible airport. The giant TSA screening area is a stockyard not fit for humans. What a disaster."
5th July 2021,4,"""This airport is very very understaffed""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver had only McDonalds (gross) open during our delay. There were no food kiosks available due to short staffing that could be coin or card operated. No phone charger docks via vending either. Would have been very helpful. Plenty of chair charging docks-but if you don’t have a cord you’re screwed. Also why can’t airports have designated sleeping areas other than the scant cushions that only the lucky find? Sleeping on the floor-great. I did like the frequency of the gate train to get you to A, B, C gates. $14 for a turkey sandwich and $23 for a charger cord. Weather delays are real money makers for the airport concessioners. Thanks and happy Fourth of July. Not. The next day I had to walk up and down the B corridor twice just to spot the signage for Gate A to get to the train. My ankle still hurts from all the walking I did. There was no one at the information booth to help place a call for a hotel or car. The security guy told me to jump the 3 block line at customer service. Yeah right buddy. This airport is very very understaffed and as per usual overpriced. Gate B 3-9 area was beautifully designed with open glass walls and glass cathedral ceilings. Great great pod seating, comfortable chairs that support you when you put your head back. The music was also good throughout the terminal. Too bad the rest of the airport seemed like an older and uglier version of somewhere else. Bravo for this slice of heaven."
2nd July 2021,1,"""no food available""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport ever, no food available (everything was closed) and restaurants that were open had over an hour wait time. The airport was filled to the brim and everything was delayed in and out because of a non apparent storm. Never want to come back here but every connection available is through here."
19th June 2021,3,"""Left a really bad taste in my mouth""","Not Verified |  First time in B concourse downstairs Gate B86. Carpet worn out. Arm rests on waiting seats broken. Dirty carpet. Just notified carry-on luggage cart broken. We have to carry our bags to plane, what kind of circus is this. Left a really bad taste in my mouth."
17th June 2021,1,"""airport should be ashamed of their staff""","✅ Trip Verified | Airport appeared clean until we used the eating facility. Cleaning staff standing around people watching and not once did they try and clean a table and sanitize tables. We have just gone through a pandemic is no surprise to anyone, airport should be ashamed of their staff and lack of care for people using airport. Denver airport charges outrages prices for food but cannot provide a clean and safe environment for its patrons. Good service manager should be placed on probation. Location is a pandemic waiting to resurge. Avoid this airport at all cost."
15th June 2021,1,"""Departure was a nightmare""","Not Verified |  Arrival is okay although you have to look for the hidden boards indicating assigned baggage carousel. We walked the length of the baggage claim area and looked at each carousel before finding ours. Departure was a nightmare. Priority check in was slower than regular. Other customers had to help us with self-check in. We followed signs to North security only to find out that the TSA line was closed and we were redirected to South Security. There were no signs how to get to south security. We had to ask 3 separate people and ended up in baggage claim again. We finally found a police officer who gave us proper directions. After finding south security I set off the walk thru alarm, went back through and was then selected for a random search, they swabbed my hands and the test indicated positive which required a more than thorough patdown. The agent pulled open my waistband, pulled up my shirt, all in front of the crowd. The TSA agent told me hand lotion sometimes gives a false test. Seriously!? Perhaps we need a better test or this was just BS. I was humiliated during the whole process. There is no way a reasonably intelligent person can navigate this airport due to their poor signage. This was my second bad experience - my first made me miss my flight due to poor signage. Never again. I suggest you fly into Colorado Springs and drive to Denver before using this airport. Also, all food options had lines so long you would miss your flight."
4th June 2021,1,"""Disgraceful service""","Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible service at Xpress Check for rapid covid test. Xpress Check also owns airport spa but must have made more money switching to covid testing. $200 for test or miss flight or quarantine. The management was intimidating the customers, would not allow customers to ask questions and literally yelled at customers who appeared frustrated. Manager did not distance when she became angry. Several people who questioned her missed their flights. Disgraceful service."
24th May 2021,2,"""is still a complete construction nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified | The main terminal was torn up and completely destroyed over a year ago and is still a complete construction nightmare. There are zero Amenities in the main terminal. Security is slow, airline counters are jammed, directional signs are awful. In the concourses all the amenities are clustered in the central area and are all jammed with long lines and not enough seating. Gates do not have enough seating and most electrical outlets don’t work. Every time I fly through here I have to help lost people figure out how to get on the train to the terminal to baggage claim. This is literally one of the worst airports now."
23rd May 2021,10,"""a pleasure going to Denver Airport""",Not Verified |  My husband and I were treated with respect and compassion. I am very sick and I guess it showed on my face. Going through security they pushed us to the front with no questions or explanation. At the gate they let us enter first. It was such a pleasure going to Denver Airport and leaving. We would recommend them at any time.
3rd May 2021,4,"""I was appalled to see how filthy the terminal seats are""","✅ Trip Verified | I arrived for an early morning flight to New Orleans and naturally sought out a seat as soon as I arrived at my gate. I was appalled to see how filthy the terminal seats are - disturbing at any time, much less during a pandemic. The seats (I was in terminal A) had visible sweat streaks on the backs and seats, stains of various colors (brown, gray) from unknown, organic substances (some trailing down the back of the seat), and overall just looked completely unsanitary to sit in. I did not visit the restrooms, but would imagine that if they get regular service, the toilet seats are less bacteria- and germ-ridden than the terminal seats, which appear never to be cleaned. Shame on Denver Airport for disregarding passenger safety during a global pandemic by not cleaning these. I had to break out my own disinfecting wipe to clean the seat before using it. Shameful."
1st April 2021,4,"""If you can't practice good customer service maybe you shouldn't be working there""","Not Verified |  My daughter has an 8 month old and is pregnant, they made her collapse the stroller by herself with her daughter in her arms, take off her belt, push all of her things forward and the security guard or whatever they're called was horrible about the whole thing. Didn't try to help her at all, nobody picks your job for you, you do it because you choose to. If you can't practice good customer service maybe you shouldn't be working there."
16th March 2021,8,"""there are not enough signs""","✅ Trip Verified | After landing in Denver, I tried to find my way out to my ride. I wound up going past TSA and found myself on a long escalator that led to a bus bus station, and was lost for about half an hour. Upon coming back in I met a small older woman who was also lost. The way out is not evident and there are not enough signs."
15th March 2021,2,"""We should be used to snow""","Not Verified |  Denver International Airport is in Denver, Colorado. We are used to getting snow. We are used to getting blizzards even. The snow stopped at 10 pm, 3/15/2021. It is now 11 am on 03/15/2021 and they still haven't got the snow removed. That is pathetic. You had trucks out all night. Many trucks working 24 hours. I feel bad for those workers on the snow team. They either need more help or more equipment. It should not take this long to get it back and running in Colorado out of all places. We should be used to snow."
13th February 2021,10,"""Workers like this should be valued and appreciated""",Not Verified |  My 16 year old daughter was stuck at the airport coming home due to weather. The staff member in customer service was absolutely the best person I have ever talked to! She triple booked my daughter for the next day to make sure she gets home somehow and made her feel safe. Thank goodness for the unaccompanied minors room. Workers like this should be valued and appreciated.
6th February 2021,7,"""Denver Airport security was molasses slow""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport has the most inefficient TSA security check process I have ever experienced. I've been to many other airports and their security often makes you feel rushed they are moving you through so quickly and efficiently. Denver Airport security was molasses slow. Lots of standing around waiting for your bin to enter the scan device and then waiting again on the other side of the body scan for your bin to complete its scan. So slow! After I went through the whole process I saw 2 main items that would help speed up the process at Denver Airport: 1) Automated return of security bins. Security checkpoints at other airports have automated bin returns which really speed things up. At the faster airports there is a worker feeding them into an automated bin return and they are quickly made available at the start of the line. Denver Airport had workers using very inefficient carts with bad mobility. My daughter and I couldn't help chuckling at a worker that was slowly navigating a cart with a stack of bins bumping into doors and other items as she struggled to slowly steer the cart from the end of the line back to the start. 2) Have travelers separate out items into different bins with no layers for security scan. Security checkpoints at other airports have you place your electronics in separate bins with now layer/piling of items on top of each other. For example, in Seattle they have you remove your laptop(s) from your bag. Same for your cell phone and bags of liquids. At Denver Airport they had everyone place everything in one tray each all piled on top of each other. Goo grief! No wonder the guy looking at the scanner had to stare at the screen for ages! It took forever. Extremely inefficient and slow for no good reason. Whomever is in charge of security at Denver Airport should take a trip to some other airports and pick up some efficiency improvement ideas. It would go a long way in getting travelers through their security area more quickly. The would also likely need fewer security stations, less equipment and fewer security workers. Aside from the slowness and inefficiency at security, the rest of the experience was fine. There was some construction, but it didn't disrupt our ability to get from point A to point B."
18th January 2021,2,"""DIA is a monstrosity""","Not Verified |  I’m a long-time traveler, having been to all 50 states, elite status on most airlines, and traveled to or through a lot of US airports. DIA is a monstrosity. Arriving, it took forever to find a way to get to baggage claim - I walked the terminal over taking the train as suggested to avoid crowds but there were no easy ways to get back down to baggage claim, eventually took an elevator. The RDA train to the city is super convenient, but the escalator to get down to it had a closed sign blocking it with no alt offered - eventually found an elevator to take me down. Departing was a nightmare. Getting off train, no easy signs for where check in is, but it dumps you at United, which had lines out the wazoo for everything. Security was snaked for miles and miles. I would hate this airport in particular if I was flying United - on what should be a light day of travel, long lines for everything, most not distanced. I actually had to stop and look up where Southwest check in was on my phone - never have I been unable to navigate an airport based on signage alone. TSA was a nightmare. The north security has shorter lines but I, like many others in front of me, had bags pulled for extra screening. I waited an additional 20 minutes for this check, bunched together with others. They had to check the pockets of my backpack, which were filled with coins and other random junk and has passed through TSA screening at least 10 times with everything in it with no extra search needed. I then darted off to the train to get to the gate and, not being familiar and with no signing, I accidentally got off at the A gates because A51 was prominently called out on my boarding pass - but actually gate was C42, that was just my boarding position. Absolutely no signage or announcement about airlines are at what terminals and every terminal looks exactly the same. I barely made the flight - I was the last passenger on. I hate this airport - it’s massive, confusing, and crowded."
21st November 2020,4,"""people not wearing masks""","Not Verified |  Dirty and disgusting, people not wearing masks. No airport staff or security in the four hours we have been here. Chairs ripped up, no toilet paper in restrooms. Do not feel safe. *There are a lot worse seats and dirty spots than these pictures."
20th November 2020,3,"""I did not feel safe at Denver International Airport!""","✅ Trip Verified | In the season that we are in (COVID-19 Pandemic) I am very pleased to see how airlines and airports are keeping travelers safe and enforcing safety measures. On November 19, 2020 my nephew and I flew from BWI-DEN to connect to DEN-EUG to visit my son on United Airlines. Upon arrival at Denver International Airport, I was shocked to see so many travelers not practicing social distancing. It looked like a regular day at the airport pre-COVID where no one was practicing social distancing. There were lines at the eatery, Smash Burger in particular, where there were no social distancing guidelines and the patrons did not take it upon themselves to do such. What was more distressing was that at the sitting area at the gates there was no signage as to be 6ft apart or the seats with the signage to be 6ft apart. Some travelers did not have their mask on or did not have their mask on properly - meaning over mouth and nose. It did not look like security was reminding people to social distance. There was even one man strolling through the airport with the mask in his hand swinging it back and forth. CDC and other health officials have warned about traveling safely during the holidays. I did not feel safe at Denver International Airport! While at this point I do not know if Colorado has mandated strong COVID prevention practices, I will say I was surprised that travelers were not taking precautions. Please note that until there is a way to slow down the infection rate of COVID-19, I will not be going to or transferring planes in Denver, CO. Stay informed. Wear a mask. Be safe."
23rd August 2020,4,"""USB ports are all destroyed""",✅ Trip Verified | Someone needs to replace the charging ports near the gates. I plugged my cube in and it keeps falling out. The USB ports are all destroyed. Just came from Tampa and had no such issues there.
13th March 2020,3,""" No training on how to clean""","Not Verified |  Poor signage. Everyone shows up to south security. The other two security check points almost empty. Bathrooms look worse than a truck stop. Cleaning staff, used towel to clean toilet no sanitizer, used same towel to clean sink, mirror, shelf, towel dispenser! No training on how to clean! Most people leaving bathroom with out washing hands! No wonder why everyone getting sick!"
1st March 2020,1,"""This is an airport I will purposely avoid""","Not Verified |  Arrived 5 min early. Went thru security in 3 min with global entry then waited over 1 hr for bag. I had priority service as a close connection. United 3 staff at 11.30 am were lazy, terrible, and not assisting at the baggage carousel. The one agent ripped my tag off my bag, said run to your gate and from there on a nightmare. No assistance. The bags were to be on carousel 3 from Costa Rica then 2. Japan Airlines arrived 15 min after us and bags were off loaded. Shame on United Airlines. Went thru tsa again as international security and tsa not the same in Denver. No direct connections for international passengers transiting thru. Waste of money and intelligence really. Tsa agent took my 100 ml Jam as they don’t understand its less than 3 ounces. World uses metric, come on Denver, get educated. I gave it up. Tsa agent dished me from the tsa line as one of my boarding passes said tsa approved and the other didn’t have the stamp. So, sent me to the end of the other line. She knew I had 15 min. Another volunteer staff, assisted me and brought me thru to the front of the line. Those who have nexus, global entry should already be pre tsa approved. This is an airport I will purposely avoid. I ran past 50 gates, no assistance from tsa or United and missed the flight by 5 min. Went to the United assistance and explained what happened. The very seasoned agent, said, she knows the system here is awful and gave me a ticket on the next flight. Rating 1/10. Very poor."
15th February 2020,1,"""airport should be avoided""","✅ Trip Verified | Terrible customer service: I was ahead of almost 2 hours and tried to print the boarding pass. But the system was down, and I asked some customer service help, but their response was too rude to hear. I was in line for more than one and a half hours that made me late. So, I bought another new ticket (United Airline). I want to recommend all employees should be trained well, especially their mouth and eye, as well as they should know what their job is. They should not look down the customer/guest as a terrible enemy and a valueless animal. If possible, that airport should be avoided."
8th February 2020,1,"""one of the worst airports in the country""",Not Verified |  Denver airport is one of the worst airports in the country. It takes forever to get from the rental car agency to your departure gate. Security lines and wait is terrible. I will avoid this airport as much as possible in the future.
3rd February 2020,5,"""friendliness is a real issue""","Not Verified | On a recent flight, leaving from the regional airline area in terminal A, there is no walkway or any service for the ones of us that have a hard time walking. Wheel chairs were available, but no directions on how to acquire one, and no visible interest in assisting older or infirm people. Denver friendliness is a real issue. I have been through the airport several time times this past year, 2019, and have found many of the service employees are never available. I strongly recommend that if you can change planes somewhere else, try to do that."
31st October 2019,2,"""Dirty and dingy feeling""","✅ Trip Verified | Dirty and dingy feeling. Nasty smelling. Signage horribly placed and sometimes misleading - worst I've ever seen in an airport, I think. The wonderful light rail station shouldn't be hard to find, but this airport makes it hard to find. The baggage carousels take inordinately long to deliver the luggage. Unclean restrooms. Disgusting seats from the moment you check in with your airline to the moment you leave your gate. Gruff and mannerless TSA agents, even by TSA standards (then again, it is Colorado, which is arguably one of the U.S.' least friendly states). Even TSA Pre-Check passengers wait longer than in Pre-Check lines in other airports, I can also attest to how terrible the lines at DIA are for non-Pre-Check holders. Boring and unoriginal options for snacks, dining and drinks for such a large airport. At least the inter-terminal tram is clean, efficient and dependable, and, as I said, that light rail station is such a nice asset. Friends don't let friends fly in and out of Denver, y'all. I've never liked this airport, but my most recent experience really did me in with it."
29th October 2019,2,"""getting frustrated with the lack of service""","Not Verified |  We are really getting frustrated with the lack of service and having things work they way they should at DIA. I understand things can go wrong but today, all of the following happened: 1) Escalator stopped when going down. Small girl was thrown to the ground and was hurt. 2) Got on train to go to baggage - did not go anywhere. After 10 minutes - we had to walk to baggage claim. 3) Waiting for baggage - when it finally started to come out- it got stuck and took someone 10 minutes to fix. Get your act together."
19th October 2019,3,"""train the officers to be better""","✅ Trip Verified |  Unfortunately, I encountered traffic on the way to the Denver Airport to catch my departure flight home. I got there later than desired, but was still going to make my flight. However, as I was going through the Tsa screening (I had my stuff on the belt, next in line to go through security), my lane and a handful of others stopped operating. This was around 5:00pm on 10/18/2019 The TSA officers made no attempt to explain to the people in line what was going on. Instead, the officers in my lane kept laughing and cracking jokes about ""the supervisors not doing their job"". They should be more sensitive and considerate of all the anxious people waiting to get to their flights. One guest in the lane next to mine remarked that his plane was leaving soon and he might miss his flight, to which the officer sarcastically replied, ""That's unfortunate."" without even giving the guest a glance. Another guests 2 kids had passed through the security gate right before the machines stopped, so he approached the officer after about 10 min and asked if the kids could come back through to stand in line with the parents so they wouldn't be waiting alone. The same officer mentioned above replied in an aggressive manner that ""they've been randomly selected and they'll be selected again when they come back in."" What he's saying is not wrong. It's how he said it that rubbed me, and undoubtedly the father, the wrong way. You could tell the father was annoyed because he simply didn't want his kids to be alone. My negative experience was mainly due to 1 or 2 officers, but there is obviously a work culture that tolerates this kind of behavior. There were other officers around that said nothing to correct the abovementioned officer's rude behavior. I have traveled a lot in my life, and can deal with a bit of rudeness, but this was over the top. Please, train the officers to be better people, which in turn will make them better employees. The Denver Airport processes many, many people each day, and bad employee behavior should not be an impediment."
18th October 2019,2,"""looks like it’s been through a demolition""","Not Verified |  I have travelled in Denver over 15 times per month on average (since this airport was built). It’s the worst run airport I have been through. Escalators are broken consistently (perhaps 1/5 trips I make), bulbs are out in the elevators, and to make matters worse the major construction to shift security upstairs (complete remodel) has come to a halt. The contractors were recently terminated. Currently the terminal looks like it’s been through a demolition. On a good note the train that runs from Denver works well. On a bad note even the long term parking is expensive ($18 per day) and the shuttle buses run infrequently. This airport is run by the city of Denver."
11th October 2019,1,"""Why do the folks from Colorado tolerate this!""","✅ Trip Verified | Terrible experience! First, getting thru security was a nightmare because a screener was being trained. They discussed every bag! No attempt was made or any consideration given to travelers missing their flight. Second, no gate information is available until you get to terminal a, b, or c. So that is not helpful when United flies out of more than one terminal. I had to take a second train ride. Third, I had to use terminal b. It has 95 gates! And guess which gates are at the end? Local flights. What a way to treat guests coming to spend money in this state. Why the taxpayers put up with that I will never know. I don’t understand how voters put up with that. Last, United treats their customers like crap with broken down planes, gate changes, delays, outrageously bad customer service. Why do the folks from Colorado tolerate this!"
6th October 2019,1,"""utterly bad experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I am a frequent traveller and familiar with quite harsh airport proceedings. But what happend in Denver Airport is inacceptable. Arriving at the security checkup with a broken arm in a cast and therefore quite handicapped I was treated in an extremely impolite and despiteous manner. The security officer shouted impatiently at me to move my luggage myself on the moving floor, his female colleague barked at me in bad slang with a ferocious face and pushed roughly around without any explanation when she was controlling me. When I was through they had much fun controlling my husband in the same rude and extensive manner, impeding him purposedly to help me collect my items. We gave no comment to them to avoid things getting even worse. This was an utterly bad experience, I felt rather like a head of cattle than a like human being. The behavior of such incompetent staff is a shame for Denver and is by no way worthy of an International Airport, but gave us the impression of a deepest ignorant and uneducated province."
12th September 2019,1,"""signage was confusing and incomplete""","✅ Trip Verified | I took the light rail from Union Station to the Denver Airport on 9/3/19 for a flight to Salt Lake City at 2.25pm. This was the worst experience I have ever had at an airport in all my travels. There is ongoing construction going on at this airport and this construction probably has a lot to do with my horrible experience. Trying to get from the point where the light rail ended at the airport to finally arriving at my departure gate was a pretty bad experience. The signage was confusing and incomplete while navigating around all the construction. The route to my gate was circuitous and aggravating. I had to stop and ask for help more than once. One employee apologized for all the craziness - she said the original company that was contracted for the construction work was ""fired"", and the city is now back to the drawing board finding a new company to do the job. This experience has left me with a bad taste, and until that airport construction is done, I would suggest you avoid flying out of Denver airport."
5th September 2019,2,"""When possible, I'll avoid Denver""","Not Verified |  I found Denver Airport very difficult for travelers to use and I recommend anyone who has to use it to leave lots of extra time and be prepared to be frustrated and treated rudely. The signs are poorly placed, when they exist. On arrival, finding the rental car shuttles was very badly marked. When I had finally gotten my car - the rental car offices are several miles away - and returned to the airport to pick up my daughter, one of the traffic officials was very unpleasant. There were no other cars in the row I was in or the next row, which were both permitted lanes for picking up passengers. There was room for easily 20 cars. I was typing in the address we were going to into Google Maps, and he came over to insist I leave. We had been there for less than 3 minutes. On departure, we had to walk a very long distance to the gate. If you have any mobility problems, request a wheelchair. Security was very badly run. There were 3 lanes open, but only 2 staff to check boarding passes and IDs. The middle staff member made no attempt to be sure that the left two lanes alternated, and no one bothered to change the lanes to two lanes. When I mentioned the problem to him, he said it was the travelers' fault that they weren't alternating because they were stepping up too fast. The lines at the food counters and in the convenience stores were very long because it is a very busy airport. The staff at the food counters and convenience stores were very nice and helpful. But don't count on having time to get food between flights. When possible, I'll avoid Denver."
23rd August 2019,4,"""screening process is a zoo""",✅ Trip Verified |   Under construction. The screening process is a zoo. Only comparable to maybe Atlanta. The TSA people are rude. The amount of walking you have to do is crazy. So many passengers traveling for 6 am flight and only one place open for food or coffee. Even the gift shop to get a water had a very long wait. Also very complicated process to get a rental car. Allow plenty of time to get shuttle and car.

16th July 2019,1,"""Inconsiderate, unfriendly people""","❎ Not Verified | Worst than LAX by far. Starting from the signs, parking, customer service, TSA, airlines. If you are old, disabled or young and inexperienced forget about it. They want you to get lost and miss your flight. First off it's in the middle of nowhere. Rather pay extra and fly from Colorado Springs overpriced airport and save me the hassle. The airports represent the state. Inconsiderate, unfriendly people!"
9th July 2019,1,"""Customs is horrendous""","✅ Trip Verified | Customs is horrendous, close to 2 hours to process one plane from London. People were missing connecting flights. They only had 3 agents working all US and Canadian citizens and two working the rest. The the next flight arrived and the global express line went through before they would continue with the other line. It was poorly managed and really embarrassing as a citizen of Colorado. So much talk from other passengers about never flying into DIA again and how Chicago and the east coast airports are so much better."
9th July 2019,4,"""staff I encountered were not helpful""","Not Verified |  This was my second time flying with my son who is now 18 months. Our departure experience is why I'm reviewing this airport. We got to the airport with plenty of time to spare because I knew from previous experience how long and time consuming security can be there. The first thing we did was stop at the rest room right by security. The people in front of us in line informed me there wasn't any toilet paper in the stalls. I was hoping they were misinformed but they were correct. There was no toilet paper. There was a woman with a TSA vest on in the restroom. Someone in the restroom asked her if she could let someone know there wasn't any toilet paper and she blankly looked at her and walked away. I was very surprised to see the security line wasn't very long! My 18 month old son has special needs. He has a feeding pump and has Cerebral Palsy therefore he is unable to stand or sit on his own. The TSA agent wanted our stroller to go through the conveyor belt machine. I told the agent I'd rather push it through so I would have someplace to set down my son while I gathered our things after they came through the belt. (I knew I'd have to hold my son but wanted to be able to set him down afterwards) She said no. She then took off all 3 of the stroller wheels and crammed it down so it fit through the machine. My son and I walked through where we were supposed to be and waited for our things. I had a backpack, laptop, my sons diaper bag, my sons feeding pump, my shoes, my keys, my phone, and my stroller without wheels to get after it went through the conveyor belt. So I'm standing there holding my son, who I can't set down anywhere wondering how I'm going to get all of this stuff back where it needs to be. Eventually I asked one of the TSA agents if they were going to put my stroller back together. I got a blank look and he went back to what he was doing. I then loudly said ""Someone better get over here and put my stroller back together"" and an agent put my stroller back together so I could set my son down and get all of our stuff. The staff I encountered during my time at Denver airport were not helpful. I originally flew from Minneapolis to Denver a week earlier and had zero trouble going through security. The staff at MSP was all very helpful and understanding. They let me push my stroller through so I could have someplace to set my son down. They helped me gather my things. And they were also busier than Denver was at the time."
1st July 2019,1,"""100 minutes from aircraft door to baggage claim""","Not Verified |  The strange experience started when our inbound flight from Frankfurt had to approach from the South and was sent many miles past the airport to turn for final approach, delaying our arrival. An extremely long level flight at minimum altitude followed before we reached the glidepath. Taxiing to the terminal was delayed again due to ""traffic"" - we stood on the taxiway for aeons with engines running. Entering the arrival concourse we found a long walk to the end of a huge crowd of arriving passengers queueing for so-called immigration. Coming from an efficient home airport we were overwhelmed. Even families with small children had to stand. If you had to go to the bathroom - forget it. We arrived at a few self-check machines where we had to type in lots of info plus give fingerprints and face photo. A slip was issued and we were so naive to think that was it - like at other airports in the world, and only customs would follow. No way. There was another queue (sort of like what cattle go thru at the slaughterhouse), even slower. When we were at the front, to our surprise, we got to an unfriendly (we had know they are from many previous US visits) inspector who did not bother to speak loud and clear. He wanted all the info the machine had asked just before, plus fingerprints, this time including the thumbs. We had the impression foreign tourists are a burden in this country. The baggage had long been removed from the delivery belt and put aside. The whole procedure took 100 minutes from aircraft door to baggage claim. The signage that should lead us to the TSA checkpoint was poor. TSA - long lines, we got to the front a bit faster as we were business class. The whole checkpoint was a complete zoo. Due to the new full body scan you had to remove the complete contents of your pockets, handkie, notepaper everything. Then the train ride - more or less swift. The departure gate was not friendly and inviting, not enough seating and poor shops. The airline refused to let us wait in the first class lounge as we were not members. Thanks goodness here in Europe you can use the lounges if you go business."
30th June 2019,1,"""this airport leaves a lot to be desired""","Not Verified |  Like the previous reviews, this airport leaves a lot to be desired. My biggest frustration is the train that runs between terminals. At night the airport decides to run the trains on a significantly reduced schedule regardless of how many passengers are waiting for it. I’ve seen 20 minutes between trains, with the waiting area so packed that only half of the people can board the 1st train, so they have to wait another 20 minutes. The folks in charge of the measily savings this provides should be immediately terminated for their complete disregard for customer service."
22nd June 2019,1,"""mile-long security line""","❎ Not Verified | This airport is a giant heap of disorganized garbage. There should be a sign or some sort of notice that if you accidentally take the train to baggage claim instead of the gates, then you will be forced to go through the mile-long security line again. Ask an employee where to find something and they'll send you to a wrong area where someone will yell at you and act like you're an idiot for not knowing this place inside and out on your first visit. Our flight was canceled and there was no comfortable place for my daughter or I to lay down and rest there during our 25 hours (every hotel and motel was booked solid). Horrible layout, inefficient service, and incompetent employees. Will never ever fly into or out of this airport again - Colorado Springs is worth the extra money."
20th June 2019,3,"""this airport continues to go downhill""","Not Verified |  I have lived in Colorado for 44 years and will say this airport continues to go downhill. It is a zoo, flight delays are not uncommon, TSA is in absolutely no rush ever and baggage is the slowest of all the airports I have traveled in the past two years even when your flight is hours late arriving. It is sad and there is really no excuse with the taxes we pay."
19th June 2019,3,"""had no room to enter stall and close door""",✅ Trip Verified | I am traveling with my handicapped daughter from CA to Virginia. We had a layover in Denver that became an overnight stay due to weather. I am reviewing the handicap stall in the bathroom by the United Airlines terminal. My daughter uses a wheelchair and had no room to enter stall and close door. If I was not there she would of had to leave the door open. The airport needs to address the stall. Also there should be an additional stall as one is inadequate.
3rd June 2019,4,"""restrooms are the dirtiest""",Not Verified |  I travel to Denver airport at least every three months: the restrooms throughout the airport are the dirtiest and have the most malfunctioning toilets I have ever run across in my travels to other airports.

I am flying urgently to see my daughter who has been taken into hospital so I was already feeling anxious. The guy who checks passports was sat in his chair, morbidly obese, yelling at people in the line (it was 5.30am so not busy). Leaving people totally flustured. The lady standing by the scanners gave me a humiliating telling off for simply saying “excuse me, do I need to take my boots off for the scanner?”. Apparently I was “interrupting her”. A disgraceful lack of customer service and professionalism. I’m terrified to come back to this airport again."
14th March 2019,2,"""experience so gross""","Not Verified | I do not remember flying into Denver and the experience be so gross! The bathrooms, the floors, the chairs! I don't know what happened, but Denver cut back on expenses and it shows through their hiring! The staff that works there are, I'm sorry to say, but the same customer service level as McDonald's! Maybe if they paid better, they would receive higher standards of employees. I watched a woman cleaning the floor with a dust pan bucket and broom, leisurley passing trash and picking up just some as my 8 month old b-lined it for old food, cups, etc. on a 5 hour layover. The bathrooms reminded me of truck stops, and the chairs smelled of - God only knows. They had holes and tears and rips across them as if the whole airport is falling apart and they are unable to afford maintenance. I will connect through Salt Lake City from now on. The train system works well, and the restaurants seemed fine."
24th February 2019,1,"""awful experience""","Not Verified |  Horrible experience at Denver airport. I’m going to avoid going to Denver at all costs after this awful experience! I’m in the third trimester of my pregnancy and had the absolute worst experience. I got to the airport about an hour and a half before my flight departed and I found an extremely long line that you would have thought there was still a govt shutdown. This was on both sides of the airport. I was really worried about missing my flight after seeing the line but more importantly about waiting too long in line given my pregnancy, but the TSA person assisting on the line told me it would be no more than 20 mins. It took over an hour to go through and when I asked agents to assist me given my late pregnancy state, they kept telling me there was nothing they could do and I would have to wait in line. I missed my flight after having to run through the airport and had to deal with hyper ventilation at the closed gate where my flight was departing from. What a nightmare of an experience! Are these people human beings! Do they have any empathy?"
9th February 2019,1,"""TSA acting like demi-gods""","Not Verified | My wife and I live in the Denver area so we are forced to use this airport, we both have TSA PreCheck. I'd highly recommend getting here at least 3 hours before your flight, even if it is at 6AM. This last time we had a 6AM flight and when we got to PreCheck we were treated as normal flyers, had to remove belts, shoes, glasses, hearing aids, empty pockets of everything. TSA agents acting like demi-gods, screaming and yelling. We travel internationally and have never experienced the ineptitude, rudeness and callousness of such people in other countries. Wife and I have decided to drive to Vancouver next time we travel overseas."
2nd February 2019,1,"""avoid this airport in the future""","Not Verified |  I will pay extra to avoid this airport in the future, international and domestic. Arrived on a packed flight from Frankfurt, Germany. Passengers were limited to the use of two computers for mandatory self processing (scan passport, take your photo, declaration questions...) at the first check point. I heard an agent say this was to slow down people getting to the next backed up line at the customs counter. An efficient agent should have announced those needing to make a connecting flight have priority, and then got them to the front of both lines. The customs backlog created bags lying around baggage claim. Self absorbed and rude staff in that area were too busy talking with coworkers to answer my desperate need for directions; a body scanner was down when I finally reached the congested security check point for my next flight. A lot of staff standing around instead of reloading needed trays. Never saw one cart and driver, so had to run to final destination. Again, an efficient manager could have projected the need to have carts and drivers available to assist those of us trying to make connecting flights. Yes, signage is lacking or poorly done; yes, too many staff are without basic customer service skills, lack creative problem solving skills, and take no initiative. Denver airport needs an intervention."
23rd January 2019,4,"""Mass confusion""",Not Verified | Mass confusion in airport because of weather delays. Staff not handling situations well. Many plugs not working. Birds flying all over and dive bombing people! Lack of information regarding flights Trying to get home to dying father and I am stuck here for 6 hours
4th December 2018,2,"""poor customer service""","Not Verified |  Complicated, confusing, and exhausting, poor customer service. My luggage was misrouted, multiple staff gave me bad advice and misdirected me, I had to run from gate 38 to 13, then missed a flight because I didn’t have time to get there."
30th November 2018,1,"""Absolutely dreadful""","Not Verified | I agree with all the reviews below. Absolutely dreadful! It is hard to bring me to tears but this airport did it. The frustration of signage, untrained staff, security issues. I left my coat as I was helping an elderly man with his cane. To go back to where I left it, South security, took over an hour to find anything with the signage. My arrival a week before was confusing. Baggage signs, go upstairs? Who has baggage upstairs? Which terminal, East or West? I got asked that for 2 pickups and nowhere does it say East or West. The hotel transport lady finally asked what color signs I as looking at. Nowhere does it say you will be taking a train to baggage. I went on an escalator and was by myself in a small highway. Apparently this was a train waiting area with no one there and no signs. Scary to say the least. Go to level 5 which turns into level 6 and after you take 2 elevators, an escalator and a moving walkway you might find a gate that also has 3-4 flights out of one gate and they are all leaving within the hour. I too, will never go near the Denver airport. I thought I might like living in Denver but this sent me running."
16th October 2018,1,"""absolutely appalled at Denver""",Not Verified |    I’m absolutely appalled at Denver and United Airlines as we were 2 hours late for our connecting flight and had a 7 hour delay. By the time we got to our final destination one of my bags was missing a wheel as my suitcase had been thrown onto the carousel to board the plane and my wheel snapped off. My other bag had no handle left on it and the lock was missing. And to add to that these were brand new bags.
30th August 2018,1,"""poor signage and service""",Not Verified | Extremely poor experience. We arrived at 12:30am to return our rental car. The signage was very poor. We drove around for 30 minutes or more until we could find our rental server. Then we waited until the American desk opened. The person who took our luggage said to proceed to our gate in the A terminal. There was no available security area opened. The sign on the west side said it was closed and to proceed to the opposite terminal. We walked over to the east side and that wasn’t open either however there were approximately 20 TSA agents behind the glass. Another passenger walked by and said we needed to go to the South security. I understand renovations are occurring but that was extremely poor signage and service. I won’t fly through Denver ever again.
11th August 2018,2,"""Very frustrating experience""",✅ Trip Verified | Our flight from Frankfurt Germany to Denver Colorado arrived 30 minutes late. We had a connecting flight one and a half hours later. Despite having that time frame we missed our next flight due to no organization to help transfer either by travellers who have been delayed by no fault of their own. It took us over an hour to get through passport controls and security checking. For instance there could have been organization for a quicker line for travellers with boarding passes for next flights within the next 1-2 hours. Very frustrating experience.
8th June 2018,3,"""unprofessional and inconsiderate""","✅ Trip Verified | Stepped onto the train leading to terminals, I had been waiting for a train so I would have a seat. When I got on there were 3 employees sitting having a chat about employees and reprimands etc.. Very unprofessional and inconsiderate of these “ladies”."
23rd May 2018,1,"""Mean customer service""",✅ Trip Verified | Exit the new train. No escalator to check in desks. Take slowest elevators on Earth. Walk past 40 Southwest desks (the entire East wing) to get to Delta. Check in. Go downstairs. No TSA operating today on West wing. Walk back across both West and East wings. Go through TSA meaning walking back the entire length of East Wing. And then get on trains. Whoever designed this concept could only have worked for a demented government agency. Mean customer service too. But grade of F just for design. Seeing kids eating meals sitting on the ground at the gates was the final straw.
7th May 2018,9,"""Absolutely no complaints""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrival from Reno, very easy and quickly out to car rental. Departure was to ZRH via IAD. Check-in staff very helpful and security (TSA Pre) surprisingly quick, although from the number of barriers I suspect that it can get very busy. Very easy to transit between terminals and actually a bright and breezy airport, nice views across the runway. Absolutely no complaints - now about United Airlines, that is a different story (!) but nothing to detriment the good airport experience."
6th May 2018,2,"""could not find any comfy chairs""","❌ Not Verified |  Well to start, flights were cancelled to DFW due to weather so had to sleep at airport if you can call it that, AA did not offer any voucher for hotel since our flight was 5 am the next day. We could not find any comfy chairs. Those AP chairs are so uncomfortable and armless, good luck in terminal A. Admirals Club only open during the day and not at night, food court left a lot to be desired at Terminal A. They should update the seating and put rockers in like Charlotte. Even places to sleep overnight with sofas and TVs. Very large lot of walking from Main Building to flight Terminals. I felt like John McClain running down the walking sidewalks. Not laid out well and nowhere quiet to sleep. Could not wait to get out of Denver. Only 2 TSA entrances so come early, very crowded. Restrooms were nasty and unclean. Saw no one in cleaning them."
5th May 2018,4,"""always very painful""","❎ Not Verified |  I fly regularly into DEN on international flight (Lufthansa and British Airways). I must sadly say that arriving into Denver international airport on international flights is always very painful, literally a 3rd world experience. Coming off the plane, passengers are herded into narrow hallways and escalators. The first waiting line for the automated immigration desks often takes 30 to 40 minutes. Then, to everyone’s surprise there is a second, long queue downstairs, that also often take 20 to 30 minutes. Luggage takes forever to reach the carousels. I would suggest that the management of the DIA airport travels to Singapore or Doha, Dubai or Bangkok to see how it is done. Colorado deserves better at its first International Gateway."
3rd May 2018,1,"""I had 1 hour to make my gate""","❎ Not Verified |  Denver TSA is the biggest racket of hustlers this side of the Mississippi. “We reserve 2-4 hours to complete this process” was my excuse as to why it took them 1.2 hours to move us thru. Coming in on a connecting international flight I unfortunately don’t have 2-4 hours. I had 1 hour to make my gate. No checked bags, traveling solo, passes pre printed it doesn’t matter. It’s as if they have mud in their shoes and are under the influence of something other than compassion and customer service. Nothing will come of this review, I just suggest trying any possible way to not go to the Denver airport aka DIA. I personally will pay double for any ticket to fly non stop from my hometown. Unfortunately that was not an option on this flight. Congratulations TSA! You are the worst customer service I can think of."
4th November 2017,1,"""wasted frivolous frisking""","✅ Verified Review |  The TSA at the Denver checkpoint to terminal A has raised the bar on incompetency. I arrived at the airport in plenty of time ""I thought"" to catch my 8:05 a flight this morning but after waiting 20 minutes to only go 12 feet I knew it was going to be a frustrating experience. When I finally got to the scan machine the poor gentlemen in front of me underwent a search that a referee would surely call ""illegal use of the hands"". I did not get out unscathed either - I got held up by Deputy Dog and he proceeded to frisk my right pant leg and my neck. After that he scanned my cashews and pistachios as they must have looked threatening. Therefore, the worst airport experience for me by far goes to DIA. Moreover, as others have reiterated in this thread the real threats are not likely to be detected with all the time wasted on frivolous frisking."
18th August 2017,10,"""well done Denver""","✅ Verified Review |  Brilliant airport! Easy booking in with BA then easy walk to security. We had access to the priority line and were through in about 15 minutes. A bit disorganised but speedy. The high point was once through security a brief walk down stairs to the train to take us to our departure gate (via the Admiral's lounge or is it Admirals'?). We were not forced to meander through a shopping mall of cheap booze, perfume and cigarettes - well done Denver an example to just about every other airport in the World I think! Boarding was also well handled with well managed queue for First, Business and Economy Class passengers."
24th July 2017,3,"""no food options available""","✅ Verified Review |  There are no food options available after 9.30pm except McDonald's and cold prepackaged food. I couldn't even get a beer at the sports pub! When I walked up, he bar tender told me to ""Make it quick!"" Very rude. I left. I tried 3 other places that ""looked"" open and got turned away. After walking back and forth in false pretenses that the next place would be in, I settled for prepackaged hummus and crackers with water. It's pretty pathetic when you can't even get a beer past 9.39pm on a weekend in an International airport! Two thumbs down!"
2nd July 2017,5,"""TSA is a total joke""","❎ Unverified |  TSA is a total joke. Every other airport I've been to has automatic belts to carry your belongings through the scanners. These idiots make you push everything straight into the scanner and then get in an unorganized line to pass through the x-ray. If you're unaware you need to push your things, they confiscate them. What other airport does this? Have a question for TSA? Good luck getting it answered. They'll just glare at you and move on. They'll let your ""random"" bag selected for extra screening sit for 10 minutes while they stand around talking. I pray to god I never have to deal with this again. Overall the airport wasn't bad, but those staff in security need to figure something out."
26th February 2017,7,"""every international airport is better""",✅ Verified Review |  Takes over an hour from landing to get your bags at Denver airport. This is the 3rd time in a row. Every international airport is better. I have flown into 8 in the last year. DIA needs to get this fixed. It's frustrating that customs is faster than baggage.
27th November 2016,4,"""flights are always late""","I use to live in Denver and still reside in the west which has me connect through Denver frequently. Flights from DIA are always late. I don't know why or how they can't figure out what's going on process-wise to manage their airport better. I travel frequently for work and go to much larger airports and experience zero problems (Dulles, DAFW, Midway, LAX, etc)."
2nd November 2016,3,"""gates are too far apart""","I fly thru this airport a lot and get the same feeling each time. Gates are too far apart to walk if you have a connection. Phone/media chargers are virtually non-existent. Today I asked for a cart to take me to Gate 89 due to an injured foot and had to wait 30 minutes, then they could only take me to gate 60 and I had to walk rest of the way as they said it would take 45 minutes for wheelchair. 29 minutes before my flight they changed my gate to 56 so I had to walk again."
7th September 2016,8,"""was pleasantly surprised""","✅ Verified Review |    After reading reviews on this page I had low expectations for Denver Airport, but was pleasantly surprised. Arrival was smooth, and baggage claim quick. The TSA line on a US holiday morning was about ten minutes. The concourses are wide with lots of seating an natural light and a good variety of shops and food. Returning a rental car took time, especially waiting at the gas station near the airport but this is a big airport. It's one of my top US airports along with MSP and Tampa."
27th May 2016,1,"""a time killer""","Not enough TSA. No pre-check. Train between terminals is a time killer. Airport is a long way outside of Denver. Regional Transit to Denver is unreliable. Add all this up, and you had better leave Denver at least 2-1/2 hours before your flight if you don't have any baggage to check."
3rd April 2016,1,"""worst airport design""",Denver is one of the worst airports as far as passengers are concerned. You have to take a train to get to the gates. That would be ok if it was an airport that grew and needed one but this place is out in the middle of nowhere. Expensive charges for rental cars. If I need to go to Denver I will try to go to Colorado Springs and drive - it is usually faster and much cheaper. I think it is the worst airport design in the country.
31st March 2016,7,"""much needed improvements""","This airport is nice with some nice restaurants and looks clean, but has limited shopping. It also needs chairs to sit on with charging stations for computers or cell phones etc. Could not find one place to get a quick charge on my dying phone. So frustrating. They could also use a help center for fast info on directions or airport help. There is much needed improvements this airport could do to make it better."
18th December 2015,3,"""parking is too expensive""","Parking is too expensive. The airport is not set up for easy navigation. It took 2 hours to get through bag check and security to the gate. We spent a fortune in parking and extra fees just to fly to San Antonio, where parking was a fourth the cost it was in Denver. It only took us 20 minutes to go through bag check and security in San Antonio and it was just as busy as DIA when we went through. When we returned to DIA, our plane sat on the taxiway for 48 minutes waiting another plane to leave our gate so we could deplane. This was my third round trip through DIA and if there's any way I can get around it, it will be the last."
30th November 2015,2,"""experience was of nightmarish quality""",The experience here was of nightmarish quality. Packed with people. The security line was longer than I thought possible in my wildest dreams. There was a market style food place on concourse B that had salads that were actually very good. That was a plus. Overall this airport is a lot of show and feels overwhelming and tricky to navigate. Something really needs to be done about the security line. It's completely demoralizing and inhumane to have to stand for two hours and then strip.
29th November 2015,6,"""Information desks not staffed""","Denver Airport is a huge airport. Due to a lack of maps/signage I was confused as how to get to the main terminal, finally figured out that the train is on the lower level. Information desks not staffed on a busy Thanksgiving weekend, asked several airport retail staff, and they either did not know, or gave wrong directions. Now that I'm familiar with the place it's fine, but at least have some ""You are here"" - type maps/diagrams around, especially if information desks are not staffed."
25th November 2015,3,"""two thumbs down from me""","If you are passing through, this airport is fine but if you have to drop somebody off or pick somebody up it's a lousy setup. The only free passenger pick-up area is called the ""cell phone waiting lot"". That means you park yourself about a mile from the airport and wait for whoever you are pickup up to call you. Then you get into the revolving circle, and you better hope your loved one is standing on the curb. Even in the middle of winter, they better be out there because if you try to stop for more than a few seconds to look/wait, airport security is going to rush out and tell you to keep driving. ""Wait, sir -- I see my 68-year-old mother right there on the bench through the window."" ""No, no,"" replies security, ""keep driving...she needs to be out here. Keep driving"". Seriously, this is such a mess, it is infuriating. Then, after creating this mess, the airport sees a way to make a profit off it. Yes, introduce valet parking ($12/hour) or actual passenger pickup parking ($4/hour). Total rip-off. So while the airport is kind of cool, it still gets two thumbs down from me."
23rd November 2015,10,"""able to get around it pretty quickly""","Denver Airport is a good airport, and we had no problems. I always fly through Denver. True, it is a bit far from Denver, and the Security lines are a bit long but it is still good. Check in was 5 minutes, there were hardly any lines and I flew through in mid-afternoon. Security was about 10-15 minutes which was good. Despite Denver being a big airport, I am always able to get around it pretty quickly. I did not have any delays when I flew, and have hardly had any delays in the past. There are some good food options, we went to a Mexican place on Concourse C. The rental car stations are far from the terminal though, thank goodness we don't have to rent a car. While I don't use the rental cars, make sure to set aside a good 30 minutes just for the rental car part, when departing and arriving. It can take a long time to get from the terminal or to the rental car, or also to some of the parking areas. Parking is always good, with lots and lots of spaces. Driving to and from the terminal, you can see a large multiple story parking garage, with parking areas scattered throughout the terminal. The employees at DIA are friendly. (The employees at Denver, not always the Flight Attendants). There is lots of art, and lots of room, compared to the always crowded airports around the US. I recommend flying through Denver, as it is very clear where to go, with the signs. DIA is fairly organized, and clean as well. Flying through it often, I have rarely had any problems at DIA."
8th November 2015,7,"""it's not a bad airport""","I fly through this airport a few times a year and it's not a bad airport. It does have a few down sides like the fact that TSA dosent seem to care if you miss your flight or not. Other than that, it's a nice airport, I really appreciate the fact that there is a restaurant in every terminal."
3rd October 2015,4,"""20 minutes minimum of wasted time to my trip""","Pikes peak shuttle, complete waste of time so poorly designed. I arrived at 6.55 am, 6 busses at west entrance, 2 more headed easterly. They appeared to travel counter clockwise, I drove to D4 and parked at 6.58. Both the easterly busses drove past as I parked. Next bus arrived at 7.07 am. Exited West entrance standing room only at 7.31 - it took us 24 minutes to travel this last half of the loop, not even a full loop. Several passengers left behind last 3 stops - bus too full already. Four busses parked at entrance still. Honestly, that many busses and staff on standby is a waste, and why are they not alternating entrances and exits? It makes far more sense to alternate entranced by even / odd number bus and just drive a one-way through to each side. Arrived terminal 7.39 waited for passengers to unload didn't get off bus until 7.43. I'm a frequent business traveller this added 20 minutes minimum of wasted time to my trip, but mostly aggravation at witnessing such sloppy logistics repeated over and over for me and others. It's not rocket science. DIA wifi - very android unfriendly. Not Mac friendly. More aggravation."
14th September 2015,6,"""so behind in moving passengers quickly""","Ok, I am a Denver native and fly through DIA every 4 weeks. I love Denver and I like DIA. But, there is a huge but, DIA is very busy because it is the biggest city between Chicago and LA route. Being said that, I always put 4 hours aside when I am flying out of DIA. Reason? 1) DIA is 45 minutes from downtown (Almost 1 hr from Southern Suburbs). 2) During winter times, there is always an accident on I-70 W or Pena Blvd. 3) Now, you would say what 1 and 2 has to do with DIA? Yes, but they are part of the problem. And the major thing is, there is always a lot of people flying out of Denver and TSA will have only 2 or 3 agents checking boarding passes/IDs. I mean, c'mon. You want us to miss our flight? On an average, security check takes 35-40 minutes (Did I say, I fly every 4 weeks?). This is just ridiculous. On Christmas day 2014, the security line was about a mile long and there were 2 TSA agents, only two. I just don't understand, a big, beautiful, organized, airport like DIA is so behind in moving passengers quickly? Anyway, that is my rant. Everything else is fine. I wish those security lines would move a little faster. P.S.- Even pre-checks have a line at DIA."
15th July 2015,3,Denver Airport customer review,"This is addressing the passenger pickup. I have flown in and out of DIA hundreds of times and yet on Sunday, 7/13/15 at 6.30 pm the ""traffic cop"" was clearly out of line and making it impossible for passengers to actually be picked up. She would not allow the cars to stop. This was so absurd I nearly laughed but became furious when she made my daughter drive around once and then again almost a second time because I wasn't actually in the lane of traffic. I know there is not waiting and now parking but there is absolutely no excuse why a car can't actually stop to load the passengers and their luggage. These rules need to be re-addressed."
3rd March 2022,1,"""What a horrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I was at JFK at my gate and had already gone through security checks. Waiting for my flight when cleaning crew came up to me and told me that I had to leave. I explained I had already been through security checkpoints ,I had my boarding pass they kicked me out and told me they were going to call the police on me because I was in the area that I should not of been in which was the gate 1 flight 7 Alaska to Seattle. They informed me that they did not have to wear masks since they were the cleaning crew. What a horrible experience."
15th February 2022,1,"""been waiting for my luggage for close to an hour""",Not Verified |  I have been waiting for my luggage for close to an hour now. I think they really need to step it up in the baggage claim department. I have not seen 1 bag come down the conveyer belt for 30 minutes now. I don't think it's that hard to grab a bag and put it on the belt.
10th January 2022,1,"""Utter shambles""","Not Verified |  Utter shambles. I was in transit but baggage can't go through seamlessly, unlike at every other airport I have transited through. Security was a nightmare, not even trying to maintain any social distancing. The place is a health hazard."
12th December 2021,5,"""helps their friend to skip the process""","✅ Trip Verified |  I'm TSA Pre Check traveler and I was surprised to see an Officer give special treatment to a couple by helping them skipped the lines. The way they were interacting it was obvious the knew each other, how can I feel secure when we a TSA helps their friend to skip the process, what else do they do? Everything else was good, TSAs are busy and working under a lot of stress, so they are stern and they don't need to be friendly and I'm ok with that."
5th December 2021,3,"""Not one beverage vending machine""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived from LAX at 12am with a 9 hour layover. Walked the entire terminal looking for a bottle of water. Not one beverage vending machine. Every vending machine I came across sold either Sim cards or headphones. I found one food vending machine but no beverages. If you don't save your empty water bottle you can't refill at the tap water fountains they do have, if you don't drink tap you will die of thirst until shops open at 6am."
14th November 2021,1,"""Stay away if you can""","Not Verified |  Horrible, horrible experience. The flight was smooth and even arrived a few minutes early. But we had to wait 45 minutes for a gate to deplane, and then another hour for luggage to arrive at baggage claim. It’s just miserable. Stay away if you can."
18th October 2021,1,"""This place is a disgrace""","Not Verified |  Me and my husband arrived several hours late from our JetBlue flight, from Mexico, because of a delay. We were in Mexico & were told by the attendants numerous times that it wouldn't be much longer, only 15 more minutes. Instead of telling anyone the truth they had us all waiting around for HOURS. This was along with numerous others. Finally we boarded & arrived at JFK around 11pm and were told by the rude attendant that there was not another flight until 9:30 am, because we missed our flight. We told her it was of no fault of ours or anyone of the many others who arrived late due to JetBlues issue. After telling her that we were waiting for our other flight from 1:40pm-6pm and that we had no where to go, she conveniently found a flight at 4:30am. Other guests were told the same thing and we're forced to book their hotel at the airport for the night. We then asked where we could go for the next several hours. She told us there was a lounge downstairs. When we got down there, there were already others sitting around, exhausted. We weren't there for long when the security guard told everyone that they couldn't sit in the lounge area, because they were going to clean it .. while all of us had no to go. My husband and I went back upstairs to find a bunch of people, families & small children, sitting, even laying all over the floor because nothing was open for anyone yet and there were no chairs. What is the point of having a large lounge area, with seating, when no one can use it? So now there are a bunch of customers just lying around, on the floor, exhausted, waiting for the gates to open. This place is a disgrace. No wonder why there are so MANY negative reviews. It's sad to see that Nothing is changing."
1st September 2021,3,"""Very bad experience""","Not Verified |  Rude airport staff. No consideration for passenger. No help when requested, no will to help. The agent at the TSA was not nice with my children and the agents were rude. They made us wait so long for an insignificant matter that we missed our flight. Very bad experience."
30th August 2021,1,"""The bags were sitting there for hours unattended""","Not Verified |  I strongly believe there are very serious security lapses at New York JFK Airport. On Friday 27 Aug we arrived at JFK from an International origin as transfer passengers enroute to Washington DCA Airport. Our luggage was tagged from origin all the way thru to DCA. The luggage was off loaded from the aircraft and placed on baggage claim while we waited in line 2 hours to re-enter border passport control where only 5-6 agents were processing over 500 passengers, the employees handling the crowd could barely speak English and were extremely rude and unprofessional. Some airport employee placed our baggage at a transfer kiosk and left it sitting there unattended. There was an airport employee standing at a door doing nothing so we asked her why our luggage was just sitting there so long and she said someone would be there so we waited up to 30 minutes. The bags were sitting there for hours unattended because nobody would come and handle our bags and put them in a secure staging area for our connecting flight. We tried asking why and employees would just turn their backs and ignore us. We decided to take matters into our own hands and recheck our baggage at Delta Airlines Ticket counter. We just walked away from there with our bags and nobody said anything so there was “unaccounted for” bags now. After taking a tram and going up and down stairs to 3 different terminals we found an employee that placed our bags onto the incoming baggage belt where we hoped it would find its way to Washington DCA. We then took more trams to a shuttle bus which took us to another terminal where we went thru an absolute chaotic security without any instruction people were yelling pushing and shoving running and our Delta flight gate changed 3 times and was 2 hours late departing. Delta was late on our first flight and lost our bags at JFK and we got them 2 days later overseas while on vacation. It is impossible to navigate JFK because there are no maps and simple instructions for foreign passengers, you must ask one of the extremely rude barely English speaking airport employees who can’t explain the complexity of finding your next terminal. You will have to run everywhere because transfer is so difficult and time consuming and information is unavailable. This airport is also dirty, smelly and worn out old. I would be willing to pay much more money to avoid New York all together for my next International Flight but it is so hard any International flights in the central USA."
6th June 2021,1,"""There are no restaurants or food service""","✅ Trip Verified | Departing from terminal 7 on LOT. Flight delayed 4 hours, must wait 2 hours outside Security until check in. There are no restaurants or food service, one broken vending machine and one filthy restroom."
31st May 2021,10,"""most importantly he actually found my purse""","✅ Trip Verified | I left my purse on the flight, and ran back to the airport to get it. There was nobody at Delta to help me and I was so scared because all my identification, medications, and my last paycheck were all in that bag. I was desperately looking for help. Then the sweetest man, an agent who checks boarding passes right before TSA, helped me. He was patient, calmed me down, was quick, efficient, and most importantly he actually found my purse. I know I got really lucky because it was the plane's last stop, but if I hadn't come across someone as kind I probably would have never gotten it back. I thank him and everyone who was involved in recuperating my purse from the bottom of my heart. You all could have chosen to take it, steal the contents, or just thrown it in the trash but everybody had a lot of good in them that night."
5th September 2020,1,"""lack of professionalism should not be excused""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst TSA! Negligent, rude, inefficient, dismissive. The manager of TSA (bearded and in his 50’s) was combative and immature to a point of disbelief. The lack of professionalism should not be excused."
10th June 2020,1,"""a horrible horrible experience""","Not Verified |  The worst airport ever. All NYC airport staff generally rank low in terms of attitude and manners. It isn’t uncommon to be greeted with a very confrontational service. On this occasion I had booked NYC as a family holiday and left by the end of the week feeling so upset. A woman and man working at security shouted at my and my family completely unnecessarily. They demanded we fold down our pram with my sleeping 1 year old baby in it and then shouted at us to get her out and the to move on immediately whilst other members of staff watched with complete indifference and smiled. It was a horrible horrible experience. They created an unbelievably tense and hostile environment, which the staff almost fed off. It was not the best holiday given an UBER driver demanded $250 after taking us from JFK to our hotel, and the hotel mixed our rooms up (the Maxwell on Lexington Avenue) Leaving 5 of us to share a double room for 5 days. All in all an awful experience made even worse by the airport staff."
25th April 2020,1,"""The worst TSA ever""",Not Verified |  The worst TSA ever. I was 40 minutes early before doors closing and its took 30 minutes just to get thru the security and when arrived at the door 2 minutes late they wouldn't reopen the door.
5th March 2020,1,"""the slowest staff ever""","Not Verified |  Worst airport I’ve ever arrived into. Huge queues probably due to the slowest staff ever. Despite queues out of the door and we were there for over 2 hours, staff could be seen chatting to each other between customers (not asking for next in line due to talking) and then taking an age to process, the whole time being very unfriendly and downright rude! Worst security checks anywhere."
2nd March 2020,1,"""security is totally unreasonable""","Not Verified | Terminal 4. The security line set up is totally unreasonable. There is one PreCheck line and no separate ""CLEAR"" line. The ""CLEAR"" machine and staff are placed at the front of TSA PreCheck line, allowing CLEAR customers to cut through the PreCheck line. Really? CLEAR has higher priority than PreCheck? If so, TSA should announce it, so people can decide to buy CLEAR instead of PreCheck. I believe the CLEAR machines and staff should be placed at the end of PreCheck line or a separate area away from the PreCheck line, so when they are confirmed CLEAR, they can get in PreCheck line like all the other PreCheck customers. I suspect CLEAR pays TSA or the airport the get their program this unofficial advantage."
20th February 2020,1,"""A truly awful introduction to the States""",Not Verified |  Dreadful experience! Nearly 3 hour wait with two people at the desks. Humourless and arrogant staff when we were finally ‘processed’ with no hint of apology for the time we had waited. Felt like herded cattle and treated similarly. A truly awful introduction to the States.
29th January 2020,1,"""3 hours waiting queue""",Not Verified | Worst ever arrival immigration process globally. 10h30 am arrival and only one immigration officer for the entire terminal with 3 777 planes. 3 hours waiting queue
21st January 2020,1,"""Still currently stood waiting""","Not Verified |  Hundreds of people awaiting to get through arrivals security. 3 out of the 12 booths on our side were open, all the rest shut. Still currently stood waiting, it's been over an hour so far."
13th January 2020,2,"""slow and unhelpful staff""",✅ Trip Verified | Shocking. Ridiculously long queues with slow and unhelpful staff. Half the booths were empty meaning wait times of well over 2 hours. Worst airport I’ve ever been in. Staff treated/talked to you like animals. Arrived back in Australia in Jan 2020 a what a completely wonderful experience. I will look at flying through another airport Newark or LaGuardia as I love visiting New York.
9th January 2020,1,"""Rude, ignorant staff""","Not Verified |  Will never ever use this airport again. Rude, ignorant staff treating people like animals, absolutely shocking. If you treat people like this you will get treated back like it. I have never witnessed so many angry pasengers. Security staff were worst of all, barking and shouting at people like they were vermin. It seems the security staff were on a power trip to see how many people they could ridicule and intimidate. If this is the way the US is going god help them."
28th December 2019,1,"""the lines for security were so long""","Not Verified |  Absolutely despicable. I have never in my life seen an airport be so disorganised, the staff so so rude, and the lines for security were so long!! All over the world they do it so much better, JFK security is manned by power tripping morons! It took us 2 hours to get through check in and security (travelling with 5 of us, 3 children), and we missed our flight by 5 min! When we were going through security the rude arrogant lady opened every single present my children received for Christmas, opening up the toys with a screwdriver. They do this for phones, iPads, Nintendo switch! Why would they do it for a Harry Potter wand and a Star Wars droid, that I wouldn’t be surprised if it even works now, never been used! Why can’t the X-ray scanner see if there is anything inside it like all other luggage! My son was upset seeing her pull apart his droid which seemed to spur her on in her arrogance and self importance! My daughter who wears an arm brace for her recently operated on elbow gets patted down at each airport, not at JFK, they seem to think 3 different people should pat her down, then they stood there and argued about who is more important and who should’ve done it first! The arrogant self important lady who took a screwdriver to my sons toy, was more upset that she didn’t get to do the pat down than anything, taking pleasure in not only treating us and anyone around her with disrespect and contempt, but the staff that she works with as well! It took us 48min alone to just get through security. I respect the process, but it doesn’t need to be this unpleasant! After all of this the morons at security let through my sons medication which was 250ml of liquid and a pair of scissors (but thank goodness his Harry Potter wand was scrutinised for hidden things). I only know they let these things through because after missing our flight boarding (the plane was still there and the ramp just shut) we went to LeGuardia airport to wait with 3 children for 5 hours on standby and their security picked them up! But guess what, they just scanned the Star Wars droid and Harry Potter wand like any other airport in the free world. Shame on you JFK, clearly you need to invest in visiting first world airports in other major cities around the world, clone what they do, and then maybe you may measure up on the world scale! At the moment you fail dismally and are at the very bottom of the pile."
27th December 2019,1,"""I’ve never been treated so poorly""","✅ Trip Verified | I live in London, but I am from New York. I feel such embarrassment when I am in this airport as a New Yorker. I have been all around the world and I’ve never been treated so poorly in an airport or had to watch others treated so terribly. The staff seem untrained. They don’t treat anyone with dignity or even minimal respect. They are rude and abrupt and won’t assist those who are confused or in need even though customs and baggage claim is a mess and horrendously confusing. I have seen actual staff snap at people asking reasonable questions or for help, downright ignoring them while socialising with colleagues, elderly people asking for assistance to be ignored. The best you are treated is someone just doing their job and acting like you don’t exist. For example, taking your bag from you at recheck without a word, checking your passport but looking right through you like you’re not there without even a hello or smile or even a nod. I had a 5 hour layover and they didn’t manage to get my luggage to my next flight on Time. It’s such a sad, sad state. Positives are I had a wonderful waiter at a restaurant and they have water bottle refill stations. Also some decent shops. Just doesn’t make up for the other very upsetting bits and how uncomfortable I felt. Unfortunate as it’s such a great city, but avoid this airport at all costs."
25th December 2019,1,"""Ridiculously long queues""",Not Verified | Terrible. Ridiculously long queues with slow and unhelpful staff. Half the booths were empty meaning wait times of well over 2 hours. Worst airport I’ve ever been in.
24th December 2019,1,"""it was absolutely shambolic""","Not Verified |  Sky train not working - we were herded into lines and told the air would be hours - had to take a taxi or would have missed the flight. Staff prior to security, shouting and people and extremely rude to everyone, including cabin crew as they came through Security - indifferent towards checking the carry-on luggage at x-ray machine - failed to notice not only my daughters liquids which included a 250ml bottle of water and make-up/skincare she had forgotten she was carrying, but more worrying, did not notice I had a large metal tin of liquid pumpkin pie mix (500mls) (accidentally placed in my hand luggage and only noticed by me later on). Security staff in general at x-ray machines were rude, offensive, patronising and aggressive towards other passengers who did not understand English well. Waited 3 hours at 1am to get through customs - it was absolutely shambolic I will never ever fly through JFK again."
21st December 2019,1,"""have never experienced such mayhem""",Not Verified |  I have never experienced such mayhem and queues at an airport for immigration before! The signs to direct people are very confusing which caused my husband to have to queue twice. I am still waiting for my husband as I write this! It took approximately 2hrs 20mins for me to get through passport control and dread to think how long I will be waiting for my husband. There are hardly any desks open and the whole of passport control is full. Absolutely disgusting as there are also young children queuing at 1am in the morning! I wish I could give a zero on the rating.
18th December 2019,2,"""such unmotivated and untrained staff""","Not Verified |  I’ve never seen such unmotivated and untrained staff before. Unfriendly, don’t know their jobs, and most of them speak a language that is not even closely related to english."
17th December 2019,1,"""most horrible experience""",Not Verified |  We had the most horrible experience last night trying to get through security prior to our flight to LAX. I have traveled all over the world and never experienced the delays in trying to get through security. Not only were they understaffed and under trained the two officials attending the screening area prior to being screen were the rudest and lacking total customer experience acted in the worst manner? There were numerous customers pleading to get through as we all were on the same flight and had 10 minutes before the door was closed on the plane and this is after being in line for almost 50 minutes! Never in my life have I waited so long and after numerous requests to let the people go through she completely lost control and screaming at us at and then decided to stop the screening process and send us back to the end of the line! I demanded her supervisor and she blatantly lied and said we were line jumpers. Thankfully after explaining to the supervisor he turned it back on to allow people to continue to be screened a young woman with two young children in front of us was so upset and distraught stead a total mess we were able to make the flight by running and with a couple of minutes to spare I’m in my late 60s as is my wife and we both have disabilities and if this is acceptable behaviour by staff at JFK and accordingly no apology was offered by anyone it’s a disgrace and obviously the women in particular who were on duty last night have no idea what so ever what it’s like to be put in that situation!! On the positive side the staff of Jetblue were amazing and kept the plane trip as comfortably as possible knowing that half the plane experience the check in GP
12th December 2019,1,"""Very rude staff""","Not Verified |  Three hours from landing to exiting the airport on arrival. Long queues. Only 3 customs and border checkouts to handle hundreds of incoming passengers. Very rude staff. No communication possible, they literally barked at customers. At departure, very long queues at security. Old facilities, not enough room to sit at gate while waiting. No family room in toilets. Blank faced staff shouting orders at customers or just plain ignoring them."
4th December 2019,1,"""A very poorly managed airport""","Not Verified |  Extremely disappointing end to New York City visit. Arriving at Jamaica Station well ahead of time we were informed the JFK Sky Train was not in service and shuttles were being supplied instead. We queued for 2 hours, amongst hundreds of other passengers as only 2 buses were sent. No JFK employees were available to update passengers what was happening throughout. Eventually being hoarded onto an over crowded bus which was supposed to be to the terminal, everyone had to get off and stand in the snow and raining for a further 20 minutes to transfer bus. Again no JFK employees were available to co-ordinate the situation. Having finally arrived and boarded the plane, we sat on the plane for 3 hours beyond our scheduled departure. With the captain stating no one at JFK Flight Control was able to be contacted - destining the situation like a ‘circus’. Several other flights were in the same situation. We have now missed connecting flights and face a 6 hour delay. A very poorly managed airport, with terrible communication and a clear lack of staff and coordination. Terribly run organisation, which I hope not to travel through again. Embarrassing showcase for New York City to worldwide travellers."
1st December 2019,1,"""Horrible customer service""",Not Verified |  Horrible customer service. Was sitting in the plane not allowed to get off for over an hour after a 7+ hour flight. No help by JFK to try and help the passengers off and find a gate. Unacceptable.
30th November 2019,2,"""won't be flying to JFK anymore""",Not Verified | When getting off and renting a car you have to walk a long distance to the car rental and my wife is disabled and there is no service to the car rental company. I won't be flying to JFK anymore.
28th November 2019,1,"""2 hours in a queue""",Not Verified |  Worst immigration system I’ve ever experienced! 2 hours in a queue that barely moved. As more fights landed the queues got longer and still a maximum of 2 officers checked people through customs. I will never fly through this airport again. Absolute disgraceful way to treat visitors and puts me totally off coming back to New York.
21st November 2019,1,"""Poor experience in general""","✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst airport experience in a major city. The queue time is long and the line is inefficiently managed. The airport staff is very unpleasant, not nice or polite to travellers with lots of screaming and directing. Many bags were opened for no real reason just to hold out the line. The staff at food shops are half-asleep and made diners wait just to fix their nails and gloves. Poor experience in general and was definitely not expecting this level of service at a major airport."
13th November 2019,3,"""security guard asked me to leave Departures""","Not Verified |  I was early for a flight at 08.05, 12th November 2019. Went up through security and sat by my gate. At 00.30, a civilian security guard asked me to leave Departures as it was more than 4 hours until my flight. This would mean leaving departures. Going to arrivals and re-submitting my luggage and self back through security. This may or may not be correct although the official website does suggest you are at the terminal at least 3 hours before international flights. Anyway the security guard, who was not rude, refused to identify himself by name or personnel number. I pointed out that I would neeed either for a complaint. He stated, 'just tell them security told you that had to'. I spoke to security downstairs, after going back to arrivals. Again professional, however, they said that complaint could not be made as I couldn't identify the guard. Firstly, I pointed out that, that was because he wouldn't identify himself. Secondly, he spoke to me at 00.30 approximately at gate 9, therefore, not an insolvuable problem. I spoke to the security ops and raised my concerns. If I am to admitted 4 hours before flight then that is now only 1 hour 15 away. Where am I supposed to go for that long? Instead arrivals is like, a not entirely clean, zombie movie. A pity most staff really good."
11th November 2019,1,"""nothing but bullying and humiliating people""","Not Verified |  My wife broke her wrist and small finger and her hand was in a cast the day before. Because she was walking unsteadily, we decided it is better that she be in a wheelchair. When we arrive at the security, she was asked to stand up. Trying to comply, she stood rather unsteadily. The immigration officer kept her standing for while. Another officer asked her to go in through another screen but this same officer scolded her and told her to stand there saying words to the effect, ""How many times have I got to tell you to stand there?"" When he finally deigned to let her go through the security screen, she found herself held up at the other side as two officer tried to find out if her plaster cast on her hand was real or not. ""It's real"" they concluded finally! We complained to the supervisor who was seated after that and she promise to take action. Whether she did or not we don't know. This is nothing but bullying and humiliating people who have visited the US to spend money and was unfortunate to have a fall. If this is how the US customs treat people I think there are many other countries we can go to. We have resolved not to go back to the US for a long time to come."
11th November 2019,2,"""one of the worst airports I have been to""","✅ Trip Verified | This is really one of the worst airports I have been to. You can compare it with the one of Cuba Havana with the only difference that there is WiFi, which was not working when we arrived. Security queues where really long when we arrived. All staff (except for 1 funny guy) was unfriendly and not helping customers. Temperature control was really awful. It switched from really hot to windy for a few seconds. Air quality was really breath taking and foods and shops were really not up to standard European airport standards. Really strange that one of the biggest cities in the world has an airport like this."
2nd November 2019,1,"""avoid in the future""","✅ Trip Verified | The passport scanners don't work properly, only passport control person was working. 90 minutes was fun. The airport is dirty and poorly ventilated. Will be sure to avoid in the future and it is a poor reflection on our country. The perfect result of what happens when governments employees run airport."
1st November 2019,1,"""Training is urgently needed""","✅ Trip Verified | My children and I were going through security and had made sure to take off shoes and load trays in readiness for the x-ray machine. In the UK, where we are from, all shoes, coats and bags need to be loaded into trays so this is what we did. Suddenly we found ourselves being shouted at aggressively by a female security attendant who was angry that we hadn’t understood her barked orders to remove bags and shoes from trays. My young son was getting flustered as she was so aggressive in her manner (his first long distance trip) and so she sighed loudly, made some derogatory remark and then removed his shoes angrily from a tray and banged them onto the conveyor belt. Her behaviour was so rude and I politely told her so, whereupon she shouted “I’m not being rude. If you listened the first time there wouldn’t be a problem!” A second attendant then shouted at several of us for standing too close to the gate by the scanner. My sons and I were shocked by the aggressive and rude way we were treated, and other passengers expressed similar feelings. How on earth would people with learning difficulties or other frailties cope with this treatment?! Upsetting end to our holiday in the USA - made us glad to be getting back on a plane to the UK! Training is urgently needed to remind these people that travellers are human beings with feelings, who are paying a lot of money for their flights and who deserve to be treated with basic respect! After security we paid a lot of money for food that arrived cold and after a very long wait. Overall not a positive experience."
28th October 2019,4,"""I really felt treated like cattle""","✅ Trip Verified | On several locations I really felt treated like cattle. “Move up, stand there, don’t go there’s, etc.. Come on staff, treat us the way you want to be treated yourself."
26th October 2019,10,"""through in a very short time""",Not Verified |    Went through immigration and customs in 30 minutes. I’ve read a great many reviews about slow long lines at immigration but we arrived on time from UK and were through in a very short time.
25th October 2019,1,"""JFK is a total fail""","✅ Trip Verified | Rude, unhelpful and officious staff; do they receive special training to unlearn basic customer service? My mother taught me to smile and say “please” and “thankyou”. Incompetent and inefficient setup; have they never seen how other international airports work? Please someone, go visit Changi or Haneda to see how to do it properly. On arrival, there was just one immigration officer for two full planes. Long lines of unhappy people ordered around like cattle. I’ve previously missed connecting flights due to extremely long wait times in immigration. On departure, surly staff are needlessly rude. Security is a joke with little understanding of the concept of flow. Terminal 7 is small with very basic amenities. I’ve travelled internationally every month for the last 25-years, and in my experience, JFK is one of the worst airports in the world. If first and last impressions matter, then JFK is a total fail and does NYC a massive disservice. Avoid if at all possible."
21st October 2019,1,"""my checked bag had been opened""","Not Verified |  I arrived home to find that my checked bag had been opened, it was locked when I checked it and not locked when I got to my destination. I know that TSA will randomly open and check a bag which I have no problem with, however, I had 2 carefully packaged whiskey glasses from Hudson Valley Distillers which were missing. It is a shame when those who have the job of security cannot be trusted. The glasses were of very little value monetarily but a reminder of an otherwise wonderful trip. I was told a long time ago that you are only worth what you are willing to lie or steal for, in this case about $5, oh worthy individuals. Maybe TSA should make those who open a bag register and do so under camera surveillance. Who's the real security threat? Oct 19 Jetblue flight 161 from JFK to Sacramento in case anyone cares"
19th October 2019,1,"""the worst arrivals experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  This was the worst arrivals experience I have ever had. I have visited many airports, including some in developing African countries and JFK stands out from all of them. Standing in a queue for 2 hours (with 2 children) just to get through immigration is totally unacceptable. I thought maybe there were some staff on strike or something, but no, there just weren't enough staff - only about half of the counters were open. Why? When we finally got through our baggage was on the floor next to the carousel - it had had to be taken off so that the carousel could be used for another flight! None of the staff I asked could tell me why the queue was so long (when we were at the back and couldn't see what was going on). One lady, when I said ""excuse me, can you tell me what's going on?"" Just said ""No"" and carried on walking! Absolutely dreadful after an eight hour flight. My daughter went to the toilet after we finally retrieved our baggage and said they were disgusting. And when we got I to a taxi and told the driver where we needed to go, which was an airport hotel, he asked ""where is that?"" and I had to give him the full address! I hadn't realised London was such a paradise. I hope never to fly in to this airport again."
14th October 2019,1,"""staff in the airport were unhelpful""","✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst experience I have had in an airport. 3 hours was not enough to get through immigration and transfer to the connecting flight. The airlines say that they were on time so, it’s not their fault. Nobody will pay for a hotel until we can get on another flight to our final destination. All the staff in the airport were unhelpful, even the supervisor who advised us to come back to her after 30 minutes if we had not gotten to the security checkpoint. She just said we had to kept waiting, and, as a result, we missed our transfer. I used to like the USA. I now have no intention of coming back or spending any money on American products."
14th September 2019,1,"""the worst arrivals experience""",Not Verified |  1hr 30mins to clear passport control even with the automated system. Without doubt the worst arrivals experience I have had. Totally unacceptable that there were only 2 border control officers for the whole of international arrivals.
14th September 2019,1,"""The experience was terrible""","Not Verified |  I was extremely disappointed in the customer service at JFK airport. I had numerous encounters where staff/individuals were unwilling to assist with questions, I was told different agents to see, multiple numbers to call, I was told to not step up to a counter without being “told” by agent and then told to step up and fill in gaps when there were gaps in TSA lines - I assimilated this experience with being a cattle in a barnyard - quite inhuman. The experience was terrible and I will go to great lengths to not fly through the airport in the future. Lastly the personnel gives your city and our nation a bad image for visitors and I hope you think about how to train staff in a more effective manner. "
6th September 2019,2,"""Terminal 2 needs a complete makeover""","Not Verified |  Amazing, I felt like I was in some under-resourced country: old rusty bathrooms, broken escalator, insufficient seating, crowded, terrible food choices for high prices. Terminal 2 needs a complete makeover!"
2nd September 2019,1,"""Rude, incompetent staff""","Not Verified |  Absolutely awful. Rude, incompetent staff who were scruffy, sour faced and unhelpful and who were screaming unintelligible instructions to confused passengers of all ages. Endless snaking lines, absolute chaos. I have travelled extensively and have never, ever seen such a disgusting airport and staff. (perhaps the exception here is La Guardia Airport) How can New York put up with this being the first impression international travelers get when they arrive in the United States? A disgusting experience all in all."
27th August 2019,1,"""this is an embarrassment""","✅ Trip Verified | I’m almost speechless. For an international airport this is an embarrassment. We flew from Terminal 7 and I would recommend everyone avoid if they can. Filthy, cramped, disgusting toilets, and the limited selection of hugely overpriced and underwhelming food is laughable, particularly the utterly nonsensical ordering system which involves not one trip to a cashier but 3. WiFi impossible to connect to, very limited selection of shops to pass the time in & staff rushed and rude. I thought Frankfurt airport was bad but this is on a level if not worse."
18th August 2019,1,"""failed to have enough staff""",Not Verified |  The US Customs failed to have enough staff to move people through causing my wife and our one year old son to miss their connecting flight to CLT airport. Then had to wait longer do to Delta airlines aircraft problem.
17th August 2019,1,"""appalled at the rudeness of one member of staff""","Not Verified |  Terminal 4 is appalling. We arrived from Manchester and queued 1 and a half hours to get through immigration. After a 7 hour flight this really is not ideal. I witnessed one lady member of staff whilst directing people as to which queue they should go in, talking to and pulling facial expressions which were totally unacceptable. When we departed to go back to the UK I was absolutely appalled at the rudeness of one member of staff. We were taken 2 floors down to an alternative security area (due to the security area in departures being too busy). The organisation was ridiculous. One lady spoke to my 2 teenage sons in a totally disrespectful and rude manner. Totally uncalled for. She spoke to them like they were stupid - they are far from stupid. I am annoyed with myself for not saying anything at the time, however, I was stunned and also in the position of possibly affecting our ability to board the flight had I confronted her. The staff in this airport are rude."
15th August 2019,1,"""One of the worst""","Not Verified |  One of the worst airports ever. Staff are extremely unfriendly and the queues last forever. They are so inefficiënt. Airport taxes are high, and for what? Food courts are far too expensive. I hated the experience."
3rd August 2019,1,"""food prices are a disgrace""",Not Verified |  Food prices are a complete and utter disgrace. Water over $4. One banana costs $1.99. Terminal size is poky. No decent shopping. Will never return via this airport - amazed at such poor facilities servicing one of the busiest cities in the world. Once again food prices are a disgrace.
30th July 2019,4,"""terminal to terminal is a hassle""","✅ Trip Verified |  I arrived at JFK from Manila on a Philippine Airlines flight in May 2019, used it for both arrival and departure on JetBlue in June 2019, and then used it for transit from a JetBlue flight to a Philippine Airlines flight in July 2019. Sure, you can get to this airport from seemingly anywhere around the world, and it services the exciting city of New York. The TSA agents typically are surprisingly decent too. And check-in staff are usually pretty nice. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the extent of the positives about this airport. Upon arrival in Terminal 1, I was greeted by a customs and immigration facility that appeared to be under construction. It looked awful - all torn up! A passport control officer was basically just waving all of us in the U.S. Citizens line through while wishing us a good one. It seemed to take a really long time for luggage to arrive on the carousel. I don't mean my luggage personally. I mean anyone's luggage! Meanwhile, staff informed my parents (who were picking me up there) that everyone from our flight had already exited customs - when none of us had yet! My first flight into JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight out of JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight back to JFK on JetBlue was delayed. I think the only reason my flight back to Manila on Philippine Airlines was NOT delayed was that it took off at 3:45 A.M., when no one else was flying out of the airport! Transiting from terminal to terminal is a hassle, too. It requires exiting your first terminal, walking down a seemingly endless hallway to the AirTrain, taking the AirTrain to your second terminal's stop, and then walking down another seemingly endless hallway to that terminal proper. Then, of course, because you're coming in from outside the secure area, you have to go through security all over again! As for food and beverage outlets, most appear to range from relatively expensive to borderline price gouging. One very notable exception was the Dunkin' Donuts landside in Terminal 1. It appears to be the only dining option available 24 hours, and so it was the only place I could use my $20 meal voucher landside, since my flight departed in the middle of the night. At Dunkin' Donuts, I was informed that if I was going to use my meal voucher, then I had to spend at least $20. I was astonished! I struggled to manage to buy $20 worth of food and drink there. I made myself sick. I still do not understand why they would not accept the voucher for a smaller amount. It's not like they would be losing money on the deal! Add to all of this restrooms which are often not very clean and with sensors which automatically turn on sink faucets when you're nowhere near them (but don't turn on when you are near them). Finally, there's the issue of the airport's being quite far from Manhattan. I've heard LaGuardia and Newark are even worse. If so, then heaven help the people who fly out of there!"
30th July 2019,1,"""30 mins wait for a bag that gets checked""",✅ Trip Verified |  God help you clearing security here. 30mins wait for a bag that gets checked. One member of staff checking each. One supervisor watching for a while. Several staff members floating around.
29th July 2019,1,"""never met staff as rude""","Not Verified |  Have never met staff as rude as they are at this airport! Arrived from London and was told by airline staff to go in the quick connect queue for our connecting flight to Orlando. A member of staff came over screaming at us that we were in the wrong queue, when I asked where we were supposed to go she just shouted “read the signs”. We ended up in a queue behind at least 50 people with one desk open. When it got to 15 minutes before our gate was due to close I asked several members of staff for assistance only to be ignored and told to wait. I managed to persuade fellow passengers to let me and my group go to the front of the queue. We then had to collect our luggage and go back through departures and security to get our connecting flight. When we got to the gate it had been changed last minute and was in a different terminal. Running around the terminal trying to find a screen with the correct information was like a scene from Hone Alone!!! We then had to get a bus over to the new gate. I fully expected to have missed the flight however we were lucky in that the flight had arrived late. We got to the gate just as it was closing. Thankfully just in time. This airport is totally disorganised and probably the worst airport experience I’ve had. I wouldn’t fly here again."
27th July 2019,1,"""airport is absolutely disgusting""","Not Verified |  In November of 2018 I went to Iceland, Norway and Alaska, with an overnight layover at JFK before boarding a connection to Seattle. This airport is absolutely disgusting, however, I must admit that customs and TSA were good, and I actually found them polite. However, as for the rest of the airport, Delta is horribly rude, the restaurants are disgusting and the baggage carts are a total rip off, a scam, charging $6.00 for the use of them, and on top of that they scream at you, in Toronto there is no charge. Then I get to Seattle and Alaska and people are polite and helpful. Going through JFK you feel as if you're going through another dimension."
19th July 2019,1,"""is a third world airport""","Not Verified |  As others have said, this is a third world airport. Avoid at all costs. The reason for this is the rudeness and total ineptness of  staff you come across. It seems that to wear a uniform at JFK airport turns that person in to someone who thinks they are head of the Military or Police. Let me tell you something, you can still be nice to people. YOU have to travel sometimes, does the experience of coming across someone with your attitude make you happy? Of course it doesn't. On Monday evening, all us travellers waiting to have our bags scanned were herded in to an area and made to wait. Huge unnecessary queues. How many x-ray scanners were available? Two. And they would let 4 or 5 people through at a time to the underworked customs staff. And not a smile anywhere. Thankfully I had Priority boarding which meant I could get through relatively quickly (about half an hour). I didn't bother with the priority boarding at the actual gate as the staff were clearly uninterested in this. If I ever have the misfortune of going through JFK again, I will make sure to be there at least 4 hours before the plane leaves. Coming through was relatively easy thanks to the ESTA process but getting shouted at by certain staff was amusing. Again, something to tell you: we love coming to visit but have no intention of wanting to stay in your lovely country illegally. Really, I like where I live. So, Florida next year. I am assuming they are still happy staff down there because, well, it's Florida. JFK staff could learn a lot from other countries where people love their jobs.The UK, Spain, France, Netherlands, Czech, Germany, South America, Australia, the list is endless."

4th July 2019,1,"""The heat was horrendous""","Not Verified |  We arrived on Virgin 0153 at 4pm on Thursday 27th June. We passed through Passport Control at 7.22 pm. The heat was horrendous. Little children, babies and elderly people were all standing for hours in horrendous heat. Around half the booths were unmanned. There were few staff to help and signage showed that this was a regular occurrence. The whole place was scruffy, chaotic and a truly shameful introduction to a great nation. All Americans should be outraged that the management of this atrocious facility are providing a shockingly bad first impression of their nation. I have travelled extensively throughout Europe, Asia and Africa and can truly say this was my worst ever introduction to a country that really couldn't care less about the impression it gives to visitors."
28th June 2019,1,"""third world calibre airport""","❎ Not Verified | Arrived after a Delta international flight. It was 3 pm on a Monday and it looked like every international flight had just landed. Utterly packed at customs with countless snaking, endless lines. No rhyme or reason what kiosk you went to. No order to the queuing. Airport staff just awful, not directing. Waited in line for 1.5 hrs. Then after finally getting through this horror, no directions to connecting flights, hardly any tv screens for departure gate times, they don’t tell you the terminal attached to the gate, so we wound up walking to gate B51, which was endless from customs. Totally antiquated, third world calibre airport. Shocking to see this in NYC. It needs to be demolished and rebuilt from scratch. Barely any seats at crowded terminals gate, hardly any eateries, awful."
28th June 2019,1,"""Why is everybody so unfriendly?""","✅ Trip Verified | Why is everybody so unfriendly and rude? Are employees selected on that quality? The quality to boss people around, no smiling and not responding to questions. I really don’t understand!"

13th June 2019,1,"""bad service and poor customer service""","Not Verified |  We arrived at the JFK airport in New York at 7.10 on a Tuesday. Apron arrival of the baggage claim, we were met with bad service and poor customer service. After waiting for an hour for our flight we went to the baggage service area. The workers obviously had better things to do, as it took them another hour to contact their manager. When they finally came, she just sat in the office typing away not helping us or giving us any updates except for saying that they were in fact loaded onto our plane and taken off, but they are unable to figure out where they were. I am on my way to a safari in South Africa, and was already pressed for time. There were two other people waiting there with us who had the same problem. I guess that paying for priority doesn’t mater because, in the end, we still lost our luggage. The moral of the story here is be cautious when flying and try to avoid Delta Air Lines."
7th June 2019,1,"""This is the worst service ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Today, I had a very unpleasant experience at JFK Terminal 5 with TSA JetBlue. There is an older TSA who was standing there flexing the line. I informed him that I have 10 minutes before my plane leaves, is there any way to get assistance. I informed him that my family was actually all the way in the front and that I was behind because I had issues with my luggage. I repeated myself several times and he just kept on looking at me and shooing me away. This is extremely unprofessional as I am a manager myself. This is not the type of customer service they should be providing even though he is a TSA member. When I arrived to the check point, I informed another member that wasn’t part of TSA, she had gave me the same inappropriate manner. She said “I can’t do anything, stay in line”. This is the worst service ever. I hope senior managers can coach their employees here at this airport. This can ruin an individuals experience."
5th June 2019,4,"""Immigration was terrible here""","Not Verified |  Immigration was terrible here, no clear queing for automatic machines just a free for all. The camera would not capture my wife's picture she was too short, then it rejected my fingerprints and we ended up in the manual queue. This all took an hour and a half and our bags had been dumped off the carousel by the time we arrived. On our return to come home we had arrived in one part of T4 and had to take a bus to the other part but did not have to redo security, the gates at T4 were crowded and not terribly clean."
30th May 2019,1,"""This is a horrible airport""","✅ Trip Verified | This is a horrible airport! I will never use this airport again if I can help it. It has a stupid, hard to figure out layout. I had to walk through the rain to change terminals. The gate areas were small and confusing as well. Then when I returned through customs and had some duty-free merchandise I was treated very rudely by a tsa worker in security and had some of my merchandise confiscated even though it was duty free and not brought from outside the airport! This is ridiculous and the worker was a complete jerk about the situation. I consider myself an understanding and patient person but this airport tested both!"
21st May 2019,1,"""the worst airport""",Not Verified |  Insane! I’d never expected New York to have a 3rd world class airport. This is the worst airport I’ve ever been at and I’ve been to a few. I will never return to this airport!

Upon arrival from the UK my family and I had to go through customs. I do not attribute the experience at customs with JFK but it was pretty bad as well. The customs officer was extremely rude and acted put off by being there. Once I got to security I realized we were precheck, yay for us right? I was told that we didn't need to take our shoes off by the officer checking our passes. Then we were yelled at by the lady at the scanning belt that we had to take out shoes off, then she yelled at us for putting our carry on bags in the bins (I don't want my bags on the dirty belts), she continued to roll her eyes while yelling at us. Worst experience, very unprofessional, hope to never have to fly through JFK again!"
15th May 2019,1,"""poorly managed and under staffed""

18th April 2019,2,"""Security was totally unorganised""","Not Verified | Awful, worst airport I’ve ever been in. Security was totally unorganised, duty free and waiting area a mess and everything grossly overpriced. USA sending you home with good memories or experience! The home of customer service is majorly let down by this airport (terminal 7)."
15th April 2019,2,"""What an absolute embarrassment""","Not Verified | What an absolute embarrassment for an American airport. This is the first and sometimes only American operation thousands of international travelers see every day, and y'all should not be proud. I need to use the restroom, there is urine on literally every toilet seat, can't imagine the last time this place was cleaned. The plug is so old and used it can't hold my laptop plug in place, I'm having to keep my leg against it right now to keep my laptop charging. The wifi I kid you not is not allowing me to stream Pandora, a music service. This is 2019 folks, come on this is a first rate embarrassment for an American airport."
12th April 2019,2,"""It’s a disgrace""",Not Verified |  Arrived from Manchester UK at 1.10pm. I was hoping it had improved since my last visit 4 years ago but I am afraid it was a shambles. The new esta system supported by self inputting machines make things worse and even then you still have to go through an interview with immigration. The hall was overwhelmed with people and staff who are very stressed and rude. I’ve been to four other American airports from the uk and this one exists from the dark ages. America you are letting yourself down. It’s a disgrace. We will not come back and I heard numerous other travellers saying the same thing.
11th April 2019,8,"""a third world airport""",Not Verified |  JFK is a third world airport. The lines through immigration are awful. The connecting flight process is terrible. There could’ve no worse introduction to people entering the USA. Dismal and pathetic for this to represent our country.
11th April 2019,1,"""disorganised, inefficient, unwelcoming""","Not Verified |  On arriving at JFK after a seven hour flight from Manchester I experienced what I can only describe as the most disorganised, inefficient, unwelcoming and stressful arrival into another country I have ever had. Total confusion and lack of clarity with no clear signage placed in the right positions is responsible in my opinion. The staff are abrasive and constantly shouting unclear instructions at the top of their voices. Long queues make for a very long wait together with the niggling doubt that you may be in the wrong queue because there is no clear signage or instruction. This was my first visit to New York, although not to the US, and my first impression of this city is one of very unwelcoming and rude customs staff. I have not experienced this at any of the other US airports I have arrived at. Surely someone needs to sort this out - perhaps management needs an overhaul. It seems ironic that the US prides itself on its customer service so what’s gone wrong here?"
8th April 2019,1,"""sorry treatment""","✅ Trip Verified | JFK confirmed again today why it is my least favorite and most avoided airport. If it weren’t for the competitive international fares I’m able to acquire due to routing through this airport, I’d never come. My plane landed at 4:30a, closing out an all-night flight of 11-1/2 hours. We were first to Passport Control, but other flights also arrived and discharged their passengers. There were hundreds in line, and only one agent was checking in the sea of American citizens returning home. Airport staff barked directions at incoming passengers, but with no clarity or organization or apparent purpose, generating even more confusion and frustration. My husband and I were near the front of the line; still, it was an hour before our passports were cleared. Exiting Control we followed signs for Connecting Flights. The main Connecting lobby was closed, so someone shouted from the top of the escalator to come upstairs. Once there we had the “pleasure” of joining all the Departing Passengers - both those Connecting (like us) and those just starting their trips. We stood in long Security lines, were yelled at by TSA staff or rudely ignored, and ultimately had three of our five parcels inspected/rifled. The airline staff has been courteous and helpful and genuinely concerned with passenger comfort and safety. The JFK airport staff, however, is the complete antithesis. How embarrassing for all of us, knowing that millions receive this sorry treatment. Get your act together, NY. Future passengers, be warned. Maybe your experience will be a good one. Or maybe you, too will take away the degrading experience that was mine today. By the way, airport staff are warm and friendly with each other, even as the passengers they serve are wearily (and angrily) working their way through JFK’s cattle call process."
8th April 2019,1,"""lack of staff and information""",Not Verified |  Travelling from the UK to New York myself and my wife landed about 4 pm on a Tuesday. We had to suffer over 2 hours of queuing in passport control which is totally unacceptable. We were penned in “cattle lines” for the duration. A total lack of staff and information. On exiting to the luggage carousel we couldn’t see a carousel with our flight on it. After walking about with no help or advice from staff we found our luggage lying in a pile in the corner. Things improved on the return as there was adequate staff. I will not use JFK again!
31st March 2019,1,"""food is terrible""","Not Verified | JFK, terminal 1 - don’t go there if you are hungry, food is terrible even for airport standards. I have been through many airports in my life. Staying in terminal 1 in JFK is one of the worst experiences for a long time. Had “dinner” at The Local - The food was worth a -2 star (minus 2) - had one bite of a burger and left the rest of the really overpriced food. I have never tasted something so bad and non prepared, not even ketchup could save this. Looking at the other restaurants and the ratings I can only imagine how bad they are as well. Not a single one have more than 3 stars and most are closer to 2 stars. JFK, JFK - what are you thinking having these bad restaurants? Is it on purpose, you would like a perfect vacation ending badly? It really feels like you do not care at all. The customer potential is huge, so why having all these non quality “restaurants”? To be honest I am amazed that “The Local” even have a license to serve food. For sure I will not put a cent in this terminal in the future. JFK, wake up now."
27th March 2019,1,"""Horrendous experience""","Not Verified |  Horrendous experience. I’m actually writing this as I’m stood in queue to get through passport control. So far it’s been a 1.5 hr wait with what I estimate to be another half hour at least till we actually get to the front of the queue. There is only 2 desks on (1 disabled and 1 able bodied) despite there being over 60 kiosks within the floor. We have a connecting flight to Las Vegas which I doubt we will actually make and there have been no apologies from staff in the slightest. There are no clear signs anywhere except throne at the start of the long snaking queue to say it would take 35 mins (which means that it’s now out by over an hour). Not a staff member in sight. Horrendous customer service with no professionalism. I can’t see any toilets and I am so thirsty it’s ridiculous. No refreshments. As I take over 33 pills a day for my illnesses I often need a drink as I get a dry mouth. No common courtesy given to anyone visiting this supposedly customer service friendly country. This isn’t at all about safety, this is purely down to an incompetent management. My advice - sack them all and start again! Terrible start to the holiday, was planning on visiting NYC with my daughter this coming February but definitely rethinking this after our experience today. Never known anything like it! I’ve attached photos of the queue (now 1hr 50 mins in) and the empty booths so you can see how inept staff are at making sure customers are dealt with swiftly and securely. This review wouldn’t allow me to leave a zero score as it’s needed a minimum of 1 star however if up to me then it would be a minus score. Take my advice fly into any other airport other than this one!"
26th March 2019,1,"""The most awful airport""","Not Verified |  The most awful airport I have travelled through in my life - and I have travelled a fair amount. The security check was very long, we had to wait about 30+ mins to get through and the queue wasn’t even that long. They had stopped and searched a woman and because they didn’t have any other woman officers, none of us women waiting could go through until they found what was setting off the alarm on her, again adding to the wait. The conveyer belt is the shortest I have seen which means all the baggage piles up until you are through the security check. Their website is wrong and they have very limited, over priced food options available which are limited to burgers or burgers or have I mentioned burgers! As a vegetarian and health conscious person this really has set me off on the wrong foot for our journey home. The shopping options again, are very limited and quite frankly equals to or even worse than a local small airport. I’ve heard BA had “invested” in the airport to make it better. I fear to think how it must have been before."
21st March 2019,1,"""a long haul travellers nightmare""","Not Verified |  Honestly I would rarely review an airport but I was shocked at how truly awful this airport is. It’s a long haul travellers nightmare. This service would simply not run in the UK- it makes our busiest airports in London look timid by comparison. First off if you’re catching a connecting flight through here good luck, the airport is huge and it is not clear where you’re supposed to be going. Not great when this is your first time here. I was stood in a customs queue that wound on forever until I got panicky my connecting flight was in 40 mins. I stepped out to inform them and they told me to ‘go over there’. I wander over to a desk and a rude lady asks what I’m doing and I need to scan my passport first - well sorry the man did not tell me that! Wouldn’t it be helpful to tell me? They start whispering in another language and exchanging looks as if this isn’t an airport where new people enter every single day. I’m not thick thanks. Then comes the icing on the cake - the ever so fun customs lady who dragged her feet over to man 1 of 2 customs desks. She tells me she needs to sit down first and takes as long as possible with an attitude. Sorry I know the job is stressful but suck it up lady. Then she starts getting really intimidating telling me I’m not stood near the camera enough and I’m telling her sorry I’m flustered as I need to catch my flight. She seems totally unsympathetic and continues being rude. Sorry but I just got off a 7 hour flight from Manchester and I had 30 mins to get through security and to the gate - excuse me if I’m a little disoriented by your awful airport! She then makes me scan both my hands at least 11 times and it was very clear she was doing it to toy with me. I mean seriously who employs these people. Luckily I kept it together to avoid trouble but I have never met such rude airport staff in my life! I’m so glad I wasn’t travelling to NYC because boy what a welcome to that city. I know New Yorkers are known for being brash but they were just simply obnoxious and unprofessional. Boy was I glad to get to LAX in sunny California where the staff were lovely and helpful. I’ve never been particularly interested in NYC and it’s -10 weather as it seems like a more aggressive version of London and this airport just confirms my opinion on the place."
14th March 2019,1,"""2 out of all of the booths were actually manned""","✅ Trip Verified | Our flight landed slightly early around 11am, we got to the immigration hall and stood in a queue which didn't appear to be too bad, however, we then realised that only 2 out of all of the booths were actually manned. Every so often one of the people manning the booth would walk away for about 5 minutes leaving just one booth open. It was taking an average of between 3 and 5 minutes per person going through immigration. There were other staff members wandering around but nobody seemed to take charge. It took us around 2 hours to get through this fiasco but by this time the queue was about 4 times bigger than when we arrived and one of the booths was about to close because the lady was going for lunch. I dread to think how long it took those poor people to get through. I was absolutely amazed that in a country renowned for its customer service, this was allowed to happen - where were the management, or at least somebody to take charge and get additional staff in."
13th March 2019,1,"""A nightmare after a 16 hour flight""","Not Verified |  Arriving with EVA air from Taipei the flight was on time but JFK authorities did not have a parking spot available for approx 1 hour. A nightmare after a 16 hour flight! Once out of the plane immigration procedures were next. A huge and extensive hall with plenty of booths but only one was open. One officer for 4 wide body aircrafts. Where are all the officers? Sleeping, chatting, taking a break? Welcome to the service desert called USA. Any questions raised are replied like you are a criminal, rude and agressive. Overall that gives any arriving visitor a good impression of what to expect within this snobbish and rude country. Try to avoid whenever possible. B.t.w., lack of immigration officers is common. At another time I experienced that 2 out of 53 counters were open."
9th March 2019,1,"""Staff were extremely rude!""",Not Verified |  The worst airport I have ever been to (and I travel a lot!). We were 4 hours early for a flight and just made it on time because of the very long queue both for check in and through security. Staff were extremely rude! In fact I saw a member of the public ask a member of staff if she worked for the airport as she needed help and the staff member simply said 'no' even though she was wearing a uniform and clearly on duty. She just couldn't be bothered to help! Unnecessarily stressful and the worst organization I have ever seen.
6th March 2019,2,"""please stop with announcements""","Not Verified |  The annocments for passengers and changed flights happen all the time, it was loud, annoying and the girl on the microphone ruined the waiting. Fix the mic, speakers and please stop with announcements. Also very expensive."

Waiting for 2 hours at Terminal 2, you cannot even get a wifi connection, the free JFK wifi signal is not strong enough to connect to the web. After 4 (!!) gate changes, back on the shuttle bus to Terminal 4! Add to this a $13 sandwiches, this is a horror show, not an airport. I thought Manila, Philippines, airport was slow and inefficient, but at least they don't jerk you around the airport from gate to gate, and you get better wifi in Manila than at JFK,"
12th February 2019,1,"""airport has put us off ever coming back""",Not Verified |  Absolutely shocking airport on both the times we were here. Very long queuing times. Staff are so rude and very unhelpful. Although we loved New York this airport has put us off ever coming back. We are frequent travellers so we are aware of how busy an airport can get. We were left infuriated still when we boarded our flight back to the UK.
9th February 2019,1,"""by far the worst airport""","✅ Trip Verified | JFK is by far the worst airport I've been to. Why don't they have a stroller or something, for family's with small children? No smoking area (its my review, so I write whats important tp me!) once through security, you are stuck at the same 20 something gates, and a handfull of bad cafe's! Very bad airport! Wifi is slow as though from the 1990!"
8th February 2019,1,"""It was a horrible experience""","Not Verified |  I was disgusted by the treatment of security staff and how they spoke to people and shouted at them. On arrival the staff were hostile (mainly the women) and in departure I overheard one security woman telling her colleague that people are “scared of her” to which she found this to be very amusing, another shouted orders in the face of an old woman telling her to pick up her tray off the floor, she was very intimidating and would have been better suited to working in a prison than in an airport. I was disgusted at this and how these people are a representation of your country, something needs to be done about the way they approach and interact with passengers. Most of the security were stood around in large groups talking and one women was whining about how she hated being theirs and wanted to go home. It was a horrible experience."
26th January 2019,9,"""experience was quite positive""","✅ Trip Verified | On Delta Airlines I flew out of Terminal 2 and returned through Terminal 4 for a domestic trip. The terminals differ enormously by size- Terminal 2 is very much smaller and very compact. Terminal 4 is huge with many stores and eateries requiring a lot of walking to and from your gate. On departure, I was surprised at the virtually non-existence security line. The gate areas have large glass panels and high ceilings. Lots of seating with electric power points. Quite a few eating places - including a Wendy’s - for a terminal with less than a dozen gates. My first time in Terminal 2 and highly recommend it. Delta had staff at the terminal entrance to assist you. Terminal 4 was very busy and required a long walk out from my gate. Just outside Terminal 4 is dedicated space for Uber and such service cars to come to pick up clients - this is very convenient. In short, my experience was quite positive and was very pleased with Terminal 2 especially."
13th January 2019,8,"""comfortable and modern""","✅ Trip Verified | Check-in attendant was grumpy and did not allow us to choose seats. That portion of the airport was boring, but after immigration and security check, you can see lots of shops and restaurants. The ambience is also comfortable and modern.

I have taken taxis before and it was around $60. This driver told me I had to pay $8.50 in tolls. Talked the entire time telling me how hard he works and only makes $10 an hour. Takes me to my destination and asks for cash and charges me $160 for the ride and then asked for a tip. My fault for being stupid!! Take a yellow cab!

Also, it is too far from Manhattan."
27th December 2018,1,"""Basic human decency could be exercised""","✅ Trip Verified |   Terminal 1 had the rudest staff I've ever encountered throughout any airport in the world. Completely unnecessary the way they talk with people. If you work at an international airport expect people to not speak English, yelling at them and talking down to them is not going to speed things up. I am not sure what the training procedures are for this place, but for any establishment to allow their staff to talk to their guests like this is wrong. Reading other reviews I am not the first to experience this. I am not sure who is running this place, but just because you are airport security doesn't give you the right to be a complete jerk to anyone. Basic human decency could be exercised even minimally and it would be a drastic improvement. Food selections are scarce and the place isn't exactly clean. Restaurant staff were friendly and prompt especially for the amount of business."

As well as the woman doing the scanning yelling at my young son for having water and not removing jackets after a meer secound. Honestly people incarcerated are treated better.

Eye contact by frontline customer service from airlines, airport to security seems taboo. Port Authority, you can do better. Benchmark yourself against the top global airports. NYC is a global city."
10th December 2018,1,"""very poorly placed signs""
","✅ Trip Verified | We had our return flight from terminal 4. While looking for where to queue for security (very poorly placed signs), one airport staff member called us and asked for our boarding passes. My husband asked him if the queue was for economy passengers (because the sign read for first and business class passengers only), this person replied ‘I am not here to answer your questions, show me your boarding pass’, taken aback by his rude reply my husband opened the bag to take out the passes, then this man started shouting ‘Don’t hold the line’ again and again in the most disrespectful manner possible. All this shouting and rude language was in the presence of our 4 year old child. Finally, we were in queue for security check. He was, without doubt, the most disrespectful staff member we have ever encountered having travelled across Europe, Asia and America. He needed training on usage of basic words like ‘please’ and ‘thank you’. Avoid this airport if possible. We have head of similar experiences from others and negative comments about behaviour of staff at this airport. They should take tips from British airport staff."
1st December 2018,8,"""airport is expensive""","✅ Trip Verified |  I went from the city center to the Airport by subway. It is a long journey, but cheap. The JFK is a very large airport. You have to leave time for everything. The directions are good. The checkin is relative fast. The airport is expensive. The walk way is long. Our plane waited about 40 minutes to take off"
30th December 2021,1,"""Everything was outrageously priced""",✅ Trip Verified | The airport leaked. There were buckets everywhere you looked. No place comfortable to sleep if your flight was cancelled. Everything was outrageously priced. I personally would never book a flight to this airport again.
24th October 2021,3,"""Don’t trust this company""","Not Verified |  I arrived at the International Terminal (Hawaiian Airlines) at 10 pm September 6, 2021. I joined the taxi line and eventually was assigned a taxi cab. The driver drove me to my hotel, Aura Hotel in San Bruno on El Camino Drive, a hotel I have stayed in many times. I believe the hotel is 1.3 miles from the airport, but this driver (Hman Taxi Service of Daly City) drove me through back roads alleys and industrial back roads to jack up his price. I remarked to him the ride was far too long and through alleys and dirt roads. He said he was following the directions from Uber! He was a crook and the meter charge was 25.50 plus a $3 tip. I could not find out what the charge should be in advance. However, my taxi ride from the hotel to the same International Terminal only cost $15! Don’t trust this company: Hman Taxi Service."
24th July 2021,2,"""one of the worst designed airports""","Not Verified |  This airport may be attractive and very clean, but is one of the worst designed airports I have ever seen.  Walk from the gates to baggage is extremely long. If you have any mobility issues and don’t use a wheelchair, it will be a real struggle. Once you finally make it to baggage claim, you have to go back upstairs and hope you see the one small sign for rental cars. This is yet another long walk with about half of it being an uphill ramp. Then, the signs are terrible. Nothing indicated rental cars until you get to the escalators. I can’t tell you how many people I saw looking around bewildered, as well as heard complaining about the walk. Follow the signs for the AirTran and take that all the way to the end. I will never fly in or out of this airport again and willing to pick less desirable flights from Oakland or San Jose just to avoid it."
8th May 2021,2,"""choose any airport over this one""","✅ Trip Verified |  If I were you, I would choose any airport over this one. If it's not the weather, it's ""runway renovations"" that cause flight delays for which apparently no one is responsible. For over 20 years, I have disliked this airport - it is dirty, with customer service representatives who apparently hate their job. It has been my only option for a specific sole airline that flies into a small airport north of SF, where my family lives. A couple years ago, I was heading to my family's hometown on a Friday for my husband's memorial service the next morning, where he had spent most of his adult life serving the public (the local service where we lived at the time of his death was for friends at our new home). Soon after my husband's death, due to shock, I had fallen down a ladder and broke my heel. For the trip, I had been recovering for 3 months and still used a cane. My flight to SF was delayed by SF due to weather - a common occurence. My connecting flight from SF to the hometown was delayed over and over on the hour. When I asked a customer service rep about this and explained that I needed to get to my husband's memorial service, he just shrugged. He had no answer whether the flight would go or not. At 11 p.m. that night, I requested wheelchair service to go to the car rental station, and the customer service rep just stared at me and acted like she didn't understand English. I went to a different desk and requested the same thing, then I rented a car to drive 5 1/2 hours to our hometown to make sure I could get to the memorial service. My understanding is that my connector flight never flew there that night. The airline carrier also did not refund me for that leg of the journey. In the most recent case this April, I recently flew the same route to visit family over spring break. On the return trip, SF delayed our takeoff for an hour, causing me to miss the last flight out of SF to my hometown. The reason -- runway renovations. By the time we arrived in SF Airport, there were no customer service reps available, no food available, and the airline customer service rep's only option was to hand me a flyer with an 800 number to reserve a hotel room ""at a discount"" for the night through Roomstorm, whereby I was charged by both Roomstorm for the very expensive hotel reservation as well as the hotel. I would not recommend this airport to anyone. I am thankful that soon the hometown airport will have a different carrier option, with direct flights to and from that completely bypass SF."
17th April 2021,7,"""San Francisco Airport is gorgeous!""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco Airport is gorgeous! We anticipated food courts may be closed and brought our dinner with us. We did take a later flight so it was not crowded at all. The only frustration I had was with long-term parking. Domestic long-term was closed with no forewarning, we were directed to international by an employee we could not understand clearly. We were given a ticket to use once we returned, I later noticed it was dated the 8th, we pulled in on the 10th. I had also found a coupon for 2 days free parking, from sfo website that was not honored. Other than that, it was a good experience. Parking is extremely expensive! Next time we will get a ride"
7th April 2021,1,"""there was no food available or open""",✅ Trip Verified | Terrible is all I can say. We landed for our layover after a 5 hour flight and there was no food available or open. There was no food offered on our flight either. We have a layover for 2.5 hours and then another 4 hour flight. Somebody didn’t think this through.
29th November 2020,10,"""Poorly placed signs with missing information""","Not Verified |  Poorly placed signs with missing information. Way too big of an airport with rude staff. Navigating is impossible and for how much we pay and how many rules we have to follow which some honestly make no sense, you would think this airport could offer more than confusing giant art that people can't even admire because they're trying to figure out this labyrinth. Why charge so much, to be treated so badly because of a poor building design. If it were for better employees, better directional tools or at least some correct information instead of being told to, and I quote Delta Air Lines disgraceful employee, ""I should've read the fine print"", maybe I wouldn't be making sure I share this experience with every single option I have, so no one has to be screwed over, after all I went through to get this ticket, like I did. And seeing all the comments on all the forums I've been on so far, doesn't look like I'm alone."
16th September 2020,2,"""social distancing is very hard to achieve""","✅ Trip Verified | I disliked this airport after a horrible experience a few years ago but it seems it’s only gotten worse. 70% of restaurants were closed with only limited options available, all of which were fast food or fast casual. This greatly reduced the amount of available seats for those who did need to eat, and therefore social distancing is very hard to achieve. Quite possibly the worst place to spend a layover during Covid!"
6th July 2020,1,"""do not recommend this airport""","Not Verified | This airport had terrible customer service for the most part. Only few employees were understanding and accommodating. They took away my 74 year old aunt’s wheelchair that she needed when she sat down. Not to mention, one of her escorts left her in a corner for an hour or more. The escorts just displayed terrible customer service. The experience was so horrible for my cousin that she had a complete panic attack and had to run from one end to the other for her stuff. I do not recommend this airport to anyone."
21st March 2020,1,"""6ft distance is not honored""","✅ Trip Verified |  Most personnel has no mask nor gloves and comes really close, not honoring 6ft distance. I m wearing mask and gloves and counter and security is harassing me, i had to go thru security line then back to counter then security line and they openly harassed me, making me wait, not helping, making it difficult, going tru all my stuff and patting me down it took an hour total and i lost my flight. Security is worst because it is without masks and come close to you to pat you down.  I asked they do talking at 6ft distance and then come to pat me and they had no clue what i was talking about. They want to pretend corona doesnt exist. Airport is quite empty but practically nobody wears a mask or gloves and 6ft distance is not honored."
10th March 2020,5,"""good WiFi is imperative""","✅ Trip Verified | I have used SFO 8 times a year on average for the last 4 years. The WiFi is often weak or there is no connectivity at all. This is surprising and ironic, given the airport is near the center of most of the largest online tech corporations in the world. Many people using SFO concur with this pattern. I wish someone in charge would get it fixed. A good WiFi is imperative for those traveling through any airport!"
26th February 2020,1,"""SFO was a terrible experience""","Not Verified |  From landing after an international overnight flight to transfer to another flight, SFO was a terrible experience and I will avoid at all costs. TSA customs entry was very poorly stationed, as was re-entry. The food establishments in this airport remain so poor. We are currently waiting in Terminal F with music so loud that we cannot hear gate announcements sitting at our gate. Celebrating Black History Month is wonderful and appropriate. Celebrating with music so loud that jet-lagged passengers get no reprieve and customers have to yell and can’t hear gate announcements is so bizarrely inappropriate. I cannot believe this is allowed and I hope to never return to this airport."
4th February 2020,1,"""Very unhelpful and rude""","Not Verified |  We arrived from from New Zealand at 6am on 13/01/2020 and needed to catch a connecting flight to New Orleans at 9.30am. At the time we thought this would be ample time to get through customs, pick up our bags and then recheck them in for the domestic flight and go through security again. There were three lines one for US citizens, one that said global and one that said all other passengers. We asked a staff member, which line we should get into, global or other passengers and his response was 'I can't help you.' Very unhelpful and rude. It took nearly 2 and a half hours to get through customs and we had nothing to declare. I would estimate there were about 1000 people needing to get processed and about 5 officials on duty. I felt most for the families with young children as there didn't appear to be any sympathy from the staff and everyone had to wait their turn. Some of these children had been on our flight, which was over 11 hours long. Any request such as changing a babies nappy was met with an annoyed response from staff. There were multiple people who missed flights and as expected were very distressed. When we finally got our turn we asked the guy who processed us, if it was always like this and he said it was worse in summer! If our flight hadn't been delayed 45 minutes, we would have missed it too. They really needed to have more staff on processing people."
13th January 2020,2,"""incredibly inefficient immigration""",Not Verified |  Horrible wait time during immigration after landing into San Francisco from an international flight. Expect 2.5-3.5 hours wait time in line before you pass immigration to get your baggage There were very little staff on duty and the wait/lines were very poorly managed. This is comical for international tourists whose first experiences arriving into Silicon Valley is backward customer service and incredibly inefficient immigration.
27th December 2019,1,"""SFO is a disaster""","✅ Trip Verified | Nightmare in the city of SFO. On arrival no wheelchair attendant as requested. I had to push my husband in the wheelchair myself. We went through customs easily with the chair, but when we collected our luggage, I couldn’t handle the luggage and my husband. He rolled himself from the luggage to where United Air collected luggage. We then had to go through TSA again. I inquired about pre-check in TSA and the official directing people yelled at me and because of her strong accent I couldn’t understand her. When I asked her again she just got furious and turned her back on us. We ended up in the non-pre TSA which was a nightmare with all our carry ons and a wheelchair. They took the wheelchair away and made my husband go through a complete search because his arm and hip replacements set off the equipment. Finally we reached the United Gate and they were almost through boarding even though we allowed plenty of time for this transition. We were sent out in the rain to get to our plane to San Luis Obispo. Because of the weather, they needed 8 volunteers to get off the plane for weight reasons. Finally they decided to remove all the baggage so o one had to leave the plane. (Good idea). The plane took off 1.5 hours late. United Air did a good job of Tracking our luggage. It went down to LA and arrived several hours later in San Luis Obispo. When I tried to pick up my luggage in SLO, the clerk at the united counter was the rudest person and of no help. She instructed me to stand by a door and hope someone would help me. It took 20 minutes. A very nice airport employee, arriving for work took pity on me and opened the door that had the luggage. We spent 2 mos. traveling. We were in Frankfurt airport, Rome Airport, Bangkok Airport, Auckland Airport and Tahiti Airport and never had a problem. SFO is a disaster and SLO needs a baggage handler."
14th December 2019,1,"""so humiliating in all aspects""","✅ Trip Verified |   Today we experienced the worst customer service by the TSA staff. My wife is on crutches and was forced to stand on one leg in the body scanner. I am glad this was amazing to their staff. We repeatedly ask if she could pass through the easier side in which she would be able to use her crutches, but for some reason she was denied the opportunity numerous times. However, once it was my turn to go through (noted I was only 2 people behind my wife) I was pushed to the other side of the metal detector machine instead in which we had ask for my wife to go through. Once the scanner had done its job she was expected to hop with one leg out of the machine since her crutches were being scanned. She was holding up the line, so the TSA tried to assist her by putting hands on her, but obviously my wife couldn’t take the help since she is not able to maneuver without the crutches. This was so humiliating in all aspects. TSA officers need to go through a sensitive and judgement course in which they are thought to be human beings and make better decisions. The supervisor was rude and backed her employe even though she was wrong. She continued to argue that her employee was not aware of the anxiety she was causing my wife, she had a meltdown while being patted down. Until that moment she realized she was in the wrong and contacted customer services to get my wife a wheelchair."
13th December 2019,1,"""how behind this airport is""","Not Verified |  I had a flight from New Zealand to San Francisco (3:34-6:30) and a connecting flight from San Francisco to Cancun Mexico (8:41-4:54). As soon as we landed I was informed that all check-in bags would need to be picked up and rechecked, sure no problem I thought to myself because I had 2:20 min to spare. I ended up standing in the customs line for a 1:45min. I talked to 3 workers who were ""in charge of managing the lines if I could skip the line ... they said no"" I asked the customs agent if I could cut in line and he says ""sorry not our problem"" Mind you that there were only 2 agents working the whole time. So after already accepting that I missed my flight (boarding time was at 8:05), I get to the baggage area where there were no signs saying where my bag would be because it already been close to 2 hours since we landed. I find my bag thrown in a pile of other suitcases. I get to my airline desk explained the situation and they rebooked my flight .. great! But they made me go through security all over again which ended up costing me another hour to which I barely ended making my rebooked flight by 5 min! If you can avoid this airport at all costs, go to SJC or even Oakland they'll probably take better care of their passengers. It is ridiculous how we do not use computers like many European countries as customs! Very outdated methods that are broken. To make matters worse I wanted to file an actual complaint but they want you to mail it in, instead of emailing a complaint. Just shows how behind this airport is. I thought we were in Silicon Valley!"
3rd December 2019,3,"""airport is not at the level it should be""",✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco is a fantastic city and its airport is not at the level it should be. The queuing time is the most important and performs too poorly. Tops - Wifi is easy to connect and fast - you get your bags fast. Bottoms - Security lines are extremely long (30 to 45 min) - Customs are way too long for visitors (1h to 2h easily).
25th November 2019,4,"""Dirty, slow, no signage""","Not Verified |  Simple review: one of the worst airports I have ever flown into. Dirty, slow, no signage. Employees unfriendly and useless. Lounge is a complete disaster. There is so much to fix that they would be better off closing it and opening a new one."
20th November 2019,2,"""unfriendly employees""",✅ Trip Verified | I've never seen anything like it. There is complete chaos and arbitrariness at the security line (departure Terminal International). The ladies at the entrance distribute the guests as they please - even as a priority guest you are put in the longest queue. The duration of the control due to bad-tempered and unfriendly employees is the longest I have ever experienced at an airport worldwide. Especially the unnecessary taking off of shoes with modern scanners is not comprehensible.
17th November 2019,1,"""not passenger-friendly""","Not Verified | Cannot believe how backwards the immigration, security and departures are! The airport is not passenger-friendly at all! Definitely will not be coming here again! No one is helpful and signage is non-existent."
13th November 2019,1,"""longest time ever to pass the immigration counter""","Not Verified |    The longest time ever to pass the immigration counter - over 2 hours. Many of our co-passengers missed their connection-flights. During our waiting time in the queue most of the people, working at the counters, left their place and didn't come back. Golf-Baggage totally destroyed."
11th November 2019,1,"""Staff are barely polite""","Not Verified |  Third time that I fly to SFO in the past 6-7 months and the experience at arrival and immigration has been consistent, appalling and you can forget your comnection if you don't have a minimum of 2 hours. I am writing this review while in the queue and I have been there for already one hour andmost likely will take as much if not more by the time I clear immigration, this is absolutely unforgiving for an airport like SFO which is meant to be a gateway for tourists and workers in the Silicon Valley. LAX used to be the worse airport on the west coast but SFO is now getting that top spot. Staff are barely polite, the queuing system is at best organised chaos, this is shameful!"
22nd September 2019,9,"""Thanks a million for the person who reported it!""","✅ Trip Verified | I arrived in SFO as I did many times in the past, except I lost my passport in the airport this time! After frantically searching for it in vain, with help from SFO Info desk and SFPD Officer, I was extremely lucky in finding it via United Airline and local personnel. It was found outside a security check point, someone picked it up and gave it to local officials and then to United supervisors. As I was walking with Officer Whitney, the local official approached us and asked “Did you lose a passport?” That’s how we found it! Thanks a million for the person who reported it! "
4th September 2019,1,"""Appalling immigration setup""","✅ Trip Verified | Appalling immigration setup. No attempt by uncaring female observing immigration staff to usher families with babies and toddlers to front of near 100 metre serpentine line of non US travellers. As a transit passenger I spent near 3 hours and made my connection by minutes. Why as a transit traveller with an e-visa did I need my R fingers, R thumb, L fingers, L thumb imaged plus a photo? Never had to endure a pat down top to toe when had a handkerchief in pocket. Had to remove a plastic tooth pick! Man on moon 50 years ago but this chaos. Go to Vancouver airport. All this and bio security via self serve consoles. Through immigration in 5 minutes."

Easily the worst experience at an international airport."

Every time I have been here, my flight gets changed, there are no food or drinks stores open after 10pm, they are very disorganized to the point where the flight attendants don’t even know what’s going on. People are everywhere and no one is taking control to organize this experience for others. I am not happy as I have been waiting two extra hours due to no explanation for our flight being delayed. I will not be back."

The airport is almost empty at this time and these guys still can’t figure it out.
7th July 2019,4,"""a total mess""","✅ Trip Verified | The airport, and especially the TSA check, is a total mess. Only a handful of lines open, with people queueing up in their socks (first time I saw a security check with mandatory shoe removal, without providing any sanitary bag to use on the extremely dirty carpet) while the luggages went through the X rays. Unlike in London Heathrow, no passport check before arriving at the gate, so make sure to call in at the check in even if you have already done it and you don't have any checked baggage to drop off, otherwise you will be called at the gate for passport check. The organization is truly terrible. Also the duty free area is pretty poor."
1st July 2019,1,"""It was a disorganized mess""","Not Verified |  Went through TSA Pre-check line at 10:30 am on a recent Sunday. The wait was over 45 minutes, and we timed people in the regular line getting through in 15 minutes on average. They kept letting all the flight crews go in front (understandable, but why not hold up the 'slow' line instead) and had only two lines open. There were no bins anywhere. If you had keys or a phone in your pocket, you were completely out of luck. My husband had a sweater they made him take off, but it got caught on the conveyor and damaged. Who has run into a baggage scanner which has no bins in use anywhere? If you have a big carry-on, you can put stuff inside - but then that, depending on your bag, means opening up your whole bag on the conveyor belt while they are yelling at you to move it along. I have knee replacements and told them, they sent me through the regular line which beeped of course, then made me go back through the body scanner line, holding others up, and then they had to do a manual search anyway. It was a disorganized mess - the worst security screening we've seen in the past year with about 60 flights in at least 24 airports. Shame on you, SFO!"
20th June 2019,1,"""No sense of urgency""","✅ Trip Verified | 3 staff processing 600 people! The majority of reentry by ESTA got the dreaded X on their biometric scam meaning joining that dreaded queue. No sense of urgency, people missing flights as a result - hopeless!"
3rd June 2019,1,"""Complete chaos""","Not Verified |  An absolute nightmare. After an 11 hour flight we stood in line for passport control for 2 hours 50 minutes. People were passing out, paramedics called to someone. Complete chaos. Thought perhaps it was a one off but later met someone in SF who waited for 3 and a half hours in a similar queue. When we eventually got through no belt info for our flight and found all bags had been taken off the carousel. People missed connecting flights. A complete nightmare - one I never wish to repeat so will avoid SFO in future at all costs."
20th May 2019,2,"""Customs was absurdly understaffed""","Not Verified |  Customs was absurdly understaffed, and it took my husband almost 2 hours to get through. Being a US citizen, I was in a different line, and got through in under a half hour. We missed our flight because of how slow this line was. It's an utter disgrace to put people through that type of wait time after traveling. There were two agents for that huge line. Even having four agents would have made a huge difference. 8 agents would have cut the wait down to just over what I had, which was plenty. After missing our flight, we spoke to a few different help desks. They were all lovely and helpful, but rather low on correct knowledge. One sent us to a travel agency pretty far away to book a new flight, and when we made it there, there was no staff. They also told us we could go to airline counters to book flights which was incorrect. The best advice the one guy gave me was to not book with cheap airlines because they provide bad/low customer service when things go awry! If you're going to fly through here be prepared for possible long customs waits, and read the info on your airlines website (for instance, that the check in desk closes an hour before the flight even though the gate is 10 minutes away!). I guess, basically, be prepared."
16th March 2019,9,"""one of the better United terminals""","✅ Trip Verified |   This review focuses on Terminal 3, the United Airlines terminal. This is one of the better United terminals, with an interesting art exhibit in the connecting corridor between concourse F and the main terminal lobby. I've also enjoyed the office cubicles that are provided, although I wish there were more. Security lines could be long, particularly in the central one near the Global Services reception."
1st February 2019,1,"""Extremely slow and rude""","✅ Trip Verified |   Terrible airport staff. Absolute worst experience, no employee knew what they were doing. One employee told me to keep electronics in my bag but once it was scanned, I recieved unnecessary attitude from another employee telling me 'I was told' to remove everything. I spent 1 hour at security check even though the line was very short. Extremely slow and rude. I will not return."
31st January 2019,3,"""It's a travesty""","Not Verified |  The Bay Area is the tech capital of the world. Try to find any place to plug your smartphone in for a recharge at this airport! Virtually NO electrical outlets available, and people laying on the floors near them trying to get a quick electrical fix. Even the United Club, their ""upscale"" lounge area, has installed USB connections that are routinely broken. Members are wandering around the lounge looking for their needed juice. ""Free Wi-fi""? Hardly. Antiquated system tries to push advertising into the very very slow connections. And while ATT users get good high speed connections, T-Mobile and Verizon are pretty poor. It's a travesty."
25th January 2019,1,"""There didn't seem to be enough officers""",Not Verified |  I arrived in this airport after completing a 13 hour flight from New Zealand at 6am. It took 90 minutes just to complete a passport check and present my declaration form. After this I needed to collect my bag and deliver it to a transfer point to have it put on the plane to Toronto. Then came the security checks. There didn't seem to be enough officers to assist with this and only one to two lines were open. The staff themselves were extremely rude yelling at us and herding us around. Have never been treated so inhumanely. My home country is Canada. I will never fly through this airport again. Lastly our gate was changed four times before boarding. Very confusing after just completing an overnight flight.
2nd December 2018,5,"""such a creepy airport""","✅ Trip Verified | What I do not understand is why such a great nation like US does not take care enough of their airports and the related infrastructure. San Francisco is such a beautiful city with such a worldwide publicity but it affords such a creepy airport. Let us just ignore the desolate state of the parking houses, the Bart Metro station and the highway connection and focus on the airport facilities. Information screens from 2 decades ago, slow and horrible security check and poor facilities. At least the immigration here is way much better then rest of the country. all in all - so sad!"
1st December 2018,1,"""SFO is a terrible airport""","Not Verified |  SFO is our home airport and is convenient to where we live so we choose to transit here for flights. That said, SFO is a terrible airport, and if we had a better choice we'd take it instead. Firstly the international terminal is leagues behind its counterparts in most any other city. And as we specifically travel to western Europe and the UK SFO does not compare to any of them overall. Coming back home the differences are so glaring; it's like night and day. SFO's international terminal is so tiny, post security dining is extremely poor. Not to mention expensive. They don't even have a well-stocked newsstand. Worse, however, is the TSA and immigration staff. TSA staff members can be pretty rude and abrasive especially to foreigners I'm sure. We're used to the attitude, but it makes a bad impression. Immigration is either hit or miss mostly the latter. And don't even ask about customs officials. They profile certain races which is not only archaic but unfair. How many times the immigration officials allowed us clearance only to be abruptly stopped near the exits by some Oriental customs official who thinks that because we look like them that we are lying about what we listed on our customs declaration form. We always note down everything we are bringing back & we are always within the monetary limits as well as we do not bring back contraband items. Yet these agents think they are so smart to do this profiling whilst the true perpetrators have been allowed to go. It's time to do away with this third world mentality and if they want to search then they need to do it to everyone and not just the ones they want to profile. So for everything I wish there were a way to rate SFO with minus points. Since that's not possible then a 1 is the best they deserve."
30th November 2018,5,"""totally ineffective staff""","Not Verified |  The arrival went well. The departure not so well. The security was an hour, totally ineffective staff! And lack of policy info. It took an hour to go from the entrance (inside) the security lines to get to the security check. Staff took their time, very slowly. Not all the lines were opened? One agent thought it was funny and kept laughing loudly. It made some passengers quite mad. Way to go SFO security! How to escalade a bad situation! Then they took my bag because apparently candles looks like bombs on their screen. Well by the time they looked at my bag guess what would had happened if it was something dangerous? Now why in the information dont you have that pointed candles should be in your checked baggage? Really not impressed by that service!"
15th November 2018,4,"""Why no expedited transit?""",Not Verified |  Why no expedited transit? Arrived in the UCIS hall with 90 minutes before my connecting flight. However I waited in the same hall for the full 90 minutes and then found out I needed another 35 minutes to collect luggage and clear security. I wasn’t the only one to miss their plane in that line. The fact that my flight was over 2 hours late was a sour victory.
4th November 2018,1,"""shambolic security lines""
",Not Verified |  Absolutely shambolic security lines. Priority queue (which we paid for) was significantly slower than the standard queue. Passengers had to run around fetching baskets because the staff werent bothering. Customers in wheelchairs were squeezed through the queues because no one had the foresight to put in a disabled lane. This also caused a significant delay when a frail passenger was asked made to walk through the scanner when he clearly wasn't able to walk. The worst airport and airport staff I have ever experienced. The BA lounge was nice though.
3rd November 2018,1,"""Awful service when arriving""","Not Verified | Awful service when arriving, there was only one person at a kiosk serving around 600 passengers. People who had connecting flights within the hour were simply told it’s not the staffs problem and they have to line up which they estimated could take 3 hours. The airport is incredibly understaffed with no sympathy for any issues they have caused."
22nd October 2018,1,"""avoid at all costs""","Not Verified |  Our 11 hour flight was on time but as it took over 3 hours to get through security and through to the baggage hall our taxi had given up and left. We were finger printed twice and herded around the arrival hall like cattle. Fellow travellers missed connecting flights and airport staff were not concerned. When we finally reached the security desk the computer system crashed. Basically there was not enough staff either in the arrivals hall or on the security desks. After a long flight the experience left us with an 'avoid at all costs' attitude towards this airport. As another traveller has written, they don't seem to be able to cope with the volume of customers."
15th October 2018,1,"""30 min to get to our occupied gate""",Not Verified | Travelled twice through this airport in the last 7 days. Twice we waited more than 30 min to get to our occupied gate. Unacceptable. Not that airport management would care but better resource planning will give you more stars in the future.
3rd September 2018,2,"""security highly stressful and chaotic""","✅ Trip Verified | Had appalling service from ground staff manning the gate for my United Airlines flight from SFO to SEA. I was one of the last few to board (with 25 minutes to spare before takeoff) and was told by a male staff that they were out of overhead bin space for remaining passengers. I was asked “Will your bag fit under the seat in front of you?” To which I answered “Yes, it’s just clothes.” He then yelled at me and said “I didn’t ask what you had in the bag, I asked if it would fit.” This threw me off guard and I just said yes, but was fuming as I stepped away from the gate. Security was also highly stressful and chaotic, with more shouting from the TSA officers than you would expect in a local fish market. United Lounge was meh. The most substantial item on the menu was chicken noodle soup."
2nd September 2018,1,"""dreadful service""",Not Verified | Dreadful service through immigration. 3.5 hours to get to baggage carousel. Announcements inaudible and no respect or regard for travellers. They don't care if you miss your connection. The TSA are arrogant and ignorant to travelling visitors.
14th August 2018,6,"""facilities around the gate were very few""","✅ Trip Verified | I departed from gate A3 International terminal. Security check and other process were smooth. But the facilities around the gate were very few. Few restrooms, 2 vending machines and all out of service. Little and a few duty-free shops. A very long line of passengers waiting to buy a bottle of water from the vending machine but they were all cracked."
8th August 2018,3,"""not up to international standards""
","✅ Trip Verified | Very disappointing as we had a 4 hr wait for our flight. Once through security there were no USB ports to charge phones etc. only the odd socket. The seating was very basic so we lay on the floor to stretch out before our 14 hour flight. The toilet queue was ridiculous as there were no toilets near the actual departure gate downstairs. There was 1 duty free shop and a couple of dining options plus a couple of vending machines. No bookstore or news stand, coffee shops etc. Pre security offered better options but not by much. Flight departure was delayed so we missed our connecting flight. Very basic facilities and not up to international standards."
7th August 2018,4,"""airport is clean and tidy""","✅ Trip Verified | The airport is clean and tidy however I had to queue for over 2 hours to go through immigration control which is far too long. There were only between 2 and 3 immigration officers on the desks with room for at least 20. This was a long haul flight and my chauffeur was also kept waiting then for 2.5 hours due to this delay. The Delta business lounge was completely full and was being shaken continuously by something on the roof very loudly. It was also extremely hot. Not a pleasant experience and one i'll try to avoid in the future. For a $10,000 ticket this is not really good enough."
2nd August 2018,8,"""announcements were completely inaudible""","✅ Trip Verified | Further to my review headed ""nowhere near as bad as I was expecting"" published 31 July I want to expand on one remark. When the flight was called it was indeed a scrum - people milling everywhere in no apparent order. The Priority Lane was not accessible without pushing through the crowds (we flew Business Class and were presumably Priority), and announcements were completely inaudible. There must be a better way to organise boarding than this. Apart from this, we found the airport OK, but then again we did have access to a Lounge."
1st August 2018,1,"""it is unreliable""","Not Verified |  Let me make this short and to the point. I am done with flying in and out of San Francisco because it is unreliable. Flights are delayed and often cancelled by the SFO air traffic control because the airport cannot handle the flights scheduled. If it were a weather issue I would be forgiving but it is not. My departing flight was cancelled so I had to reschedule and fly out of Oakland. When I returned my flight was delayed due to construction and one of the runways was closed. Really! You mean to tell me that with the planned construction there was no pre thought on affecting runway access. It is not just construction, with SFO there is always some excuse why a flight is delayed or cancelled. I am done! There are other choices: Oakland and now San Jose. I have been delayed and cancelled for the last time SFO. Adios!"
31st July 2018,8,"""nowhere near as bad as I was expecting""","✅ Trip Verified | Used San Francisco to depart on July 23. To be honest we found the airport perfectly OK (bearing in mind some of the reviews) but we only used it for departure. Travelled in by BART train from Pioneer - very easy journey even with luggage as the train terminated at International A - and about 3 minutes walk from the BA check in desks. Couldn't be easier. Checked in and got Pre TSA screened which meant through security in not much time at all. Flight was 4 hours away (the second of 2 BA flights) and flying Club Class so used the BA Lounge. The actual International Departure area after security looked quite small but it didn't have the usual hordes of people aimlessly milling about between the fast food outlets, coffee shops, sports bars and departure gates. Also quite wide so gave an airy uncrowded feel, and had some nice seating areas with tables. Probably would have been pretty dull and boring if we weren't using BA's lounge. It did have a couple of restaurants at the very end of the terminal which actually looked very nice with great views of the runways. A real scrum with no apparent order when the flight was called, but all in all nowhere near as bad as I was expecting from the previous reviews."
27th July 2018,2,"""Boring terminal""","✅ Trip Verified | I was surprised that on Terminal G of SFO, after security check, there are only very few shops that were opened, with only Gucci as the international brand, and three restaurants. Boring terminal!"
24th July 2018,1,"""This place is extremely unorganized""
","Not Verified |  Every single person I know has had a horrific experience here, but mine began when my flight got delayed 10 times and they would only tell us in only 30 minute incriminates. The food is horrible and the staff are the most unhelpful I have ever experienced. This place is extremely unorganized and everyone seems to be scrambling because their flights are messed up as well. Avoid at all costs."
22nd July 2018,4,"""Sort this out SFO!""","Not Verified |  Worst experience I've had in immigration lines. 90 minute delay from getting off plane to exiting immigration/customs. First the automatic scanning of passport was good and fast, but then we waited in a barely moving line as four immigration officers tried to process 1000+ incoming travelers, and proceeded to repeat what the automatic scanning device did (fingerprints and photo). Asked twice why there was such a delay, customer support replied by blaming it one the airlines 'poorly scheduled arrivals'. Eventually immigration staff were increased to 6 people processing the backlog. Sort this out SFO! I'll try to come through Oakland in future. Great to be treated like cattle."
27th June 2018,4,"""fix your wifi SFO!""","Not Verified |  I am currently writing this review on my cell phone instead of my computer because the WiFi is horrendous. I cannot even express how frustrating it is to try to log onto the WiFi upwards of 50 times and get no results. I’m leaving this airport (thank god) and won’t have to experience it any time soon. It is nearly impossible to get internet on a device that doesn’t have cellular because of this WiFi issue. I am extremely unsatisified with my departure (the wifi issue) and my arrival. The airline we flew in with had lost my bag and even though they had it to us pretty fast, it was still very inconvenient. Overall, fix your wifi SFO! It is extremely unprofessional, unexceptable and unnecessarily difficult."
5th June 2018,1,"""People backed up back to the gate""","✅ Trip Verified | It took more than 3 Hours through immigration. No one there to ask a question. Since I traveled alone no chance to go to restrooms. When I asked someone to look after my bag for a minute to check with someone to see if there could be anything done to reach my connecting flight, all that I got was someone shouting at me from one of the officers. To picture it: Some flights had arrived in a short sequence, there must been more than 1000 people and there were 4 officers, one of them dealing exclusively with a large number of people using a wheelchair. After that he disappeared. People backed up back to the gate. So if more than 3 hours are not enough to get a connection, then I guess you cannot go through SFO at all. I made it with closing doors, sweating like hell, and wishing I hadn't booked my vacation. I booked business to have a pleasant trip, this did not work. Maybe it is some support for the airlines, so that tickets have to bought twice. So: If visitors with a willing credit card and in good spirit to use it are abosutely not welcome, why not close the border completely? Fortunately the nice people on Hawaii made more than up for it. I doubt I will travel through or to SFO ever again."
30th May 2018,4,"""Staff were inefficient and rude""","✅ Trip Verified | Disappointing experience in SFO. Upon arrival, waited close to two hours to exit customs. Now at departure, queue to security was an hour long. Staff were inefficient and rude. Toilets were littered with used seat covers. Shops were limited. Queue for lift to enter departure area was also slow. Nothing to be excited about really, if given a choice, I will never fly out of this airport again. Note to all passengers - Account for a long waiting time and be very early. Airport wifi was spotty. Upon arrival - unable to connect for close to an hour (but I was already queuing for 2 hours at the customs so..). Upon departure, wifi comes on and off. They can work more on signages to inform passengers better - be it security checks or even direction to gates."
22nd May 2018,3,"""there is always a delay""",❌ Not Verified |  Every time we fly into SFO there is always a delay due to traffic. Why does this only ever happen here? Is there a shortage of air traffic controllers? We are to the point of rather flying into Oakland.
12th May 2018,6,"""very long queues at immigration""","✅ Trip Verified |  As usual very long queues at immigration. They seriously need to modify their immigration hall; its too small and cramped for handling so many international arrivals all the time. There are substantial immigration counters but very few staff. The baggage area is also very small and gets crowded because the flights arrive in quick succession but the immigration takes time, so there's a lot of baggage waiting to be collected. Customs is fast and they don't bother you much."
10th May 2018,1,"""the most disorganised airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  As a seasoned traveller I am accustomed to arriving at chaotic airports but never in a million years expected to witness such poor customer service / organisation at a US airport! Arrived on A380 flight from London at the same time as an Air France flight. 10 minute walk to passport check not too bad but that is as good as it got! Met by a very rude SFO staff member whom herded us like cattle into the international queue. It was at this point that it dawned on me I was going to be there a while ... a very long while to be precise. 10+ CBP desks all unmanned except ,yep you guessed, 1 CBP to check what I estimated to be at least 400 people in the queue. I counted probably 100 in front of me so unless they were to put more staff on (I counted at least 3 walking around chatting but not on desks) average 2-3 mins per person, I was in the queue for the long haul (pun intended!) There were families with small children in the queue some as young as 2 whose parents seemed to be at their wits end trying to keep them within the confines of the queuing system ......come on SFO airport sort it out so those with very small children and the elderly be given priority it is not on! Anyway after 2 hours in the queue and approx 40 people in front of me somebody took the initiative to open up a few more desks and some 30 mins later I received my stamp and was in the baggage hall. At least I won’t have to wait for my bag to arrive I thought - wrong it had arrived but then they had put the Air France flight on the same carousel mixing everybody’s bags up. As we had all been in immigration so long the bags had been removed from the belts and dotted around the baggage hall. Top tip if you can’t find your suitcase and are told that it has arrived ask to see if any bags had been taken downstairs to make space! As after about 50 minutes that was where I had to gamble on going (have to clear customs to go downstairs with no way back if it is not there) to visually identify it - to summarise disembark the airplane 1700 arrive immigration 1710 walk out of the airport at 2030 makes SFO officially the most disorganised airport I have ever had the displeasure to arrive sprinkle it with unmotivated rude staff really gives such a poor first impression of what is a fantastic city / country which is a shame! Next time I visit it will be OAK or SJC no way will I ever go through SFO again!"
10th April 2018,3,"""staff indifferent and inefficient""","✅ Trip Verified | We arrived on a full international flight from AKL and landed in SFO to transfer to ORD. It took 2 hours to get through to the domestic terminal. The security staff was indifferent and inefficient. The TSA PRE line was empty and fully staffed. The employees in that area were yawning and indifferent while there was a line of about 200 people going through the only other line. In addition, there were at least 5 other security employees standing idle. However, they chose to have only one person checking passports and only one person managing the security line who was extremely slow. It was the worst security I have ever experienced from both a domestic and international perspective. Unless I am coming to San Francisco the stay, I will try to avoid this airport in the future."
9th April 2018,4,"""complete lack of helpers""","✅ Trip Verified | Barely caught connection: signage, directions and complete lack of helpers, greeters or assistants makes navigation very challenging. Multiple possible trains to change terminals and little guidance on the quickest one. Must go through security again when transferring terminals: real downside. Also our first flight waited 25 minutes for a gate to park. Cut our time way down. I would avoid SFO Airport for connecting flights. They should work harder on user friendliness. (Snarky TSA guy was no help.)"
12th January 2018,4,"""I try to avoid SFO""","✅ Trip Verified | I fly weekly for business, and my client for the past year has been in the San Francisco Bay area - so I've flown into and out of all three Bay Area airports, Oakland, San Jose, and San Francisco. Overall, I would say that SFO has great shopping and dining, is wonderfully decorated, is convenient to drive into and out of - and totally blows at making airplanes land and take off on time. In the past year, I have had a higher percentage of my flights into and out of SFO delayed than at any other airport. When I check FlightAware, in general the other two Bay Area airports will be on-time, while SFO will be delayed. I have been delayed due to fog, winds, air traffic, runway construction and smoke. The most heinous delay was when airport operations decided to ""flip the airport"" - switch which direction traffic would land and take off - which made every airplane on the ground, even ones lined up to take off, have to then taxi around to a different runway. This happened after they closed the boarding door on my flight and put us twenty-sixth in line for take-off and delayed us for over an hour. This was one of the only two times I've ever actually missed a connecting flight. Other than SFO's near-incompetence with their core function, the airport is largely okay. I fly American from Terminal 2, but I go through security at the Delta terminal, Terminal 1, because there are currently only 8 gates in operation there, and I can go through PreCheck in less than 5 minutes, then walk over to T2 inside security. The tram that runs to the rental car facility is rather slow, but does the job fairly stress-free. And, it's fun to look at the jumbo and super-jumbo jets (Airbus 380, that is) that fly internationally. But in general, I try to avoid SFO, especially for departures if I have to make a connection."
21st December 2017,1,"""staff were nowhere to be located""","✅ Trip Verified | On 12/19/17, at Gate 66 United. The 140+ Decibel Alarm Rang For Over 30 Minutes at 8.00 am, finally silencing around 8.30 am after the third call by airport personnel. No excuse for forcing passengers to be subjected to dangerous sound levels while staff were nowhere to be located. A complete failure to follow public health sound regulations and codes. A ridiculous amount of damage to the hearing for many. Felt like I was in a greyhound station without an adult attendant. Elderly passengers cringing with hands over ears. A major incident where no-one seems to care."
8th December 2017,7,"""Overall, it's a decent airport""","❎ Not Verified |    SFO is my home airport. I've flown domestically a couple of times out of it, but with the lack of service on domestic airlines, I really don't like flying on US carriers. Thus, my review is a compilation of experiences on both departures and arrivals at SFO over the last six years. My wife and I travel two to three times a year, mostly to Asia to visit her relatives. Most of the TPAC flights we've taken out of SFO have been late night and the security line experience has been quite quick. SFO doesn't use TSA agents. They were allowed to hire contract employees instead and the difference shows, at least in the international security lines. I believe the longest I've taken in a security line is about 15 minutes, and that was for a rare day flight. So departures are typically pretty good. Arrivals have been a different story. We got into the Global Entry system pretty early in the game, back before credit card offers to reimburse the $100 fee were common. We did it after one particularly heinous arrival in which two 380's and a couple of 777's all landed within minutes of each other, coupled with a computer glitch, caused the lines to simply be ridiculous. If you're familiar with the arrivals layout, you know there's a gate way the heck down at the far end of the arrivals hall. That's where the back of the line was. I believe it was 2.5 hours to get through immigration after all was said and done. But even before that, lines were typically about an hour long, even when fewer than the maximum number of flights land simultaneously. Global Entry changed that for us. The last flight we took arrived back in SFO on December 5th at 6.16pm, according to FlightAware. We were in my brother-in-law's car at 6.45 with our baggage. Lounges at SFO are pretty spartan. We have the Priority Pass, and the only lounge that's available in the entire airport, domestic or international, is on the OneWorld (AA) side of international departures. None are in domestic departures. And the international departure area is separated to such an extent that if you go to the OneWorld side and your flight is departing on the Star Alliance side, you have to back out from the secure area and then pass security on the other side. Not a well thought out design. We've also used the United Lounge, and those are pretty universally grim. Signage is good. The food and beverage on the airside, while a little steep (what airport isn't), was pretty decent. While it's possible to get to and from the airport on public transit, I wouldn't recommend it. BART is a pretty poorly run system and security is not exactly their forte, so I would imagine someone with suitcases would be seen as easy pickings. My one experience with the super shuttle was a Zero Dark Thirty ride one morning from our house about 10 miles away. For my wife and I, it was about $20. Overall, it's a decent airport. It won't compare with the Changi's, Incheon's or even Bangkok airports of the world, but it's serviceable and, sadly, it represents one of the better airports in the country."
17th November 2017,1,"""staff totally disrespectful and rude""
","❎ Unverified |  Arriving into this airport was ridiculous, queues for over an hour, staff totally disrespectful and rude not only to myself but other passengers. Organised chaos, no one had a clue of what they were supposed to be doing and when they did some one else would contradict them! The young lady, I use the word lady very loosely and for the sake of this review, who pulled me to question why I didn't have my papers (another member of staff took my papers before I arrived to a member of staff who was supposed to take the papers) spoke to me like dirt and made myself and another two passengers (who I wasn't travelling with) feel very uncomfortable, very bad attitude, arrogant and curt!"
16th November 2017,3,"""the worst transfer experience""","✅ Verified Review |  This has got to be the worst transfer experience I’ve ever had. I only had a 1hr 45min layover. Make sure you have 2.5 hrs or more. The customs alone took about 45 min. I still had to claim my baggage, recheck them and go through security. I mentioned to security that I was late for my next flight and I was transferring. The guy said they don't expedite passengers (and yet many of the good reviews for their airport says they do?) so that’s a complete lie. He nicely suggested I could ask others if I could cut. Here, sadly, it’s common for people to be asking others to cut at security because they are late for their flights. To be fair, so far no staff were rude, just indifferent. But one young guy near the right side security conveyer belts (right before the scanning machine), when I asked him what should I do, grinned and rudely said ""it’s not my problem"". I didn’t have time to get his name. I had only 5 minutes to get to gate 90 (yep, the one at the very end) and had to run with all I had. Once I got to my flight 1 min past the boarding time officially ending, the crew was nice enough to still let me on. Seeing me panting, red-faced and sweating, one guy nodded at me and said “you had to run too?”"
11th November 2017,1,"""most horrible security lines""",✅ Verified Review |  The most horrible security lines I have experienced since directly after 911. One security lane was open for hundreds of travelers. People missed flights because the TSA personnel would not allow them to go through the TSA precheck line. I will never fly out of SFO again. Would rather fly out of OAK!
10th October 2017,3,"!will avoid SFO at all costs""","❎ Unverified | We arrived from Toronto at Terminal G and needed to find the departure gate of our connecting flight to Sydney. In Terminal G there were no signs showing departure gates of flights leaving at other terminals. After asking cleaners and security guards we were told we would have to leave the secure area and re-enter in the other terminal. indications to find Terminal A were hard to find and we were advised to use the train. There is a blue and a red line; the red line was not operating and it was a 20 min ride from Terminal G to Terminal A, then we had to go through security which offered no help for connecting passengers, the plane was fully boarded when we arrived at the gate. We ran around 90 min and swore we will avoid SFO at all costs in the future"
13th September 2017,1,"""Horrible planning at this airport""","✅ Verified Review |  Horrible planning at this airport. Over the past 10 days I've landed at this airport twice at around 1.00 am and were informed that our gate was occupied, having to wait about 20 min to be given another gate. People at SFO, please do better planning, you should not keep people waiting on the planes constantly due to your poor planning."
9th August 2017,3,"""There are no signs""",✅ Verified Review |  Arrived into T1 and needed to transfer to international. There are no signs. Our flight had been delayed so we had very little time to get from T1 to international. It was terrible. Huge security queues. No one to ask for help. Walking down endless long corridors between terminals with no signs not knowing if we were right or wrong. No way of jumping the security queue even though we would have missed our flight had we not skipped the 300+ people in security queue.
30th July 2017,1,"""arrival in international was horrendous""","✅ Verified Review | Arrival in international was horrendous. Herded through long lines and a feeling of chaos. I'm a citizen and have never waited so long for a stamp in any of the dozens of countries I've travelled - except now my own thanks to San Francisco. It was an hour in line, with equally exhausted and upset people. I looked over and saw the visitor line was 4x longer, meaning they stood for 2 or more hours for a stamp. Welcome to America? Not cool! After finally getting stamped, I was at baggage claim for an hour and a half. Some people 2 hours to get their bags, again, first time ever for me. 2.5 with no water or toilet as a single traveler you don't want to leave baggage area thinking your bag is coming out - but 1.5 hours later it finally does. I felt so embarrassed that this chaos is the very first impress for visitors and I missed 2 airport busses myself. I have no idea what inefficiency is going on at international arrivals but it's really, really bad."
14th June 2017,10,"""improved markedly""","✅ Verified Review | We flew from Terminal 3, the base for United's domestic operations. Things have improved markedly at San Francisco over the past couple of years. Terminal 3 has been thoroughly modernized and has many state-of-the-art features. United's clubs, at gate 69 and in the satellite concourse, are both among their better clubs. Check-in is well-spaced and efficient. Security, long a problem for Terminal 3, seems to have been configured to move quickly. We were flying at midday and experienced no wait at TSA Pre-check. As an aside, I'm also familiar with SFO's international concourses. They are among the best in the US, with lots of facilities and efficient boarding areas."
30th May 2017,1,"""officials were pleasant""","Customs and immigration with a returning ESTA was reasonably quick using the newish kiosks. All the officials were pleasant which has not always been the case previously. Bags were quickly available and their onward checking efficient. Security check into T3 was also quick and painless. Plenty of places to eat and drink before heading for gate lounge. Lots of seating, easy to read departure boards, clean rest rooms and well organised boarding procedure. No complaints at all."
22nd May 2017,9,"""out 20 mins after leaving the aircraft""","After reading all these negative reviews I was positively surprised by San Francisco Airport. Arrived on an international flight on Friday evening with United. No wait at immigration at all! Officer was very friendly, baggage delivery was quick and I was out approx 20 mins after leaving the aircraft. Next morning cdeparted on a domestic flight. Security was fast (wait time hardly 3 mins - ok, admittedly I could take the first class line, but the normal one was also very short) so I had plenty of time for coffee. Directions in the terminal were clearly marked and I found it easy to navigate."
10th April 2017,2,"""customs is terrible""","Customs is terrible, it has been for the past three years, long lines to get first to the computer that takes your picture and passport information and then through to the agent. Hundreds of people waiting and only three agents to serve you. Makes you wonder where your tax dollars go."
31st March 2017,2,"""avoid for international arrivals""",Avoid San Francisco airport for international arrivals. I travel to Asia frequently. Leaving SFO was not a problem. Getting home was very difficult. There were about 1000 people in the US citizen line upon our arrival. We had an hour to get to our connecting flights. We asked several workers who said that we needed to get in line. Previously at other airports and here we received cards to bypass the lines for our transfers. But not now! We asked people in line if we could cut to make our flights and they allowed us but there were still a couple of hundred people ahead. After sprinting with our carts of luggage we made the planes at the last minute. One was held a few minutes for 2 of our group. Seattle will be my airport from now on.
28th March 2017,5,"""such a waste of time""",We spent over two hours to pass immigration. The new self-service machines have increased the queue times at this airport. They are such a waste of time since almost everybody is still sent to regular interview where they take the pictures again and validate the documents again.
17th December 2016,2,"""worst for immigration queuing time""","San Francisco is the worst airport for immigration queuing time. Only 3 counters open. I waited for more than an hour for a stamp, not to mention the rude staff that keep yelling at the passengers. I thought America has the best airports, by looking at the advancement in the country. I was wrong. The airport in my hometown in Jakarta is even better at queuing time for immigration. Do note that my country is still a ""developing"" country they said."
31st October 2016,10,"""so many people willing to help me""","✅ Verified Review | I want to thank the staff that helped me find my lost briefcase which I foolishly left in a bathroom after arriving to San Francisco from a long flight. The ground floor baggage office, the oversize baggage office, the cleaning staff, the lost and found office and the Qantas desk. Also all the various TSA, police officers and information desk staff. All these people in one way or another were so helpful and never just told me tough luck. There was nothing of particular value in the briefcase, just a lot of items which I collected on my trip, but nevertheless I wanted to keep. It is hard to believe in such a major airport so many people would be so willing to help me. I was especially impressed with the downstairs luggage office in the international terminal who very willingly contacted a staff member who quickly checked the plane and searched it for the briefcase. The lost and found police officer did more than have me fill out a form and quickly confirmed that the briefcase had been found and returned to Qantas."
5th October 2016,1,"""the worst airport experience""","We flew into the SF domestic terminal from Newark with United Airlines, with a 6 hour wait before flying Qantas to Sydney. Because my mother-in-law needs wheelchair assistance, the plan was to meet her at the Qantas departure gate. However, she wasn't there and nobody at all in the airport was able to assist us. I spoke with about 25 staff about the misplaced family member but all they could do was direct me to others who sent me on a wild goose chase for five hours. Even though numerous PA announcements were made for my mother-in-law, when she approched counter staff she was rudely ignored. Most of the staff, including the company responsible for delivering her to the wrong gate on the other side of the huge airport, seemed unconerned about the plight with absolutely no procedure for missing wheelchair passengers. I only found her after going through three security checks to various sections of the airport. As a regular traveller for over 30 years, this would have to be the worst airport experience of my life. San Francisco Airport is callous, rude and incompetent."
27th June 2016,3,"""food options are limited and expensive""","San Francisco is my home airport. It has some serious problems. Severe delays due to weather are extremely common all year. The worst I've ever experienced was 4 hours. The terminals are also poorly organized. Terminal 3 is strictly for domestic UA flights. Terminal 1 is also domestic-only and all other airlines. Terminal 2 is strictly international. If you have a connecting flight on a different airline, be prepared to walk a long way. The security lines are longer and slower than most US airports. The food options are very limited and all are expensive. The employees at security, UA customer service are all very rude."
6th June 2016,9,"""best airport in the US""","Unless you're flying out of the dreadful Terminal 1, SFO is the best airport in the US. We flew United from Terminal 3, a thoroughly modernized relic of the 1970s (the 1950s if you take into account the original design). Check-in is pretty efficient, but the gamble is with security, which can be very congested, even sometimes with TSA Pre-Check. In our case it was very quick indeed, but we were going through at midday. Shops and services throughout Terminal 3 are excellent as is United's main club at the junction of two main piers. The airport is airy and open and hold areas are reasonable. Things get even better if you are flying through either of the International Terminals or the completely renovated Terminal 2."
26th May 2016,8,"""signage is clear and easy to follow""",San Francisco is a modern airport. Excellent selection for food both outside and inside the gate area. Free Wifi is excellent. Signage is clear and easy to follow. Airport Staff seems nice except for the UA Boarding agents on my flight who all looked miserable and did not smile. I always enjoy SFO airport. Very clean.
23rd May 2016,8,"""security is also good and thorough""","I usually depart out of SFO for both International and Domestic. In the first weekend of May 2016, right before the peak of a proposed busy season due to a good economy, airport security was smooth. My flight was delayed as my handy TripIt app informs me of any changes so I wasn't too worried. The staff here are friendly. Security is also good and thorough. Lines were long but it is to be expected especially since I do not have TSA Pre Check. For this trip I traveled Domestic to PDX. Airport was great but delayed flight out was a nightmare. Rainy weather in early May what a drag. When I took a trip back in April 2016 same thing flight delayed. I flew Virgin America each time. I do not think it mattered too much in terms of airline, it was mostly the weather out of the airport. That is my biggest gripe flying out of SFO. Otherwise, great security and employees. Also, another thing I do like about SFO is that there are filtered water stations immediately after security. Bring your reusable bottle and refill."
8th April 2016,3,"""left scouring the walls ""","I came in from XNA looking at a 3 hour hold over. I have been in a lot of airports but the terminal for the United gates were very sub par. My biggest complaint is that there is almost no places for travelers to charge phones or plug in laptops. They have one area that seats 8, as in eight people with a desk and outlet. Other than that, you are left scouring the walls looking for a way to plug in your phone. Even small airports today have gate seating areas with outlets and USB ports. You'd think that a major airport like San Francisco would be up to date. Food options lack as well. The food options you do have are very expensive. They think every traveler is a millionaire."
14th March 2016,6,"""food options very mediocre""","Travelling from SFO to Japan using the international terminal. Because of a long layover and an after midnight departure I was looking forward to having a decent meal prior. SFO it appears to feature mostly Japanese buffet/fast food options. An upscale Japanese restaurant was featured on their dining options chart for the North Area food court but there didn't appear to be any sign of the restaurant itself. I wish Stone Brewery had a dining facility here like they have in Terminal 3 because it is badly needed. Not sure what Firewood Grill is doing at SFO because the quality of their food options for a sit down dinner were very mediocre at best. The International Terminal is otherwise very spacious, airy and welcoming."
31st October 2015,8,"""check-in was painless and quick""",Check-in was painless and quick. Having travelled through SFO airport before I knew to eat before you pass security as food places after are poor. Going through security was a little slow (took about 30-mins) but the people in charge seemed friendly and chatty - unlike Boston. Wi-Fi was good and quick. Getting to my gate was a little walk but nothing too strenuous. Overall SFO airport is pretty good and I won't mind travelling in/out of there again.
13th October 2015,9,"""immigration was well organised""",Arrived at San Francisco international Terminal at 8am after long flight from Sydney. Quickly through immigration which was well organised with bags appearing a little time later. Selected for customs search which was also quick and courteous. Bag drop queue non existent. Through pre TSA at T3 without delays. From landing to waiting at the gate for our ongoing flight in T3 around 45 minutes. SFO certainly had its act together on this occasion.
22nd September 2015,4,"""SFO has totally dropped the ball""","This is for the International terminal flying with BA on the north side. We arrived on BART then took the light rail to the terminal. Check-in was a bit of a walk from the light rail, but we aren't old. We had arrived early for the earlier of the two BA flights so security was quiet and fast. But that's the end of the good news. SFO has totally dropped the ball. I don't want to hang around before security because I want to get the chore out of the way. But after security there is almost nothing but bathrooms and gate seating. There's a small cafe serving plastic wrapped food near security, a crummy little over priced personal pizza and plastic wrapped food restaurant right at the end on the right and an expensive and thoroughly disappointing coffee shop on the left. There are no proper sit down restaurants. The only stores are the over priced duty free and the usual tourist junk stores. There's no good book shop, there's no pub, there's no waited table service. There isn't even a cafeteria or food court style restaurant. They built this huge terminal with it's millions of dollars taller than it has any need to be statement of a check-in hall but they forgot all about the fact that people want to pass their waiting time in the departure lounge in some comfort. It's more like a railway station than an airport. For a heavy jet it seems to take ages to taxi for takeoff from the east-west runways, but it is all factored in to the expected duration, so relax, you are leaving and someone will finally provide, oh right, airplane food. Why couldn't I get a decent meal at the airport? Returning to SFO we had booked a rental car, cheaper than a taxi and much more pleasant than a shuttle, we did a one way to KOAK which is just a few miles from home and cut out the waiting and sharing and discomfort. The aircraft taxi time is a lot less for arrivals. We got off the plane promptly but some other flights were in too. Immigration now has electronic service. I hope you look like you. But they haven't improved baggage handling. Airports like Manchester in the UK should give masterclasses to the sluggard baggage handlers at SFO, I have got off the front of an A330 in Manchester, flashed my European passport in the EU lane and walked straight in to the baggage claim to see my bag already waiting for me there. No danger of that at SFO. Any time will do. Even with a nearly new and purpose designed facility they are in no hurry to do their job. So we stand and wait and wait. Eventually the bags turn up. Show the paperwork to the customs guy and you are on your way. Out the door through the throng of people not waiting for us then follow the signs up to the light rail and a few minutes later you are deposited at the car rental facility. I am a frequent renter with several companies, this time I took Alamo and we were in the car and leaving inside of ten minutes after getting off the train. Join the loyalty programs, they are well worth the time. We can go over the Bay Bridge or San Mateo, both are about the same distance and both are well sign posted from the car rental exit. Basically turn right then follow the signs to US101, unless you are going somewhere else."
15th August 2015,3,San Francisco Airport customer review,"Arrived on a United Airlines Boeing 747 from London. We landed 15 minutes early at 1pm only to be told there was a plane in our gate and we would have to wait until around 1.30pm for that plane to leave. At 1.45pm, the plane had finally left and we started moving to the gate. Then the other plane had to return to the gate because of an emergency. Leaving us still waiting on the tarmac for another 20 minutes. Finally they moved us to another gate and we were able to disembark. There should have been better organisation at the airport to prevent such delays. When we got inside the terminal we had to walk a long distance to the immigration desks where there was a very long queue. Many of the desks were closed and the area was totally unprepared for the numbers of people coming through despite it being mid-afternoon. There were no staff controlling the queues so some people were able to skip ahead of others. Very badly organised. Finally got through to baggage claim. There were a number of other people at the carousel and we waited for our luggage for ages. Then we realised that the luggage from our flight had been taken off and left aside. Nobody from the airport or airline bothered to tell us where our luggage was. Really poor experience this time at SFO."
19th April 2015,n/a,San Francisco Airport customer review,Airport is great except for wait times at immigration. I've been one of the first off my plane and still had to wait nearly an hour to get through I feel really sorry for the 400+ people behind me. Where are all the staff?
14th January 2015,1,San Francisco Airport customer review,Used global entry at immigration fast and easy except at 5ft height the picture was of the top of my head only. A very mean security guard told me to go stand at 37. Looking around to figure out which line was 37 he yelled at me to go now. I walked to 37 and then he again yelled to stand where he pointed. There were no markings on the floor to tell me where to stand so I looked at his pointing finger to figure out where he wanted me to stand and then he yelled at me again to get moving up to the booth. I'm 67 years old female and I hadn't been yelled at like that for about 50 years. The immigration officer was nice asked about my trip and welcomed me home. The security in Mexico hoped I had enjoyed my stay in Puerto Vallarta and wished me a nice day.
19th September 2014,6,San Francisco Airport customer review,Arrived mid afternoon from Heathrow to very long immigration lines for visitors but once US citizens cleared all booths opened and cleared in just over 1 hour. Still too long but at least they were organised and a lot better than other US airports in Summer. The facilities are fine no idea why people complain about this aspect apart from maybe late opening for any early overseas flights including Canada. Local transport to SF downtown is excellent.
17th September 2014,6,San Francisco Airport customer review,Compared to LAX SFO is pretty OK for US airport. Our arrival and departure it was fairly seamless in the International Terminal - cleared immigration and security fairly quickly. Despite delay (14 hours) SFO is reasonably comfortable but more distractions would be nice. I was comfortably cloistered in the Business class lounge but took walks out and noted apart for food and shopping they could do with free wifi and computer terminals phone/tab charging kiosks.
20th August 2014,9,San Francisco Airport customer review,Terminal 2 at SFO (Virgin America and American Airlines) was completed in 2011 and is in my opinion the best airport terminal in the USA hands down. Terminal 2 at San Francisco is clean and TSA lines are generally short and efficient. I mainly take the redeye to Washington DC (IAD). Terminal 2 blows away flying on United - the other older SFO terminal is one of the worst in the USA. But Virgin America are geniuses to be at Terminal 2. Terminal 2 has a great bookstore a nice massage area a very good restaurant and a number of good fast food options. The overall Terminal feel and look is clean reducing your traveler's stress immediately. This Terminal should be the blueprint/case study for American airports to study.
11th May 2014,n/a,San Francisco Airport customer review,Utterly terrible. 2hrs and 5 mins to get through immigration. Only 4 desks for visitors out of a total 48 available positions. Only a volunteer helping to organise the queue. Absolutely no concern shown by staff. No one managing the situation. Its not like long haul flights with hundreds of passengers on arrive by surprise. This needs much better planning and management.
20th March 2022,4,"""there's no reason to treat people that way""",Not Verified |  Rudest TSA agent I've ever ever encountered. He yelled a profanity at us because we didn't realize our suitcase had to go into a tray. I understand of you're having a bad day and that TSA can be a difficult job but there's no reason to treat people that way.
24th February 2022,1,"""the least efficient airport in the U.S""","Not Verified |  Probably the least efficient airport in the U.S. when it comes to rental car rental and return, and the shuttle transportation from the rental car area to the airport. You do not want to be cutting it close to get to your departure gate if dropping off a rental care here, because they certainly aren't in a hurry and the shuttles are few and far between."
29th December 2021,7,"""There is a taxi problem every time I fly into Las Vegas""",Not Verified |  Once again a 100+ person taxi line and no cabs. McCarron needs to have at least minimal cab service of some level to meet customer demand. There is a taxi problem every time I fly into Las Vegas.
27th December 2021,1,"""such a disgusting airport""","Not Verified | In the many flights I have been on I have never seen such a disgusting airport. When I say unclean I mean, you don't even want to put your shoes on the floor. No moving sidewalks were working. All tables and counter space were sticky and had trash everywhere. Bathrooms were so bad that I waited to use the one on the airplane. Due to a delayed flight I sat there for 6hrs and saw 1, I repeat 1, cleaning lady come around and smash the trash down instead of taking it out."
8th December 2021,2,"""It was a chaotic mess""","Not Verified |  I was so disappointed with McCarren Airport on December 6th. Terminal 1 was so over crowded and no one making sure people were wearing mask. It was a chaotic mess. Announcements constantly over the top of each other. Constant gate changes, dirty and broken down woman’s bathroom and overcrowded mess., That terminal created so much stress to everyone. Please, with all the constant traffic through that airport you must do better. I was there on a Monday evening and not a Holliday, could it be worse? It’s a bad experience for customers and I am sure it’s stressful for employees. Way to crowded in all areas and out of control."
20th October 2021,8,"""Going through TSA was another story""",Not Verified |  My husband and I are going to see our grandson in MN. We are 71 and 79 years old. We have not flown in 2 years. We are Pre TSA and are flying Sun Country. The check in for Sun Country was great. Going through TSA was another story. The gentleman at the walk through scanner was very rude. I set the beeper off. I said it was probably my anklet. He said that was not possible. I told him that it had happened before. He told me again that was impossible. I removed my Apple Watch and two bracelets. I then was able to go through the scanner. I felt that he was very rude. I understand there can be frustration when dealing with the public. This is the only recourse that I have to express my unhappiness.
13th October 2021,2,"""security check point is slow""","✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines kiosk not work and unacceptable personal for need and slow service in the baggage drop off, security check point is slow and rude personal for family members including kids."
17th August 2021,2,"""We almost missed our flight due to this""",✅ Trip Verified | My laptop with my 3 cell phones were sent to the back for an additional security check. The second scan didn't produce anything wrong. We almost missed our flight due to this additional scan that was caused by what? It was unnecessary! Maybe the security scan machines are defective and/or need additional cleaning/rebooting?
30th July 2021,5,"""the TSA checkpoint was confusing and frustrating""","Not Verified |  Going through the TSA checkpoint was confusing and frustrating. The TSA agents kept giving me conflicting instructions. Take off your shoes, you can put your shoes back on if you walked through the K9 area, put your shoes on to walk through the metal detector. It made absolutely no sense and when I acknowledged it I just received blank stares from them. The conveyor belt stopped working because someone’s bag jammed it because the TSA agents failed to tell the person to put their bag in a tray. I watched them watch the person put the bag loose on the conveyor belt and then fail to give them correct instructions. Then as they were trying to fix the jammed conveyor belt a TSA agent came over to where I was and said that it had stopped working because a tray was still in the tray dispenser. I don’t believe this had anything to do with what the problem was, and there were trays sitting in other tray dispensers, but they decided it was the one in front of me that was the problem and gave me stern look. Again, that makes no sense, my tray didn’t jam it. They need to improve their system and communicate better with each other and with people who are traveling because we are not mind readers. I see this happen a lot with incompetent employees, they can easily blame the customer for a problem. In this case it really seemed like the TSA agents were causing problems for themselves. What would a person gain by not following instructions and delaying their travel time at the airport? I felt frustrated enough to write this review, and felt completely validated to see other negative reviews."
15th July 2021,1,"""the worst airport I’ve ever been through""",✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airport I’ve ever been through. I travel here several times a month for work and have never not had my flight delayed or cancelled.
13th July 2021,1,"""There are no signs anywhere""","Not Verified |  Long term parking is ridiculous. You park on International or Domestic side which both lead you to terminal 3 D Gates. We almost missed our flight for departure because the security gate was not open and had no other way to get to gate C. We had all 3 teams to get there. When arriving try to find the Tram but you can only take a shuttle. I asked several people where to get to long term parking and not one person could answer other than leading me to Public parking. Never mentioned a tram. So we wonder around again looking for a way to get to Terminal 3 because we arrived in terminal 1. There are no signs anywhere but on the last elevator by the front door. All the TSA agents were absolutely rude when asked any questions. Not only by us but by anyone around I saw asking them how to get to a location. Get better signage, better way to longer term parking and friendlier staff."
25th June 2021,3,"""Any future trips to Vegas, I'll fly else where and drive in""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrival uneventful with exception of extremely long walk to bag claim. Departure gate c/d TSA security rude when an item was out of spec with rules. Just say ""sir you can take the bottle and dump it and re-screen, or leave the bottle"", all of his attitude wasn't called for. I don't stereotype but this falls right in line with what I would have guessed. I re-screened and passed. Looked at the TSA agent and told him to have a really great day. TSA body scans kids. I know, because they tried to scan mine. Just because shes tall doesn't make her older. Seating areas look like the 1980's. Charging ports in that area are few and far between. The prison gray, white and black color exude such warmth and welcome. Any future trips to Vegas, I'll fly else where and drive in."
27th May 2021,1,"""She rudely told me to move on""","Not Verified |  Arriving at the Terminal 1 passenger pickup this morning from the cell phone lot, I exited my vehicle and walked to my trunk to open it up. I was immediately approached by the ‘traffic person’ before I even got it open. She rudely told me to move on. I said my friend was approaching but she again told me I needed to move. My friend was approaching my car but this rude woman told me to point her out because she didn’t believe me. There were only three or four people who had finished crossing the walkway. There was no line of cars waiting for anything, in fact there were very few cars there at all, but this woman was determined to make me leave. That’s when my friend stopped with her luggage to put into the trunk. I had been stopped less than two minutes. The woman didn’t leave us even then but continued to be as unpleasant as she could. My friend and I are both in our mid seventies and I hate to think how someone with a disability would be treated. If this is the way you represent Las Vegas to the world we deserve the very worst criticism of all. The attitude of these people should at least attempt to be hospitable if not helpful."
26th April 2021,2,"""This an obtuse way to treat people""","Not Verified |  Get more rental car trams / buses. This an obtuse way to treat people. I have never waited this long to get on a rental car bus either arrival or departure. Absolutely ridiculous! Makes me not want to ever come back here, get it together. "
6th April 2021,9,"""we were treated like VIP’s by American Airlines""","✅ Trip Verified | When we started our trip in Savannah, GA we had ask for assistance. When we arrived in Las Vegas there was someone waiting at the door with a wheelchair. This employee was excellent! He took us from one terminal to where we were to pickup our luggage. Waited with us for the luggage then took us out side and hailed a cab for us. He also gave us his card so when we return to leave we can call on the way to the airport and they will be waiting for us to get us to the plane. Even though we were basic economy we were treated like VIP’s by American Airlines."
31st March 2021,3,"""LAS is just a really dirty airport overall""","✅ Trip Verified | For such a newly improved airport, McCarran sure is trash! This is the worst practically new airport I've seen anywhere in the world. I don't know what the casino revenues collected in Vegas, or even the airport itself, are going toward, but it sure isn't toward having a meaningfully modern, efficient airport, despite the many years and dollars spent on revitalization. For the pros - 1) Baggage claim was actually efficient. 2) Signage inside the airport was ample. That's about it. As for the cons? 1) There is no efficient means to take a rideshare or taxi, as the wait for either can be over an hour. It took me 40 minutes and I felt lucky compared to the people around me. 2) There's no effective means of public transportation to the Strip and this is considering that the airport is practically on the Strip! Not even a monorail. 3) The terminals have mostly new, though very depressing and uninviting, architecture and design. 4) The terminals were poorly lit, in both the late evening and early morning. 5) I saw a tiny handful of anyone working in the airport who smiled, or who otherwise just didn't look angry. 6) Airline (baggage claim) and security personnel were almost entirely ill-mannered and officious. Not just ""having a stressful morning and need coffee,"" but flat-out rude. 7) Apparently this airport doesn't believe in automated check-in and baggage machines, even though they're chock full of them, Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc. weren't operating theirs, and required their passengers to stand in long lines (of course, if you checked in in advance and have no baggage to claim, this isn't a problem for you). 8) LAS is just a really dirty airport overall, plain and simple. 9) Practically nothing was open in the airport at either 9pm or 6am, I guess this isn't a huge deal to me only because we're still in the midst of a pandemic. I understand that LAS has to interact with a never-ending array of passengers who don't even understand clear airport signage or etiquette, but I would respectfully suggest that LAS look to Salt Lake City (stunning new airport with overall great service) or even Phoenix (which is above-average but not great) as examples of how to operate a respectable airport."
27th February 2021,6,"""rudely, disrespectfully, and unprofessionally approached me""","Not Verified |  Ride share pickup area. At 08.00 on February 27, I was dispatched to the rideshare pickup lot to pickup a passenger. Upon arrival, because my vehicle is equipped with a wheel chair rack, which extends three to the rear of vehicle, if I pull my vehicle diagonally into a parking stall I would create a traffic hazard behind me. To be safe without blocking traffic, I pull in parallel to the stall post. Your parking patrol person, rudely, disrespectfully, and unprofessionally approached me and started yelling at me."
17th October 2020,7,"""Food price is too expensive""","Not Verified |  Food price is too expensive. One small bottle of orange juice $4.25. Compare with walmart just $1. All fountain water are shut off due to covid19. People has no choice has to buy food and drink with the price that no choice. Government should control and inspect food price at all airports. Why they can control people who rip off merchandise like hand sanitize, glove etc. out there but not at airport's merchandise."
6th October 2020,1,"""Get it together!""","Not Verified |  My wife only had a paper copy of her Drivers License. We just got married and booked her flight under her new name. We had no issues flying from Denver they were helpful and professional, but Las Vegas TSA was a mess. They told her to change her surname back to her maiden in order to get through security. She had to go back to Spirit and ask them to change her name on her ticket to match her passport. She had already flown with her new name in their system, but the Spirit staff member was amazing helping her cancel her flight and then re-book it to comply with TSA. Long story short they asked her to travel with a name that is no longer her legal name. She had all the documents needed marriage certificate, new social, new debit cards, new temporary license, and her passport with her maiden name, and her old voided I.D. but it still wasn't enough. Get it together! How does one airport know how to handle this matter efficiently and you guys can't."
25th September 2020,3,"""have never seen so much mistreatment on handling people""","Not Verified |  My older brother has Autism and the TSA agents kept yelling at him. The first was yelling at him to move up as my brother was walking but I guess it wasn’t fast enough. When my mom said he’s Autistic, he says “well you need to get him and tell him”, she said I was but you keep yelling at us. The canine was out and we had to pair up. My dad was trying to be my brothers partner because he’s afraid of dogs. But the lady TSA agent wasn’t listening because she was yelling at him to go. So because he was hesitant because of the dog the agent with the dog kept yelling at him as well. We (my parents and I) yelled back he’s autistic stop yelling at him. I travel a lot and have never seen so much mistreatment on handling people."
22nd August 2020,1,"""if you hate your job then quit""",Not Verified | I know being a TSA agent is probably very difficult but I do follow all the rules and try to be pleasant to you all but when I am treated like a five year old and told to line up against the wall “just like you learned in the first grade” than I get annoyed. Don’t wave me off and say stay here and don’t move! How about being nicer if you hate your job then quit. I would be fired on the spot for being rude to a patient of mine!

It is not that complicated, I saw it applied everywhere else in Vegas. I live here so I know first hand."

All transportation options were at the other end of the terminal. How can an airport be so poorly planned. At departure a few days later in terminal 1, TSA PreCheck was closed at 6.30 pm on a Sunday? Long line ups at security. Again very long walk to A gates and four moving sidewalks that were not functioning, not one but all four. Give me a break, most third world airports are superior to McCarran."
9th February 2020,10,Las Vegas Airport customer review,"Not Verified |  I would like to commend the Staff at the Departure Gate for WestJet at the Las Vegas Airport. I was flying to Vancouver on February 1/20, flight 1789 and had misplaced my passport. When I called the airline directly I was informed that a Passport was required to board the aircraft. I had cleared Security and was already checked in for boarding. The agent at the WestJet Departure Lounge was so helpful and patient. He took my information and identification and called the airline. I did have a copy of my passport with me, which was verified. After 15 minutes I was told I could board the plane to Vancouver and then on to the connecting flight to Kelowna, B.C. I cannot tell you what relief and good news that was. I cannot say enough about the service and handling of this situation by the agent that assisted me."
26th December 2019,2,"""Rude and unprofessional""","Not Verified |  Las Vegas - worst TSA experience I have ever had. Rude and unprofessional. I’m all for security, but rummaging through a 13 year olds bag while looking at her and not the contents of her bag which is falling on the floor is awful. They didn’t check anything, not even her eyeglass case. Just tossed everything around and let it fall on the floor. Then took my 17 year olds bag away without explanation to the walkthrough screening out of view, wouldn’t answer where they’d were taking bag, squatted and searched out of our view and sent bag back. My visibly upset, crying, angry daughter was made fun of by TSA so I said that it was wrong to make fun of a kid. He said he was “communicating” with his coworker to see if he was in trouble. Communicating in customer service is asking if coworker needs help. He was just being a mean person. Then the man asked if she wanted to speak to a supervisor, and my daughter said yes. TSA agent simply walked away telling everyone he didn’t know why she was so upset. When my daughter opened her bag, nothing but her underwear was touched (it was on a pocket on side of the bag). It’s despicable and nasty. Grown men bullying teenage girls and their mom. They only stopped when my husband walked into view from around the corner. Disgusting. She filed a complaint and we will too."
20th November 2019,7,"""rule doesn't make sense""","Not Verified | Got my multitool confiscated at LAS checkpoint. I had flown out of LAS with the same tool not even 5 days before with no problems. TSA was very nice about it, but I still had to throw away a gift from a friend no longer with me. The reason I couldn't have this tool? it had a 2in ""saw"" blade. My question is what am I supposed to do with a 2in sawblade thats going to cause such havoc that I cant bring it with me? Again, TSA was nice, but the rule doesn't make sense."
18th November 2019,1,"""Pre TSA is strongly advised here""","Not Verified |  Arrival was fine, but going through TSA at this airport was the absolute worst ever. I thought that since it was a smaller airport, it was be easier. Man, was I wrong! We left from the huge Atlanta airport and went through TSA with no problems. At McCarran, the people were rude, we had to stand in front of a machine to be scanned with our legs spread and arms up over our heads. Then we were frisked! Everyone had to do both of those things, not in Atlanta! I also made the mistake of buying a gift of lotion for a friend and it was confiscated! I know that I don't look like a terrorist, but I do know their rules. The woman had absolutely no empathy at all. The lotion was still factory wrapped. What the heck do they do with the things that they confiscate? That lotion was $20. I've never been treated so badly at any airport ever! Pre TSA is strongly advised here."
10th November 2019,1,"""the most abusive I have ever experienced""","Not Verified |  I have to report that the TSA agents in Las Vegas Airport are the most abusive I have ever experienced. To say they are arrogant, angry, condescending, and very loud would be an understatement. I have never been treated with so little respect while going through security in my life. Commands were shouted and if not complied with immediately further abuse was received. I purposely wear a plastic belt to enable easy pass through security but an officer barked at me to remove it. I accidentally left a hotel key in my pocket and this gave me the pleasure of a full body pat down including my crotch and hand swab. My carry on had to re x-rayed because I failed to separate all items as requested and I was suitably chastised for my inability to complete their orders. In addition they insist on shoe removal, even when I was wearing plastic flip flops. In conclusion I hope this situation with the TSA improves as this experience has left a bad taste in mouth after fun few days in Las Vegas."
2nd November 2019,1,"""Terrible, shameful treatment""","Not Verified | Visited Las Vegas for the first time recently. Our trip was wonderful, but our experience traveling through this airport ruined it. From the Fox Rental Car shuttle the bad treatment started, and it just got worse. Nearly every 'service' person we dealt with, from the American Airlines check-in, to the shop assistants, TSA, Burger King lady, and nearly every AA representative we were forced to deal with was breathtakingly rude, and sometimes downright bullying. And my husband and I are very polite and patient people. We spent the night in the freezing airport due to AA incompetence and got nothing but hostility from nearly everyone we (politely) approached for help or information. When we were finally put on a plane with the help of one American Airlines employee, I witnessed at least four other passengers being treated terribly for no reason. It's like they are trained to abuse their clients. The icing on the cake was the 2 AA cabin crew members getting into a very loud fight in the back of the plane. The tension on the plane was palpable. I've never experienced this in my life, and suddenly the news reports about passengers flipping out on planes seemed understandable. I'm not surprised, if it happens on American Airlines, and guess what? It would be totally the fault of those employees. Terrible, shameful treatment of their clients. I will never fly AA again, and will never pass through McCarron airport again. Beware!"
22nd July 2019,1,"""extremely rude and inconsiderate""","Not Verified |  The airport security/police are extremely rude and inconsiderate of any factors that might be slowing you down (in our case a 1 year old who was unwell). While waiting in the line, we were up next and we see this one officer who's just staring at us. While I am used to them signalling us to proceed and seeing nothing from him, I asked if we could. To this he shouts from there ""why are you making things difficult?"". I asked him softly, ""how did we make things difficult for you?. We were waiting for you to let us know if we could proceed"". He angrily responds ""your ID and passes"". We didn't want to take this any further. It seemed to be the normal at Mccarran."
31st May 2019,4,"""Come on Mccarran! You can do better than this""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at 8:20pm on 29 May 2019 from Zurich. Took 43 min to clear immigration. Total of 28 immigration channels, only 6 were staffed. 6 passport scanning machines (2 were out of order) but the airport staff said “they are not working right now” even though 4 showed green serviceable light. I asked another staff why we can’t use the passport scanners and got another answer “There aren’t enough immigration officers”. Well, isn’t that the point? Passengers using the passport scanning machines and having their fingerprints and photos taken, cuts down on the amount of time the immigration officer processes each passenger? Come on Mccarran! You can do better than this!"
7th April 2019,1,"""It’s awful""","Not Verified |  Filthy, smelly, it might be the worst, dirtiest cramped airport I’ve ever been in. Once you have been here all other airports will be a step up. It’s awful."
25th January 2019,3,"""was very disappointed""","Not Verified |  Had a long layover at this airport and was very disappointed. It is very poorly organized and has very few and poor food choices. The foods that it does have is grossly overpriced, even by airport standards."
22nd January 2019,5,"""Get rid of the blaring music""","Not Verified |  Pet relief area is a very welcome addition. Music playing in background is like being in a club. Way too loud and not necessary. Very upsetting to small children and support animals because of how loud it is. Why do we need all that background noise. If people want music they usually have it on their phones. It is nerve wracking and adds to anxiety. We have to be at the airport for so long, that doesn’t take in delays. Get rid of the blaring music."
16th January 2019,7,"""very disappointing for this level of airport""","✅ Trip Verified | The airport is a very clean and nice airport but what surprised me and my wife is that this airport does not have hotspot that you can order a Taxi or Uber taxi. Yes it does not have a WiFi connection but only in the main terminal. No phone to order taxi as well. So if you of a need to order a taxi at 3 am as we did, you have to drag your several suitcases with you to the outside parking over a small bridge back to the parking just to find out that there is no internet there so you will not be able to see if your taxi is coming. So the solution is to run between the main terminal to the parking and from the main terminal to the Uber parking, this is a very disappointing for this level of airport, what a shame. The shuttle to rent a car organizes was very rude and did not organize the lineup at all, he was just standing there beside the bus doing nothing and when I said to him that he should do his job he was rude."
9th December 2018,2,"""TSA staff were the rudest""","Not Verified |  The TSA staff were the rudest that I have ever seen. They were barking orders and telling you where to go but, then they were not ready. Then they were yelling again what to do or not do. It's sad, they must really hate their jobs. Maybe they need a change of leadership or morale team building."
26th November 2018,3,"""the worst I have ever experienced""","✅ Trip Verified |   I have to report that the TSA agents in Las Vegas Airport are the worst I have ever experienced. To say they are arrogant, angry, condescending, and very loud would be an understatement. I have never been treated with so little respect while going through security in my life. Commands were shouted and if not complied with immediately further abuse was received. I purposely wear a plastic belt to enable easy pass through security but an officer barked at me to remove it. I accidently left a dime in pocket and this gave me the pleasure of a full body pat down and hand swab. My carry on had to re x-rayed because I failed to separate all items as requested and I was suitably chastised for my inability to complete their orders. In addition they insist on shoe removal, even when there is no metal in them, but there are only a couple of metal seats to assist in re-shoeing. In conclusion I hope this situation with the TSA improves as this experience has left a bad taste in mouth after a fantastic few days in Las Vegas."
21st November 2018,1,"""do not fly into or from Las Vegas""","Not Verified |  If you are pregnant and wanting to do a pat down opt out going through security do not fly into or from Las Vegas Airport. You will be harassed. When I asked the first security officer if he could request an opt out he said it will be a long time and you need to ask the guy on the other side of security. Well that is awkward because you have to go through the line to talk to the guy on the other side of security, at every other airport that person is the one to request an opt out. I was finally able to ask him. Disgruntled he requested a female opt out. He told me to wait in a small crowded corner where the floor was covered in trash, as I was wearing no shoes. Later when asked if the opt out was female he said, ""um I think so"". I am currently looking very female and very pregnant. After a while an upset woman waved me over. She was rude in very thing she said. I travel a lot, I've had over 20 pat downs being pregnant and none of them were humiliating at all, let alone this humiliating. She directed me to stand between lines of people getting their stuff on a mat, as she barked what she was doing. As she started explaining the pat down she struggled through every part, rolling her eyes, and being sarcastic. She never told me I was good to get my stuff. She just walked away once the swab was tested. I will be using the Saint George airport from now on, when I need to come to this area. I recommend anyone that would prefer a pat down to do the same."
30th October 2018,4,"""poor customer experience""",✅ Trip Verified | Terrible idea to have old school carpet throughout your airport making it difficult to pull luggage bags. I thought it would be obvious not to have carpet in an airport where people have to pull their luggage and cause unnecessary effort and poor customer experience. I will avoid this airport when possible for that reason alone.
15th July 2018,1,"""Extremely rude TSA staff""
",Not Verified |  Extremely rude TSA staff. They don’t communicate and they expect people to be in two places at the same time. I appreciate the security but it is not necessary to yell at people for doing what the first TSA agent asked them to do.
30th June 2018,3,"""45 min or longer to get your luggage""","Not Verified |  I travel in and out of the Las Vegas airport several times a year and when arriving I always have to wait at least 45 min. before my luggage carousel even starts, it does not matter what airline it is or what time of the day or night you have to wait 45 min or longer to get your luggage."
10th May 2018,1,"""rude unprofessional and untrained""",❌ Not Verified |  Has to be one of the laziest staff I've encountered. From check in all the way up to a horrible 65 min TSA. TSA extremely rude unprofessional and untrained. They have no clue of how to properly get persons and items through in a timely manner. This is horrible and I recommend showing up 3 hours early to not miss your flight. This airport needs an adjustment I say restart your TSA they give people a horrible departure experience.
27th April 2018,1,"""Worst airport experience""","❎ Not Verified |  Worst airport experience I’ve ever had, and I’ve spent quite a bit of time in airports. From the obnoxiously rude woman at the Frontier counter to the unorganized, inefficient, demeaning, and harassing TSA agents I was completely shocked that Las Vegas Airport allows these people to represent a city who’s economy is based solely on Tourism. TSA can have a reputation, but the staff of LAS go far above and beyond to berate and belittle travelers, I was astounded by their treatment of a woman in a wheelchair and a man who’s luggage and person was being inspected. I'm embarrassed that these employees get their kicks out of feeling more powerful than airport patrons by being bullies. The airport is dirty and reeks of cigarettes and the design is unfortunate (the closest bathroom to my gate was a good 10 minute walk, only to find out it was closed for cleaning and I had to wander another long hall in the wrong direction while my flight was boarding). I know this is a bit scathing, I had a great time on my trip, but left with a terrible taste in my mouth."
18th April 2018,1,"""by far the worst experience""","❎ Not Verified |  This is by far the worst experience I’ve ever felt with in an airport! My friend and I are from Texas and we came to Vegas for her 30th birthday. In Texas when you renew your driver's licence they cut the top of it and issue a paper ID. This damn airport has put my friend through hell trying to get to our flight! They frisked her numerous times, searched her carry on luggage few times and all because she has a Texas renewed ID! This place is the worst!"
31st March 2018,1,"""loud, crowded and uncomfortable""
","✅ Trip Verified | McCarran International Airport (Las Vegas) is one of the worst airports I have ever had the displeasure of using. Where to begin? The only good thing about this airport is it is very close to the city center. Otherwise, it's loud, crowded and uncomfortable. No matter the hour, loud rock and country music is playing. No place to escape the assault on your senses. People are crowded into gate areas that are too small with inadequate and uncomfortable seating. People are sitting and laying all over like in some post-apocalyptic scene. The rental car shuttle consists of smelly, old diesel buses with rude personnelle that yell out instructions. The food choices consist of over-priced fast food. Once again, inadequate seating in the restaurant areas. Huge lines to everything with more rude people treating passengers like cattle."
18th October 2017,3,"""rude TSA agents""","❎ Unverified | Rude TSA agents! I couldn't believe how unfriendly they were, and not helpful. They make tedious situations worse. I understand people not liking a job, but at least fake your disdain in front of customers. I have flown countless times, but I refuse to fly into McCarran."
27th July 2017,5,"""at how bad the floors were""",✅ Verified Review |  Arrived on a Thursday about 12-1 pm and the airport was mobbed. Our luggage carousel had three flights of luggage on it from three different cities. On return trip the airport was deserted at 3 pm. My biggest complaint is the men's restrooms on Concourse D were filthy. Some urinals (perhaps 1/3) were out of service. There was an attendant floating around that did not appear to be doing much to improve the situation. I was appalled at how bad the floors were. Wi-Fi had advertising from a financial brokerage frim and I really did not trust it a lot.
3rd May 2017,1,"""absolutely unbearable""","✅ Verified Review | Las Vegas is one of the worst airports I've ever been to. The staff are rude, which makes the long lines, perpetual waiting times, trashed bathrooms, and wifi that kicks you off every few minutes absolutely unbearable. My experience was so miserable it makes me want to scream. And thanks a million to the staff member that threw out my lunch! I have been traveling with appropriately sized containers to make sure something like this didn't happen for years, yet now my less than 4 oz container is now more than 4 oz and you want to escort me an hour back in time to the back of the line to keep the container? At the very least the staff that couldn't figure out how to scan my boarding pass and told me I needed to go back across the airport to reprint it could have been more polite (and after protesting, another staff member at least tried the pass and got it to work). Las Vegas Airport, thanks for making me never want to come back to the state. Yes, it was that bad."
20th April 2017,10,"""great service in and out""","✅ Verified Review | Great service in and out at Las Vegas Airport. Great food, helpful staff (including AA, Spirit, TSA etc) all was very pleasant. Our flight out was cancelled but everyone we encountered did everything possible to make our stay in and out pleasant. They still have areas where we can smoke. We arrived with no drama. We were taken to the rental car terminal and back again was awesome - Viva Las Vegas."
8th April 2017,10,"""smoking areas past security""","The prices at Las Vegas Airport are prohibitive, but what else is new. It was dirty when we got there but it must have been at shift change because shortly after sitting down a crew of workers came through and cleaned the place up nicely. The absolute best part of this airport in the eyes of a smoker is there are smoking areas past security so you can smoke in a glass room with vents while waiting for your plane."
3rd April 2017,3,"""the staff (TSA) were rude""","Other than a very nice woman working in one of the essentials shops, the staff (TSA) were rude. The woman at the ticket counter asked me if I wanted to push the retractable handle down on my suitcase or just have them break it when loading. Then, there was the escalator ordeal, which involved a backup of travelers at the top, where TSA security screening is located. A female employee was positioned behind the ropes where people step off the escalator, apparently, to instruct people to move right upon exiting. However, her screaming, and I am not exaggerating for effect, was creating more confusion and hesitation, resulting in a moment of panic for those of us that were trapped in a momentary crush. Perhaps some signage at the bottom of escalator or recorded overhead audio instructions would help, especially for the elderly or physically disabled. TSA directions guy, same experience. Yelling and pointing, as if he were conducting traffic control at the scene of an accident. His accent, combined with volume and hand gestures, made it all the harder to understand. The lady behind me asked, ""what does party of 4 mean?"" He was actually yelling ""podium 4"". Lastly, if a customer inadvertently packs a banned item in carry-on bag, such as brand new bottle of hair product, there is no need for a lecture (yes, I got one). A simple ""sorry, but this is not allowed"", will suffice. And no, I don't feel the need to walk along to the garbage can to watch it being disposed of, just let me go on my way (possibly this is policy). On a positive note, cleanliness, amenities and seating comfort was excellent. The airport itself, is one of the nicest I've been to. Maybe the staff were just having a bad day."
8th March 2017,7,"""Seating was adequate and comfortable""","✅ Verified Review |  We arrived at about 10 in the morning, the staff were tired and everybody was glued to the slot machines in the centre of the terminal. The huge arrivals sign was convenient to show where Arrivals should go, after a 2 storey escalator and one small baggage claim later, we were out of there. When we returned to depart later that week, we turned up one hour early so we had to wait an hour before check-in. Seating was adequate and comfortable. Check-in process was fast and effective. One confusing thing is that I was travelling with a friend and I got exempted for TSA Pre Check. So we had to split lines and Wait for him after security. Overall smooth and efficient. After that we went to a small restaurant the east end of the terminal. Quick bite to eat and was delicious. Gate boarded efficiently and on time. Adequate seating while waiting for boarding call. Overall a clean, fast, and efficient airport."
23rd November 2016,8,"""the international terminal impressed""","My first use of this airport and the international terminal impressed. Coming in, a short walk and I cleared immigration and collected baggage in about 20 minutes. Going out, check in and security took little more than 5 minutes and it was quiet mid evening. It is a long thin terminal so some walking may be required."
25th May 2016,2,"""terminal also lacks the facilities""","Departure from Las Vegas Terminal 3 was a nightmare. It took a half hour queing to reach the security desk. When I was through security, an officer in the hall randomly asked to rescan my bag, while the security scanning was lax. This terminal also lacks the facilities of the better Domestic terminal. Immigration signage is not clear."
28th March 2016,9,"""staff friendly and helpful""",Always dread arriving in USA on holiday after past experiences of lengthy delays at Boston however Las Vegas Airport was a pleasant surprise. Friendly TSA staff (never thought I'd say that) and was through immigration in about 10-mins. Again on return trip out of LasV the security queues were not too bad and the TSA staff friendly and helpful - Boston should take note. Quite a few charging stations once you are through security along with a mixture of various shops/cafes and other eating outlets. Would have no hesitation flying into/out of this airport.
27th March 2016,2,"""a bit disappointing""","Immigration personnel are terribly slow and not very welcoming. Shopping facilities are non-existent compared to other same-size airports - 4 of the same shops with magazines and newspapers. 2 identical sport shops. Dining facilities are ok with Burger King, Carls Junior and 2 cafe's. Spacious and clean. A bit disappointing."
20th March 2016,1,"""incredibly unhelpful""",Just went through security at McCarran airport. The TSA members there were very rude and incredibly unhelpful. They even treated the elderly passengers very inconsiderately. Loved Las Vegas but the service in the airport will definitely have us thinking twice before returning. Customer service must not be a job requirement as there was absolutely none shown. Having traveled to various locations I can honestly say that this was one of the worst experiences that my family and I have ever experienced.
10th January 2016,9,"""a truly unique experience""","Waking up at 4 in the morning isn't something most of us would enjoy, waking up in at 4 in the morning to catch a flight probably seems even more dreadful to some. I don't expect much from airports when traveling based on the fact they are designed to harbor the vehicles taking us from point A to B, but Terminal 3 at McCarran International is just amazing. By far one of my favorite airports, free wifi and slot machines to entertain you, a truly unique experience. Plenty of shops and restaurant options, whether you want fast food or gourmet they got it, want to shop for quality perfume or maybe a magazine for the flight, it's all available here. If you have the option, ensure you depart/arrive at Terminal 3, lack of foot traffic(It was recently constructed) makes it clean and gives it a new, ""modern"" feel."
30th November 2015,10,"""very comfortable seating""","Flew JetBlue Airways between LGB and LAS. Terminal 3 at Las Vegas is one of my favorites. It has an airy feel with very comfortable seating. Terminal has a variety of dining options to choose from. Free wifi works very well. Security during afternoon takes a little longer because of the international flights departing from T3 (British Airways, Virgin Atlantic etc.) Baggage claim area is enormous. If you are used to the chaos of Southwest Airlines Terminal 1 at Las Vegas, then flying JetBlue Airways from Terminal 3 will feel like heaven."
28th November 2015,10,"""had a small-town feel""","Flew out of McCarran on a Saturday night with my fiancee. As my only experiences prior to this for departing flights were at Phoenix Sky Harbor and at LAX, I was expecting a bustling, intense, borderline-impossible check-in and security screening process. We got dropped off at the Terminal 3 entrance (we flew Frontier) and I kid you not, within 30 minutes, we were checked in, screened through TSA (their agents were incredibly friendly and humorous) and shuttled to our gate through the people-mover system they had. I was most definitely blown away by the efficiency and level of service that McCarran had to offer. For a big-city airport, it certainly had a small-town feel with the high speed of check-in and high quality of service. It was worth driving 200 miles one-way from Southern California, as opposed to driving 80 miles to LAX. Would fly from here again in a heartbeat."
28th November 2015,5,"""clean and aesthetically pleasing""",Las Vegas airport was clean and aesthetically pleasing with a simple transfer yet the staff well the majority are. Grumpy and rude with few manners and are not good at their job. The restaurants are few and of low quality with little to offer the only positive is that. The gates are huge with plenty of seating and the scenery is spectacular.
31st October 2015,7,"""most unique airport in the world""","I transited through Las Vegas while traveling on Southwest Airlines from John Wayne Airport to Houston Lobby. What makes Las Vegas the most unique airport in the world are the slot machines inside the Terminal. Passengers are welcome to try their luck at the slot machines while waiting for their flight. Since Vegas is a hub for Southwest Airlines, their terminal is very busy. As a result, the seating areas and restrooms tend to be crowded. McCarran Airport does offer free wifi. The airport also boasts views of surrounding mountains, and the world-famous Las Vegas Casinos."
17th March 2015,7,Las Vegas Airport customer review,The airport upon our visit in September 2014 was clean efficient and spacious in the new terminal. The security process which does take too long in most US cities was up to the excessive time scale I have become accustomed to. However luggage handling collection was much improved. My negative experiences on my last two trips has been the very low standard of the counter staff at the airlines check in desk. On this occasion she insisted on me having a China visa in my passport to visit Hong Kong which is not required. I showed her my HK resident card but she insisted on a visa was dismissive and ignorant of the visa requirements for entry and refused to check them. Eventually she checked myself and my partner - but at other ends of the plane even though we checked in very early. This was corrected elsewhere. American and United airlines seem to have the most rude check in staff. Happy with the others.
14th January 2015,5,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I have used this airport many times mainly terminal 1 D gates and the terminal 2 and 3. However I used the B gates a few days ago. It is definitely dated compared to the D gates and terminal 3. However the place was a dump with rubbish strewn all over the seating area this is really is inexcusable.
1st September 2014,n/a,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Had a run in with the worst 2 ignorant people at security at this airport and I've been to about 10 airport's in my time and they took the cake its bad when the guy behind you even notices and says they love their job don't they as I shake my head in disbelief. Maybe this is typical behavior of airport security but this experience at McCarren airport was horrible. Oh and this great new D and E gate terminal is so great with its horribly small seating area but wait! There's a whole bunch of slot machines where the seating should extend so passengers don't have to stand for hours. What a joke.
3rd May 2014,10,Las Vegas Airport customer review,A great airport! Slot machines everywhere smoking lounges just the vibe of Vegas everywhere! The baggage area is easy to find lots of signage for which belt your bags will be on and a boatload of ads for shows and such.
17th February 2014,n/a,Las Vegas Airport customer review,What a difference! The new terminal 3 is so much better than the old terminal 2. The building is spacious bright I've been to Las Vegas many times since the 1980's and this last pass through on a plane change I saw a once beautiful airport reduced to a trash heap. Garbage everywhere restrooms filthy. Slot machines have been added everywhere crowding out passenger seating in the terminals. One would think with all that slot money they could afford additional cleaning staff. Avoid this airport if possible.
9th December 2013,8,Las Vegas Airport customer review,What a difference! The new terminal 3 is so much better than the old terminal 2. The building is spacious bright and clean. Arriving from the UK was pretty smooth and efficient. It probably took about 45 mins to go through US Customs collect my bags and exit. Staff including immigration are friendly. On the way back I used the airport lounge which is a bit small compared to other lounges but had a nice choice of food and snacks and the bar staff were very nice. There isn't a lot of choice when it comes to duty free shops and the whole airport feels empty as there are a lot of departure gates but not enough international fights utilising them. Overall a nice airport to fly into.
12th August 2013,8,Las Vegas Airport customer review,The D and E gates at LAS are very nice. The terminal is bright clean and offers good views of the runways and apron operations if you are in the D gates. The security line for the C and D gate was very long so be prepared for a 20 minute wait. My only complaint was the lack of choice when it came to finding something to eat. There were plenty of Starbucks but not a whole lot of other place.
28th April 2013,6,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Not overly impressed with this airport. We checked which took a while (Thomas Cook) to find that when we attempted to pas through security we were turned away because TC had not printed the boarding passes correctly this caused stress to quite a few passengers. Once through security we found terminal 3 lacking in eateries and shops (been in better local airports). You can smoke through security in the casino areas.
22nd December 2012,7,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I went to this airport last year in Vegas and it was quite crowded but I guess it was being renovated. The security people were nice and this year I went back for my Vegas vacation and the airport looked impressive spacious and all the amenities were accessible to passengers. There are good restaurants and stores with reasonable prices and the security people I met were respectful and helpful. I was so impressed with the wheelchair person provided to me at the airport as I needed a wheelchair. He was great helped me in security put all my stuff in trays and helped me get them back including my shoes. This is my second time to go to Vegas and I can only say I wouldn't hesitate to go back again via this great airport.
22nd November 2012,7,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Flew in from LGW on Virgin. Couldn't believe how straightforward exiting the airport was. Staff including immigration helpful and friendly. Flew out a week later internal to Miami. No problems apart from long hike to D gate and way overpriced bottled water. To reviewers rating this as worst airport in the US I'd suggest avoiding Miami - truly the worst airport in the US and probably the world.
7th November 2012,9,Las Vegas Airport customer review,We travelled from NY to LAS and the arrival was smooth. It should be noted that we arrived at midnight and there were not many flights arriving at the same time so we got our luggage quickly. I liked the train connecting Terminal D and Baggage Claim. The atmosphere at the airport deserves special attention - spacious halls high ceilings bright neon lights and slot machines. The airports is so close to the city that you can walk there on foot but the shuttle service and buses are also available.
1st October 2012,1,Las Vegas Airport customer review,"Not recommended for a plane change. In July I had to change planes on Southwest and it took me 15 minutes to walk to the next gate! That wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't for the lack of air conditioning. Most of the walk was extremely hot stuffy and smelly. There were small little areas where the air actually worked but not many. When I reached my gate it too was overcrowded warm and smelled. The attendants at the gate were aware of the issues and implied that no solution would be forthcoming in the future because the area was so narrow and was mostly bordered by windows on one side. I became so uncomfortable that I took a 4 minute walk to the nearest ""air conditioned"" sections and I sat on the floor waiting for the next flight to board. I don't know about the other areas of this airport since this I was only there due to a plane change on Southwest but I will do my best to avoid this airport for any future connecting flights."
13th September 2012,3,Las Vegas Airport customer review,New Terminal 3 - looks good but is sorely lacking in facilities decent food charging stations etc. Only poor restaurants (i.e. fast food).
24th April 2012,2,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I was truly shocked at how run down Las Vegas airport was. Bathroom doors don't close properly forcing patrons to use the facilities with the door ajar. The soap dispensers were out of soap too. The shops and amenities were sparse at best. In general it is the most run down unkempt airport we've had the pleasure to leave.
14th April 2012,2,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Had to connect between concourse A and B and it was a travesty. Signage is horrible 1 moving walkway in what seems like a half mile walk. Up and down back and forth. One of the worst airports in the world.
5th April 2012,1,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Travelled to and from Las Vegas from the UK. Arrivals relatively pain free - good taxi queue well organised according to how much baggage etc. International Departures (Terminal 2) was the worst ever. Queued to drop bags so much for checking in online 24 hours ahead. The queuing started - first to get on the escalator second to go through security and then through a manual passport control. Finally into departure hall. 4 flights departing within a short space of time meant that the place was absolutely heaving with this relatively small amount of passengers. Duty free was pitiful other shopping outlets grim and don't even get me started on the 'fast' food outlets.
20th March 2012,2,Las Vegas Airport customer review,McCarran airport has to be the worst US airport I have used! I flew domestically from San Francisco it was relatively easy to get from gate (B17) to the luggage carousel. Luggage took an age to arrive. No obvious signs on how to get to the international terminal. International terminal arrivals area is one big joke! The waiting area had no toilets nowhere to buy any food/drink just a few rows of seats and a monitor. Departing wasn't much better we'd arrived early so there was virtually no queuing to check-in. Getting through American security was its usual painful process – longish waits. There is virtually nothing post-security. Thankfully wifi worked. Not many toilets and they were dark and dingy. I see that there is a new international terminal opening up in a few months – it is sorely needed!
13th February 2012,6,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I flew to Las Vegas from London Gatwick and to San Francisco and back for a day trip. The domestic terminal is excellent. It is very clean has several shops and cafes and plenty of seats at the gates. The TSA officers are also very friendly at that terminal. However the international terminal is very small not as clean as the domestic one and there is not many places to eat at. There was no empty seats at my gate so I sat at another gate among passengers flying to Mexico. The TSA officers at the International terminal are also not as friendly as they are at the domestic one. I also noticed that when a flight to Mexico was boarding the announcements were only made in Spanish not English. If I fly to Las Vegas again I will fly into the domestic terminal.
1st November 2011,3,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Terminal 1 (divided into 3 concourses A B and C) and used by Southwest US Airways and Spirit among others is dark dirty and difficult to navigate through. Carpets are dirty slot machines take up valuable floor space causing overcrowding garbage isn't picked up as often as it should be bathrooms are dirty and parts of the airport near the restaurants/snackbars and bathrooms smell funky. The taxi ranks and rental car shuttles are poorly managed and chaotic - at peak times it can take up to 30 minutes to get a taxi. The one positive about McCarran is that the TSA checkpoints are the best of any major airport in America - lines move quickly agents are courteous and seem better trained than their counterparts at other US airports.
4th September 2011,1,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I had a 1st Class ticket with Virgin and the facilities are awful. Dull lounge with unhelpful staff. I ordered a Ham and Cheese sandwich which was stale and the wine wasn't much better. Hopefully when they open the new terminal in 2013 it should get better. Unfortunately they can't change the staff.
19th June 2011,3,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Terminal 2 has very few shops or food outlets if two Virgin flights are scheduled tO depart at a similar time there is insufficient seating and the air conditioning struggles to cope. Free WIFI which is a bonus.
24th July 2010,4,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I've arrived and departed from this airport several times each time from the D gates. It's a pretty long walk from check-in to the D gates and from the D gates to baggage claim. There is a tram to take for part of it but it's still a pretty long walk. The D gates have a pretty good variety of dining and shopping options along with the obligatory slot machines with it being Vegas. On my last trip July 1st-July 12th I got a big surprise. Baggage claim has always been notoriously slow in Vegas but on this particular trip I waited less than 5 minutes for my baggage. That means from gate to taxi took just about 15 minutes which I'm sure must be record time in Vegas for somebody that's checked a bag.
14th July 2010,5,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I departed for Minneapolis in the afternoon of July 5. The queues were reasonable staff polite air conditioning in the terminal was very welcome after the heat outside and the free wi-fi is a bonus. No complaints whatsoever.
23rd November 2009,3,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Terminal 2 (international flights not including Canada) is a totally different experience to the main terminal. While check-in and the security check were easy once gate-side there is virtually nothing to do. There are a few tiny shops the usual fast food chains and a small bar. What a contrast to the razzle dazzle of the city itself! I suggest that if you check in with plenty of time to spare take the 5 minute walk over to Terminal 1 for any last minute shopping food or drink.
8th September 2009,4,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Arrived and departed from Terminal D. It was pleasant to walk through and had plenty of services and restaurants. The slot machines are great but they need the payment machines like every other casino in town. The connecting train was pleasant and efficient as well. No issues with luggage. On departure the TSA screener seemed to be obsessed with my Canadian Passport.
2nd July 2009,4,Las Vegas Airport customer review,True enough about the long run from the car-rental garage but the airport itself ran smoothly on a departure to Vancouver. Can't do kerbside check in to Canada but I guess that's Homeland Protection or TSA or somebody. No money exchange until 8.00 which caused a rush. Lounge should be after security.
13th January 2009,3,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I have transited this airport and departed once. One thing for visitors to consider is that the consolidated rental car facility is very far from the airport terminals. While it is convenient in that you go to just one place regardless of which company you use and there are then just two busses to choose from (depending on which terminal you are departing from) you have a long trip on the bus and need to allow for the extra time (and getting to the rental car facility by vehicle can be confusing since you do not take the same main road as to get to the airport terminal). Once in the airport processing was relatively fast; about par for most airport these days. Nothing to rave about but also no big complaints. You do have a chance for some last-minute gambling before you get on your plane.
28th October 2008,3,Las Vegas Airport customer review,We arrived with Delta from JFK. Baggage handling was excruciatingly slow and the claim are crowded. It would be less crowded if it not double as a casino.
2nd October 2008,5,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I found the airport to be busy but efficient We flew Southwest and by the time we walked to the baggage claim our luggage was already there so no waiting. There were plenty of limousines and shuttles outside so it was not difficult to get a ride to the hotel. The airport seemed very clean and had a sufficient amount of stores and restaurants. Coming back the check in line was long but went very quickly. No problems at all with this airport.
30th September 2008,3,Las Vegas Airport customer review,An insanely busy airport (at least it was when I went through it) but I found that it mostly functioned reasonably well. I arrived at Terminal 1 on US Airways and had no issues with signage although it was a long walk from the gate to baggage claim. My only issue was the delay in recovering my baggage due to confusion about which carousel it was on and even this was cleared up after a few minutes. The ground transportation area was very busy but problem-free. For the flight back the biggest obstacle was getting to the terminal through the extremely crowded lane for shuttle buses taxis etc on the Terminal 1 departures area. The driver eventually had to let us off some distance from where we needed to be but everything went okay. The lineups for check-in looked extremely long but there were lots of terminals for electronic check-in which kept things moving and after this the wait to check baggage was pretty short. The TSA security lineups were also pretty fast. There were lots of shopping opportunities before going through security and still some decent shopping and eating after going through security. The waiting areas were quite pleasant and offered a good view of the airport ramps for an airplane nut. Overall Vegas loses marks for the baggage handling hiccup and the congested taxi lanes at departures but otherwise it functions pretty well at moving a lot of people through with minimal hassle.
15th September 2008,1,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I have had the misfortune to travel to LAS. I arrived on a domestic flight and have waited for my luggage for over an hour. Then when I finally exited to airport I waited for the car rental facility bus for over half an hour and it was midnight. After finally getting to car rental agency getting the car and getting to MGM Grand (which is about 10 minutes from the airport) I was in my room at 2.00 am. From landing to the hotel it took me 4.5 hours (the drive to the hotel was 10 minutes) in the middle of the night! This is the worst airport I have ever been to. OK Paris Charles de Gaulle/Roissy is just as bad but that's it. LAS is a disaster of an airport! If you can avoid it!
19th November 2007,3,Las Vegas Airport customer review,I go to Las Vegas airport about 3 times a year and have experienced using both the domestic and international terminals both have good and bad points. The international terminal is much quicker to use on arrival even if you have to go through immigration the domestic terminals baggage reclaim is one of the worst in the world I've spent many times waiting over an hour for my luggage. The international terminal however has very limited facilities with nothing worth eating unless you like BK. The domestic terminal D gates are by far the best although limited eating facilities at least its clean and spacious.
25th October 2007,2,Las Vegas Airport customer review,The positives - close to the strip and easy to get to and free WIFI (the only thing that you will get for free in Vegas). Negatives are many - passenger dropoff area has ony 2 lanes for cars and is extremely crowded; only 1 dropoff area for every airline; limited and bad food. No real restaurants. Very crowded baggage pickup security lines can be very long limited covered parking. Need to park in the outside overflow lot and walk to/from airline gates can be long. Besides the many casino based shops there is limited interesting shopping
8th October 2007,1,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Terminal 1 is extremely busy with the volume of domestic flights but plenty of outlets and places to sit. Terminal 2 - of all the US airports Vegas was the friendliest in terms of staff and immigration was pretty quick too. It made a pleasant change to be greeted with a smile and for the immigration process to be completed quickly. Departing from Terminal 2 however is a totally different story. The terminal is to put it frankly more like a bus terminal waiting room. There is just one duty free shop - this must be the smallest in the world! and 3 eating options we had a connecting domestic flight before our international flight back home and therefore had a wait of around 4 hours - it felt more like 40 hours. Worst airport terminal I have ever had the privilege of waiting in!
26th September 2007,4,Las Vegas Airport customer review,As a frequent visitor to the States I have found Vegas airport to be the most pleasant to pass through. I generally arrive and depart through the D gates and this terminal is one of the cleanest I have been in. The choice of food outlets and shopping is plentiful and many of the gates have views of the strip! The only drawback seems to be baggage reclaim which is painfully slow especially when you just want to get to the casino!
21st June 2007,1,Las Vegas Airport customer review,We flew into Las Vegas for a 4 day trip from Toronto and where our arrival went smoothly our departure was a different story. Our check in at Westjet was fine but there were serious problems with airport security. Out of at least a half dozen stations  they only had one station open although there were at least 4 different flights leaving at the time so there was a very long lineup. There were numerous security personnel standing around doing nothing at all so the problem wasn't staffing. They were without exception extremely rude to everyone coming through they seemed to be working deliberately slowly - perhaps a work to rule situation? There was a a large group of Japanese travelers with many seniors and they were treated terribly. Despite the fact that they all seemed to have their things in order the personnel were extremely rude to them barking out orders and behaving in a very boorish manner. When it got to be our turn we were treated in a similar manner. I have no problem accepting that there is a need for good airport security and am happy to cooperate. Rudeness is bad enough but the incompetence displayed made me realize that passengers are not being protected properly. This whole ordeal certainly left a bad taste in our mouths and undoubtedly did the same for the others who were unfortunate enough to be there that evening. We pay money in airport taxes to at least in part be protected from whatever threats may be there and certainly deserve much better than this.
5th February 2022,2,"""the dirtiest airport I have visited in the US""",Not Verified |  This is the dirtiest airport I have visited in the US. Carpeting in gate areas are filthy. The bathrooms stunk and were dirty. No good water bottle refill stations and the one I found had backed up sitting water in it that stunk and was filthy. Need to sanitize when I get home. Maybe I am just used to the cleanliness of MSP and ATL but this was so gross.
1st January 2022,1,"""isn't worth the hassle""","Not Verified | Seatac has been sliding in a downward spiral for the last few years. First with their incompetent handling and management of construction/expansion that caused delays, missed flights and other problems affecting passengers from all airlines operating out of there. There has been no improvement and the construction is just dragging on now for years with little benefit seen from it. Now, the airport received a light dusting of snow that closed it down numerous times over the Christmas holidays. Canceled flights, delays compounding an already busy system, stranded passengers were the norm and it affected flights from all across the nation. But Seatac has it's cute little food delivery robots getting in passengers ways. How much did that total waste cost? Maybe if that money had been spent on a few more pieces of snow removal equipment the airport could have remained functioning. While it is not often that Seattle gets snow, it does happen regularly, even with global warming. Who ever is in charge of the airport is a total buffoon and incompetent and must be a pay back room appointee. Get someone that knows how to run a large, complicated airport system and not just some lackey looking for the splash of doing the current ""cool"" thing. I am seriously considering moving my allegiance to a different Airport, like Spokane, and if need be will be changing airlines as well. Seatac is not convenient for me at all and with all of these constant problems, it just isn't worth the hassle. I'll take my dollars elsewhere."
7th November 2021,2,"""Seattle you can do better""",✅ Trip Verified | Seattle is such an inefficient airport. The security lines are always long and slow. There has to be a better way. Then the airport gates are confusing. There are gates that are stacked (N gates) but there is no indication that there are more than one gate in that area. Seattle you can do better.
19th September 2021,4,"""Seattle seems to be a little improved""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle seems to be a little improved from three years ago, but still not great. Their N concourse has been beautifully redone, and is very modern, though the restroom wasn't very clean. Their B and C concourses, though, are still relics of the 1980s, old, cramped, vastly outdated, and with disgusting restrooms. The dining and bar options were/are plentiful, although overcrowded and overpriced even by standards of major hubs. The inter-concourse tram is nice and efficient. Customer service is about like I remember it, whether while dining in or at the boarding gate: courteous and polite, but kind of detached and aloof. I've never met any personnel in this airport who were either outright rude or outright bubbly, I guess that's just the Seattle way. Alaska and Delta have nice lounges there, and, again, the N concourse is nicely redone, so there is some incentive to transit through there more often in the future, but the airport still has a lot to be desired yet in terms of overall customer experience. If you're vacationing in the Pacific NW, I still recommend flying into Portland, Bellingham, or Vancouver, BC if you can help it."
12th July 2021,1,"""This airport is filthy""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is filthy. I am sitting at C3. Trash in the main walkway and the carpets have trash, smashed, chunks and clubs of food all over the carpet everywhere I look. The bathrooms smelt, dirty and were out of soap. The taxes they charge to go through here are high, so one would expect cleanliness. I haven't seen one cleaner around either. Sad and embarrassing."
11th July 2021,1,"""Such a disappointment""","✅ Trip Verified | Such a disappointment for the hub of my favorite airline: C concourse is filthy: Numerous travelers scheduled to department on flights later than 9pm, yet every business except the Hudson shops close at 9pm. Venture to the rotunda and same, the airport is shutting down while 100s of travelers are awaiting flights. Availability was already limited due to the port awarding contracts to new ventures and booting about long term airport tenants. I am sure COVID is the excuse for no new construction, but the huge amount of boarded up restaurant fronts has been around long before COVID."
27th June 2021,1,"""What a dump of an airport""","✅ Trip Verified | What a dump of an airport. The C terminal is filthy. Very obvious that bathrooms are not regularly cleaned. Halls narrow. Poor signage. Arrived international. Jet bridge didn’t work. Pulled aircraft to another jet bridge, 30 min delay. Staff at bag transit were aloof looking at cell phones and chatting. I placed my two bags on the transit belt. Avoid Seattle. Long lines at restaurants that are open. Many are still closed."
26th June 2021,1,"""ladies in security were so incredibly rude""","Not Verified |  The ladies in security were so incredibly rude. I accidentally left my pepper spray on my keychain (I’m a 24-year-old woman who takes self defense seriously) and she picked it up out of my bin and aggressively said, “what is this? You can’t take this. What were you thinking?” In front of everyone in the security area. I couldn’t believe the condescending tone she had. She talked to me like I was a child slapping another on the playground. It was uncalled for. I can’t believe she gets away with this behavior."
16th June 2021,1,"""One of the worst customer service experiences""",Not Verified |  One of the worst customer service experiences at an airport. How did the people that work for the gates at Alaska get these jobs? They should definitely not be working in front of customers. They are the opposite of what you would want as customer service representatives. The service was fine until they (out of the blue) were rude.
3rd May 2021,1,"""Very crowded, fairly dirty and seems about 50 years out of date""","✅ Trip Verified | I used to fly thru SEA 2 x month on business. I just came thru this week on round trip from BIL to DCA and back. Airport is same as I remember. Very crowded, fairly dirty and seems about 50 years out of date. Some of the terminals are so crowded that the air exchange cannot be close to good. Compared to Vancouver, Canada, DEN, Hong Kong, ABQ, etc it is pretty sad. I shows a very poor city and airport planning. I need to plan future travel thru DEN I am bringing a puppy home. The availability of dog area is poor. I walked to a boundary fence, went up a hill and had a small grassy area."
13th April 2021,1,"""Horrible experience!""","✅ Trip Verified | We had a flight at 9.25 am on a Sunday. We arrived at the airport shortly after 7.30 am and checked a bag. Then we had to walk the length of the terminal to get in line for security, which began out in the parking lot and wound around (for at least a half hour) and up some stairs into the building. We didn't get through security until 9.10. Our boarding pass (which we received that morning) listed the wrong gate, but since we were in a rush, we didn't stop to check it. By the time we reached the correct gate, at 9.20, we were told the doors had been closed and we missed the flight. Then we had to wait another half hour in line to get the next available flight, which was an unwelcome red-eye leaving at 9.45 pm, and our checked bag is at the wrong airport. Horrible experience!"
14th December 2020,1,"""30 min trek to the check in counter""","✅ Trip Verified |  Not surprised to see that there are only bad reviews of this airport...worst set up and flow of any airport I have ever been to. Seattle being such a “tech” city with so much money, one would think they could figure out how to plan a better airport. Recent multi-million dollar remodels didn’t help ...in fact I think they made it worse. Who came up with the idea to have to public transport’s last stop still be a 30 min trek to the check in counter? Is that the same person who decided to put the rental car return 2 elevators, a bus ride, and 3 escalators from the checkin desks? (Around 20 mins)  No alcohol during Covid? How is that supposed to help ... we are in the middle of pandemic, a beer takes the edge off and numbs my aggressive hatred towards a stupid airport!!!"
3rd October 2020,2,"""the worst flying experience""","Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst flying experience. Had a 7.20 am flight back to the Bay Area and was running slightly behind. Was forced to navigate across the airport (3 gates) to check by bag, and then was informed when I arrived at the gate (5 minutes before departure) that they had preemptively closed the gates 15 minutes. Didn't receive the memo. Make sure you show up at least 15 minutes prior to your scheduled departure or you may not be allowed on the plane. To top it all off, had to pay a $50 fee to change my flight. Couldn't even spare me that hassle."
15th July 2020,1,"""disgusted with how filthy the airport is""","Not Verified |  We are in the middle of a pandemic where masks are enforced at airports etc. Everywhere I look there are people not wearing masks. I even asked an employee of the airport to enforce the rules and ask a man close to me to put on a mask and she told me it wasn’t her job and walked away. I am disgusted with how filthy the airport is. People leave their trash all over and have no respect for others around them. Even the pilots and staff aren’t wearing masks, really setting a great example for the rest of people. To say I’m angry is an understatement."
19th May 2020,1,"""Lots of people not wearing masks there""","Not Verified |  Please enforce the mask requirement! Today, May 18, was supposed to be the first day SEATAC required masks. Lots of people not wearing masks there - even a TSA agent. I will not go through SEATAC until I hear they are enforcing mask requirement. If SEATAC does not require masks, it will hurt Alaska Airlines."
14th May 2020,1,"""no safety requirements""","✅ Trip Verified |  There are no safety requirements in place during this coronavirus pandemic. At least half the people were not  wearing masks - including airport personnel. There was no social distancing, and, the airport was crowded. I thought that flying in mid-May would be safer than waiting till more people flew, especially since I heard that airports and most airlines were requiring masks (if not social distancing). Only in the USA would there be no real safety regulations in place. For shame airport. Alaska Airlines was worse/as bad. They 'boasted' about their safety policy in place but it was a farce. They said masks were required but there was absolutely no enforcement, even when I complained. I hope to never fly through this airport or with this airline again. It would have been a relief if they had followed their words with real actions, but obviously they are afraid of passengers (who I agree must be not quite right to not fly with a mask), and obviously the company policy does not back them up."
13th February 2020,4,"""Not kid friendly""",Not Verified |  Not kid friendly. We went to three different restaurants (for breakfast) and all of them turned us away because I had an 8 year old who was not old enough to drink. I’m guessing that’s a law but perhaps there could be more options. Also struggled to find family bathrooms.
13th February 2020,2,"""closure of all services at this terminal by 10pm is unreal""","Not Verified |  A ton of money was used to 'remodel' the N gates. I’m so annoyed and wish my airline didn’t constantly use this terminal. It’s cleaner than most, but the lack of amenities and closure of all services at this terminal by 10pm is unreal. We arrived after a 6 hour flight to find all kitchens and quick food in this terminal closed. Even the newsstand, closes at 10. There isn’t a single thing open and after 6 hours, one might like to grab a quick bite or drink or heck, even buy a new magazine. Zero options tonight. Super unfortunate and super frustrating. Sorry Seattle, I’m unsure why you can’t seem to make this place inviting and functional. Lastly, for being brand new, it’s already becoming filthy, please allocate more cleaning crews."
6th February 2020,2,"""Friends don't let friends use Sea-Tac""","✅ Trip Verified | Friends don't let friends use Sea-Tac. After multiple arrivals into and departures from Seattle, all I have to say is, ""What a joke!"" How, oh how, does the metropolis which gave the world Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks, and served as the setting for the classy '90s sitcom ""Frasier,"" manage to have an airport that would shame Satan himself? It's almost as bad as LAX. Staff aren't so much rude, as they are ""aggressively passive-aggressive"" - pushy and aloof, but polite the whole time they're doing it. The passengers indeed can actually seem rather hostile, perhaps because they're crammed like sardines in an old, outdated, small, dingy, filthy airport that always seems to be under construction without any tangible progress in modernization. There is no logical connectivity between the terminals, whether you're relying on signage or the inter-terminal tram. I mean, isn't the purpose of a tram to logically piece the airport together? The floors don't look like they've been cleaned since 1987. The restrooms, unkempt sometimes. Delays in arriving to, and departing from, the gate are common, because this airport has had a dramatic spike in flights without any accompanying increase in people-handling and gate capacities. If you have to visit the Pacific Northwest, fly into Portland, OR or Bellingham, WA in the US, or Victoria, BC or Vancouver, BC in Canada (though Canadian immigration and customs aren't exactly any more pleasant than their American counterparts)."
26th January 2020,2,"""one of my least favorite airports""","✅ Trip Verified | Has become one of my least favorite airports. Overcrowded, never can arrive or depart on time due to gate shortages, most restaurants are closed for remodeling, bathrooms are dingy and gross. Seattle is dying."
12th January 2020,1,"""an assault to all your senses""","Not Verified |  What a depressing place. There is no doubt I am at Tacoma airport. I don't know what hits you first. The grime or the smell. It is like an assault to all your senses. There is trash visable everywhere. I can count 8 coffee cups at gate B6 rigjt now. This airport always seems to be under construction, yet nothing ever seems to appear better. Added to this is the fact that all the store employees seem to be bothered when you have to interupt their conversations. If you have a connecting flight I recommend you avoid Tacoma Airport."
3rd January 2020,1,"""a poor experience every time""","✅ Trip Verified | The slowest and most inefficient airport I've ever had to arrive at. If you are not a US citizen, do not, I repeat, do not make a transit at this airport, you will not make it in time. Of the 6 times, I've arrived here internationally, it took an average of 1.5 hours just to clear the immigration checkpoint each time, with a maximum of 3 hours from personal experience. After clearing customs, all other airports that I've been to have your checked luggage up and out on the carousel in 20 minutes max. Here, it's at least an hour's wait so it doesn't even matter if you've cleared the immigration checkpoint quickly. Finally when you exit to ground transport, do not use the bag conveyor belt to deliver your luggage separately before taking the transit train to Seattle exit and ground transportation else you'll have to wait another 10 minutes for your bags to arrive by the conveyor belt after you've arrived by the transit train. This airport is not just understaffed, it suffers from very visible underemployment and operation inefficiencies. For example, the airport management has in their infinite wisdom decided to station not one but two workers at each luggage carousel to arrange bags neatly on the carousel as they arrive by the conveyor belt so that they don't tip over. This task is absolutely pointless - I've still seen bags tip over and being rearranged by other passengers standing beside it. So now you have two persons being paid to just stand by the carousel chit-chatting and occasionally moving a bag or two when they could be doing something more useful like delivering the bags quickly. All in all, too much waiting and a poor experience every single time. Is it too much to ask for an airport to do its job quickly so I don't have to stand for another 3 hours after a 12-hour transpacific flight? I've arrived in the US from LA and San Fran and both are much, much faster."
12th December 2019,8,"""increase duty-free shops""","✅ Trip Verified |  My departure and arrival are here at Seattle-Tacoma airport were good. Starbucks was crowded by people but it is ok. In addition, the airport needs to increase duty-free shops."
10th December 2019,8,"""very pleased with customer service""","Not Verified |  Although it seems that every time we fly into SeaTac, it is under construction, we were very pleased with customer service at check in, and gates. And TSA line very short. 4 days after Thanksgiving, it took 20 min to get from check-in to gate, which is unheard of. Good experience, except construction caused the terminal to be very cold."
4th December 2019,9,"""cheerful, humorous, kind""","Not Verified |  There was a security officer named Williston who was cheerful, humorous, kind and absolutely over the top with positive energy who made our trip to the airport at 7 am, memorable and delightful. If more employees enjoyed their jobs and made it a point to enrich passengers' lives as he did, the world would be a better place."
22nd November 2019,3,"""shocked at the dirty carpets""","Not Verified | Curbside check-in was a snap. The security line was almost empty. My wife has PreCheck and has to walkway down from the rest of the security and it took her three times as long to clear bag check/body scan as I did without PreCheck. We walked down to the gate and I was shocked at the dirty carpets. All kinds of food debris are on the floor, all over. There is no one cleaning or vacuuming and it is late afternoon. My wife dropped her coat on the floor and I was grossed out. We moved to the other side of the building to wait at Gate B9 vs Gate B10. Otherwise, the experience was uneventful. Nice sunset with a good view of the mountains. Then I got my bag in San Diego and someone has been through it. It is not a TSA inspection. One side has been ransacked. The strap I always put around the bag is gone and the stupid expanding section is now bellowed out. Inside the contents are as if they were tossed in a blender. What a mess. I don't know who or why but this is really bad news. SWA runs a great organization and I doubt they were the source of something nefarious. But it happened there and could not have happened on arrival because it came out with everyone elses. Who does that? How cheesey and lame. And I lost a bag strap that has been around the world with me for years."
15th November 2019,3,"""took out the water refill""",Not Verified | They re-did the airport and took out the water refill station so they can sell plastic bottles. A sales rep told me they removed the water fountains because the food court sells water? I'm very very disappointed. Seattle has been an environmental mainstay for decades and now - well!
12th November 2019,2,"""I love animals, just not in here""","✅ Trip Verified | No place to sit. Friendly and helpful workers. Limited food selection. While it looks fairly clean it's not, it's like a dog park in here. Who wants to eat food that's been prepared and cooked with pet dander and hair that has to be everywhere, not to mention the people with allergies. Disgusting. I love animals, just not in here."
4th November 2019,1,"""most uncomfortable airport""","Not Verified | Thanks, Seattle. You have managed to make this the most uncomfortable airport I’ve ever been in. It didn’t use to be this way but you have totally screwed it up. There is no comfortable place to sit down if you’re on a long layover."
26th October 2019,1,"""nowhere to sit""",✅ Trip Verified | I highly recommend skipping this airport! There is nowhere to sit. I am currently sitting on a bench down a hallway I found where employees take their breaks. They were kind enough to let me hang out. The bathroom was a mess. The layout is awful! It's crowded and hot. Lines to purchase food/drink are alarmingly long. Total chaos!
16th October 2019,1,"""told the queues to shut up and endure it""","✅ Trip Verified | Until our last trip through Seattle, I thought that Dulles was the worst possible USA port of entry. No more. SeaTac is without question the worst customs/immigration experience in the first world. There were easily a thousand arrival passengers and only 6 immigration agents. There was a queue to get into the queue to use the passport scanners, and then a further queue to get to an agent. The queues were “managed” by college sophomores who were all on their first week on the job. The offered no explanation as to why the delays were so extensive, and basically told the queues to shut up and endure it. It took 3 hours from the time we got in line to the 15-second interview with the immigration agent. I will never, repeat, never book an international arrival to Seattle."
2nd October 2019,3,"""A timely departure is rare""","✅ Trip Verified |  I am from Seattle, but have relocated elsewhere. I travel weekly for business. There are many well run airports in the country. SeaTac is not one of them. The busing to planes is a disaster. A timely departure is rare. I am currently sitting in a queue of 15 planes to depart 30 minutes late in perfect weather. If I didn’t live here, I would avoid this airport at all cost."
29th September 2019,2,"""recommend skipping Seattle""","Not Verified |  This airport that is my home airport is just so bad especially when arriving from international travel. We were arriving from a very long flight with two small children and everything about that fact is just plain awful. There is a short walk to immigration, probably the only plus, and then the confusion begins. They won't have your stroller yet so you carry all of your luggage and small children. There is no family friendly or child friendly service. You wait in very long lines with very poor line management, changing the configuration willy nilly at will and people in the back of the line might be first ones through kind of deal. Then because their long lines are so terrible with poor customer service and direction usually your bags are out on baggage claim. Used to have to wait for that for hours but they've fixed that problem by delaying you elsewhere. Then our bag is lost and nobody knows where it is or really helps in any way. There is no convenient counter to offer assistance. Every person working there is like a free agent, not connected to the larger web. Then you wait in another line to get through baggage and when you voluntarily have one item checked out by animal control they rudely handle your stuff.  Then when you finally find someone at a baggage counter and say 'hello' they don't bother looking up from their phone to say hi back and then are just so not helpful that you decide to run screaming out of this whole place and try your luck on the phone later because humans are incompetent. Lastly forget public transportation, this is also a joke. You now have to walk like a mile to the light rail without the stroller the airport lost and then get harassed by ticket enforcement for good measure. I truly and sincerely recommend skipping Seattle and i live here"
16th September 2019,2,"""there is nowhere to sit""",Not Verified |  This airport is cramped and there is nowhere to sit while waiting for a flight. I am sitting on the floor in a corridor because every seat is taken. Limited charging stations. Even worse than Logan which I did not think possible.
3rd September 2019,1,"""best of luck on arrival""","Not Verified | Like many of the previous reviews we found this airport the worst we have ever arrived at and we have been going to the US since 1981. When your pilot wishes everyone the best of luck on arrival you know you have problems. We landed at 1:15 p.m. from Heathrow and did not get out until 4 o'clock. By that time our pick-up had left and we had to pay again. Some people had to cradle their small children for a long time as there was very little seating. I would suggest anyone thinking of arriving here on an international flight should break their journey and go through immigration, etc somewhere else and then travel on a domestic flight. We had trouble finding our bags and the airport staff, if you could find one, were unhelpful. Immigration staff were pleasant"
1st September 2019,4,"""Total chaos""","Not Verified |  Total chaos. No instructions from employees that make any sense. Took a train within the airport. No signs, no station announcement and no hint of where your airline might be. Instructions on how to navigate through the airport were more complicated than my SAT exam. This airport, like most is run by government. And as the great Ronald Reagan said ""Government is not the answer to our problems. Government is the problem""."
15th August 2019,1,"""This airport is a hot mess""","Not Verified |  Do you love mass chaos and terrible customer service? Seattle is the airport for you! None of the employees have the foggiest idea what is going on and are exceptionally rude. They clearly do not care at all about their customers or their jobs. This airport is a hot mess. Unclean, unprofessional and quite frankly unbelievable. I have experienced arrival, departure and transfer delays and confusion. Stand up job Seattle! To be honest, I wish I could give it a zero."
8th August 2019,2,"""the most poorly managed airport""","NotVerified |  I live locally and I travel often for work. I have been in airports around the world and I can now say with confidence that SeaTac is the most poorly managed airport that I visit. I now have to account for an extra half hour (minimum) delay for both arrivals and departures. I understand growth of an area creates difficulties, but the area has experienced continuous, foreseeable growth for decades. The inability to accommodate this growth at the airport is a clear sign of poor management and this should be addressed. Top down changes are needed. Anyone in a leadership role who believes that this airport is on the right path, as busses drive people to planes, departures are delayed due to runway availability, and arrivals sit and wait for gates to open, needs to be fired and replaced by someone with a realistic view of the problems facing the airport. Solutions are needed and no new restaurant or international terminal will rectify the disaster that has become SeaTac airport."
1st August 2019,1,"""Just an embarrassment""","❎ Not Verified | 2-4 trips to Asia from Seattle a year. Just an embarrassment. The way they treat our visitors is shameful. I’m from Tacoma so I’m used to being treated badly by lazy government employees, but tonight is too much. It’s getting worse by the year. And I don’t know how to fix it except to just fire people from the top down. I’m just ashamed of my American neighbors acting like this again and again."
24th July 2019,1,"""bathrooms always stink""",✅ Trip Verified | Seatac is the most disgusting airport in America. The bathrooms always stink. There is never any paper towels to dry your hands and the dining options are a joke. Barefooted people are laying all over the waiting area furniture and on the filthy floors. So proud of their Starbucks and the few shopping choices are a rip-off.
24th July 2019,2,"""the worst I've ever experienced""","Not Verified |  After being spoiled by our home airport, Tampa, this one is the worst I've ever experienced. The kiosks did not print out luggage tags. This caused a long process of waiting in line to have the tags printed. Security was another nightmare, going from one security area to another depending on your gate (What? Why?). Then on top of that, some gates are in the main terminal, while others are remote, requiring a train. Mine was remote of course. The whole place is inefficient, old, and needs serious upgrading. Not a good experience at all!"
17th July 2019,1,"""has got to be the worst airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  This has got to be the worst airport I have ever visited in the US. I have traveled to most states, and all the airports have their quirks, but this one annoyed me and that is hard to do when I am on vacation. I am not going to complain about things they have no control over like TSA lines or airline queues though their queue lines for taking passengers to the Rental Car Station was 100 yards long. I am going to complain about an unsafe practice that is directly caused by airport management. The use of buses to take passengers to their planes is something I have seen before and understand. However, filling the buses with passengers like sardines with carry on luggage is a recipe for disaster. I complained to the workers and they kept pushing people in. As I expected, the bus had to come to a hard stop (normally I would not have considered the stop as bad), and everyone wound up bumping into each other and tripping over luggage. No one was hurt but this is an accident waiting to happen. They had four buses queued up and it was unnecessary to unsafely pack this many people just because they think this is a subway car or a street bus. I choose to be on those and subject myself to that when necessary but not at an airport with carry on luggage. The other disappointing feature of the airport is its dinginess. The outside areas where you wait are poorly maintained with debris all over along with dirty walls and sidewalks. Not what I have come to expect from a US airport. I know its next to impossible to choose your airport but stay away from this one if you can until they make things safer and clean up their public areas."
10th July 2019,1,"""Seattle Tacoma has fallen behind""","Not Verified |  The security check point lines just keep on getting longer and longer, extending the airport checking area. For years I have been traveling to and from Seatlle Tacoma, and numerous ineffective and inefficient security by DHS are implemented. Whereas, other domestic airports have greatly improved through better traveler services with multiple check points, shorter lines, electronic scanning capabilities, etc. However, as a world traveler, Seattle Tacoma has fallen behind not only domestic airports but also international ones from developing countries."
6th July 2019,1,"""This is beyond reasonable""",Not Verified |  Two hours plus just to get to the immigration desk when I landed on BA53 at 11.30. This is beyond reasonable when waiting with two small children. Dreadful.
29th June 2019,3,"""gets worse every year""","❎ Not Verified | I was at the airport at 6 am and the security line was one and half hours long. Arriving back to the same airport two weeks later, the baggage took a very long time to reach the baggage claim area. There is a totally inadequate pet relief area with a small bit of gravel, no grass. For smokers one goes outside the terminal at the baggage claim area, it is filthy and there is no cover which must be awful in the winter when it rains a lot in Seattle. To reach shuttle buses, Uber and other transportation you have to take an elevator or escalator up another level, cross a skybridge and then take another elevator down again. You cannot cross the road to reach transportation from the baggage claim area. This airport gets worse every year."
28th June 2019,2,"""wait was way too long""",❎ Not Verified | Stuck on the tarmac after a 6-hour flight. The wait was way too long. They need to figure better logistics. I came from Philadelphia and that was better. And they are typically the worst airport on the planet.
26th June 2019,1,"""sticky, dirty and full of trash""","Not Verified |  The most disgusting place I have ever been to. Only a few check in monitors working causing approx. 1 hour lines. The dust and trash that cover the security floors is beyond sickening. The gate seats are sticky, dirty and full of trash, one even had a orange peel on the ground and no employee cared to pick it up. The bathrooms are worse than public street porta potties. This airport doesn’t reflect the city of Seattle. I am so turned off by this airport I will most likely never return."
19th June 2019,1,"""an absurdly terrible airport""","✅ Trip Verified | What an absurdly terrible airport! There’s absolutely no reason on a non-holiday Monday afternoon to have a 1.5 hour wait in security. The airport knows how many flights and people to expect, and they should hire enough people to facilitate people getting through security in a reasonable time. Instead, there are very few staff around to help and direct (and the ones that are just blindly tell you to go to the next checkpoint because it’s “quicker,” when it’s not). The TSA agents are rude and defensive. One was giving me a dirty look and she said because I had given her one. Well, yes, I just waited in a 1.5 hour line for no reason, did she? She then went on that it’s my fault I was late (when I arrived almost 2 hours before my domestic flight). They also flag and pull lots of luggage from the line—but then there’s no one to check that flagged luggage and you have to wait another 10 minutes while your bags just sit there. I will avoid Seattle airport at all costs!"
18th June 2019,8,"""didn't appear to be long lines""","✅ Trip Verified |  Long walk from gate to exit. We then connected on to the Light rail to downtown Seattle and it was pretty hard to find out where to go. If you are connecting to the light rail, it is inside the terminal, not outside There didn't appear to be long lines anywhere. There seemed to be tons of places to shop and lots of restaurants."
17th June 2019,1,"""a very bad experience""","Not Verified |  I entered Seattle on a Virgin flight on Thursday 30th May. I headed for Passport Control and was told to stop and wait in a corridor to the Passport area. I waited and waited for 90 minutes along with several other people , most of whom complained to the staff on duty after an hour. Announcements came over the intercomms that the passport control area was very full and they were trying their best to clear the backlog. The area where we were queueing was a corridor less than four metres wide , with at least 50 to sixty other people off the same flight. This area was very hot and became unsafe, so much so that we were offered free water whilst we waited. Several other planes arrived and putting it bluntly we were discriminated against. Although we had the necessary ESTA documentation to enter the States we along with many other passengers had to endure watching passengers rush right past us and enter the passport area to be processed whilst we had to wait in line. Many of those waiting missed onward flights thanks to this policy. After 90 minutes (roughly) we were allowed into the processing area. 30 plus finger printing machines were there for us to use. So after a nine hour flight and ninety minutes waiting in a very hot area we were given the task of taking our own finger prints . Now I understand English perfectly and read the instructions perfectly, but would the machine take my prints ? ….NO. I then checked the screen below where my fingers had been, the finger plate was dirty , greasy and covered in what I assumed was sweat. I pointed this out to an attendant. There were just two helpers at the time trying to control this area and barking at the passengers. Two helpers for 30 dirty fingerprinting plates and people from all over the world not understanding the instructions walking around puzzled, bewildered and disenchanted . So wondering what germs or micro biological virus I would pick up from this experience I transferred to a different machine. Eventually I obtained a piece of paper with a large “X” across it. I had failed my first test to get into the USA, now I was being barked at again and being ordered to another queue about two and half hours after my landing in the United States. After three hours I was given the all clear by a United States Customs Officer in a little booth, with his own finger printing machine that eventually, (although just as unclean as the previous one) agreed to read my finger tips ! This was a very bad experience. Despite many complaints by my fellow passengers, many of whom were fellow Brits, we all felt we were discriminated against. The young customs officer who eventually allowed us in to the United States stated “We are getting new machinery soon”. This experience which I can prove beyond doubt will mean I will never travel through Seattle again. I found the people nasty, barking at us, talking to us like we were thick and shepherding us around like sheep. I assume that anybody who lives in Seattle or works there would also be disgusted if they saw how people visiting their city for the first time ever were treated."

The passport control lines are usually an hour at least for visitors because as the staff repeated over and over, ""US citizens get priority"". Which would be fine if the passport control kiosks for hundreds of international visitors were in any way adequate. I've been living here and traveling back and forth for three years. As America's ""8th busiest airport"", they need to join the rest of us in 2019 and equip their arrivals better. This is pathetic, unnecessary and embarrassing."

It took us a couple of minutes to check in our luggage but nearly an hour to go through the tsa security line even if the person on charge at the beginning of the line told us it would only take 30 minutes. When we realized we were not going to make it on time (boarding time had started since 30 minutes), we asked a tsa agent to help us to cut the line. We were suprised of her negative answer as its usually how we do it in Europe. We were even more surprised when she asked us to wait while everyone was passing in front us, making us even later for our flight, in the future, we hope there will be some changes regarding the organization of the tsa security queue to reduce its duration. Its definitely the longest I have ever had. Good luck to all future passengers!"

We had an hour and a half to do all this - seems adequate, right? Wrong. After customs and baggage inspection (about 45 minutes), SEATAC required us to exit security, take a shuttle to another terminal, and go back through TSA screening again - about another 45 minutes because there were very few screeners working, and the line was unbelievable. All this to return to the same terminal we started at, only two gates over. We ran through the terminal and were late for boarding. The entire experience was stressful and completely unnecessary - why in the world does TSA want to create more work for themselves? They should simply keep arrivals behind security when they're meeting connecting flights."
1st February 2019,3,"""arrival process is archaic""
","Not Verified |  The international arrival process is archaic compared to other airports, ie Frankfurt, Germany. The scanning machines are numerous and quick but then you still check through an agent who stamps your printed receipt which served no purpose other than being redundant. When we asked who gets the printed receipt an officer said to destroy it. Then after exiting with our baggage we went through another screening which had only two lines resulting in a large backup. The people helping with the baggage were friendly and helpful, the TSA individuals we had contact with were grumpy, especially some woman with the drug/fruit sniffing dog. Embarrassed to think that foreigners entering the US get a sterile, non-welcoming first impression."

One of the see-thru boxes had been opened, the plastic seal removed along with two pieces of candy. Are you kidding me! Because the candy was in see-thru plastic containers it was totally unnecessary to open the box and remove the plastic seal. Crazy. Also, I had a bottle of liqueur padded with plastic on two sides and taped in place so the inspectors could clearly see the labels on the front/back of the bottle and see exactly what it was. They removed all the padding and didn’t bother to tape it back on after inspecting it. It’s a miracle it didn’t break and spill all over the contents of my suitcase. Why can’t they repack items the way they found them? This isn’t SeaTac’s fault, but some of the TSA people working there reflect poorly on an otherwise excellent airport."
13th December 2018,3,"""nightmare experience""","✅ Trip Verified | We arrived at Seatac airport to get a Hawaiian airlines flt. We already did online check night before flight but needed to get a bag tag from a malfunctioned kiosk and waiting for one to open up. Then stand in a long line to check bags in. Although I was pre check I chose to go with the rest of my family who weren't. After that the craziness began. Among our group of 6 was my 91 yr old mother who maneuvered those very very long zig zag lines thru TSA as good as we did. There were only 2 lines to general tsa check for hundreds of people zig zagged sometimes 4 abreast. What I carried through TSA Honolulu and TSA Las Vegas in 3 pans took 6 pans at Seatac. The young agent had me put all my belongings in separate pans. Shoe, purse, hand carry, jacket and ipad/cell phone, 6 pans total not counting my mother's 3 pans with her hand carry, purse and cell phone. After we went through my mother's purse went missing and we panicked running around looking for it only to find that an agent had it and brought it to us to search. By the time we got the tram to the boarding gate with 7 minutes left to board I was happy to be leaving that nightmare experience behind. It took 1 hr and 10 minute thru TSA. Come on seatac we've been going thru this since 2001, get it together! You are the last people your visitors go through. Fix your TSA lines! Six of us almost missed our flight."
29th November 2018,2,"""traffic control delays""",Not Verified |  Seatac has become the most miserable airport to transit through. Air traffic control delays all regional flights constantly. Alaska airlines had not had a single flight that hasn't been delayed that I've been on for 2 years. The construction projects have not been named correctly.
21st November 2018,1,"""TSA lines are outrageous""
","Not Verified |  TSA lines are outrageous and the security process throughout is simply terrible. They have 2 pre-check only security checkpoints right next to each other, fully staffed with officer with very little to do because they usually have just handful people in pre-check line. However, if you don’t have the pre-check, you have to walk long ways to the checkpoint in the middle of the airport, which has the line that wraps forever. It turns into a very stressful process because both the passengers and the officers are overwhelmed. Getting thru security may take you 40+ minutes. Unacceptable. This is an exptremly poorly managed TSA process and it has gotten worse in the last year."
21st November 2018,2,"""a miserable experience""
","Not Verified |  While the airport is trying to make the terminal nicer, the security lines are horrible, poor management, long lines and they move so absurdly slowly, that you end up racing to your gate. It’s possibly even worse returning from international flights!! As a result, it’s always a miserable experience."
19th November 2018,2,"""food options are limited""",Not Verified |  This airport lacks enough seating for the amount of people waiting to board flights. The food court has been closed for about a year and consequently food options are limited and again there is no seating if you manage to find something to eat. People were sitting on the dirty floor and blocking the entrance to shops. The bathrooms were crowded and dirty. The PA system sound is very poor. In a cosmopolitan city like Seattle I expect better.
9th November 2018,2,"""has severely gone downhill""","✅ Trip Verified | SeaTac has severely gone downhill in the past fifteen years. On arrival, I was shocked at how extremely long the immigration and customs queues were, staff were handing out bottles of water and many passengers were missing connecting flights. Announcements advertised an e-passport app but no WiFi on which to download the app until quite far into the queue, and no advertisement that there was WiFi. Overall, it took two hours to get through as a US citizen. After immigration (literally walking through, wondering if I was going to be arrested) I ended up confused and bewildered in Customs with people playing Human Snake around the baggage claim waiting for their turn, which took another hour. The way out was no better, with ridiculous security lines and a rush through screening that must be cutting corners. Seating before security also scarce and the cafes were crowded. Poor, retirement-age volunteers had been brought in to help queuing and give passenger info - a disgrace that they're not being paid. Come on SeaTac, get it together. Until you do, I'm flying into Vancouver."
20th October 2018,1,"""This needs to be fixed""

19th October 2018,2,"""most poorly managed airport""",Not Verified | This is the most poorly managed airport I have ever experienced. The lines were mind bogglingly long without the traffic to justify it. Seattle will not be on my list of places to return unless they have another airport to try.
10th October 2018,3,"""they never fix the outlets""","Not Verified |  Year after year, we fly in and out of Seattle airport. And it never ceases to amaze me (and others) how they never fix the outlets for people to charge their phones. We are usually in the N6 area, for Alaska airlines. People running from seat to seat, trying to plug in their phone or laptop. How frustrating. All the money they rake in, and cannot get adequate outlet service for their customers."
26th September 2018,2,"""Long delays""","Not Verified |    Arrived from Frankfurt on LH on September 23. Long delays (2 hours) wait for those coming in on visa or first time ESTA due to multiple flight arrivals. Staff at the line up area were pleasant and apologetic for the long wait. When I got to the officer, he was rude. It was a long wait for me and must be the same for him. His line of questioning was very passive aggressive. I guess he is taking out his frustration of his type of work to others. I feel sorry for him - understanding that he must do a thorough job but unnecessary hostility doesn’t represent the job well."
9th September 2018,3,"""2 hour queue to get through immigration""",✅ Trip Verified | Obviously the airport is undergoing modernisation as it is looking very tired at the moment. The staff were all very polite and helpful but that did not detract from the long 2 hour queue to get through immigration which was awful. Some people missed connections as there appeared to be no mechanism for fast tracking such passengers. Baggage was taken off the carousels long before people arrived to free up space for other flights. Then there was another queue for customs. Baggage back on a conveyor with no information as to where it would end up. Then long walk to find a taxi. At the end of a nine+ hour flight it was just too much. Feel sorry for the people working there!
26th August 2018,2,"""not nearly enough seating""","Not Verified | Not nearly enough seating, no conveyor walkways where I needed, old funitiure, way too few phone recharge outlets in main terminal and many did not work!"
15th August 2018,3,"""No seating in this airport""",Not Verified |  No seating in this airport. Huge walkways but no seating at the gates. People wind up standing in the walkways. Very poor design. Also needs more restaurants and rest rooms.
15th August 2018,1,"""no fun to fly through here""
","Not Verified |  Wow SeaTac, get it together. I’m from Tampa, which is probably my favorite airport in the world. But I moved to Seattle some years ago, and now I’m experiencing probably the dirtiest, least efficient airport on a regular basis. Before even getting to the airport, traffic is backed up. This evening it was Arrivals traffic, but it was spilling over into the Departures lanes, so we were delayed there 15 mins. The people waiting to get to Arrivals must’ve had to wait over 30 mins to get there. They need to be better about moving people along and not letting them sit. The Security screening process is a joke, with lines going every direction and no designated person advising people how to prepare to go thru screening. The women’s bathroom was so dirty, with toilets clogged, paper towels and toilet paper all over the floor, overflowing garbage bins, soap dispensers that don’t work and if you notice the carpet at the terminal, it looks like it hasn’t been vacuumed in a week. This place seriously needs some new leadership. Please. It’s no fun to fly through here."
11th August 2018,4,"""use caution with connecting flights""","Not Verified | Use caution with connecting flights if you are entering the US via Seattle, be sure you have plenty of time. Customs, bag check and security take an incredibly long time to clear. The whole operation is crammed into the basement. Ugly, hot and it must be where they put all the TSA rejects because they’re all unkempt, disgruntled, and slow (more than usual). Seatac could help this process with some facility improvements. Airport itself is fairly grungy these days overall, especially the S terminal."
10th August 2018,3,"""the place is filthy""","Not Verified | We last passed through the Seattle Airport in May. Compared with other international airports we are familiar with, it was filthy, which we noted in a review. It is August 9. Without exaggerating, we can say that the campground outhouses in Japan are cleaner than the restrooms in Sea-Tac. As for comparisons with international airports in Korea, Japan and even Mongolia, the state of uncleanliness at Seattle Airport is a disgrace. Whomever is in charge out to be embarrassed. Below, we gave Airport Staff a score of 1 - because the place is filthy."
10th August 2018,1,"""customer service is horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport in the US. Not only is this airport ugly, but customer service is horrible and TSA lines are out of control. We arrived 2.5 hours prior to our flight to Las Vegas. At the airline counter we checked in and were told to wait in the TSA line which started right next to the airline counter! The line snaked around and around. It was moving so we thought the line would go quickly. We were mistaken. The lines snaked through almost every part of the terminal. Down hallways, next to shops, thru other lines, etc. I have never seen such poor management of TSA lines at any other airport in the US. It was simply mind boggling. I attempted to ask a TSA agent about the Pre-Check lines but was ignored. On my second try I was told to move or get pulled out of line. SeaTac is seriously a horrible airport. It's only redeeming quality is it's light rail system that connects directly to the airport and gets you to downtown Seattle easily. Other than that, SeaTac is a horrible mess. Avoid it at all costs."
19th July 2018,4,"""This airport is sweltering""","Not Verified |  What’s the matter Seattle? Can you not pay your electricity bill? This airport is sweltering! Now I have to sweat for 3 hours. Get it together, you have a beautiful city but you have a horrible airport!"
15th July 2018,2,"""very disappointed""","Not Verified | We made the mistake of needing to be there at 4:20 AM which seemed to be close to when the next bunch of agents came on duty. I had a Pre Check so I walked right up and mentioned to an agent I needed to have a full body scan because of a knee and hip replacement. The full body scanner had yellow tape on the front of it with no agent. So he yelled something like ""where is the full body person?"" then he yelled again as I am waiting then he said ""fine I will do it"" and I finally was able to make it though no problems. My wife was not Pre Check and she waited in line for about 30 minutes until she reached the screener. They had very few agents at that time in the morning. When she went though, the machine kept saying she had something in her pant pocket. The pants did not have a pocket so they did a very detailed examination. In the mean time the line was growing longer as a new group of agents were coming to work. It took my wife 45 minutes to make it though - very disappointed!"
2nd July 2018,3,"""Security was completely crazy""","✅ Trip Verified | Security was completely crazy at this airport. They had a TSA precheck with no line and many agents doing nothing while the regular line was literally out the door. Totally inefficient. When the line finally began moving it was because they basically stopped screening everyone and let all go through only a metal detector. They need to study other airports, much like Seattle itself there are major problems in planning."
1st July 2018,1,"""security lines are totally ridiculous""","✅ Trip Verified | Really a horrible airport. It is operating at capacity. The security lines are totally ridiculous all the time. Last time I was there (June 11) at least TSA was letting people through without taking off shoes, going through the x-ray, taking out computers or toiletries, etc. which was a nice change, but even with that the line took 30 minutes and stretched for probably 200 yards away from the security checkpoint (everyone would have missed their flights if TSA had done the normal checks.) For international arrivals, passport checks can also be very slow since there doesn't seem to be any correlation between the arrival times of flights and the number of immigration officers on duty. The international departure terminal can get very crowded and hot in the early afternoon, and it can be hard to find a place to sit and slow to get served if you want food. Soon at least we will have Paine Field as an alternative option."
26th June 2018,3,"""increasingly dismayed""
","Not Verified |  Having flown several times in and out of SeaTac in the past few months I am increasingly dismayed by my hometown airport experience. Ridiculously long screening lines for those who have not paid for the honor of TSA precheck or other. Two hours to clear immigration. Huge line with no bathrooms available. This after 30 hours of travel from East Africa made this traveler indignant to say the least. They had just three officers at passport control. Come on, guys. We pay a ton of taxes. A better airport experience should be available to all."
26th June 2018,2,"""This is ridiculous""","Not Verified |  Wow! Can someone spell ""slow""? This by far one for the worst airports in the U.S. TSA has only one checkpoint open plus PreCheck. Oh yeah, and lots of passengers standing in line waiting for the rest of the TSA employees to start working. This is ridiculous. But hey who cares, the passengers only keep this business in the air, so why should they matter? Now I am sure someone will talk about 'shift changes' and the classic, we only care about passengers safety, blah, blah, blah, we all understand that but be efficient please, and for goodness sake smile once in a while and say ""Have a nice day "" with at least some sincerity."
20th June 2018,4,"""TSA officers standing in a huddle chatting""","✅ Trip Verified | Less than half of the security lines were open causing a huge backlog. Took me 40 minutes to get to the front and when I asked why so few were open the TSA officer refused to answer my question and just told me to move along. And it didn’t look like they were short staffed. There was a group of 10 TSA officers standing in a huddle chatting, laughing and some on their phones."
16th June 2018,1,"""This is the worst airport""",Not Verified |  Attempted to check-in early. Was informed could not check in before 4 hours from departure. Went through search very fast. However for fours had to stand due to no seating and delayed flights kept moving my terminal. This is the worst airport I have ever dealt with.
12th June 2018,1,"""worst customer service""",Not Verified |    Seattle Airport is by far the worst TSA experience I’ve ever encountered. They are also not military friendly. Waiting in line is just ridiculous. 4 security checks open for pre TSA and only 1 open for people with a normal ticket. Absolute worst customer service. Security guards are rude and will throw away any liquid items even if it it less than three ounces. Lost nearly 50$ of face cleaners. The airport is also dirty and unkept. Avoid Seattle airport at all costs.
29th May 2018,1,"""Could it be worse?""",❌ Not Verified |  Could it be worse? Not sure how. 04.30 and lines not moving. People were flooding in. Suggest getting here 3 hours early at least. Time to get Global or Clear.
28th May 2018,2,"""a dirty American airport""","❌ Not Verified |  Having recently traveled in Asia (Mongolia, South Korea, Hong Kong) it is invariably disappointing to come back to a dirty American airport. In Mongolia, a “developing nation,” they have discovered soap and water. Sea-Tac managers should investigate this modern cleaning marvel - it would help with getting some of the crud removed from some of the seats and bathrooms. The airports in Hong Kong and Seoul are thoroughly modern and immaculate. Maybe cease the USA! USA! Chants for a bit and pick up a broom? Seriously. Your airport is embarrassing."
26th May 2018,1,"""security check is ridiculously slow""
","❌ Not Verified |  The security check is ridiculously slow. The TSA personnel showed no urgency in getting people through the check. It took 1-2 minutes to get each passenger through the checkpoint, and there were security lanes that were closed even though the security line was snaking for hundreds of yards through the airport. I missed my flight despite being at the airport nearly 2 hours before my flight. This was unacceptable handling of the situation by the TSA personnel. Other international airports troubleshoot when security is backed up to try and get people on their flights. Sea-Tac’s security didn’t seem to much care."
25th May 2018,2,"""people were missing flights""",❌ Not Verified |  Today's queue time just to get to TSA checkpoint was an hour. TSA late opening up extra lines and people were missing flights. Do not schedule 8 am departure from Seattle and don't fly there if you can avoid it.
22nd May 2018,1,"""It was a mess!""",❌ Not Verified |  I travel internationally several times in a year. This was the first I used Seattle as my port of entry. After we got off the plane and prior to reaching the immigration area we were stopped and advised that there is a backlog and we have to wait. The announcer advised all the passengers to download the Global Passport App and complete it and as soon as we answer questions and receive the QR code we could breeze part through immigration clearance. I did this and indeed went passed through quickly only to be stopped at luggage claim and customs clearance. It was a mess! Luggage from different airlines were piled on the same luggage belts. After I found my luggage there was a long line of people trying to clear customs. It took about 2 hours to clear customer and when I asked the customs officer why there is such a back log she said the new system made it a mess. I guess a new system was put in place but not properly staffed. Will not be using Seattle Airport anymore as a port of entry.
20th May 2018,3,"""security used to be well managed""",❌ Not Verified | SEATAC really was screwed up security. Used to be well managed. Now incredibly long lines for general while manpower running Clear or TSA sitting bored and apologizing for poor leadership decisions. Felt bad for them. They were clearly embarrassed by new line management situation. I fly monthly and have never seen SEATAC so bad. Someone in management needs to be fired.
16th May 2018,1,"""the worst airport experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airport experience I have  had. I will never be flying out from this airport again! 2 hours in the TSA line with my wife and three children. Got here at 6:30 for a 10:00 flight to Hawaii, got to the terminal with the people still at the gate going in and the receptionist wouldn’t let us on! Worst customer service, worst airport experience, worst attitudes by the airport personnel!"
4th May 2018,1,"""1h30m in queues""","❎ Not Verified | This is from my 2 recent arrivals experiences. There are 8 ""International"" flights landing within span of 30 minutes. Even if we consider a minimum 150 passengers from non us citizen and stand in queue, total people standing will be 1200. If one person spending roughly 5 minutes it's not rocket science to deploy the required capacity to clear queues. I spent 1 hour 30 minutes both times in these queues. Another chaos at the luggage belt, no discipline at all. I don't know the role played by airport staff to streamline these processes and traffic load management. Same thing happens at the boarding train point, total chaos. It's a small conveyor belt and everyone jumps on. It's like you are going to ride last scheduled train which takes you to exit doors. Overall, I will suggest to use other airports as entry points in US and travel domestic routes. At least you will save lot of time coming out of airport."
29th March 2018,1,"""a poor welcome back""","✅ Trip Verified | The TSA agents at the security check-in area immediately following customs and baggage claim was one of the most chaotic systems I've ever experienced. One TSA agent told a passenger to push his bags through. 1 minute later, another TSA agent pulled the luggage out and stacked them in a pile. 20 seconds later, another TSA agent said ""who did this?"" In addition, they had a sarcastic tone to their verbal instructions. We had to ask for bins multipke times, especially after they continually specified that we need to empty our pockets. When my husband reached over for a bin that was being wheeled over, he was abruptly told, ""no, that's not for you, put it back"" and when another passenger reached fir a bin, he was told it would cost him $10. This unprofessional behavior was a poor welcome back for US citizens and represented the US poorly to visitors."
26th March 2018,6,"""security screening ridiculous""",✅ Trip Verified | I recently flew from Seattle to Frankfurt. Check in was a breeze! Took less than 10 minutes. Personnel in that area deserve 5 stars! The line to get through to the security screening was ridiculous. I waited a good hour! There was one person to serve in that area. I don’t understand why there were two priority TSA officers that more than half the time stood around waiting for non existent premium passengers!! Why could someone not funnel a few of us “cattle class” travelers over to these other TSA officers when they were twiddling their thumbs? Or possibly one of those officers could come over to assist a few passengers when there was a lull in the premium screening. There were never more than 10 people waiting in that priority line. What gives? Poor management!
20th March 2022,2,"""staff members at this airport were extremely rude""","Not Verified |  The staff members at this airport were extremely rude! This was consistent throughout the entire airport. My daughter and I were flying for the first time in a long time and we were appalled at the attitude of the TSA employees, the Bojangles employees, and the market employee. I don't understand how all of the employees throughout this entire airport all share the same negative and rude attitude. What I do understand is that working with the public can be difficult and exhausting. However, the reputation of the Charlotte Douglas Airport should be a consideration, I will do everything in my power from this point on to avoid flying in or out of this airport."
28th February 2022,1,"""Horrible COVID compliance""","Not Verified |  Horrible COVID compliance! Passengers were allowed in the terminal without masks. Airport employees were observed with masks that were not properly deployed, with noses and mouths uncovered. Avoid flying through CLT!!!"
16th January 2022,1,"""Apparently everything closes at 8.00pm""","✅ Trip Verified |  Apparently everything closes at 8.00pm and you’re an idiot if you don’t already know this based upon the employees we encountered. All we wanted to do was have a bite to eat and watch the game, but were rudely told the airport closes at 8.00 even with 10.00pm departures. Don’t plan on grabbing snacks or drinks from any other shops as they all close at 8.00pm and don’t ask if a shop is different."
17th December 2021,1,"""Extremely rude employees""","Not Verified | Extremely rude employees who acted like they were doing me a favor by doing there job. Also rude to my family. We will avoid this airport when ever possible do not think I have the patience to be around such disrespectful, rude people I considered filling a complaint but would be a waste of time for obvious reasons"
27th November 2021,1,"""amount of rude behavior was extremely uncalled for""","Not Verified |  Please explain to the TSA that for some people having a job is a privilege and if they hate their job so much that they need to take it out on all the passengers, it might be a sign to find another job they can be happier with. The amount of rude behavior witnessed by many from our flight was extremely uncalled for. You have done one thing very well, you made a 3rd world country look way better than you."
21st September 2021,1,"""avoid this airport""",✅ Trip Verified | The worst airport I have ever traveled through! If you are going on vacation please if possible avoid this airport! The worst experience flying I have ever had and also thank you American Airlines two busted bags and a hard landing!
21st September 2021,1,"""slow service, low staffing""","Not Verified | Coming back from Jamaica people joke about it being a third world country but comparing the service speed and courtesy there to the reception at this garbage airport is like night and day. Slow service, low staffing, no courtesy, and with two flights in the terminal you’d expect to be able to get your bag in less than an hour of standing"
19th September 2021,3,"""think these restaurants would be opened""","Not Verified |  First of all, no alcohol sales on Sunday until ten, and there are not enough restaurants in this place. The terminals are spare and I get that we are living in the times of COVID, but hunting down food … even coffee is nonsense. For the amount of people on this airport in the early morning, you would think these restaurants would be opened."
6th July 2021,1,"""She told me to file a complaint and step away""","✅ Trip Verified | There is a Market Fresh located right where you either turn right to go to gates ABCD or left for the E gates. There is a bar there with deli style food and sodas. The kiosk was not working so several people, more then 20, went over to the ""bar"" register and was told that she was sorry but she could only sell alcoholic drinks but would call someone to fix the kiosk. After standing there for 35 minutes in which she didn't even call anyone but continued serving drinks and more customer were turned away for the Fresh Market sandwiches and sodas, I asked again for her to call someone. She told me to file a complaint and step away. Wow, so the Charlotte Airport Fresh Market is more then happy to sell you booze but not food and sodas which is needed because airlines do not provide those. Also, I repeatedly asked people wishing around in collar shirts and walkie talkies and all they could say is they worked for AA but didn't know how to get in contact with anyone. So I sat for almost 3 hours waiting for my flight, not eating or drinking because I wouldn't purchase booze from fresh market. I could have stood in line for the same time to wait for a table to eat in a bar and I don't eat fast food. Way to go Charlotte Airport. 4th of July weekend and no one from Customer Service is walking the airport."
1st July 2021,2,"""The worst experience""","Not Verified |  The worst experience. After landing, waited in the plane 35 minutes for a gate to become available. Then waited over an hour for luggage. Airport too small for the amount of traffic or not properly managed."
16th June 2021,1,"""airport is simply not set up to handle the crowds""","Not Verified |  Has to be one of, if not the worst airports in America. The airport is simply not set up to handle the crowds pumping through there. If you have a connection that is less than an hour, you can forget about any food options due to super long lines at all of them. If your lucky, the lines at the Hudson news type places will only be 10 people long and you can grab a snack. I fly nearly every week and connect through Charlotte at least 4 times a month, it’s always the same. Staff for the most part is okay, unless you are in the regional jet area E gates. It is a free for all over there, very unorganized and chaotic. 5 years ago this airport was great, now I dread connecting there."
16th June 2021,4,"""lack of open restaurants/shops is ridiculous""","Not Verified |  The lack of open restaurants/shops is ridiculous. Airport volume is back to normal yet through three terminals there isn't a single place to buy a simple coffee. Seriously, what sadist has no available coffee at 6am? I get they needed some closures when travel was low during COVID, but that time is over. It's time to open this airport back up."
5th June 2021,1,"""The most disorganized airport I have travelled thru""",Not Verified |  Travelled thru on June 4. The most disorganized airport I have travelled thru. The crowds on departing bordered on mass hysteria. Bumper to bumper passengers. Was difficult to tell where lines started or ended. Most passengers were funneled thru gate E. Employees screaming directions to tell passengers where to line up. Terminal was so crowded there wasn’t anywhere to go. Zero social distancing. I would compare it to cattle being led into the slaughter trucks. A fair description! TSA agents overwhelmed. My encounter bordered on ridiculous. Too long to explain. I would avoid this destination at all costs.
1st June 2021,3,"""Not once has the baggage claim carousel been accurately reported""","Not Verified |  I have flown into Charlotte a dozen times. Not once has the baggage claim carousel been accurately reported. You leave travelers guessing if their baggage is on carousel B1, B2 or both when you just say B. Then you have people bouncing back and forth between carousels because of your lack of detail. There is also no organization when it comes to shuttles back to parking. You have no lines or anyone directing people, so there is just a mass of people. It’s so disorganized, some people are being courteous while others don’t care and just walk to the front of the line. It’s really embarrassing."
25th May 2021,2,"""every single time I have been delayed""",✅ Trip Verified | I have connected in Charlotte over 4 times in the past two years and every single time I have been delayed. I don’t think a flight ever leaves this airport on time.
17th May 2021,6,"""Everyone was helpful and friendly""","Not Verified |  PROS - Navigating the terminal: It has moving, belt walkways to help you move faster or, as in my case, assist you if you are somewhat handicapped. Food: There is a lovely atrium food court with rocking chairs, if you can get one, and a nice array of restaurant styles. The restaurants had very long lines, so I stopped in a convenience shop and got a sandwich to avoid the lines. Dogs: They have airport comfort dogs, I was really hoping to see one. Unfortunately, I did not. Maybe next time. Staff: Everyone was helpful and friendly. One of the young men sanitizing surfaces was actually dancing and just made you smile. The shop cashier told me I can grab a free bag of chips since I got the sandwich and a bottle of water. The gate attendant cheerfully added a note to allow me to pre-board, as I cannot pivot and navigate a tight space easily and unbeknownst to those around me, it brings me great physical pain to have to pivot and dodge other people and their baggage. She did however, add a request for a wheelchair, which I did not request and it caused some confusion for the staff at the destination terminal. CONS - Seating: There are not enough accessible seats. I needed a place to eat my sandwich and the rocking chairs were full and all the atrium seats that I could find were bar stool type chairs that, due to my handicap, I am completely unable to get on and off. I get around ok with a cane. However, I also had to stand at the gate, as there was not enough seating. I am still having extra trouble getting around a day after my trip due to the pain of having to stand."
7th May 2021,1,"""No time to enjoy or visit the airport amenities""","Not Verified |  American Airlines schedules so many flights at one time it's ridiculous. Once landed, it took 35 min to get to gate. Same way on departure. No time to enjoy or visit the airport amenities."
22nd April 2021,1,"""They don’t care about passengers safety""","Not Verified |  Worst airport ever. Dirty, over crowded, no soap in bathroom and no way to keep distance from other passengers. No one at the airport is cleaning, did the FAA forget to tell Charlotte Airport that we are in a pandemic. Most workers at the fast food have their noses out of the masks. I will pay more never to fly through Charlotte again. They don’t care about passengers safety."
13th April 2021,1,"""Most inefficient airport in the country""",✅ Trip Verified | Most inefficient airport in the country. Always end up waiting a minimum of 30 min plus to declare or take off. Poor logistics both on the ground and in the air. Dreadful experience.
6th April 2021,10,"""We were treated like VIP’s""",✅ Trip Verified | Even though I didn’t request when booking I was able to request assistance for my husband. When we arrived at the Charlotte airport they had someone at the door waiting with a wheelchair. We were treated like VIP’s. When it was time to board our next flight to our final destination even though we were in basic economy last to board they called us as the first to board. Since the plane was full they ask if we wanted complementary carry on checked bags which we were happy to do.
20th January 2021,9,"""it was improved""","Not Verified |  I have to admit, I was quite impressed with CLT. I hadn’t flew through here since the US merger and it was improved. The center core with concourses sticking out works well, the moving walkways are nice, and I explored all of the concourses as I was here for 4 hours. A, B, C, and D were nice, and the food options were excellent. Also, all of the staff were super nice and the facilities were clean. That being said, Concourse E needs some help as it feels run down, overcrowded, and is confusing."
19th November 2020,3,"""it has a long way to go""","Not Verified |  I cannot fathom how poor this airport has been especially in the midst of Covid. I was transitioning through this airport on my way home and I sadly missed my flight. I had to make some important international calls to sort out a new ticket but their internet was spotty at best and I could hardly hold a conversation for for than a few seconds without it dropping and I certainly couldn't do video. I had to piggy back off of a store's network I found somewhere b/c theirs was so unreliable. There wasn't even a Boingo Hotspot there that I could buy and no SIM card vending machines, or any vending machines for that matter in the main terminal, which makes things even more frustrating when the entire airport shuts down at 9pm and becomes a ghost town. Forget about sleeping if you get stranded. There isn't a comfortable place in site and their rocking chairs (very dated now) is really one of the few non-airport style chairs they have available. For being the 16th largest city in the U.S. as the Governor says repeatedly every 5 minutes on the recorded message, it has a long way to go. Few restaurants are open too so expect very long lines at your favourite places to go. Lastly, the TSA agents here are the rudest I have experienced. They yelled at customers, they didn't smile, they didn't even try to have conversation with people when people tried to be nice to them. They all seemed very dissatisfied with their work. Either their manager needs to be fired or they need to find new jobs."
19th November 2020,4,"""social distancing was non existent""",Not Verified |  This airport was too packed and social distancing was non existent. The staff walked around more than cleaned the facility and two young workers tried to get into a confrontation with me for no reason. They were in front of me on the automatic belt and kept looking back talking about me but I paid them no attention because I couldn't hear what they were saying. The food lines were long and no social distancing. The bathrooms were not cleaned enough. I have a 6 hour layover in the airport and had to keep moving around to less crowed areas to feel safe. Some people weren't wearing masks and no one in authority corrected them just the automatic message that played out periodically over the intercom.
5th November 2020,10,"""she saved the day!""","Not Verified |  Charlotte airport is crowded but always feels comfortable. In particular, I want to praise one woman who made my transition through Charlotte incredible. I don't know her name but, I got off my flight from Gainesville FL in the crowded end of E gates and had only a 1 hour layover, and made my way to my next departure in C 15 to Pittsburgh. I stopped to buy lunch and found that my wallet was missing. I quickly returned to E34 and begged the woman who was the gate agent to check the now empty jet, handed her my used boarding pass. She stopped what she was doing and walked through that door. I knew she wouldn't find it and began wondering how I would pay for my parking at PIT. A few minutes later, she emerged through that same door and handed me my wallet. It contained my credit and debit cards and my cash. All intact. I don't know her name but I told her she was my favorite person on Earth. The man seated nearby said ""you are one lucky guy"", and I agreed. I ran to C15 and made my flight. Whoever she was, she deserves praise. She could have told me ""no"", or ""you were warned to check for your belongings"". Instead she saved the day!"
10th October 2020,6,"""very surprised to find no potty liners in your toilets""","Not Verified |  During this time of the Pandemic or COVID, I was very surprised to find no potty liners in your toilets. I thought maybe it was overlooked in one of the restrooms, but I visited a couple and no potty liners to be found. I think it should be normal for added protection especially now during the pandemic. My airport in Portland, Oregon has them."
3rd September 2020,1,"""airport is in such disarray""",✅ Trip Verified | This airport is in such disarray. I flew from gate e33. They have so many people flocked at the end or this terminal that there are no seats. People are standing. The gates are so close. Like the door to the gate is maybe 2 feet from next gate. No organization at all. People were in line to speak with gate agent and she pretty much ignored us last two in line. I love flying American Airlines but if that means I have to connect in Charlotte then Delta it will be. I can only hope that they get this fixed real soon.
5th June 2020,8,"""the best airport I have been through""","Not Verified |  Flew through Charlotte Douglas international airport on the way to Antigua back in 2016. It was the best airport I have been through, easy to navigate, good food and shopping options, and nice staff. The best airport along the east coast by far."
7th March 2020,1,"""Nothing good to say about the airport""","Not Verified |  Nothing good to say about the airport or my experience flying into or out of Charlotte Airport, I'll just let my rating speak for itself. Absolutely terrible in every conceivable way."
18th February 2020,1,"""a shopping mall with planes""","Not Verified |  Total garbage, a shopping mall with planes. You'll end up waiting on the tarmac longer than you'll be in the air. I will avoid this airport for the rest of my life, and I hope you do too."
18th February 2020,3,"""Avoid Charlotte if possible""","Not Verified | The past several times changing planes thru Charlotte has been the greatest example of incompetent people being placed into positions that exceed their abilities. It gives me time to ponder the state of the US airline industry as a whole and some insight into how a thriving demand still results in oft dismal earnings. Maybe an over-regulated industry is not attracting the top tier talent and what we are left with are the likes of those that run Charlotte airport? Avoid Charlotte if possible, ATL is faster (that is saying something) and if you must fly thru CLT, allow yourself ample time."
4th February 2020,1,"""over-crowded, lacks seating""","Not Verified |  I find it repulsive every time I have to depart from it. It's over-crowded, lacks seating, constant tarmac delays waiting for gates to be available, and the departing airfares are at least $200 higher than similarly sized airports. AA has a monopoly (over 90% of all flights) and they clearly take advantage by price gouging and delivering horrible service with impunity. Our local officials should be locked up or investigated for how they mismanage tax money with this disaster for an airport."
27th December 2019,1,"""airport is an absolute nightmare""","Not Verified |  Worst airport experience I have ever had. This airport is an absolute nightmare. Our flight coming in was delayed and when we arrived they sent us back through security as we were running to catch our next flight. Got to the gate 12 minutes before the scheduled departure only to have them already close it. They weren't apologetic in the least, worst customer service ever! Just shouted at us that we will have to rebook a later flight, it's not their problem, but feel free to make some purchases in their airport. They had an entire family of 5 trying to catch their connecting flight and can see that their previous flight had just landed. Yet they refused to wait until even the scheduled departure time for us to get there. Garbage airport, horrible customer service, try to avoid at all costs."
22nd December 2019,2,"""one of the slowest airports""","Not Verified |  Our flight got in on time, around 10.00 pm, but then we waited almost 1.5 hours for luggage to even start appearing on the luggage carousel. Charlotte is one of the slowest airports I have ever been to. I don't know what the problem was. We were the only plane that landed at that time. If I didn't live near Charlotte, I would not use this airport."
18th November 2019,2,"""agents are rude""","Not Verified |  Unfortunately the previous reviews are correct. The agents are rude, my flight was delayed 3 times, and changed gates twice for the same flight. Truly the worst flying experience, I've had. Please someone fix CLT. I was warned by frequent fliers. They were right."
25th October 2019,1,"""Avoid CLT at all costs""","Not Verified |  Easily the worst airport I have ever been to in United States. My incoming AA flight from LHR was forced to wait for the gate to be ready once we arrived, and then once at the gate, we had to wait again to de-plane because Customs (Immigration/CPB) was backed up. Once we reached customs, it took over an hour to get through due to long lines and literally one CPB Officer processing inbound US Citizens. Once we were past Baggage Claim and Baggage Re-Check, the transfer from Concourse D to Concourse E took a ridiculous amount of time as the ""Moving Sidewalks"" were non-oprational. Once we finanlly arrived in Concourse E, the food and drink options were horrible (Burger King and Panda Express? Seriously?) Then our connecting flight was delayed due to late arrival of inbound flight, again because of poor Ground Operations. Finally, once we boarded, we were delayed again due to taxiway congestion. This is the most poorly managed airport I have ever traveled through and I will never book another flight through this airport. The levels of mismanagement were far worse than even bad Third World airports. Avoid CLT at all costs. You're welcome."
21st October 2019,1,"""worst airport I have been to""","✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airport I have been to. They are cramming too much traffic into a terrible, cramped airport. There are horrible lines for everything (bathrooms, food, rental cars, tsa, ticketing), nowhere near enough seating or food options and the whole place feels like a greyhound station. I will seriously alter my travel plans majorly to avoid ever coming here again. Its bad for the Charlotte economy."
19th October 2019,3,"""the airport offers nothing""","✅ Trip Verified | We have been traveling thru Charlotte for years. Never realized that late night flights, there are no amenities available. Really? Your flight is delayed, your stuck and on top of that the airport offers nothing! No food, no drinks, not even a vending machine? This airport is a poor example of an “international” airport. As with the airlines customer service is literally in the toilet. There needs to be an airport that cares about the folks that pass thru whether it’s a few minutes running to your connection or stranded for hours on end. Step it up, please!"
11th October 2019,3,"""astonishingly ""blah"" airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Charlotte Douglas is the most astonishingly ""blah"" airport that ever existed. The offerings of shops and restaurants are ""blah,"" with no discernible North Carolina-specific flair. The layout and architecture of the terminal I was in was ""blah,"" due to white and beige everything, low ceilings, and construction zones abounding. The carpeting and the seats were more ""blah"" than those found in a doctor's office, only far dirtier and more heavily used and aged. The ticketing gate agents were ""blah""; no one remotely rude but no one particularly smiley. The WiFi sucks. North Carolina itself is far from ""blah""; maybe its flagship airport shouldn't be!"
29th September 2019,1,"""Customs is a mess""","Not Verified | Customs is a mess. Over an hour already. Thousands of people, 20 kiosks - a real mess and embarrassing experience. Won’t fly American again. Fun watching crews and global passengers laugh at the zoo."
22nd September 2019,7,"""an excellent place to enter the United States""","✅ Trip Verified | Charlotte is an excellent place to enter the United States, if you have a choice. The customs area is very compact, and it's a short walk from the gates to the passport checkpoint. With Global Entry and a Carry-On bag, I went from jetway through the entire process and through security back into the passenger terminal in 20 minutes. I don't think there's any other major hub where that's doable. The rest of the airport is decent. On the plus side, it's a decent size - not as massive as Atlanta, but big enough to be able to stretch your legs if you have time to kill. There's also a good selection of food and drink at the airport, though prices are high. On the other hand, American schedules a lot of short connections through the airport, so you may not have time to enjoy the amenities. And note that a lot of the gate areas are under construction, and they can get very crowded, so be prepared to stand for awhile. Overall, I much prefer Charlotte to Atlanta and a lot of the other hubs. But it's not quite elite yet."
27th August 2019,1,"""Worst signage""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst signage, staff, rideshare pickup and generally the poorest airport you can imagine. Luggage took 30 mins to get. Bathrooms not clearly marked. Someone should get fired for allowing this airport to exist in this disorganized form."
1st August 2019,1,"""Absolutely awful experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Our flight to Dublin was cancelled due to mechanical issues, which is completely fine because I’d rather be on a safe flight. However, we waited on the plane for an hour before being told we would be moved to a different plane. Once we walked back into the airport, we were then told that the flight was completely cancelled which lead to a mad dash to the one attendant at the desk to try to change flights. No announcement was ever made about vouchers, where to pick up luggage, etc. We have waited in this line for answers for 3 hours. We tried calling American Airlines representatives who told us just to speak with an attendant in person. Just recently we were told to go collect our luggage near baggage claim. Currently, two of our family members are waiting to receive our luggage from a woman who said “There are only 5 employees pulling bags out, the other 50-100 have already clocked out and gone home.” I would say horrible miscommunication if there had been much communication at all. All that was needed was an overhead announcement stating where to pick up bags, wait in line to rebook flights, will email vouchers, or something to that extent. Absolutely awful experience."
15th July 2019,1,"""worst airport I’ve ever seen""",❎ Not Verified | Easily the worst airport I’ve ever seen! Charlotte is at least 20 years behind other real category x airports. The following is a list of cons because there are no pros to this miserable airports. No Seating accommodations for passengers who are stranded overnight which happens frequently for the slightest amount of rain. Only one bathroom on the entire 2nd-floor ticketing level. One bathroom for thousands of people. They’re so smart they put the smoking section right on the curbside which permeates the entire airport. All of the lines for food or drink are always packed. It’s always hot. They turn off their escalators so you have to climb stairs with your luggage. TSA is incapable of properly staffing their checkpoints which create massive waits! This due to the mistreatment of employees. Extremely narrow walkways in the concourses and again limited restrooms. They built a new concourse in A terminal and didn’t have the presence of mind to put seating for people to eat their food. Always traffic outside due to the dumb physical layout of the airport.
16th June 2019,2,"""needs to be some management improvement""","Not Verified |  There are so many problems with every aspect of this airport. I'm going to list problems with some no-cost or low-cost solutions. 1) Concourses are narrow, so pedestrian traffic is a mess. People are constantly bumping, almost bumping, crossing in front of, and getting behind slow people. Last night, a member of the cleaning crew had parked a rolling garbage bin in the middle of the concourse (E) and was off to the side having a casual conversation with a vendor. This caused many pedestrian issues, in an already stressful environment. Solution: train cleaning crews about traffic in the concourses and how to treat customers better and NOT block their paths. 2) Continual gate change for arrivals, and - what seems like - confusion for the airplane waiting to pull into the appropriate gate. I don't know how much larger airports are so organized, but CLT needs to have systems in place for parking planes quickly at their gates to get people to their connecting flights on time. Last night in Concourse E Gate 17 (6/13/2019), 5 breathless passengers showed up to catch the last flight to Columbia SC that day. The unconcerned gate employee told them the doors were closed, and there was nothing he could do. Their incoming flight had been blocked from their gate for a time, making them late to the Columbia flight and that flight pulled away without them. super simple, cheap solution: have a gate ready for each arriving plane. If a plane has passengers for connections, communicate with their connecting plane's crew to please wait 3-5 minutes for the passengers to arrive. 3) Some of the slide-walks weren't working, and you need that extra boost in speed to reach long distances between connections (see above). Solutions: maintain existing equipment and keep it running. 4) Lots of trash, lots of people working who seemed to not want to be there, and boarding queues crowding the already narrow corridors - there needs to be some management improvement at this airport. All of this makes me feel less safe flying."
4th June 2019,2,"""horrendous walking times""",✅ Trip Verified |  What a disaster. Airport is overcrowded with many rude employees that could care less about the traveling public. Many areas under construction with carpeted areas being difficult for travelers to move their bags. It is clear that the runways and traffic control are stretched which results in numerous cascading delays. Not enough seating - horrendous walking times - surly employees. 
15th May 2019,1,"""the rudest I have met to date""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport ever. I had a layover there coming from Germany. I am traveling with two service dogs. I had to get my luggage (even though it was checked through to SFO). When I got down to luggage claim one of those sniffer dogs they have, a small beagle (could have still been in training and I am not faulting the dog at all) went crazy seeing my dogs. I got yelled at by it's handler over the concourse that I need to pick up my dogs? and what kind of service dogs these were. I responded politely that this is a question she was not allowed to ask and that I felt uncomfortable yelling my disability over the airport. Her rude response was that there were probably just emotional support dogs and needed to be carried by me that for sure they were not service dogs like hers. Well no as your dog is not a service dog! It is a working dog, which is supposed to stay calm under any circumstance. Finally got it all finagled and re-checked my bag when I got to the 2nd very rude and obviously bored customs agent who asked me for the paperwork on my dogs. I hand him all the paperwork with the Aphis paperwork (shot verification) laying on top and hs rudely asks where is the rabies paperwork? Right there under your darn nose. I do not see it. Oh just go through I'll take your word for it. People at this airport are the rudest I have met to date and I have travelled a lot in my past. Rude and belligerent. Never again Charlotte."
2nd May 2019,1,"""It was a horrendous experience""",✅ Trip Verified | Charlotte is my home airport and as a business traveler I don’t have any problems. But I flew in with my 84 year old mother who had requested wheelchair assistance. After waiting over 30 minutes no one ever came. The airline got me a wheelchair but they are not allowed to transport passengers other than to and from the plane. I pushed my mother in a wheelchair while managing 3 bags. It was a horrendous experience. Topped off by over an hour to get the bags. I have to say the services at the airport are highly lacking. The parking personnel are wonderful!
23rd April 2019,1,"""the absolute worst airport""","✅ Trip Verified | I have never been through such a ridiculous international experience in all of the other airports I have flown through. I get off my international flight 20 mins early. Then have to go down and claim my baggage that should just go all of the way through. But no, I have to wait for two other flights that got there after us, before our bags came down. Then had to go re-check my bags, then go through customs for US again, then had to go back through TSA Check in with my carry on again. Then, finally get down to my flight, in which half of the walking escalators are not working to find I've missed my flight. This is the absolute worst airport I've ever been to."
16th April 2019,1,"""walking distance are ridiculous""","Not Verified |  One of the worst AA hubs. Each visit, there are at least 3 to 4 moving walkways and escalators under repair. The walking distance are ridiculous ie from E concourse to B concourse. No shuttles. And certainly encounter broken walkways. Food choices are awful. Get I'll every time I eat here. Most inefficient security of AA hubs. 1 TSA precheck open on a Monday morning with no less than 30 minute wait. Staff is rude. At another check point asked if i could leave shoes on since TSA pre and was rudely told this is not a TSA checkpoint. Every major airport in the US allows for shoes to stay on (but electronics out) and allow walk through scanner when boarding pass marked. Not the inefficient rude people in Charlotte. Horribly under seated in their waiting areas. Never enough seats. Wall to wall standing people in aisles and halls. This airport should not be a hub. They have no concept of efficiency or courtesy! I avoid them like the plague but sometimes have no choice."
25th January 2019,1,"""avoid at all costs""","✅ Trip Verified | The most garbage airport I've ever been in. Flew in from SFO one of the busiest in the country and these goons here were delayed on my landing (30 mins), theres no seating, food service were rude, TSA were rude, no transit for their gigantic airport, outlets to plug in phone run at such a low voltage you cant fast charge your phone, they somehow didnt have room for everyone to bring their carry on luggage on the plane (how is that a thing?) And my flight was delayed over an hour and a half. Beer was $10.71 (more than SF?). People running everywhere absolute chaos. Dirty and construction everywhere. I will never travel to this dump site again, avoid at all costs, pay more if you have to, warn your friends and family"
24th January 2019,2,"""delayed 90% of the time""","Not Verified | In October I wrote a review on Charlotte's complete incapacity in routing aircraft on the ground. I switched back to Delta. And they left me in Atlanta 3 weeks in a row on a Friday night so I gave up on them. So I went back to American where I was executive platinum but I had a strategy I would avoid the airport closest to my house (Charlotte) since they are delayed 90% of the time. Alas schedules get changed and unlike Delta, American will put you on another flight and invariably those go through Charlotte in the east coast. So I am departing on my 3rd flight via Charlotte this month. And it is delayed 1 hour. My other two were delayed 30 and 45 minutes. In all 3 cases the planes landed ahead of schedule and sat in the taxiway for 45, 35, and 37 minutes. I am baffled. No other airport I visit (85 in the last 12 months) has this issue. Maybe they don’t care like Delta for their diamonds or maybe they really are incompetent. But I would think there is a public safety risk if they are this incompetent. Should the FAA investigate? I don’t know but what I do know is I will do everything I can to go through DFW to avoid the inevitable missed flight yet again since Delta is no longer an option because they disdain their frequent flyers."
20th January 2019,2,"""Invest in one""","Not Verified |  It’s called a train/tram/dart/whatever you want to call it! Invest in one! Fast moving walkways can only get you places so fast. Every big airport like this one should have some kind of faster transit system. This isn’t cutting it. No sitting in terminal, especially when 9 are crammed into one tiny corner."
18th December 2018,2,"""no real variety in food options""","This airport has a couple of chains and some stuff that looks local, but overall no real variety in food options. I was hoping to grab a bottle of water and some gum during my layover, so I stopped by one of those convenience stores, only to find out that a small water was $4.50 and a pack of gum was $3. I know airports are always a little more expensive but that’s excessive. I saw the same bottle of water in another terminal for $1.75, if that gives you an idea of how ridiculous these prices are. There’s also very little shopping that appealed to me, and if there’s a duty free store I must have missed it. Definitely going to avoid ever coming to this airport again. At least some gates have a lot of outlets (not all, of course!)."
1st December 2018,3,"""Always construction going on""",Just advice to travellers. From the time you land until the time your plane actually gets to a gate and you are able to deplane is usually a minimum of 30-40 minutes. Time from boarding till wheels are up also averages about the same. Arrange connections accordingly. To get to the regional terminal from others is like a mile walk in the airport. They dont have shuttles between gates and way more traffic than the airport was designed for. Always construction going on.
27th November 2018,2,"""unfriendly and difficult TSA""",Not Verified | Absolutely the most unfriendly and unnecessarily difficult TSA experience of any airport I have traveled. I travel several times per year and especially dislike Charlotte.
15th November 2018,1,"""uncalled for and unacceptable""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been in several airports across the US and the Caribbean. I have never been in an airport that is so stressful upon arrival and departure. You have some of the meanest employees working outside. Travelers want to get loaded up and get in/out as fast as possible but they are rushed beyond a reasonable amount. Travelers were screamed at, berated, and essentially threatened by the staff outside. It's embarrassing to say that's my hometown airport. I can't imagine ever having that experience anywhere else and ever going back. It's uncalled for and unacceptable. Not to mention the fact that there isn't enough seating at the gates. We were forced to check a carryon at the entrance of the plane because ""they were out of room"". Then once we arrived at the baggage claim to get the bag we didn't want to have checked to begin with, we waited another 30 minutes on it to arrive! Then you go outside and continuously get screamed at to move to a certain location and they basically don't want any cars to stop. Almost as if they want you to load up with the car still moving and then get out as quickly as possible. It's just absurd. I wish I had video recorded the experience and had action 9 on it. No-one deserves to be treated that way especially paying customers!"
29th October 2018,3,"""Very crowded""","Not Verified |  Very crowded, slow walk to dreaded regional E gate. Slow taxi and open door even after kind crew acknowledging our lateness and the challenge to make connections. Will make my connection this time but missed it last time and one time before that. Love American but seriously considering Delta through Atlanta for future flights if Charlotte does not improve."
16th October 2018,1,"""terminals dirty and disgusting""","✅ Trip Verified | This is absolutely the worst airport I have ever experienced. The terminals are dirty and disgusting. Flights are habitually overbooked, there isn’t enough seating for passengers in the gate areas, and they don’t have the infrastructure to handle the amount of flights they are trying to handle. Today my flight was delayed because there was a random fuel truck blocking the gate. I generally try to avoid this airport at all costs, but sometimes its inevitable that I get stuck here. CLT please fix these issues."
6th October 2018,3,"""a complete disaster""","Not Verified |  So I like American Airlines, they have new planes and treat their frequent flyers really well. I have been the highest status on United, Delta and American in the past five years and am currently highest on Delta and American. Needless to say I travel a lot. I will book about 250000 miles this year. Mostly domestic wth 10 international trips. I will go to 80 airports a year in average. Sadly Charlotte is the closest airport to my home and is the worst airport I travel through (yes, this includes JFK and CDG). The worst part is the staff are genuinely nice and really try hard but the airport operations are a complete disaster. I have gone through Charlotte 31 times this year and have averaged a 35 minute taxi time. I have missed 14 flights this year trying to go through Charlotte. I have driven home 11 times (I am 80 miles away). Yes, there is perpetual. construction but LaGuardia is much worse there. It is simply they don’t know how to route planes on the ground. I am literally typing this as I am taxiing (45 minutes so far). I am baffled that LaGuardia and JFK figured out how to move aircraft in the ground but Charlotte can’t. Maybe the air traffic team at Charlotte should benchmark any other airport in the world (I mean this literally) to understand how to move aircraft on the ground. This task is clearly beyond their comprehension. This is frankly confusing in the home of Nascar! It is a shame too because the services on the airport are actually pretty good. Yes, if you have a regional you have to do the march across the world to the E but people are genuinely friendly as you walk so it isn’t that bad. So Charlotte. Figure out how to move airplanes on the ground and you could actually be a good airport. But until you do you are not worth the hassle. I will go through Atlanta (bet you never thought you would hear that huh)."
6th September 2018,1,"""i""ncompetence is staggering","✅ Trip Verified |  Based on others' reviews, it is evident that the CLT site is fairly consistent in poor service, missed connections, and overall negative experiences. Our flight was delayed due to the President's visit and inclement weather. When we finally reached our gate after sitting on the tarmac for over an hour, we were delayed further due to a lack of staffing to park our aircraft. Once deplaned, we raced to our connection only to find the flight had closed (well outside of the 10-min window of departure time). The excuse provided for the lack of staffing at our arrival gate: lightning and staff safety. Yet, staff were evidently not in any danger to guide our departing flight out of the gate, a fact we found quite interesting. Many customers were left stranded and when trying to rebook flights, the responses from AA workers ranged from eye rolls to terse replies. Never did any employee of the airline or the airport acknowledge what every passenger was feeling. A simple, ""We understand you are upset and we are doing what we can to make the rest of your trip as pleasant as possible."" As we stood in a customer service line, one airline employee passed out customer service number tickets. When asked by several passengers where our luggage might be, she replied, ""Whatever flight you were supposed to be on, that's where your luggage is."" Many people informed her that our connections had already left before we arrived. Yet, she stuck with her (obviously incorrect) statement of next-flight luggage transport, absolutely clueless. We were able to rebook on a flight the next day (2 p.m.) but needed to find something earlier for work obligations. At 11:50 p.m. we left the main concourse, past the TSA area, and headed to the main ticketing counter. Unbeknownst to us (and hundreds others), TSA closes their gates at midnight. No signage, no verbal notice, no nothing. We were locked out of any food, beverages, seating, carpeting, etc. until the airport reopened at 4:30 a.m. We found a quiet place to sit (on the floor, with a locked door next to us) and charge our devices near the baggage carousel. Not long after settling in, an airport employee saunters up and says, ""You gone hafta move from that do'."" As we gather our things to move, the employee then says, ""I don't know why you so upset. You know you can't sit in front of that do'."" Our response: ""Because this airport is horrible."" His response: ""Ain't nobody tole you to come heah."" And this was the basic attitude of every single employee we encountered from our arrival until our eventual departure. We did attempt to make a purchase at the Starbucks at the ticket counter. True to CLT form, the oven was broken and they had run out of the one thing I cared to order. And passengers were due to arrive in less than 4 hours. To be served what remained to be seen. If the presence of a high-profile official and a brief storm delay can render this airport all but useless, an actual emergency will bring the entire city to its knees. There is clearly no plan to address the lack of airport personnel, availability of rental cars, hotel rooms, etc. and neither American Airlines nor the CLT airport gave any effort whatsoever to aid passengers in navigating such a challenging experience. I am committed to avoiding CLT at all costs. The level of incompetence is staggering. Since the airport is owned and operated by the City of Charlotte, I can only imagine what disasters occur throughout the city on a daily basis."
29th August 2018,3,"""airport is by far the worst""
","Not Verified |  Out of all my travels (and I fly quite frequently,) this airport is by far the worst. Plan to spend more time on the tarmac than in the air, and if waiting, you will be seated in an unclean area, and surely sweating profusely. Tight connection? Plan to miss. Terrible design in this airport, and there is always construction inside and out, with no real progress. Avoid at all costs."
27th August 2018,1,"""Horrible place and people""","✅ Trip Verified | I have traveled all over the world and have never encountered a bigger bunch of rude and overall unwelcoming employees in this airport. Absolutely no exception. Horrible place and people. If there is any possibility of flying somewhere else, do it. Avoid this place like the plague. There are no redeeming qualities to be found here. It doesn't matter where you go in this airport you will be treated like dirt. Service is a complete foriegn language here folks."
27th July 2018,1,"""the service was horrible""","Not Verified |  We travelled from NYC to Charlotte and our flight was cancelled from Charlotte to TriCities airport due to weather. The staff were not prepared to handle the number of stranded customers and the service was horrible. Also, there were no rental cars available and the car rental staff were rude and of no help. We decided to call a friend and stay in Gastonia, NC which is 20 minutes from the airport and we rented a car outside of the airport in Gastonia and drove 3 hours the next day home to Johnson City in order to attend a funeral. The airlines (American) cancelled all flights and American nor the Charlotte airport staff could handle the influx of customers. My main concern for Charlotte is to prepare your staff for a disaster and how to handle a crisis when there is an influx of people in your airport. I would expect that your facility has a disaster plan and if this is your disaster plan, it needs to be revamped so that you can meet the customer needs. Very concerned on how this went down!"
25th July 2018,2,"""the worst baggage claim system""",Not Verified |  Charlotte airport has the worst baggage claim system I have ever seen. I live in Charlotte therefore I have to use this airport all of the time. It always take 45 minutes to an hour for bags to arrive. I have used the airport approximately 7-8 times in the past year and there is always an insane delay with the luggage. The area for pickup is way too small and the people running it never stop blowing their whistles so no one has any clue what or where to go. Terrible experience every time but I don’t have another option. Unacceptable and really needs some changes.
23rd June 2018,1,"""Nobody was helpful""","Not Verified |  I had the absolute worst experience in my life traveling through Charlotte. I'm not sure if it was American Airlines or just the lack of organization by the airport. We landed with a 90 minute layover from Cancun. Lightening was spotted so we were told we had to wait before they could let anyone off of our first plane. We missed our connecting flight somehow even though we made it to the gate before departure time. Nobody was helpful or seemed to care that we were upset and lost on what to do next. They said we had to stay in a room until the next morning and that's all there was to it. No ""I'm sorry"" or anything of the sort. Our luggage was supposedly sent to Indy without us, but when we got to Indy 7 hours later to pick it up, it was nowhere to be found. Our luggage was left in Charlotte last year as well. We will avoid this airport at all costs from this point forward."
20th May 2018,1,"""the least organized airport""
","❌ Not Verified |  Now to start my company and myself are not rude or impatient. We are quite empathetic and understanding. That being said this is the least organized airport I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. We flew in from Jamaica for a connecting flight. First we were forced to stay on the airplane for an extra 35 minutes because customs was clogged. Mind you we already had a terrible flight experience with American Airlines. Upon entering customs we observe chaos. Different TSA employees are yelling at hundreds of customers to “direct” us all. After finally getting through customs we are yelled at to get our bags, fine. At the third threshold however three more TSA agents start giving everyone three different varieties of wrong directions. We end up missing our connecting flight and at the wrong area completely. More employees continue to curtly tell us we are all in the wrong area (although we had been yelled at to do so) and that we are SOL. We and another hundred customers then waited an additional 40 minutes to recheck in and get new flights. We did not come across one decent treating polite employee during this entire experience. I wish my job allowed me to be rude and discourteous to good paying customers. I have flown my entire life, I disliked this experience more than O’Hare and will be avoiding this airport at all costs."
23rd March 2018,1,"""TSA were overly aggressive""","❎ Not Verified |  Me, my mother's boyfriend and my mother were traveling and had to take multiple flights to get home, Charlotte was the last. The TSA harassed me and my mother's boyfriend randomly checking us and never really explaining at all. My mother's boyfriend has metal knees and it took them a good half hour to realize that's not a problem. The TSA were overly aggressive when talking to us and just told us to go away after the check was done. Then later when we check our bags we find that they checked our luggage too. If I ever fly again I am definitely not visiting Charlotte Airport."
10th March 2018,3,"""Both times our luggage has been soaked""",✅ Trip Verified | This is the second time that we have flown from this airport and had our bags soaking wet on the other end of the flight. Both times our luggage has been soaked through on all sides of the bags and we could wring water out of our clothes. We had to take them to a laundromat this time to dry them out so we could wear them. Never have we experienced this at any other airport and to have it happen twice now at the same one is extremely odd. It was like someone just dropped them into a huge deep puddle of water and let them sit there for an hour.
10th February 2018,1,"""it is complete chaos""","✅ Trip Verified | I understand and I was able to see that the airport is being refurbished, however it is complete chaos. No signs, everybody is running confused from one side to the other side. There are no staff to guide or assists travelers. Very poor and few options to eat something and most of them are crowded. My conclusion is that if I could avoid this airport I would definitely do so."
24th January 2018,2,"""a ridiculous delay""","✅ Trip Verified | This was my first time using the Charlotte Airport, and I hope it will be the last. I was arriving on an American flight that was more than an hour late. When we touched down in Charlotte it seemed like there might just be time for me to make my connecting flight. However, after taxiing a few minutes, we came to a stop near the terminal and then sat there without moving for a solid hour. The pilot apparently couldn't tell us anything beyond ""there's a traffic jam"", which was not exactly helpful. There were lots of gates open, including the one I watched my connecting flight leave, so I can't really believe there was a valid reason for such a ridiculous delay."
5th January 2018,10,"""plenty of signs and helpful employees""","❎ Not Verified |  I have flown in and out of CLT several times in the last 18 months and I have had a great experience every time. Although there has been construction going on at the airport for at least the last 18 months, it has not been an issue. There are plenty of signs and helpful employees to direct flyers where to go. I am especially impressed that there are workers and signs in the long term parking lots that direct drivers where to find parking spots. This was especially critical during the busy time before and after Christmas. And I have never waited more than a few minutes for the shuttle bus to pick up in the parking lot or in arrivals. Previously I have flown in and out of Chicago Ohare, ORD, and CLT is so much easier to move through than ORD, which is massive in comparison. I also find that airport staff will treat you well if you treat them well."
5th December 2017,2,"""security lines insanely long""","❎ Not Verified | This airport is a complete fiasco. I have lived in Charlotte all my life and I am very familiar with the airport, but with all the construction going on at CLT there have been more issues I have encountered, mostly associated with parking, but this was probably was the worst out of all of them. I was flying American Airlines from Charlotte to Pittsburgh to see friends and normally I use Park N' Go but this time I decided I'd park in the Daily Decks since it was closer to the terminal I was only going for 3 days, I always avoid the Long Term lots since those lots are a zoo and they have been that way forever. When I parked the first shuttle was full so I waited almost 20 minutes for another one to come and when it came the driver offered no help to anyone with large suitcases. In the airport the line at check in was ridiculous, the agents were taking their sweet time checking people in, American app was not working so I couldn't check in with it. Check-in took about 25 minutes, security lines were insanely long and I finally ended up going to the E checkpoint even though my flight was at Concourse C since it was the least of all of evils but even then TSA still took almost an hour. TSA Staff were all very rude and were barking orders at people military style, I put my laptop in the plastic bin with my wallet, phone, and shoes like I have countless times before without a problem and the TSA agent barked at me claiming I wasn't following directions and that my laptop had to go in it's own container, I looked on TSA.gov and nowhere does it say that's required, all it says is you have to remove the laptop from your carry on, which I did. Of course since I knew they were just doing their job I didn't argue. I go through the scanner and wait for my bags and I couldn't find my backpack, I ask one of the agents and she flat out ignored me and said I was asking the wrong person. I finally saw them staring at my bag on the screen and I stood there until finally after 15 minutes an agent asked ""is this your bag"" and I said yes. As it turned out a set of souvenir coins that had formed a clump in my backpack apparently looked weird but when I asked if I could just take it out and show them what it was they yelled at me saying I wasn't allowed to touch the bag and I'd be denied boarding if I did. Nobody was willing to help, they were treating all the passengers like dogs, even children and the elderly, it was just appalling. There's a large amount of restaurants and retail outlets at CLT but once you're at the gate the seating areas are cramped and there is very limited seating. The concourses have hardly changed at all since the late 90s. Some of the gates in Concourse E still use ancient dot matrix printers. After the TSA incident I just barely made my flight by 15 minutes even though I arrived at the airport almost 2 hours prior, gate agent was the only nice person I encountered at the airport, she probably heard of the all the TSA problems from other passengers because when she scanned my ticket she said ""don't worry I wouldn't have closed the door on you"" she said there were 12 people on the flight still stuck in the TSA lines. Given this is my home airport it is embarrassing to see that they treat customers like this."
14th November 2017,3,"""very limited restroom facilities""","✅ Verified Review |  I fly through Charlotte for work many times. It’s almost a guarantee that my flight out of this airport will be delayed. Despite the size of this airport, there are very limited restroom facilities, and the restroom stalls have humongous gaps between the doors and walls. WiFi is spotty at best. If you can fly through another airport, do yourself a favor and do it."
6th November 2017,2,"""disorganized and packed""","❎ Unverified |  Charlotte Douglas Airport Arrival experience — pathetic. I travel frequently both domestically and internationally, Charlotte is the worst experience in the last two years! 1) Waited for 1 hour 23 minutes for a single bag to be delivered to Carousel E, but finally it appeared on Carousel D. When asking the baggage staff if such delays were normal, they said, “Oh yeah, It takes an hour to an hour and a half to get luggage on E"". This was a domestic flight. Baggage staff stated that management is aware of this disfunction and has done nothing — unbelievable! 2) Traffic pattern/management horrendous — one half hour to go less than a mile from parking to pick-up. 3) The parking shuttle is a “cattle call” and is disorganized and packed."
11th October 2017,1,"""stressful and degrading""","✅ Verified Review |  We were returning from Mexico and going through security was terrible! The employees were rude and yelling. I have never been treated this badly in any other airport. We were traveling with our daughter; she tried to wait for us during the procedure because we had never been in this airport. We did not know our way around. They yelled at her to keep moving even though she was not in anyone's way. She moved to the side to wait for us but they yelled at her and would not allow it. None of the employees were helpful, they were too busy been rude. The whole experience was stressful and degrading!"
10th October 2017,1,"""rude, smart mouthed employees""","❎ Unverified | Charlotte is one of the rudest airports I have ever been in. I fly several times per year and have been in multiple airports across the US and internationally. Security and customs bark and yell at people and treat us all like prisoners. I have never seen such rude, smart mouthed employees! People asking simple questions getting yelled at. I flew through this airport twice in one month and both times it was like this. They also confiscated $70 worth of liquor that was purchased duty free in an airport and packaged according to TSA guidelines! When I asked what was wrong, I was yelled at and told not to question. At that point I was almost late for my flight and just had to go. We usually have connecting flights through Atlanta and have brought back the same liquor multiple times. I will do whatever it takes not to ever have my connecting flight in this airport again."
17th September 2017,1,"""not enough seating and dirty bathrooms""","✅ Verified Review |  This airport is always like a zoo with far too many people, not enough seating and dirty bathrooms. American Airlines is to blame for getting all these people in the same place at the same time without adequate facilities. This is probably a safety hazard. DFW feels open and easy to navigate and so are many other airports. Avoid CLT!"
9th September 2017,3,"""I've never been so poorly treated in my life""","❎ Unverified |  I have arrived at this airport twice in a span of a few months and while I had hoped my experience was a 'one-time thing' or just a bad day, I'm sorry to say that was not the case. I have not flown a lot in my life but when I do I usually have 18+ hour journeys. As a citizen of the United States, it is nice to come back after a few years. Well, after an eight hour flight over the ocean, the first thing you are met with is passport control. I have to say that the TSA, guards and police who work there are some of the most unhappy, unhelpful, and rude people I have ever had the mispleasure of interacting with. There were many lines and unclear, sometimes conflicting instructions. We were met with a man who did nothing but treat everyone like an animal, yelling and being rude to people who were confused. Even after the handful of times I have flown, flying and airports are still daunting and I feel sorry for the people who are first time flyers or tourists who will be met with this the first time they are in the country. In May, when I arrived with my boyfriend from a European country, we were met with hostility. When attempting to go through the line, they asked if we were family, if we were from the same household, which we were. The woman simply barked at us that we were indeed not together or family before we could even say anything. She then told her colleague to not help us because we were trying to get through the line faster. We were separated, he needed to be pulled to another line and I was forced to wait at least an hour on the other side. Needless to say we missed our next flight. I've never been so poorly treated in my life. These people should be ashamed of themselves. I understand they have an important job to do but there is no excuse for being so hateful and so rude to people, most of which are confused or afraid. We were almost in tears by the time the process was over. This airport was a stark contrast to the previous in London which was quick, painless and effective. Charlotte Douglas is anything but. On a brighter note, after we got through security, we talked to a woman to rebook our flight and she was very nice and very helpful. The security process is so long, so uncomfortable and the people are so rude I couldn't possibly recommend this place. I hope I never have to arrive in that airport again. Nothing says welcome to the USA like a bunch of angry people screaming at you and treating you like yesterday's trash."
12th August 2017,3,"""avoid this airport""","❎ Unverified | On August 10, 2017, we arrived at Charlotte airport on a flight from Rome, Italy. We had a 2.5-hour layover for a connecting flight to New Orleans. We have made round trips from the US to Italy for 35 years, and we have never had such a long delay in passing through US Immigration. There were at least 500 people in line, and there were only 7 agents checking passports. There were about 20 passport kiosks for do-it-yourself scan of passport, finger prints, etc. After about an hour, we made it to the Kiosk; then about another 45 minutes to the agent who repeated the same procedure himself that we had already done at the kiosk. The process couldn't have been more confusing and when I finally said something to an airport courtesy worker, she said ""we make no promises"". We barely made our connecting flight. They were closing the door. Many in line were for more than one hour after their connecting flights were due to depart. In short, avoid this airport until changes are made. It is a beautiful facility with worse than poor management and organization in the Passport Control area."
4th August 2017,1,"""service was pitiful""",❎ Unverified | The service at Charlotte airport was pitiful. We arrived from Punta Cana and had a connecting flight to Oregon. We had 3 hours of lay over which you'd think is enough but with the incapacity of the passport control we missed our flight. I can assure you I will never travel through to this airport again.
30th July 2017,3,"""has always been a tough place to get around""","✅ Verified Review |  Charlotte airport has always been a tough place to get around. You generally always have to go from one end of one terminal to the end of another. Handicapped individuals used to reliably depend on the Club Car to pick them up and take them to their destination. You sat in a designated spot and they would pick you up. However, now probably for some politically correct reason, the Club Cars no longer run. They have been replaced by men and women who will push you in a chair to where you are going. However, the sit and wait in the designated chairs no longer works. I sat for 25 minutes and watched empty chair after empty chair walk by me. Some looked at me, but just walked on by. If the airport was bad before [high priced restaurants and ling distances to walk with intermittent functioning if the skywalks] it is now even crueler."
29th July 2017,1,"""everything is horribly delayed""",❎ Unverified |  Avoid this airport at all costs. Every time I come here it is an absolute nightmare. They can never get gates right and everything is horribly delayed. It looks like the Olympics are taking place because everyone is running around like mad to catch gates since everything is late. Will try my best to never come through this airport again.
14th July 2017,1,"""airport has gone downhill fast""","✅ Verified Review | Charlotte airport has gone downhill fast. I understand they are growing but it is an absolute nightmare to navigate. Every concourse is overcrowded. The air rarely works well. Bathrooms are disgusting and feel like you're in an old gym locker room. Staff are the most discourteous I've experienced and I'm in airports every week. I've been knocked over, pushed, and had my bag knocked off of my arm multiple times trying to get to my gate. It's everything everyone dreads about travel these days."
12th July 2017,1,"""doesn't appear to have been planned""","❎ Unverified |  So far I have used 20 airports on 2 continents and Charlotte is the absolute worst. It doesn't appear to have been planned but seems to have grown randomly like a snake firework from the 4th of July. You have to be in pretty good shape to comfortably hike from one point to another with your carry-on, personal item and whatever else in tow. The whole thing should be razed and rebuilt."
1st July 2017,1,"""a lack of available seating""","✅ Verified Review | I have connected several times at Charlotte Airport in 2017. At least in Terminals B and E, there is a lack of available seating coupled with a lack of places to charge electronic devices/work while waiting for your next flight. At 9 am, I am currently sitting on the floor between terminals. The bathrooms are also showing their age and the smells are not inviting. The bathroom attendant helps but the problems in the bathrooms go much deeper than an attendant can solve. The carpets in the terminal should be ripped up and replaced with tile or a hard surface. For a city with so many affluent bankers, this airport is not measuring up."
28th May 2017,1,"""held on the plane for 35 minutes""","Flying in we were delayed due to a line of planes trying to get to a gate. When I returned on an international flight, we were held on the plane for 35 minutes because the customs hall was backed up and the fire Marshalls would not let any more people in. This is the second time this has happened to me and the last time we missed our connecting flight. This is only going to get worse as they are building more gates to allow more planes to land and doing nothing that will increase capacity of the immigration hall. I don't care how many rocking chairs they have or places to eat or shop, just get me to my gate without a major hassle, I've flown internationally through a dozen airports and this is the worst!"
10th May 2017,3,"""had the worst experience with TSA""",✅ Verified Review |  The airport itself is fine but I had the worst experience with TSA. They were all rude and not helpful at all. I was traveling with a toddler and had no idea how I was supposed to go through security with her. When I asked several different TSA workers they were very rude.    
30th April 2017,1,"""the wheelchair was not there""","✅ Verified Review |  I requested medical equipment because I have a brace on My leg. When I landed, the wheelchair was not there and waiting. I waited for a good 15 minutes for the person that was supposed to get me with the chair and get me to my next gate to board the next flight. I attempted to exit the plane not being able to bend my leg, hobbled to the door in the rain to finally get the help! When the person got me to my gate he said Sorry, you missed the flight. I got an apology and was told that they apologized for being short staffed and received a discount voucher for a hotel, I asked for management and again was told about them being short staffed. By the time I got shuttled to the room I should have already been with my son in Kansas. I missed a night with him, had to pay for a room because of them being ""short staffed"" and was placed outside in the wheelchair in the freezing cold and rain! I was told that I needed to be outside so I didn't miss my shuttle! 45 minutes is how long it took! By the time I reached the room, my luggage was soaked, I hobbled to a vending machine because I was starving, showered, and got to sleep at 2am I had to be back up at 5, take a shuttle at 5.30, and be back at the airport by six. In fear of being short staffed again although the plane was scheduled to depart at 7.30am. Have sent 2 strongly worded complaints to the Airport and if I had a choice, I would rent a car, with my bad leg, and drive the 15 hour trip back home!"
13th March 2017,2,"""will not be flying out of Charlotte again""","Buyer beware: the airport's website will assure you that there is always ample parking for every flight, but when we arrived at the airport on the morning of our flight, every long-term lot was closed for construction. The daily parking lot was full as a result, leaving only ""business valet"" or hourly parking at a significantly higher cost. When we contacted the airport later to complain, they informed us that they were not responsible for our extra expenses because it was ""our choice"" to park or not - as though it was a valid option to miss our flight and sacrifice thousands of dollars in airfare. I will not be flying out of Charlotte again."
13th February 2017,5,"""airport is always extremely crowded""",✅ Verified Review |  I used to like this airport but I don't any longer. Some of the problems are not exactly with the airport itself. Traffic from where I live to and from the airport is bad almost all the time. Being a hub airport this airport is always extremely crowded and I found that the wifi in the airport the worst I have seen. There is also a lack of places to plug in electronic devices.  
2nd January 2017,2,"""the staff are absolutely awful""","✅ Verified Review |    Honestly, I fly out of CLT very often, as it is frequently the airport where I am forced to take my connecting flight. I say forced, because the staff are absolutely awful. The food service and cleaning personnel are the kindest people I have met, however the check in attendants are the most entitled staff I have ever dealt with. Each and every time I go here (4 times in the past 2 months), the customer service provided is absolutely awful, not taking the customer into consideration whatsoever. I was asked to check my bag, and when I questioned why (as the bag could clearly fit beneath the seat in front of me), the man says to me ""because she said so."" And had no sort of explanation to follow. Of course when I finally boarded there was enough room for my bag in more than a few overhead bins. I do not recommend this airport at all. The only reason I do is for the kindness I have received from every food service or cleaning crew member, once I thought I lost my phone in the bathroom and the woman in there cleaning was so willing and so kind enough to help me find it. I think this airport's staff need an update on how important customer service is to any business."
1st January 2017,1,"""poorly run and extremely inefficient""",Multiple TSA agents standing around with no apparent function while 6 agents handled three screening lines funneling through one of two scanners. Poorly run and extremely inefficient. There is much room for improvement with screening process. Airport also under construction.causing more problems.
13th December 2016,6,"""disappointing to see our airport like this""",There were no Christmas lights up. No cheeriness displayed. Construction mess everywhere. When you walk out from baggage area you walk into a cloud of cigarette smoke that hung in the air. After traveling from other airports this was rather disappointing to see our airport like this.
4th August 2016,2,"""40 minutes before my bag was checked""","This is the worst airport I've travelled through. We had a two hour turnaround to arrive from Cancun and catch connecting flight to Dublin. The plane was delayed for 30 minutes between landing and parking. Custom clearance was slow but efficient, as was collecting and putting through baggage. The real delay came at security X-ray scanning. The tray with my bag, sandals and triple sealed duty free bag went through the scanner and was put aside to be checked. Three trays were ahead of mine to be checked. It took 40 minutes before my bag was checked. Obviously staff did not know standard operating procedures regarding sealed duty free bags. There was no assistance, I was just told I had to wait. No manager in charge. The elderly man checking through the bags worked at a snail's pace, and despite my pleas did not ask for other security staff to assist. Absolutely disgraceful. I would have missed my connecting flight, only for my children waited at the departure gate and refused to board. The plane was 25 minute's delayed."
27th July 2016,1,"""seating is incredibly lacking""",Our flight arrived early from Dallas and then the pilot informed us the ground crew were not ready for us. We proceeded to sit on the tarmac for almost 40 minutes and missed our connecting flight to Cincinnati after racing from concourse C to concourse E with no help. Some moving walkways were broken down and could not be used. The agent at the gate then proceeded to rebook us on the next flight but failed to notice we had first class tickets so we had to go back and get that fixed however this new agent was very helpful. We then had to proceed to a new gate even farther out where gates are being shared by multiple flights and seating is incredibly lacking. This airport is a mess and needs a shakedown and complete makeover.
6th July 2016,1,"""cannot control traffic effectively""","Charlotte airport is poorly operated. The disorganization is clearly evident in regards to the high amount of delayed flights, which leads to tension and poor customer service. The tarmac crews cannot control traffic effectively. Our plane sat on the tarmac for 25 minutes waiting for the ground crew to simply clear access to the receiving gate. This tarmac delay caused the plane that arrived on time to force many passengers to miss connections. I hope to never travel through NC again."
18th May 2016,1,"""airport is so poorly run""",The worst organized airport in the US with the rudest staff. Every time I fly into this airport I am hopeful that I will have a good experience but it never happens. Never have I sat on the tarmac upon landing like I do here. Again missing a connection not because the plane was late but because the airport is so poorly run that we sit waiting for a gate for 40 minutes. Only to recieved zero compassion from the staff here and downright rude treatment. I will do everything I can to avoid this airport in the future.
29th February 2016,8,"""new favourite airport""","Probably my new favourite airport. I honestly was not expecting much after the American Airlines flight coming in from London and a 5 hour wait till my connecting flight to New Orleans but the border control was quick, the bags came quickly, the toilets were clean, there was a wide range of restaurants, I would recommend 1987 market. There was plenty of seatings areas, the staff were friendly and the WiFi was very simple and easy to connect to as well as being fast. I would definitly recommend the airport."
22nd February 2016,9,"""courteous and helpful""","I was there for a connecting flight to Rochester NY, when the airport was closed because of heavy snow. The customer service staff at Charlotte were wonderful. They were all courteous and helpful at a time that must have been a nightmare for them."
17th February 2016,2,"""no help was offered""","Never again will I use this airport. On both flights, although they landed on time, we had to wait some 40 minutes before being allowed to park at the gates. Naturally, passengers who had connections missed their flights. No help was offered to them. I am no spring chicken, nevertheless I had to run like crazy to the other end of the airport in a desperate attempt to catch mine, and I was lucky they let me board just before the doors closed for take off. The return travel was even worse. The connecting flight which had supposedly departed when we debarked, had actually been postponed by 2 hours. Then it was advanced by 1 hour, but nobody told us. When I and other people returned at the gate that we had checked beforehand, it was empty and we were told that the advanced flight had just departed - from another gate. And there was no mention of any flight to our final destination on the departures screens. The rest is wacky: the plane had not been adequately fueled, so the advanced flight had not departed after all. We were allowed to run on the tarmac to climb the ladder to the plane, which eventually departed with considerable delay. Charlotte NC airport: never again."
22nd March 2022,2,"""I feel service can be improved""","Not Verified |  So first time in a while that I've been to this airport. I got a little turned around and looked everywhere for someone to help, unfortunately everyone ignored me. Finally I went up to a desk and asked the lady attending the Hawaii desk and asked my question. She treated me rather rudely and cold. Don't usually leave reviews unless I feel service can be improved and I think it should be. Also have an anonymous tip line, it makes it easier."
17th January 2022,2,"""My experience was frustrating""","✅ Trip Verified |  I was dismayed to see that a few years ago, this airport received high ratings. My experience was frustrating. I went through Phoenix in transit. Flights were on time in my case. However I had a hankering for a smoothie since I ate some food brought onto the airplane. Since I had lots of time, I went to every set of gates. You can't even buy a smoothie in this airport. Panera Bread had some on the menu but were all sold out. Every flavor. No wonder! Many restaurants were not even open. I travel a lot, and this airport is now near the bottom.  Covid is no excuse because I have traveled much during the pandemic. A few other things.  The charging stations are all on little block tables that are always very crowded. Some of the outlets are so worn out that your adapter falls out or you have to shake it to connect. But usually you can find one that will work There are no outlets in lounge seats at all. Some signs do not show gates in both directions. Went towards the C-Gates and had to look backwards to see that I had to turn left for C1 to C9. I surmised that because I have airport experience but woe to the person who does not. I know to have very low expectations when coming through here. Hopefully I will not have to use this airport for anything in the near future."
30th November 2021,1,"""the worst international airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  Do not travel through Phoenix Sky Harbor. Long lines, over zealous security having every other bag extra checked, the airport is dirty, they have everyone crammed into a small area and no restaurants are open. Hundreds of international passengers arriving from 10+ hour flights to this pathetic excuse for an airport. Travel through anywhere else. This is the worst international airport I have ever experienced."
28th November 2021,1,"""the worst traveling experience we’ve ever had""","✅ Trip Verified | For the last 3 years, I know there’s a pandemic, Sky Harbor has been the worst traveling experience we’ve ever had. Twice, we have reserved a rental car and showed up to no cars available. We make other arrangements now. The food and service options have taken a nose dive. The ‘we don’t care less feeling' is palpable from people working everywhere throughout food service options, which I might add is almost null. Maybe this is showing businesses that they need to pay people a living wage. We will be making other arrangements so we don’t have to eat in this pathetic excuse for an airport."
25th November 2021,2,"""barely any restaurants open""","Not Verified |  There’s barely any restaurants open, half of gate A they are all closed and the other half of gate A is so packed you have to wait super long for a table which makes no sense. Opposite of covid safe and pretty ridiculous for people who have a long stressful day of traveling. Do better."
15th November 2021,1,"""No restaurants open""","✅ Trip Verified | If you have a red-eye flight or anything from 7pm onwards, you're absolutely screwed on food choices. No restaurants open, no staff to help, and extremely overpriced sandwich/chip options. Since it's silly to eat dinner at 6pm, we wanted to sit at the airport at a bar/restaurant like every other airport in the world, not Phoenix airport. After arriving at 8, everything was closed which is absurd and unheard of in the travel industry. After looking through every single gate for over an hour, we had to settle on a self-serve kiosk. Give a guess how much 2 sandwiches, 2 fruit juice, 1 bag of chips, and some pathetic soggy veggies was? If you guessed anything lower than $47, then you're wrong. Absolute abomination and the management needs to learn how to get a grasp with their pathetic excuse for an airport. Just quit your jobs now and give it to someone that will actually look after the customer. FYI, whilst eating our ""dinner"" there were many other travellers in the same boat desperately looking for food and stressing to find something for their flight. This wasn't just an issue that we experienced ourselves."
9th November 2021,3,"""don’t book a flight through Phoenix""","Not Verified |  Good evening peasants! Please don’t come to Phoenix Sky Harbor after about 8 pm and expect to be treated like a human. I mean, if you are hungry, don’t expect to have an open restaurant or bar. We may allow you to buy some food that is covered in plastic, but for sure no alcohol. You should have planned better. First, you should have booked your flight with a carrier that did not re-route and re-book you. Better yet, don’t book a flight through Phoenix. Even better yet, don’t be such a looser and charter a jet that takes you directly to your destination. Didn’t become a rock star or a movie star as a kid and you worked for a living? Bad planning. Served in the armed forces? Gosh, thanks so much for your service, no human food for you either. It’s just business, I’m sure. Stop whining, we left the lights on! The news stand is open, and they sell candy. How ungrateful. Well, that is what you get when you sell things to peasants. No gratitude."
6th November 2021,2,"""nothing was open""",✅ Trip Verified |  Had a red eye departing 1130pm straight shot to Newark - I got here at 830 to have dinner and a glass of wine in terminal 3 - nothing was open. How disappointing and sad to sit for 2½ hours with no hospitality or libation. Disgraceful
17th October 2021,2,"""the place is full of closed restaurants and bars""",✅ Trip Verified | Saturday afternoon and the place is full of closed restaurants and bars. We had several hours to wait and everything was closed. 
2nd October 2021,1,"""Avoid this airport at all costs""","Not Verified |  This airport is just gross. It is so crowded that you can barely walk. The trash cans are overflowing, there was water all over the bathroom floor, and trash all over the ground. Avoid this airport at all costs.  If you have a layover here and you are considering a different flight- go with the different flight."
13th September 2021,1,"""Wake up Sky Harbor""","✅ Trip Verified | I travel with 3-4 large 70 lb tool boxes for my business. I had to search for a luggage cart as they have been removed. I found one in the corner of the departure lounge. Today when I arrived back to the airport, no luggage carts. I asked a Delta agent where the carts were and I was told the contract with the company that supplied them ended and the new company was supposed to be set up August 1, but has not yet done anything. How are you supposed to carry 4, 70 pound tool boxes to the parking garage. No skycaps, no luggage carts. Whoever runs the airport and makes these decisions without thinking of the inconvenience to passengers who I am sure have had to deal with the same issue is an idiot. I was told by one of the purple help personnel to use a wheelchair. Really. Wake up Sky Harbor. August 1st has come and gone more than 70 days ago."
12th September 2021,1,"""not even McDonald's is open""","Not Verified |  8:00 on a Saturday night and not even McDonald's is open let alone getting a lousy beer. Terrible, Starbucks closed, pizza joint closed - no pizza at 8 o'clock on Saturday night. I will definitely reconsider Phoenix airport next time I go thru here."
3rd September 2021,2,"""most restaurants closed""","Not Verified |  Very limited in dining choices - most restaurants closed. Went to different terminals and only choices are Mexican food or sandwiches. Sat for 15 minutes in one restaurant and finally left since no one even came over. Bought a sandwich and then nowhere to sit and eat . Kept delaying my flight and since the seats are limited unless you want to sit right next to someone, I have been standing for hours while they continually delay the flight. Only outlets are on a counter which has been in use at all times."
28th August 2021,1,"""stores and restaurants are closed at 7pm""","Not Verified |  It is a Friday night, plenty of flights coming in and going out, stores and restaurants are closed at 7pm. Absolutely ridiculous. Can't even get a cup of coffee. Just horrible."
23rd August 2021,2,"""Dining options here are very poor""",Not Verified |  Dining options here are very poor. Lines for what few options exist tend to be very long. I have been to this airport several times and it is always the same. Seating is very limited too. Renting a car is a hassle with the shuttle back and forth and adds another line to wait through before you can leave the airport.
14th August 2021,1,"""airport has the worst layout""",✅ Trip Verified |  This airport has the worst layout. After getting off the plane there was long wait to get luggage. Once received there were No instructions as to how to find rental car company (Sixt) was mine. I had to board a bus to “rental car“ several miles away and even longer due to slow Bus. Once at the rental place there were more lines as everyone gets dumped at one spot. Return was worse as there are NO clear directions to return. once at the right place after car drop off another rotten bus ride to the airport. 2 hrs to return car and get to the airline. English is not the language there either.
13th August 2021,3,"""The floor was dirty""","Not Verified |  Waited in concourse D. The floor was dirty. Looks like it hasn’t been vacuumed in who knows how long. There is trash under the seats and across the floor. There are not enough charging stations/plugs. People park it and refuse to move once they are charged up. Disorganized, I don’t know if it’s due to staffing or the airline (Southwest). Tired and I want to go home. Plus side, they do have a place to take your pet to the restroom."
7th August 2021,10,"""America's friendliest airport, indeed!""","Not Verified |  I arrived and departed in the early morning hours. It was busy but not overcrowded. No long lines and TSA was pleasant enough. Easy to find your way around. America's friendliest airport, indeed!"
27th July 2021,1,"""there are zero luggage carts available""","✅ Trip Verified | There are no luggage carts in Terminal 3 for people with special needs, seniors, people traveling with small children, and international travelers. This was confirmed at the information desk within Terminal 3 that there are zero luggage carts available. With Sky Harbor being an international airport within a large metropolitan city, this is truly disgraceful. My wife arrived last night from abroad with our 2 small children, 3 large suitcases, 3 carry on bags, and a large back pack. I recently had back surgery and could offer no assistance to my spouse with moving luggage due to lifting restrictions. After a 24 hour international trip and consoling our four year old daughter along the route by picking her up, she was already complaining of a sore back when they arrived. After all that, my wife had to make three separate trips lugging large suitcases clear across the airport to the parking garage while I helplessly watched our children. At no time did anyone at the airport volunteer to offer any help or assistance. This is fundamentally wrong, irresponsible, and shows complete lack of planning and foresight by airport management in every possible way. People traveling into and out of Sky Harbor will need to bring along additional hands and resources since the airport is unable to provide the very basic necessities or help all airports, regardless of size should possess."
15th June 2021,1,"""the absolute worst airport I have ever encountered""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the absolute worst airport I have ever encountered. The visit started with TSA when I proceeded to remove my laptop from my backpack due to the fact that I am an avid flyer and understood that was a standard precaution. I got my bag slammed in my face and was told to not touch anything. After this experience we arrived to the terminal at 3:00 expecting for restaurants to be open for dinner, this is a invalid thought as the restaurants decide when they can open and close. The google and/or Apple Maps isn’t even accurate to the time they will close. We arrived at the Panera two minutes after closing and they wouldn’t even serve us, resulting in forcing us to eat at a quick store for a $20 sandwich. Nothing within the airport is connected and the airport TSA/Staff laugh at you when you ask where you can get dinner."
8th June 2021,1,"""worst TSA staff I've ever encountered""","Not Verified |  Absolute worst TSA staff I've ever encountered! They were rude, unhelpful, & down right miserable. After we loaded our bags, shoes, etc onto the security belt we were told to wait in line at the metal detector. However there was nobody over there to assist us and the Closed sign was set up. Meanwhile all our items had gone through and were on the other side unattended. I asked if someone could please assist us so we could get to our luggage and I was told to wait and eventually someone would help us. We continued to wait for approximately 10 more minutes. Meanwhile listening to the TSA officer cuss under his breath. When we finally were let through we grabbed our luggage (which was fortunately all there) we started to leave to get out of the way and was yelled at by the female TSA officer to remove our bins off the belt. I will never come back to this airport!"
8th May 2021,1,"""rudest, most miserable TSA agents""","✅ Trip Verified |  Travel all over the country often airports large and small. PHX by far has the worst, rudest, most miserable TSA agents we have ever encountered! Not just 2 us but everyone around us. I have never seen such behavior it was unreal! The icing on the cake is the rental car/airport shuttle system. Never experienced anything so slow and dysfunctional even at airports twice the size, it is a complete failure"
13th April 2021,3,"""The line for the rental car bus was incredible""",Not Verified |  The line for the rental car bus was incredible. Waited 45 min in line for a bus. No urgency and no attempts to increase number of buses. I don’t understand and I am sure many people will miss their flights.
10th April 2021,3,"""Was quite disappointed with the cleanliness""","✅ Trip Verified | Was quite disappointed with the cleanliness and overall conditions of the gate that we were at. There was hand sanitizer, but none of them worked. The seats had crumbs and dirt all over them. Lastly, the bathrooms were dirty and only half of the containers had soap or towels in them. We had bottles on the floor around our gate. As for the gate, we couldn’t hear the flight attendant telling us about our flight because there was a TV show playing in the speakers above us, when we told them they said there was nothing they could do and just to come closer, there are over 70 people on this aircraft and you want all of us around the gate? So much for the 6 ft social distance rules I guess, but then again the airlines pack us in like sardines so what’s the point of the social distance rule anyways."
28th February 2020,6,"""restaurant choices are limited and very noisy""",Not Verified |  Once you go through security restaurant choices are limited and very noisy. If you have dietary limitations or are vegetarian there are not many offerings. Assistance with immigration was the bright spot. Ladies at Global Entry were excellent.
23rd February 2020,7,"""Consistently frustrating""","Not Verified |  The return baggage system speed is the worst of any airport that I frequent and I fly a lot. Consistently frustrating, I dread having to check a bag."
26th December 2019,3,"""has the slowest baggage claim""",Not Verified |  I fly a lot out of many airports and Sky Harbor has the slowest baggage claim I've ever experienced. It is the best reason I moved away from Phoenix. I always dread the return to visit family.
20th December 2019,8,"""some of the nicest and friendliest people""",Not Verified |  I think the TSA agents at Sky Harbor are some of the nicest and friendliest people I've experienced. The only thing I didn't like about the airport was the extra hour it took to get to the car rentals. All of the volunteers at the airport are super nice.
14th November 2019,2,"""One of the worst designed airports""","✅ Trip Verified | I’ve traveled all over the country and internationally. One of the worst designed airports and even without the design my service experience was terrible. Flight sat on the runway for 30 min. Bags took forever to come out. Had to wait in line for a bus to the car rental place. Car rental place was 15 minutes away. It’s a desert, are you telling me you couldn’t build one closer? How valuable is your sand? Signage was bad at the rental car place. Lines were bad because a bus load of people got there at the same time. Phoenix airport mentions that they will be getting a train connection to the car rental in a couple years. First of all, that means they know they suck even if they want to claim and trademark that they are the friendliest airport. It also doesn’t make the long drive to the rental any better. Instead of a bus now I’m gonna be on a tram. Great job Phoenix. The day service is determined within the first 20 minutes of the experience. Mine was spent on the runway and the remaining hour was spent getting my bags and car. Thanks. I hope my negative word of mouth affects your business like you affected mine. I’ll make sure to let every person I know. Enjoy your terrible NPS."
30th August 2019,10,"""incredibly kind and helpful""","Not Verified |  We recently traveled from Phoenix to Seattle with my son's ashes, I was expecting a hassle going through TSA but the officers were incredibly kind and helpful. I just want to say how thankful I am for the respect given my son's remains."
28th June 2019,8,"""fast and easy for domestic travel""","Not Verified |  Everyone is honestly being far too harsh. Phoenix Sky Harbor is really not bad, the lines are usually short, getting through security is pretty fast, tons of great stores and restaurants open. However, there is basically no international flights which really sucks but LAX is a 1 hour flight away so it’s not really that big of an issue. As for domestic flights, they have one to basically every large city and often. Bathrooms are clean, WiFi is fantastic, not a lot of gate seating though. Basically, it’s not bad at all, fast and easy for domestic travel."
5th June 2019,10,"""polite and helpful service""","✅ Trip Verified |  I encountered polite and helpful service by the employees at checkin and in the restaurants of the Phoenix International Airport. It is an easy airport to navigate. Overall the airport was very clean and I was particularly impressed with the restrooms. The ladies restrooms had plenty of paper towels and toilet tissue, the sinks were freshly cleaned, the mirrors were shiny without marks, the floors were clean and shiny, and each stall was quite large, which I really liked! I was quite impressed with this airport and will gladly recommend it to others."
22nd April 2019,1,"""not the friendliest airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Definitely not the friendliest airport, lots of unfriendly treatment of passengers including: - having to walk, yes walk outside in the heat or cold between two of the terminals, no train, no buses like there used to be, I’ve never seen anything like it. They say there is a golf cart to help transport but I’ve only seen it once in twenty times and it was full. So you just have to walk with your luggage. Good luck. If you land past 9:30pm they close several of the exits in Terminal 4 so you have to walk twice as far just to get out of the terminal, then you have to walk back to baggage claim or your car. They make hundreds and hundreds of passengers walk late at night so they can close two exits and save on one security guard’s wages—not friendly, annoying after a long day of travel. There are 8 gates at the end of the B concourse that are squeezed into the space that one or two gates would be. It’s crazy, people pushing each other, literally lines crossing each other to get onto the plane and no seating, everyone has to stand or sit on the floor. Why crush 8 gates into such a small space? Not friendly. Creates angry passengers. Honestly I’m trying to find what is friendly about PHX."
17th April 2019,1,"""No car rental shuttle buses""","✅ Trip Verified | On arrival last week April 11, I took the earliest flight from DCA getting to Reagan airport at 4:30 AM to arrive at Phoenix at 9:20 AM. No car rental shuttle buses. The line was hundreds of passengers long. Inexcusable. Tonight on my return flight, fearing the car return bus fiasco, I arrived at the airport 5 hours before my flight. At check in the said Gate A 6 An hour later they switched to gate A 20 (another pier). An hour later the sent me back to A 11. Then after that 1.5 hours before departure they switched me to gate B 13. As I passed AA passenger assistance counter in The B Gate pier, one of the two AA employees pulled the ribbon closed in front of me and said “Closed!” At 9:45. I just wanted to ask her if they were going to change us again. She stepped out passed the ribbon she closed and pointed 100 feet back up the B gate pier for me to go look at the overhead flight boards. Never an apology. And for this so am paying for First Class. A decent company would offer a refund. The airport food service facilities are wholly inadequate with passengers waiting in long lines to be seated. (Half hour wait at an airport)"
21st March 2019,3,"""consistently bad service""
",✅ Trip Verified | Disabled. Waited almost an hour for someone to push wheelchair from counter to gate. No pusher available at boarding so I had to hobble down the jetway. Fly every week out of PHX. Pretty consistently bad service for disabled travellers.
20th March 2019,3,"""always wheelchair issues at PHX""
","✅ Trip Verified | Disabled. Waited alomost an hour to get a pusher for a wheelchair to take to gate. At gate, no pushers available, had to hobble down to gate. Travel every week, always wheelchair issues at PHX."
24th January 2019,1,"""unable to communicate basic information""","✅ Trip Verified | I am relatively new to the area. I just had to go on a 3 day trip. I got to Terminal 4 at 6am on Monday and I see a sign to Terminal 4 South car park. No other information was given. Was it short term I wondered? No, I thought, if it was short term, they would tell you this like every other car park in the USA, or indeed the planet, and also tell you the rates. When I came back just 3 days later the car park attendant hit me with an $81 dollar bill. I am absolutely disgusted with the service. You are apparently unable to communicate simple basic information to new comers. Next time I will take a luxury taxi instead and save myself a bundle. Thanks a lot."
11th December 2018,6,"""lack of international flights""","✅ Trip Verified |   Phoenix is overall a great airport besides the lounge situation deteriorating and the lack of international flights. The Pros: - Ease of access - Good food options - Good Internet - Fast Security (unless they do the dog screening as they take some time to get setup and while they do the security checkpoint is closed) The Cons: - Major discrepancy in quality of services between terminals that are not connected - Lost it’s only Priority Pass lounge access in the afternoon - No Asia flights and maybe 1.2 flights a day to Europe (and I am generous) - If the flight to Frankfurt and London are at the terminal together it gets messy, there is no real room for international expansion - Rental car are on the other side of the planet."
26th November 2018,1,"""Worst TSA experience ever""",✅ Trip Verified | Worst TSA experience ever in over 40 years of flying! The airport check-in and curbside is terrible. Would rather drive 6 hours to LAX than go thru this again. They claim it is the “friendliest airport in the USA”! No way!
16th June 2018,2,"""wouldn’t recommend to anyone""",Not Verified | Check baggage services horrible. No help or limited staff. Also staff serving very unfriendly. Can’t even explain how impersonal they were. I had also assumed that the gate number printed on my ticket was correct (my fault). They could at least post at the gate that the gate had changed. So much technology and all. Security check in was super unfriendly as well. No one had even had a slight smile - aren’t they getting paid? If I could choose another airport definitely would do that. I wouldn’t recommend this airport to anyone.
27th April 2018,1,"""crowded, cranky service""","✅ Trip Verified | I travel weekly and frequent Sky Harbor several times a month. Since I fly SW I’m usually out of Terminal 4. First off, the departure and arrival boards are not anywhere that makes sense. After arriving from the car rental you have to proceed to any of the four gates (a,b, d,d). AB one side, CD on the other. So if you walk up to the gate at A and you’re on C, you have to walk all the way across the terminal. Not enough characters to complain about everything wrong but the other peeve of mine is a complete lack of seating, one bar per gate. Clearly the “Best Airport” in my opinion is outscored by almost all others that I travel to. Cancun even beats this place. Crowded, cranky service and old. Tear it down."
9th April 2018,3,"""It is a nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified | Locating Terminal 4 parking area is almost impossible. If you have to meet someone from an international flight at Phoenix Sky Harbor Terminal 4, allow at least 30 extra minutes to locate the parking area. It is a nightmare! Whoever put up the signs to different parts of the airport must have been drunk when they came to point drivers towards the T4 parking area ramp. The lane the sign points to is not the right access lane, it is on a slight bend, there are numerous other signs and you end up sailing past on the constant flow of traffic. I have to pick people up regularly from T4 and it beats me every time. I have complained many times at the airport, but nothing changes. If you find it in three circumnavigations of the airport, you win a prize! Is anybody at Sky Harbor listening?"
25th March 2018,2,"""Dirty floors. Torn seats""","❎ Not Verified |  Dirty floors. Torn seats. A foul and mysterious odor. Antiquated baggage claim. Jetblue only mans a desk from 8-12 pm. TSA is a joke. If you didn’t know better, you’d think you were in a third world airport. But actually, those places try to have higher standards. It is as if the airport leveraged the beautiful weather so as to compensate for the substandard conditions of Sky Harbor. Embarrassing and disappointing for such an amazing state."
7th March 2018,2,"""Poor signage""","❎ Not Verified |  Picking up a handicapped friend from the airport. I have only been here one other time and had the same experience. Poor signage. Either not enough or even helpful. Trying to pick up someone here is a challenge. No information on where to park. Short term parking is not labelled until you are unable to access the lane. Miss a parking garage because the signage is so poor, you are out of luck. Exit the airport and start all over with tons of traffic. Dealing with this airport, I’m surprised more people do not miss their flights. Very poor layout and design. New York is easier to deal with. Not the best, but better than Phoenix, at least in NY, there are friendly people guiding you in the right direction. Good luck Phoenix, your growing pains are showing."
6th March 2018,2,"""TSA is a joke""","✅ Trip Verified | TSA is a joke. They hand checked almost everyone’s bag since their machines were malfunctioning so this made a ton of people late and on top of it, they were so rude! So much for calling themselves “the friendliest airport.” Ridiculous. Everyone was furious but of course had to comply."
26th February 2018,1,"""Horrible experience overall""","❎ Not Verified |  We were traveling with my autistic kid. I told the TSA agents that he needed assistance, they still asked him all kinds of questions, he had to go through the screening booth. He couldn’t understand what was asked of him. I kept telling them he doesn’t understand but they still insisted he should go through the whole process, dismissing my suggestion that they just do a pat down or find an alternative. I had to kneel to put each of his feet on the yellow markings and show him how to get his hands up and he kept putting them down. Horrible experience overall. I talked to the supervisor and she seemed to think that the lack of sensitivity towards a disabled child is all OK! Lots of training seems to be needed for that team."
13th February 2018,1,"""Delays have the entire airport behind""",❎ Not Verified |  Delays have the entire airport behind with counter attendants giving half answers in order to get you to leave them alone so they can to the same to the next person. No compensation given for when their construction delays cause me to miss my connecting flight resulting in an 18 hour layover and expensive last minute sleeping arrangements as well as missed earning potential.
30th December 2017,2,"""was deliberately misdirected""",✅ Trip Verified | “Everyone is TSA Pre Check Today”. Was travelling with two children and was deliberately misdirected by two male airport security employees when asked to be directed to the TSA Pre-check despite being an TSA approved traveller. No good reason for doing this except to harass a female parent travelling alone with two children. What a shame. I saw other passenger behind me being directed to TSA without hitch so I went back and entered the line without seeing their “assistance”.
23rd November 2017,2,"""Most poorly laid out airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Cannot for the life of me figure out why someone designed an airport where to connect between the terminals you have to exit a terminal and go through security again. I was traveling with a friend who was in a different terminal so I went to the friend’s terminal to have breakfast. No one bothered to tell me I was in the wrong terminal or warn me I couldn’t get to my terminal from where I was. I had to go outside, walked a lot, and re-enter security. Most poorly laid out airport I’ve ever been in."
16th November 2017,5,"""poorly managed Duty Free""","✅ Verified Review |  I travel to/from Phoenix at least twice a year and this is an ongoing issue: Out of all the airports I have ever visited Sky Harbor wins for most unreliable, ill-prepared, poorly managed Duty Free ever. For this most recent flight Nov 15th 2017? Just the littlest kiosk was open in the B gates. No alcohol and no cigarettes. Sad."
8th September 2017,1,"""one of the worst airports I have been to""","✅ Verified Review |  This airport is the one of the worst airports I have been to. It was September 5th at 4.30 am, and I was heading to Screening zone before heading to the gate. There was a huge line up at that time and they opened 3 lanes for screening. 1 for express and 2 for general boarding. Apparently a screening-machine was malfunctioning in one of the 2 general boarding lanes. Instead of opening another lane to deal with the congested line, staffs merged two lanes into one. That resulted in adding extra 10~20 minutes of everyone's waiting time and limited space for people pick up their belongings after passing the screening line. While I was picking up my belongings after passing the screening-machine, staff said ""you are taking up too much space and not letting others having the space for picking up their belongings"". This was very upsetting because all this happened due to their malfunctioning machine and merging two lanes into one. I had never problem with this kind of situation because I pick up my belongings pretty fast. Lots of people were complaining at that time but staffs did nothing about it and did not want to open another lane to deal with this situation, that was very lazy of them and stupid. There really needs to be procedures to deal with this kind of situation. Otherwise it will happen again and that would be just silly, because this is an easy fix. Hopefully whoever works in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport see this review and bring it up in their meeting and come up with better procedure for this kind of situation. Plus, the wifi is horrible too. This is 2017 and there is still issue with weak signal. Come on."
4th August 2017,2,"""Very disappointing""","❎ Unverified |  Very disappointing. The guy at the information desk gave me misinformation - not once, but twice. Wrong information about baggage claim and about airport shuttles. Seemed very bored and disinterested in helping anyone. The American Airlines baggage claim was a mess. Signs giving the baggage claim area for my flight were all wrong. What a mess."
7th July 2017,2,"""Baggage Claim area was abysmal""","❎ Unverified |  Baggage Claim area was abysmal. Frontier Airlines from COS arrived with info that bags would be on 4. No signs were at Carousel 4, but they were switched to 5. Bags came from 5, but stopped before the last bags came out. Someone noticed a flashing yellow light. No one was in the area to assist. Delta said the problem was Frontier's not theirs and we'd have to go to the ticket counter. The info counter person said she didn't have a phone and couldn't call. She has a phone. Frontier ticket counter said it's not their problem, the carousels belong to the City of Phoenix. City of Phoenix said that the carousel doesn't stop unless there's a jam and that's Frontier's problem. After about 45 minutes of this a Frontier ticket agent went into an elevator and got someone to finally react. Some mysterious guy apparently pushed on the flashing yellow light and the belts started moving. This shouldn't happen at what is claimed to be a Friendly Airport. Someone should be available to assure the carousels are working properly, regardless of which airline is using them. Bad experience."
9th April 2017,2,"""one of the worst airports in the US""","✅ Verified Review |  This is one of the worst airports in the US. The terminals are spread out all over the place, making connections a chore. If you have a connecting flight in a different terminal than you've arrived, be prepared to walk a lot. It also seems that this airport is unable to accommodate the number of airlines/flights arriving and departing. I've taken several departing flights that have left the gate early or on time, only to end up delayed 45-60 minutes because of taxiing and other tarmac traffic delays. Avoid this airport if you can!"
20th December 2016,6,"""direct route back to the main lobby is blocked""","Occasionally, when my flight is delayed and arrives at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport after about 10.00pm, the direct route back to the main lobby is blocked after deplaning at Terminal D. Subsequently, hundreds of passengers from various gates at the terminal and myself are re-directed to Terminal C, that adds about 750 feet (that's about 2 1/2 football fields long) to our tired trek home. It's rather disheartening and seems the City is too cheap to provide the needed security guard to watch us exiting Terminal D."
18th November 2016,2,"""unnecessary and badly organised""","I have no problem with security checks - keeps us safe but after a 10 hour flight - the equivalent of 3 am for us we waited at passport control for over an hour, with, at times, only 1 booth dealing with the non American, non special assistance passengers. It was unnecessary and badly organised. Experience certainly didn't feel like ""Welcome to America""."
26th April 2016,2,"""not enough space""","What a mess this place is. TSA is in chaos. Rude and inefficient. Body scanners are missing. Metal detectors used are apparently not set with proper sensitivity. One of us cruised through with one artificial hip. The other of us lit it up because of two artificial knees. Thus, an invasive pat down ensued. Ridiculous waste of time for the agent and the traveler. Not enough lines. Not enough space. Signage inadequate. Unorganized and sloppy. Then there is the terminal. Dirty and uncomfortable. Not enough seating for a plane full of passengers. Public address system poor. Boarding instructions confusing because you could not tell what gate was making the announcements. Nothing in the terminal says welcome to Phoenix. Nothing lets you know you are in the southwest. If we could, we would definitely avoid this airport in the future."
18th February 2016,2,"""unorganized mess""","I arrived almost two hrs before my next connecting flight. To only stand in line for three hours. TSA by the masses yet just three lines opened. More than three flights missed by about 100 people. When I finally got to TSA I was told I had to leave the liquor I purchased In Mexico (sealed legally). I stated I would check it in (he never suggested that option). AA stated they have nothing to do with TSA delay, I paid $150 for next flight because yes, way before the ""I would have to relinquish liquor"" while in the 2nd hr of waiting on line I missed my flight. Lots of employees at this airport as I went to customer service to complain stated that the airport has been a mess since Dec 2015. Avoid this unorganized mess of an airport. Lastly it's very sad how AA nickle and dime its customers."
15th January 2016,8,"""a really bad baggage experience""","Overall, it is a great airport, however a really bad baggage experience has left a bad taste for checking baggage. My bags took 1 hour to arrive and were not on the carousel advertised on the electronic board. As I was leaving with much luggage that showed up on carousel 5, the airport board was still showing that my bags were still being waited for on carousel 1. At the tail end of a long, overnight trip, this was not a good experience to end my trip."
17th December 2015,2,"""avoid this airport""","We were on a flight from Cancun Mexico to San Francisco with a stop in Phoenix. We purchased a few items from the Cancun transit shops wrapped and sealed in the special security cleared bag. Upon arrival at PHX, we cleared immigration and customs and were on our way to catch the domestic flight to SFO, which included going through TSA. The TSA agents confiscated our sealed purchased items stating that they were not in the right TSA approved bags. It is totally unacceptable to require all the countries in the world use the same type of security clearance bags used in the US. We ended up losing everything we bought to the TSA agents who supposedly ""confiscated"" them. The agents had a terrible attitude and did not even try to listen to the explanations. Very unhappy with how out of touch the TSA agents were in this airport. Try to avoid this airport as much as you can, especially if transferring from an international flight to a domestic."
13th December 2015,1,"""signage is non-existent""","Avoid for transit travel - informational signage and help is non-existent. After walking in circles for 15 minutes my wife and I finally asked a pilot what terminal our airline was in and then learned we needed to exit security to get to our terminal. Needless to say that meant we needed to clear security again. We had cleared thru Pre-TSA at our originating airport but our transit boarding passes did not have our pre TSA-clearance authorization printed so we had to go to our airline ticketing area to reprint. The lines were long and the staff working TSA were less than cordial. We asked if there was work in process to connect the terminals and they said no why would they? We explained that we had come in on Alaska (a major airline) and that we were departing on American (another major airline) and that going through security twice was a waste of resources and they pretty much they said too bad, that's just normal."
2nd December 2015,1,"""worst security screening queues ever""","Worst security screening queues ever. Arrived 2 hours early, but TSA only had 2 lines open, forcing more than a one hour wait just to get past ID screening, then still had to go through luggage screening lines. TSA personnel are rude, condescending, and could care less. Southwest Airlines was forced to delay departures as more than a dozen passengers were late due to TSA screwups with far too few people working the first Tuesday in December at prime time 6 p.m. departure. What an incomprehensiblly incompetent TSA staff at this airport, has to be the worst in the U.S."
15th November 2015,3,"""line was ridiculously long""","After a lovely weekend in Scottsdale, the departure almost didn't happen. We had time to kill and arrived at the airport 2 hours early. Thank goodness, because the security line almost resulted in a missed flight. The line was ridiculously long and there were only 3 regular lines open. TSA pre-check was practically empty. Passengers were missing their flights as we navigated the security line. I arrived at the gate with only 5 minutes to spare. TSA staff could not care less about the situation - why would they have 1 TSA person checking identification and IDs and not accommodate what was clearly an exceptionally long line of passengers to get through the security process? I will remember this experience and that planning to navigate this airport may require closer to 3 hours for a simple domestic flight."
12th November 2015,5,"""out of date and touch""","TSA rude, sarcastic. Most of stores closed. Out of date and touch."
9th November 2015,7,"""I have seen better""","This airport will do, although I have seen better. Restrooms and terminal were clean although not 100% spotless. It's a considerable distance to the gate. There are electric buggies roaming about, to help the elderly and infirm. Queue times and staff performance were reasonable, as I expected."
3rd November 2015,9,"""completely packed and chaotic""","Phoenix airport is easy to navigate, get in, get out and be on your way. It's a good medium size - not too overwhelming nor will you have to walk miles and miles to get to your gate. The only negatives are that as of October 2015, they are still not allowing ride sharing service like Uber and Lyft to operate at the airport. You have to take a cab when leaving the airport which means surcharges and extra fees. There is also limited seating and food options at Southwest gates. Everywhere we tried to grab a seat or a beer was completely packed and chaotic."
31st October 2015,9,"""very easy to navigate""","Transited in Phoenix en route to San Diego on Southwest Airlines. This airport is very easy to navigate and you can access areas of the airport where different airlines are operating. For example, while searching for McDonalds, I ended up in the area for American Airlines, and enjoyed breakfast there. Once I was done eating at McDonalds, I walked back to the area for Southwest Airlines. The free wifi at the airport also worked like a charm. The airport also boasts pretty views of surrounding mountains."
12th October 2015,4,"""little choice of where to spend my waiting time""","I transfered between Southwest flights in the new Terminal 4 and found it to be both spacious and attractive. But there's only so much that can make up for a poor airport design. Each concourse is a self-contained unit and the walk between them is extraordinarily long, making it impractical to use any of the restaurants or facilities other than those of your flight's concourse. And with only a handful of shops and restaurants in my departing concourse, I felt as if I had very little choice of where to spend my waiting time. (My meal was great, however). With the long distances, this wouldn't be a good place to have a short layover, and switching terminals would be even worse. Finally, the wi-fi, while free, had a weak signal wherever I used it and frequently disconnected."
18th September 2015,1,"""I was rudely addressed""",Worst security check-in at Phoenix Airport. Newly pregnant I had a simple concern about going through the scanner. I was rudely addressed and basically felt like a cow being pushed through and forced to use the x-ray machine. I hope I never have to come here again. The city was a fantastic friendly city and the airport security does not reflect that at all. Very disappointed.
21st August 2015,1,Phoenix Airport customer review,Worst security checkpoint I have ever experienced. The TSA pre is never available. Poorly run.
6th April 2015,3,Phoenix Airport customer review,Awful start by adding 45 minutes at minimum to your pre-flight schedule if you rent a car. Rental facilities are nice but not user friendly. Pack a lunch distance and obstacles traffic lights etc will chew up minutes. Work up a sweat getting from car to curb only to wait for a heated bus. Bus driver was friendly though. Check in area at terminal 3 are very small and any line at Jetblue or Delta will block the door. TSA personnel are disinterested and moved at a snails pace. TSA area very small and jammed up. Terminal was strewn with bits of paper and the place looks dated carpet dingy. Tried to board with my cell phone but gate did not have capabilities sent me over to next gate to get confirmation. Overall disappointed in the user friendliness of sky harbor.
6th July 2014,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,Flight from UK arrived leaving 2+ hours to make a connecting flight. It was the only plane coming in. About 10 booths for passport check varied between 2-3 in use. Then security. 3 people checking boarding passes for 1st class/priority passengers 1 for the rest. Then 2 of 4-6 lines of scanners open. I missed my flight and sat for 5 extra hours after a 10 hour flight. Pointlessly stupid and uncaring people from immigration and TSA. They should not have jobs or more to the point their supervisor should not have a job. Read the other reviews it is not coincidence.
3rd July 2014,2,Phoenix Airport customer review,I would do anything to avoid this airport. In my opinion it is one of the worst in the U.S. The food vendors are inefficient and just don't care. Check in lines are very long and agents don't assist or direct incoming passengers. The TSA areas and agents are crowded and rude. It is poorly organized with an inefficient very off- site rental car site. If you are going to Phoenix you are stuck. If you want to use Phoenix for connections don't.
7th April 2014,2,Phoenix Airport customer review,My wife and I recently returned from a trip to Mexico and entered the U.S. in Phoenix. Our arrival just so happened to be at the same time 4 other planes landed from other countries so we were not allowed to depart the plane until customs cleared out the other planes. My wife and I expected to sit on the plane for at least an hour considering how many planes were before us but Customs was able to get us off the plane in less than 30 minutes which was at least in my opinion exemplary. The reason we gave Phoenix Sky Harbor such low ratings is what happened after we cleared customs. We had to go to our next flight which didn't leave for 2 hours. But we once again had to go through security to get to our domestic flight. We stood in line at security for nearly an hour! Because of this combined with the long walk to the other concourse we barely made it to our next flight and weren't able to eat anything for dinner. The security checkpoint was poorly run. The people working the checkpoint weren't pleasant at all. And out of the 6 security lines there only two of them were open! I doubt that there were more than 50 people ahead of us but it still took us an hour to get through the security line. From now on my wife and I will do everything we can to avoid any connecting flights through Phoenix. If you have to change from an international flight to a domestic flight be prepared to take a full 2 hours to get to your domestic flight! I've worked for the federal government all my adult life but even for me the management of the security checkpoints is inept.
22nd March 2014,2,Phoenix Airport customer review,Be forewarned: Allow 2-3 hours before your flight departure time to check in at Phoenix SkyHarbor Airport. And do not assume that will leave you with time for such things as catching a bite to eat before you board your plane. Airline check-in goes fairly efficiently but it's the TSA that will slow you down. Expect to wait an hour or more to pass through screening watching as everyone passes through one or two inspection stations while 5 other stations stand empty/closed. Next time I might prefer to drive 16 hours (from Denver) than to fly through Skyharbor.
29th January 2014,8,Phoenix Airport customer review,I would suggest any reviews of dining experiences or facilities written prior to 2013 be modified since Sky Harbor T4 is going through a full restoration/modernization. A total makeover of eateries and services throughout. They are showcasing local favorite restaurants which has added some great choices pre and post security. Cowboy Ciao Humble Pie Four Peaks Brewery Sauce Barrio Cafe to name a few. T2 and T3 have not been given this same makeover but have some decent choices nonetheless. I actually look forward to getting to PHX early to grab a bite to eat and a decent glass of wine. On return they even have a brand new full service Starbucks in the Baggage Claim area. They also have added the light rail running between Economy parking and T4 which is another great improvement. TSA agents are friendly yet professional. I am grateful for my TSA Pre Check status too which allows me to breeze through security with little or no line.
21st March 2013,5,Phoenix Airport customer review,Terminal 4 has several hallways or spurs serving the gates - when our gate was changed to one in a different spur it was a very long walk but they had moving walkways. An employee pushing two wheelchairs at once had to do the same turn-around and didn't use the walkways. The spur that included our new gate had only three food services (the other one had more) all run by the same company with no cooked food except one was making breakfast egg sandwiches. I asked for one without meat and was told it wasn't possible. They seemed to be making them from scratch! I settled for a very good yoghurt parfait but would have preferred something more substantial. Most staff were incredibly helpful but one needed additional training. None of the food services on our spur had a vegetarian sandwich of any kind. We've had easy food choices at many airports and while traveling throughout Arizona for two weeks so Phoenix's attitude seemed very obtuse. Many people have dietary needs or preferences for a variety of reasons. The airport itself is close to downtown Phoenix easy to reach. The free wifi worked fine. The announcements were clear and the restrooms were clean. Check in and security (at 7.30 a.m.) were friendly and well-organized.
9th August 2012,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,"Being from Europe I'm very disappointed with Sky Harbor's facilities. I flew PHX-LHR from terminal 4. Firstly the ""duty-free section"" was very poor. Secondly the lack of eateries really surprised me especially since this were the gates with the international departures. I was forced to head to another section of the airport to get a slice of pizza. There were nowhere to sit and eat. I was lucky though to force myself to a table where it was possible to stand and eat. Finally the store with newspapers candy drinks etc was closed at my terminal (apparently it isn't allowed at this airport to have more than three stores open at the same gates a store clerk told me this). After all these flaws are quite understandable considering Sky Harbor almost exclusively serve domestic flights."
31st May 2012,9,Phoenix Airport customer review,I flew out of this airport while attending college in Phoenix. The airport was easily accessible by bus from campus and the check-in and security lines were almost always quick and efficient. Terminal 4 has an excellent central waiting area (outside security) with seating/shops/food everywhere with an overall very nice atmosphere. Having separate security checkpoints for each section of gates (all the gates are connected behind security) is a very smart feature which cut down on wait times at security considerably.
29th April 2012,9,Phoenix Airport customer review,B Diener's comment [27 September 2010] is incomprehensible in that it twice describes PHX as 'a small airport'. It is actually huge spreading over a large area with long distances to cover in terminals. However it does provide a fairly pleasant experience. T4 has some of those long distances but passing through TSA was almost pleasant. The centralised Rental Car Centre like that at Las Vegas is actually a good idea and the associated shuttles are frequent.
22nd March 2012,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,GDL to SFO on US Air and had a short layover of 1 hr 20 mins at Phoenix Sky Harbor. This airport is a nightmare. It is so far from one gate to another that 1 hr 20 mins is not sufficient to make the connection. I missed my connection and had to stay in Phoenix for one night and get a flight the next day. The facilities were very nice; yet the problem was the distances. In the future I will avoid this airport if at all possible.
6th February 2012,5,Phoenix Airport customer review,Waiting time for luggage is poor for such a small airport. Rental car companies are all centralised in one location with just one well served shuttle route which is a great idea. Queuing times for security are OK. Food choices in the departure area (after security) are limited to fast food only and generally rather poor.
25th June 2011,2,Phoenix Airport customer review,Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is not as friendly as it says. Your typical unfriendly experience at Sky Harbor begins at check-in. The TSA machines block 3 exits which can be a safety hazard if there was a fire. The TSA agents are the meanest I have come across and I fly a lot. Sky Harbor Airport has very few eateries and restaurants compared to most airports and the selection is very unhealthy. The airport has been undergoing a constant phase of construction for at least 3 years with no end in sight. A sky train is supposed to connect the airport with city transit but it wont be ready until around 2020.
15th May 2011,1,Phoenix Airport customer review,By far the worst airport security experience I've had with a 45+ minute wait time and the lineup snaking far out into the terminal. All because the TSA officers were checking re- checking re-re-checking (ad nauseum) people for the slightest infractions; for things like going through their machine with (gasp) a $5 bill in their pocket. No coins just a slip of paper. There was an elderly couple in front of me who got re-checked by the scanner three times because they had little bits of paper in various pockets. This was going on in every single lineup not just mine and it wasn't because something unusual had happened on the worldwide scene that day. Near as I could tell the TSA was just doing it for kicks. I rarely get angry at service personnel because most people are just doing their jobs as best they can but especially the way an elderly couple got treated really had me seething by the time I finally got through that agonizingly long lineup.
26th September 2010,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,It's a small airport that is very efficient. The check-in was quick with hardly any line up's. I can say the same for the security check. Once you are in the secure area you have the choice of checking out a few gift shops or some bars and smaller restaurants. Personally I liked the large panorama window overlooking one of the runways with nice scenery in the background. As it is a small airport traffic delays aren't common.
23rd October 2009,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,PHX is my primary airport so here about 2-3 times a month. Easy to use good signage but distances can be long to get from one area to another. Shuttle to parking lots have gotten more crowded (less buses running?). They are adding a people mover system so construction is everywhere.
2nd August 2009,2,Phoenix Airport customer review,"I travel through PHX about 25 times a year and perhaps familiarity breeds contempt but their slogan ""the Friendliest Airport in America"" is completely ridiculous given that I can usually get through the entire travel process there without so much as a kind word or a smile from anybody dealing with the public. It's become a personal challenge to see how friendly and polite I can be and still get a surly response! This last trip I flew on Delta through Terminal Three which is showing its age with filthy worn carpet broken seats at the gates and broken fixtures in the bathrooms. The ticket counter agents were surly the TSA personnel were yelling at passengers the bartender at the Taverna restaurant was carding everybody including a surprised white haired old man in his seventies who proceeded to drop all his stuff on the floor while trying to find his ID and all the time the bartender was loudly slagging her managers. Wendy's had a long line that didn't seem to be moving the Delta/Sky West gate agent was curt to the point of rudeness and the flight was almost an hour late with no announcements. I should mention that in both Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 most of the shops and eateries close very early sometimes as early as 4:30 PM well before the evening flights leave. I can't count the number of times I've been stuck behind security with literally more than a thousand passengers who have no place to eat or drink. Sorry while all of that may be typical of the pathetic state of air travel in the USA these days none of it says ""friendly"" to me. To top it off the drunken-sounding automated announcer mangles names to the point of unintelligibility. On the return it is common to wait forty-five minutes or more for a checked bag. On the good side the free Internet usually works the taxi stands are very convenient to the baggage claim and economy parking is cheap at $8 a day. Sky Harbor tip; park on the roof of the Terminal 2 parking garage. It's as cheap as the outlying economy lots but is directly adjacent to Terminal 2 and is just a short walk or bus ride from Terminal 3."
20th May 2009,5,Phoenix Airport customer review,Efficient transportation. Check-in activities vary by airline and terminal but with the exception of the Spring Break week all of them move along quickly. The only hitch is the TSA bag checking procedures where after checking in passengers with checked luggage must submit them to the TSA for security checks and pilfering. All of the terminals have several options for dining and T4 has numerous very good opportunities to eat for an airport. The TSA Security Theater lines for passenger entry to the secure area move quickly and in T4 if you see that the TSA has decided to go crazy at one checkpoint you can just walk across or over to another line that is actually permitting travel to occur. Checked in luggage usually arrives in a reasonable amount of time. The restrooms are plentiful and clean. PHX employs sufficient numbers of airport employees and volunteers to give help and guidance to all the visitors. The rental car facility is off site but the rental car shuttle bus system works smoothly. The airport has a free wifi system in all terminals. The freeways and surface roads to the airport are all well marked and the PHX highway system is well-designed and flows smoothly.
6th November 2008,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,Well run and busy. Phoenix surprised me on a few counts. It is pretty big very busy and handles volumes astonishingly well. It is not an international destination really so is mostly all about domestic and as no-one wants to drive to Phoenix it's domestic travel is large. Good airport pretty well figured out
2nd June 2008,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,PHX has undergone extensive improvements as of late. Curiously I noticed a rather dramatic increase in the cost of car rentals. When I arrived I was taken by shuttle to a brand new common rental car facility built atop the garage where the rentals are kept. Apparently the drastic increase in rental rates (before gas price increases) is due to an outrageous assessment levied against the rental companies those fees are then charged through to arriving passengers renting vehicles. Weather is seldom a problem in PHX and the signage and traffic patterns of the airport roads make navigating around fairly easy. The terminals are equipped with moving walkways making it easy to get from one part of the terminal to another if needed.
22nd April 2008,3,Phoenix Airport customer review,Terminal 4 at PHX is aesthetically pleasing once past the scrums at the check in counters (signage is poor but that may be the fault of a certain airline rather than the airport itself). It's a shame the aesthetics don't carry over into the airside areas as seating at the gates is crowded with uncomfortable chairs. Baggage delivery from plane to belt always very slow taking at least 15 minutes after arrival for the first bags to appear. Worryingly some over-attention to details: there was a fellow at the stop for buses to the hire car centre to remind pax of the 'rules for riding the buses' for a five minute journey. The man told me bags had to be placed on the buses in a certain way 'to comply with federal regulations' - a bit overly judicious in my view. Too many irritants and not enough pluses during the Sky Harbor experience to give PHX more than two and a half stars which I will grudgingly change to three.
24th December 2007,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,"Pretty decent airport overall. Check-in lines were practically nonexistent security took only a few minutes to get through and the ground staff from the airline agents to security to the baggage handlers were all remarkably friendly efficient and helpful. I also liked the ""simulated desert"" decorations while moving between the check-in/baggage claim area and the security area on the second level. Unlike ORD expected delays were well-publicized and the monitors were constantly kept up-to-date. The baggage claim area is a bit drab though at least this time my bags didn't take too long to come through."
17th September 2007,5,Phoenix Airport customer review,PHX is an excellent airport on many fronts with just a few negative aspects. If you plan to transfer at PHX and want to switch airlines you will need to change terminals. This is not obvious but this is because very few people would want to do this since both Southwest and America West/USAirways have their hubs in T4. If you check luggage do not expect to find it waiting for you when you get down to baggage claim. Since PHX is a hub the volume of bags they process is enormous and the speed that passengers can make from the plane to the carousel will always result in a wait for bags. (Hint: Do not check bags!). T2 is very old and it is not attractive to look at. T2 is fast; from the car park to the airplane in fifteen minutes on some occasions including ticketing security and the walk. The T2 parking garage is right next to the terminal and the terminal is an older one full of airlines like TED so you can move right through it. And you will want to as there is no real reason to linger. T3 is fast; from the car park to the aircraft is again quick and easy. T3 is a vintage 1980's terminal but it has some very attractive artwork on the departures level and because of the hub in T4 for Southwest and America West/USAirways the remaining mainline airlines are usually on time and heading for their own hubs. T3 is also clean with plenty of seating although most of the airline clubs are now closed since 9/11. T4 is new clean and efficient. Lines in the ticketing level can be enormous but they move quickly. Security is usually pretty fast in T4 and the lines on the departures level move quickly there also exept on Spring Break. T4 has numerous dining options shoeshine and even art galleries. Passengers can walk from the Southwest side to the America West side without leaving the secure area. The travelators make a transit in T4 fairly painless. Sky Harbor has moved all the rental cars to an off-site condo facility to the southwest of the airport. The busses run very efficiently and they are not operated by the self-important Transit Police like at SJC but rather by helpful folks who want to transport you. The facility itself is huge but easy to navigate. Roads and Signage: The traffic flow around the three terminals is complex but the signs are very clear and accurate. Drivers new to Sky Harbor should be aware that the Rental Car facility is not AT the airport and that the traffic flow at T2 is different from T3 and T4 because it has a different orientation to the runways.
3rd January 2007,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,I had the chance to see the Phoenix Airport during a very long layover and found the experience to be quite positive. The Southwest Airlines concourses tended to be a bit crowded but I found the terminal to be admirably well maintained overall - clean shiny and refreshing. All airports should do as well as Phoenix does on basic upkeep. Signage was good inside the Southwest concourses and the shops and eateries were plentiful. Overall it was very pleasant.
15th November 2006,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,I recently flew through PHX airport for the first time. I flew in on America West and was connecting to a United flght. Overall I really enjoyed this airport. Terminal 4 which is where most of America West/US airways flight arrive and depart is spacious lots of shops and easy to navigate. However the major flaw with this airport is transfering to a non America West flight. There were no signs anywhere. I had no idea which terminal to go to or how to get to the other terminals. I asked several airport personnel and simply got a shrug indicating that they had no idea. The screens only show american west flights so that didn't help at all. Finally I found a TSA person who told me which terminal United flies out of and how to get there. Once this was solved the transfer of terminals is pretty easy and efficient. Overall great airport but needs better signage for people transfering to other airlines.
20th January 2006,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,Fly to Phoenix once or twice a year. Baggage always takes forever no matter which terminal you fly into. Recently flew United to SFO and waited at check-in for almost half an hour which wouldn't have been bad if I wasn't the second person in line. When the passenger in front of me thought he had an open agent she closed her station and left even though there was only one other agent that was only checking in first class passengers. She didn't care that no one was checking in the rest of us. The check in area is unbelievably small - I think they expect that planes holding hundreds of passengers don't actually fly out of their airport. Security took almost an hour - we were wound out down the ramp and around the corner towards the baggage carousels. The security agent checked our passports and insisted on additional ID for my husband because his passport had expired but let me right through even though mine was expired too.
27th April 2005,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,"I mostly use Term 4 (for America West) though I've done a few out of Term 2 and 3. Though not remarkable PHX is actually a pretty good airport - maybe even great by US standards because of it's overall efficiency. I've seen many long lines at check-in's which are usually a function of how many agents an airline wants to make available. Even at peak holiday times I don't think the Am. West lineup has ever taken longer than 30 - 40 minutes and if you arrive early (or just luck out perhaps) you often walk right up to the counter without wait...I'd say this happens about half the time I travel. Other airlines may not be quite so fast judging by their lines. Security lines appear very long at times but in fact they move quickly. A lineup stretching 300 feet can actually clear through in only 15 minutes. Even better (at least for Terminal 4) you can go through security at either of the two A gate entrances or the B gate (3 total) whichever is shortest and use post-security moving walkways to go back to your assigned gate. Many people don't know this or even when told are afraid to thinking they'll be going from one long line to another. After 20 or so trips in the last few years I've never seen all 3 security points busy -- you can almost literally walk right through if you're willing to move the least busy. Land-side and air-side restaurant shops are generally good in both areas although the last year construction is closing off several land-side stores. There is a severe shortage of chairs/tables in the land-side of Term. 4 which is too bad as the Oaxaca (sp?) restaurant there is a must for me but I have often had to stand and eat or kindly ask others if I may share their table something I'd rather not have to do. The T3 & 4 shops are typical ""airport"" but decent and there's lots of coffee bars sit-down licensed restaurants and the aforementioned moving walkway lets you explore the rather large Terminal 4 relatively quickly even when lugging your carry-on around. I often leave extra time on trips just so I can do this. Knock-on-wood I've never had a baggage error checked-in through PHX so in fact I almost never carry-on anymore. The T4 B gate is international but it's stores aren't remarkable - the duty free is nothing amazing. Fortunately you are a people-mover ride away from all the A gate stores without having to go through security again. PHX doesn't have the ambiance of other airports I've been to like Honolulu nor the clean look of Vancouver but it is not unattractive and does quite well at what's important...getting you checked in accurately and quickly. Restrooms are always clean. Airline employees roam the floor just to be there for people asking questions - they are actually partly responsible for why security moves so quickly too as they work with the TSA.. When looking at efficiencies and amenities combined I certainly prefer it over Las Vegas McCarran or SeaTAC. Read about Wash. Dulles and LAX Terminal 4 just to see frustrating an airport can be and you'll have some idea of what a good one is like."
10th April 2005,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,"The worst part of PHX is the baggage system on arrivial. It takes very very long for bags to arrive from aircraft -- even lightly loaded aircraft. This is true at each of the three terminals (2 3 4) and does not depend on which airline one travels. If you have the misfortune of arriving at terminal 4 then be prepared to also be harrassed by poorly trained staff who insist on checking bag tags -- but when asked they have no idea why they check bag tags other ""than its my job."" Apparently it is not a security factor; if it was one would think that the checkers would know that that is the reason they do it. But they don't and they are rude besides. But the wait for the bags to come of the flight is even more disturbing."
7th March 2005,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,PHX is a decent enough airport although signage could be improved. The TSA baggage screeners were kind enough to put locks on my cases after they'd screened them which impressed me. The tiny Duty Free store for international flights is astonishing too - not every airport can be like LHR but it could be quite a source of revenue for the airport operators and/or City of Phoenix to sell more duty free goods.
15th December 2004,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,Travelled thru PHX twice now. Both times were arrival and return to LHR. Very quick (for USA) immigration and everything well signed. At hire car within 35 minss of landing on a full 747-400. Airport is clean and tidy and all staff friendly. Security was unobtrusive other than when proceeding to gate and then thorough. Only downside was the lack of any decent Duty Free and catering was limited (and expensive).
23rd December 2021,1,"""it was chaos and no one was friendly or helpful""","Not Verified |  You know it is not always the passenger that is in the wrong. Our party of 15 came in with time to check in. The hotel should have sent the shuttle about 30 minutes earlier, but we made it to the airport. From there it was chaos and no one was friendly or helpful. I know the staff must be under a lot of stress, but that is no reason to be rude and unhelpful to the passengers who just want to get to their destination. Not all of us want to prove a point, and we all were ok with wearing the proper mask and thought we were following the proper rules. Because of the TSA lines and overkill on patting down passengers and 10 steps in the wrong direction, and a very rude and probably tired official there were 3 out of the 15 who missed the flight and spent the next 29 hours getting home. Because of this there were 3 seats that could have been used by 3 people in need, but used by the 3 of us who needed to get home. Our flight that we should have been on, had 3 empty seats. Because of this action at the airport 3 of us slept in the airport, was witness to a person walking around nude at 3am in the Orlando airport, waited for security to attend to this poor confused person 25 minutes, and had to fly to Dallas and then from there to Madison WI. The rude and overkill with the TSA team slowed down the process even more. There are always two sides to every story."
14th December 2021,1,"""I'm totally shocked with their treatment""",Not Verified |  My family arrived at the airport in plenty of time to catch their flight back to the UK only to stand in the check in queue for an hour and twenty minutes and only move a few feet. On trying to do self check in unsuccessfully they asked for help only to be treated very rudely by airport staff. They then went back to the check in queue and again approached several members of staff as there was only an hour till their flight left and again were treated very badly by the most unhelpful staff. They eventually made their flight with minutes to spare my sister who was travelling has MS and is in a wheelchair the stress of her flight home had totally put her off coming again as any stress impacts on her MS symptoms. I'm totally shocked with their treatment especially as MCO is usually excellent with disabled passengers.
5th December 2021,1,"""never fly to or from here again""","✅ Trip Verified |  If you have to catch a flight out of here make sure you’re here a day early because you are guaranteed to miss your flight waiting in line through security.  Everything is done slowly and poorly with no regards to anyone's time. I will never fly to or from here again, I rather pay hundreds of dollars in Lyft fees to fly into other Florida airports but Orlando."
15th November 2021,1,"""the dirtiest airport I have ever seen""",✅ Trip Verified | This is without a doubt the dirtiest airport I have ever seen. As I wait to board my flight I am sitting next to an ant infestation. There is food all over the ground and no custodial personnel anywhere. Absolutely disgusting. Bathrooms horrifying.
8th November 2021,4,"""get your security acting right""","✅ Trip Verified |  It's a clean and straightforward airport. A lot of little food places to visit and seating if you need it. However, the TSA staff there is extremely rude. I understand they have to take their jobs seriously however, they do not need to treat us paying travelers like we're pieces of garbage. I'm a young woman traveling alone and I don't need any man talking down to me and you can't even get ""thank you, have a nice day,"" from them. They were extremely rude about the mask I wore and told me to put a real mask on, even though it covered my mouth and nose. The mask I wear is an alternative for my asthma and how I am able to comply with it where it's needed. Meanwhile there were people walking around with none on at all so I don't even want to hear it. Maybe you need to train your people in common courtesy to others to make it a more pleasant experience while you're there. Glad they keep it clean and tidy, but seriously, get your security acting right with the paying customers who are supporting their paycheck."
6th October 2021,1,"""Maybe we will be driving to Florida next time""","Not Verified |  The lady pushing the bins into the scanner was beyond rude. As I thought the bin was stuck, not that she purposely pushed it at an angle, I fixed it and she picked it up and slammed it back down to back to being at an angle. If I saw this is how she wanted it you think I would I fixed it? No, I would’ve left it. This lady needs some sunshine from this so called sunshine state. We get it you’re busy but the other workers were pleasant and joked around. The same worker also stated what you don’t care about your belongings? As they’re motioning for us to go through the scanning. Well if our items were pushed through and not held for so long we would’ve been fine. Maybe we will be driving to Florida next time. "
4th September 2021,10,"""TSA was super friendly and quick""","Not Verified |  TSA was super friendly and quick. I lost my Apple Watch during security check, my own fault. I panicked and TSA helped me and looked with me for my watch. They gave me an number to contact them and and fill out forms online. I got a call back the same day and they told me the great news that they found my Apple watch! I am super happy with their quick response and customer service!"
27th July 2021,7,"""Not bad service but it could be better""",Not Verified |  Very fast security. Staff could be friendlier and more clear with their directions. Bathrooms weren’t very clean. The chipotle ran out of almost everything. Not bad service but it could be better.
24th July 2021,2,"""What an awful airport""","Not Verified |  What an awful airport. The TSA was fine however the layout, sanitation, seating, is awful. For being the happiest place on earth I would say don’t bother. Disney, Universal, Sea World all need to step in and force this city to step up their game. No cold drinks to buy, luggage takes for ever to get unloaded, bathrooms broken, dirty and sinks not working. With the amount of money coming through this airport. There is no reason not to elevate. Shame on you Orlando. Take care of your travelers."
9th July 2021,1,"""no need for the dirty smelly airport!""","✅ Trip Verified |  I have come and gone from this airport for many years, l haven’t flown for a couple of years because of Covid. In July of 2021 l visited my son for a week. I flew Frontier from Rochester to Orlando which was just fine but the experience back was less than pleasant. The staff at the airport seemed to be trained in inconsiderate customer service. They’re rude and crude for the most part. I will say that the gentlemen that checked me in at the Frontier counter was very pleasant. He was THE only pleasant employee l experience during my 2 hour stay in the airport. The worst thing l encountered is that airport gate 16 smelled liked urine no matter where stood or sat. I feel that this is the one airport that should be setting an example for our nation since it is the number one vacation destination. Get it together Orlando! There is no need for the dirty smelly airport!"
6th July 2021,2,"""Very rude TSA""","Not Verified | Very rude TSA. Not 1 person I encountered was nice! Traveled with many family members. On the way to security checkpoint, 1st TSA encounter: was yelled at while I was with my two young children (to walk shoulder-to-shoulder side by side: difficult to do when 1 child was in a stroller). 2nd encounter near check point was told to scan my tickets with another very rude TSA worker who called me back as I was about to walk to get a body scan, he was upset and had a very mean/annoyed facial expression. Again yelled at: “who are they!” I replied “my children Sir, I scanned my ticket sir”. 3rd Encounter and thankfully the last! I had to dump my sons water from his bottle at a close trash bin (didn’t happen at JFK airport where I’m originally from as the TSA there was friendly and performed a test to check the water, lady smiled and I was on my way). Had to throw away a plastic spray/sip bottle that I was unaware contained approximately 1 ounce of water. I asked if he can just please allow me to dump that water out as well and was told “No, it’s too late” but he let me dump my sons water from his bottle. I was totally confused as I watched him confiscate it. He then checked my sons backpack and took his 4 oz unopened juice box and tossed it! As I said before I was traveling with many other family member and other children who were all able to keep their juice boxes from another TSA worker a different line. Worst experience of my life traveling through Orlando Florida airport! And I’m from NYC."
10th June 2021,2,"""go through security check again""","✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived at the airport 2 hours early as a precaution of the long security checks. We got through the security checks after 30 minutes (what a relief) so our family of 6 decided to use the lounge membership before departure. Our departure is Terminal B gate 35. One of the lounge is located in Terminal B, gate 1-29. We took the tram to the lounge. After finished, we have to take the tram back to tram lobby area (this is the security clearance area after the checkpoint) to take another tram to our gate 35. The TSA employee closed the door and told us we all have to exit and go through security check again, although we have already waited in line and completed the security checks for 6 people. We had only 10 minutes to complete the security checks before our plane boards. The tram for gate 1-29 is the only tram that is separated by ""Exit"" door once the passengers depart the tram lobby area. The logistic of this tram design is so absurd that even though passengers already went through security check, but if you use the lounge (tram 1-29), and have to depart to any other gate, you have to go through security again. Airport Logistics Department need to re-assess this as this will cause passengers to crowd checkpoint lines and miss their flight. Very frustrated that this happened."
11th May 2021,1,"""I’ve never seen anything like it in my life""","Not Verified |  Literally the worst airport experience I’ve ever had in my life. If you can help it at all, do not fly into or out of this airport. We were departing back to Philadelphia from Florida yesterday and arrived at the airport with 2 hours and 45 minutes before our flight. Walked into a line wrapped around the entire one side of the airport wondering what the hell was going on. Turns out it was the security line. There had to be over 600 people in this line, all very disgruntled to say the least. It took us over two hours to get to security. We rushed our things through and ran to catch the shuttle with our shoe laces untied. Luckily got onto the shuttle as the doors were closing and sprinted to our gate from there with about 5 minutes to spare before the doors closed and we missed our flight. The thought of missed our flight only to have to go back to ticketing and returning to that torturous security line again was enough to make us prepare to drive two hours to another airport to fly out of. Despite the fact that we made our frontier flight by a hair, we ended up sitting on the plane for another 30 minutes to wait for the 56 (!!) passengers that were still not present for that was supposed to be a full flight. The airline waited for about half of them to get onto the plane and had to leave the other 20 some passengers behind. This experience alone made an otherwise decent trip a horrible experience that we were left with. I will never ever ever fly into or out of this airport again and urge others to consider the same. Aside from the insane waiting and stressful rushing to our gate, the staff at the airport was very rude and cavalier about the situation. Non apologetic, no concern and just flat out rude. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. On top of everything, we were practically starving for a period of 5 hours since the time we thought we might have to grab a quick bite before our flight was spent stressing in an insane line and frontier doesn’t serve anything on the plan for passengers. I would have rather driven to Florida. Also, I was forced to give this airport one star for some reason, but they deserve negative stars. Steer clear!"
6th May 2021,1,"""Very rude and disrespectful employees!""","✅ Trip Verified | Very rude and disrespectful employees! I have been treated so poorly by ever staff member I come into contact with. Where do I start besides saying I am an experienced flier with many miles under my belt. The lady at the Camden food co. Counter slapped the counter several times, forcefully trying to get me to move up in line. I couldn't because the people in front of me were still moving their bags. I said have a nice day and she said ""whatever"". Shall we start with TSA now? I was being told to step closer by a TSA agent who was farther away. I could not hear them because of the masks. The TSA agent in front of me said, ""hey, Dumbo come get in now, shouted and talked down at me just to stand on the yellow feet and put up my arms. She then starts to grab my arm and pull me out of the machine. She said ""keep the line moving boy"" boy? Who do you think you are. I gave them no reason to treat me like that."
13th April 2021,1,"""Ended up missing my flight""","✅ Trip Verified | When my family first got here it took an hour to retrieve our luggage. On the day it was time to return home it took an hour to make it through TSA. These lines were nothing I have seen before in my history of traveling. It was worst than customs ×3. They were rude and everyone is doing something different. One say take electronics out while the other say leave it in. Then when I told her the lady just said leave the electronics in, one TSA employee says ""I don't know what airport said that to you"". I had enough at this point. I told her this airport told me that and as a matter of fact it was your coworker. Ended up missing my flight and had to stay another day."
4th April 2021,2,"""Very disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | I read previous reviews about the rudeness of the TSA/check-in staff and surprisingly they were right on. Absolutely rude, that’s all I need to say. Very disappointed!"
6th December 2020,1,"""rudeness will never be forgotten""","Not Verified |  First, the staff who checked us in were amazing. I was travelling alone with a toddler and they were very helpful. Then I went through Security and that was the worst. I am not a frequent flyer. I explained this. Mind you, the airport was empty. I'm flying for the 2nd time in my life and they huffed and puffed when I asked simple questions. I did not know to get out 4-5 plastic tubs myself for my things, while making sure the grandbaby is still next to me. So they had to help and were very displeased. Then I ask where to find my terminal. The employee rolled his eyes and pointed to the left. I asked if I needed to get on the train. Another employee laughed and asked if I was serious. Yes, in Atlanta you can actually walk to some terminals so I was unsure. Not all people fly all of the time. Have some patience. Treat people with respect and don't assume they know their way around. There were no other passengers anywhere to follow or ask. Sorry I had to interrupt them from socializing with each other, but their rudeness will never be forgotten."
14th October 2020,2,"""the signage is terrible""",✅ Trip Verified | I have the unhappy experience that will bring me to your airport from time to time. I have suffered the tortures of the dammed because the signage is terrible. You closed the B side car rental but you have failed to notify the public. I have looked but found not a single sign. I fly Delta so I use the B terminal. Well to my dismay and consternation I find no signage telling me where to find Delta. I do see a sign that tells me about all the other airlines in the A terminal. What do you have against Delta? Now I know why your airport was rated just above Newark. I wonder if a news report about these shortcomings at MCO would be interesting reading on several websites as I have now twice tried to report these problems on your website but it errors out every time. 
23rd September 2020,5,"""security check not social distancing""","✅ Trip Verified |  Concerns about social distancing. This is 1st travel since pandemic, at check in everything was fine upon going thru security check people were not social distancing there was plenty of TSA agents to in force. Also on Tram no Enforcement. This was not what I had expected."
24th March 2020,1,"""Shame on airport management""",✅ Trip Verified | We arrived at MCO (Orlando Airport) on Mar 18 at 11.00 pm. Airport was fairly empty as expected except apparently a couple of other planes arrived around the same time. Airport security or TSA whomever controls the trams from the gates to the terminal shut down all but 2 tram cars just as 200-250 people were trying to go from gates to the terminal. With all the concern over Covid19 why in the heck would the airport jam all those people into 2 trams. It probably took 2-3 trips back to the terminal to move all the people. We happened to be on the front end of that crowd and once in the tram had no chance to socially distance ourselves from anyone. It was like stuffing sardines into a can. There were 4-6 airport personnel controlling the situation and they all were obvious to any social distancing requirement being imposed for health purposes. It was 11.00 pm which must have been quitting time and they just did what they did every other night when 11.00 pm arrived. Please allow them to understand what is going on in the world today and try to assist in stopping this current virus. If you cannot allow the employees to make better decisions on their own then airport management needs to be in field understanding what is happening in your airport. Shame on airport management.
19th February 2020,1,"""Worst airport security""",Not Verified | Worst airport security I’ve ever been through. They don’t know what they are doing and contradict each other. Staff if very rude and not intelligent whatsoever.
13th February 2020,3,"""airport has outlawed gum""","Not Verified |  If you chew gum to keep your ears sane on takeoff and landing, bring it with you as this airport has outlawed gum. Apparently too many kids spitting it out on their carpets. Watched 3 family's spill the extra large McDs sodas on the carpets with no complaints or cleaning. If you fly from here and kids are screaming on the airplane with ear pain - thank MCO! Fly to Tampa if possible."
4th February 2020,1,"""customer service needs a lot of attention""",✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airport I’ve ever been to. The people at the security are so rude and mean. When the lady was telling me to put my feet in the yellow lines I didn’t hear her so she continued to scream it at me. Next my purse gets checked and the man very rudely asks if I have anything in there that will hurt him. I’m a 20 year old white girl I don’t even know how to work a can opener sometimes. Then he pulls out my victoria secret perfume and says this is too big to go through security so I can destroy right here in front of you or you can mail it to yourself. Throws the perfume at me and doesn’t direct me to any kind of ups or anything so eventually I got tired of going in circles and threw my item away. Now I’m sitting here waiting for my plane and crying. Isn’t this supposed to be about customer service? What is the point of being rude to everyone you encounter? The customer service needs a lot of attention. How can you expect people to enjoy their time and get good reviews if y’all act like this. I haven’t read one good review since because this places is straight trash.
9th January 2020,2,"""the most uncomfortable airport""","Not Verified |  I’ve flown through Orlando six times this year. It is by far the most uncomfortable airport I’ve been in — many people, very little seating or bathrooms. If I ever have to stay in the airport for more than 4 hours, I leave and come back. Maybe that is exactly what the city wants us to do."
7th January 2020,1,"""One of the worst airports""","✅ Trip Verified | One of the worst airports. Huge lines for security at 4am, incredibly rude TSA Agents who subject children to body scanners and subsequent pat down of a sick 13 year old wearing shorts and a thin shirt, and no shoes with nothing in their pockets. Refuse to give their full names or badge numbers or any other identifying info. Never had an issue at any other airport including Philadelphia, BWI, Seattle, Vancouver, Venice, Toronto and others."
3rd January 2020,1,"""this airport is not up to par""","✅ Trip Verified | Simply stated, this airport is not up to par considering the popular destination of Orlando. People travel from all over the world to visit this city and this is the best the city can do? Trash simply put. 1) Poor restaurant choices. 2) Limited number of restaurants. 3) Horrible selection of restaurants (you've never heard of most of them, few franchises). 4) Horrible security/TSA lines with no organization, crowding people like cattle before the ID check and then subjecting them to a surprise Disney-esque maze lineup after BEFORE getting to screeners. 5) Slow shuttles to gates. 6) Limited seating at Food Court. 7) Limited seating a gates. Seriously, I thought Orlando bills itself as a ""worldclass"" destination, it's a destination with no class!"
22nd November 2019,9,"""easy to get in and out""","✅ Trip Verified | Great Airport, very clean, easy to get in and out and park with good signage. The airport is also very clean and bright inside with a lot of amenities including restaurants, hotel, and shopping mall. The airport staff and security are friendly and dressed professionally. I would definitely recommend this airport for local and international travel."
5th November 2019,2,"""truly the armpit of all terminals""","✅ Trip Verified | I travel to and from this airport monthly and it never ceases to amaze me how incredibly terrible this airport is. It’s dirty. TSA lines are usually long, the agents rude, and the last couple of times the TSA Pre-Check lines have been shut down. The restaurants selections are the worst of any airport in the US I’ve been to and once you get through TSA your choices are even more dismal. Tonight our flight has been delayed by two hours. The only sit down restaurant at our terminal stops serving food at 9 and there’s only one location in the terminal where you can get an adult beverage. This place is truly the armpit of all terminals in the United States."
19th August 2019,1,"""Low number of restaurants to serve all the gates""",Not Verified |  Inefficient ticketing and baggage check in. Inefficient TSA line - 3 empty precheck lanes while general check had a 25 min wait. Low number of restaurants to serve all the gates. Dead cockroach in Hall. My wife had to try 3 different bathroom stalls before finding a door that worked.
19th July 2019,10,"""so far above and beyond""","✅ Trip Verified |    I just had the pleasure to of being served by Gudny who works for Thomas Cook/Swissport at Orlando (MCO). I cannot tell you how amazing she is. I enquired about a seat change and she went so far above and beyond. We had great banter and she got me an amazing seat with with seat map magic (better than what I was asking for). She is not just an exemplary employee who Thomas Cook/Swiss Port should hold onto for dear life, but just an awesome person. "
13th July 2019,1,"""TSA was extremely rude""",Not Verified |  TSA was extremely rude. Absolutely no help at all when my boarding pass would not scan. I just needed information on what to do but instead I got a rude how stupid are you stare. I pray they all find other jobs that bring them some joy. It’s so much easier to be kind. So sad.
4th July 2019,2,"""prices are jacked up on every item""",✅ Trip Verified |  This airport has copied every negative aspect of the Orlando experience in that prices are jacked up on every item in the airport to suck away every last penny from the traveler. Items that in any store cost $1.25 were priced at $3.50 - basic sandwiches at over $10. Remind me to drive next time. TSA did a great job despite heavy volume.
11th June 2019,1,"""by far my least favorite airport""","Not Verified |  This is by far my least favorite airport to fly into or out of in the entire country. I fly fairly frequently (1-2 times per month) and every time I fly here people are cold, unfriendly, and not helpful at all. I've had people stand and stare at me waiting in line for coffee, only to tell me 5 minutes later they closed the line. I've been yelled at for not getting in the closest general screening line when there is an obvious general line that is shorter. Today, a security agent squeezed behind me with a cart full of bins, then get mad at me when I accidentally backed up and turned around to apologize (never even had the chance to say anything). Other airports also do a far better job of posting what you can and cannot bring on board, but I've been behind someone in security with full-size shampoo products. The seating area is really dirty today, and the bathrooms are overcrowded. I enjoy Chicago airport. I love Denver. Even LAX is tolerable if you have the right attitude. But for some reason, every time I fly through MCO it is a stressful and unpleasant experience."
3rd June 2019,1,"""not one person offered to help""",Not Verified |  Worst TSA I have ever dealt with. I was traveling with my infant and was gate checking my stroller. We approached security not one person offered to help remove the bassinet from the stroller so it would fit through the belt or help close the stroller. I have my baby in my arms removing my shoes taking out my iPad and struggling to get the stroller on the belt and not one person offered to help. Even after we were scanned and everything had passed through still not one of the 5 TSA who were standing around asked if they could assist me. The security staff here needs a class in customer service. So disgusted with them.
24th May 2019,1,"""Worst airport I've ever been to""",✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airport I've ever been to. Staff are always rude and always look like they don't want to be there. I was treated like an animal. Would not recommend this place to anyone.
16th May 2019,1,"""the worst airport I have been to""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando International Airport. Airport code MCO. This is not my first time in MCO. I have been to this airport a few times. This is probably the worst airport I have been to. I have travelled to many different cities and countries and gone thru many airports. First, this airport's layout, it is just stupid. They make you go back and forth for no reason and you need to take monorail. The monorail was surprisingly fast and effective. Cleanliness of airport is very questionable. It is not a clean airport. Many places are dirty and the bathroom is Mr Cleans nightmare. I hardly saw any cleaning staff in the airport. What makes this airport the worst is the staff who work in the airport. Many are just rude and lazy. Even the baggage handler thinks he owns the airport. So don’t expect service or courteous here. Most likely you will get yelled at for bothering them. TSA here is joke. I saw 20 TSA, 3 TSA agents working and 17 TSA just standing around talking and laughing. I approached one of TSA to ask question. Her response, “just go over there.” Apparently sharing a joke with her friend is more important than the security of the airport. I thought Newark airport was bad but compared to MCO Newark airport is a well oiled machine. Once again, staff in the airport are what makes this airport the worst airport. Only bright thing about this airport is the immigration agent. Most of them are very professional and courteous. Everyone seems to be trained very well. If possible, avoid this airport."
10th May 2019,1,"""Rudest TSA security""","Not Verified |  Rudest TSA security I have ever been to. When you asks questions they dont listen and if they ever answer they will do it in an uninterested or rude way. I have been with other airports, they are nice but here at MCO they are the worst!"
25th March 2019,1,"""rude and uninterested""
",✅ Trip Verified |   No one seems to know what is happening. Staff throughout airport rude and uninterested. Restaurants closing early. Chairs in seating area broken and obviously been that way for a long time. Surely Disney could be encouraged to donate one weeks takings to modernise this awful beginning of people's holidays. If I compare this to Gatwick and Heathrow in England and Schiphol in Holland it is embarrassing to America.
22nd January 2019,5,"""looks like it's stuck in the 1970's""","✅ Trip Verified | Have experienced this airport on multiple occasions over the last 10 years and every time it's the same. The Airport looks like it's stuck in the 1970's and would need a renovation. Overall the check-in process is smooth, but the security can take longer than expected. There is an ok amount of resturants and bars, and there is not enough seating at the gates leading to a lot of passengers having to stand up."
15th January 2019,1,"""ridiculous process""","Not Verified | Coming from Stockholm we had a very long flight only to wait an hour or so before immigration moved just a little at a time. While being there another hours a flight arrived and you saw the passengers arriving into the already established que's only to be yield at by officials as if they were small children and rudely! To get back to the plane they left and stand by. The official also informed those passengers that they were not going to be processed because the airlines they flew did not file the proper paperwork and they were unexpected! We made it through immigration recovered our checked baggage pleasantly surprised by being given a free cart, rolled through the customs door then told to unload the carts were not allowed to be used to take the luggage anywhere and we were told to place our luggage on the conveyor, told it could take as long as 3 hours to show up at the main portion of the airport. No passengers put there luggage while we were there they all struggled and all helped each other carry their luggage back to the main terminal. Ive been to many Airports across the world. Never have I ran into an additional 3 hour process at the end of customs in any airport at any country. What a waste of big money. why did not the airport let the cart vender rent carts out there rather than spend millions on conveyors that no one will want to use. Also no signs or instructions regarding this portion of the process. It was a melt down just waiting to happen every 10 minutes. They had such a nice appearance when we departed, arriving was a nightmare more than anywere Ive been in 30 years. The staff seemed to try to manage dealing with the ridiculous process. It took us a few moments to carefully stack all our luggage up on the free cart. For a 10 second push 15 feet?"
14th January 2019,1,"""unpleasant arrival experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Most unpleasant arrival experience in my life. Arrived at 10 pm on January the 7th from Panama and went directly to immigration line (visitors). Very disappointed to see that there were only 2 agents allocated for our line, while that line for locals had more than 7 agents. As a result it took us more than 1:30h to pass the immigration controls. Then, they took me to the customs office with the excuse of having a common name (they didn't provide more explanations but the way the agent explained didn't sound very convincing, besides it was the first time that it happened to me in US territory). Time spent in the office, 30 minutes. After the office I finally got to pick my lugagge, only to discover that it had to go through a 2nd security check and that we had to pick it in another terminal. Sadly when we got to the pick up terminal, part of the lugagge didn't come out. Nobody from the airport or airline was present to assist us. I asked to another passenger in the same situation and he told me that this messy inconvenient was really normal in the airport. We sat for more than 1 hour besides the belts, until the last bag finally came out. It took me 3 hours to fly from Panama to Orlando and incredibly it took me more than 4 hours to try to go out of the Airport. These guys have no idea of customer experience. I know security is a priority but it doesn't give them the right to provide such a poor service. If I don't know how to treat my guests I simply don't invite them."
10th January 2019,1,"""TSA are disgusting""",✅ Trip Verified | TSA are disgusting and dehumanizing. This pig of a women was pounding on the plastic barricade and bellowing to people to move up a few inches. I was traveling for work so I had no choice. This is unacceptable.
7th January 2019,4,"""it is horribly outdated""","Not Verified |  We arrived later in the evening. Our plane was delayed, so we got something to eat in the main terminal. I'm glad we did, because there were few options near our gate. Because we ate first, security was short (it was horribly long before we ate). My biggest issue is that for an international airport at a major tourist destination, it is horribly outdated. For us, specifically, it is a huge lack of charging stations. We were at the gate 15 waiting area. In that area, there were 6 outlets, each with 2 outlets and 2 USB chargers. That makes a total of 24 people who can charge a device. Get with it. Most modern airports (we live in Denver and use DIA regularly, but have seen it at most other parts airports as well) have seats that charge, so every passenger has the opportunity to do so. In this information age, we all use our devices for everything from business, to email, to boarding passes, to transportation (Uber, etc.). We had been gone from our lodging most of the day and arrived with devices in need for charging. Do you have a plan for when a passenger arrives with an electronic boarding pass, but their phone dies before boarding because they couldn't charge it?"
4th January 2019,1,"""Avoid MCO at all cost""","✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely horrendous experience going through Orlando International airport! During holiday season travel rush, the airport closed all TSA precheck lines and created massive queues, herding everyone into general security check lines. The staff were extremely incompetent and could not adequately direct the traffic or move the lines along. It was the absolutely worst security experience I have ever experienced of any airport, any country! Avoid MCO at all cost!"
4th January 2019,1,"""bathrooms filthy and smelly""","Not Verified | If I could give this airport a 0/10 I would. Driving into the airport required a toll road and most rental cars charge more without sun pass. When we finally made it into the airport the signs to return rental cars were quite confusing, we had to go around the entire airport to return our car, when we finally made it to the terminal. the TSA line was long. Food options were very limited and the bathrooms were filthy and smelly!!"
4th January 2019,5,"""no one cares about customer service""",Not Verified | The customer service at Nathan's and Burger King on gates 60-99 are the worst customer I have ever received. More than 15 people on line to order and only one register open. The employees show that they do not care. Nathan's always runs out of food that’s in the menu daily and even forks. Looks like no one cares about customer service at those two locations.
31st December 2018,1,"""Waiting time, almost an hour""
","Not Verified |  This is the third time that I have to wait so long for our baggage. That happened in July with Southwest and in December with Spirit and Frontier. Waiting time, almost an hour."
21st December 2018,1,"""the most unfriendly airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Terrible signage, terminal train out of service, police officer unprofessional when asked a question. I have traveled 24 round trips this year and find Orlando to be the most unfriendly airport in my long travel history. You know when NY and NJ is better there is a real problem! It is very obvious no cares here, what a shame. At the end of the day one airport has to be the worst and it’s Orlando!"
21st December 2018,1,"""airport has done away with special assistance""
","✅ Trip Verified | Three planes came in together and there was over 800 people in the immigration hall with three officers on. We saw people collapse and children were crying. We waited over two hours as this airport has done away with special assistance, my wife has muscular dystrophy and is in a wheelchair. We will never again fly into this airport. It’s appalling. What a horrendous way to treat your visitors. Virgin sent us a text before we arrived apologising for the wait in the immigration hall so obviously people had complained to them."
14th November 2018,3,"""there is no signage""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando International has two separate security check points in terminal B that are gate specific. Our boarding pass that we got printed a few minutes prior to going through security didn’t list a gate. Having not been to the airport before we just got into the first check point with our kids and all the carry-ons. It took about 20 minutes before we got to the TSA desk at which time they told us we had to leave and go to the other check point. We then waited in line another 20 minutes to get to the security screening in the second checkpoint line. Our complaint is that first the gate should be printed on the boarding pass as clearly the TSA counter had this information 20 minutes later. Second, there is no signage or employees going around checking to inform travelers they are in the right checkpoint. We all expect some wait at the airport but things like this are simply maddening! Further, when we talked to the TSA folks, they rolled their eyes like this is a very common thing and they wished it wasn’t that way. So my question is this, why isn’t the airport leadership taking this on as an issue to be corrected? Also, the gates for Delta were super crowded! We had to stand the entire time waiting to board, which isn’t easy with small children."
10th November 2018,1,"""the worst I have ever seen""","Passport control at this airport is the worst I have ever seen on this planet bar none. Our plane landed from London at 5:50pm, the air bridge took 15 minutes to dock at the aircraft. Then we were told that the customs hall was overloaded and there would be a passenger hold on the aircraft for a further 20 minutes. Despite being first off the plane we then waited in line for another 2 hours. Customs was also no better, there were a total of 6 CBP lanes open for all arriving visitors. My wife also got a secondary immigration inspection for the apparent reason that she would be staying too long (we were on 2 one-way tickets) despite us both being on the same bookings and me being admitted without question. That whole process took another 90 minutes of waiting for a single CBP officer. So after landing at 5:50pm we got to our rental car at 10:30pm. We will never use this airport again. Orlando lives from tourism and frankly with a welcome like this they can keep it. I would give zero points if allowed."
9th November 2018,2,"""employees rude and offensive""","Not Verified | Avoid at all cost, this is the worst airport I have flown into. The employees are rude and offensive, do yourself a favour fly to Sanford. I will not be flying with Virgin again because they land at this airport in the looses term, I would give it minus If it would let me."
3rd November 2018,2,"""avoid at all costs""","Not Verified |  TSA lines 30 minutes or more, and the airport authority staff sitting in various places around the main floor do nothing to inform. This place used to be one of the best. I would now avoid at all costs. Horrible treatment of the flying public."
29th October 2018,1,"""What a joke!""",Not Verified |  What a joke! The staff members at this airport are the most rude and ignorant people I have encountered in my life. Be prepared to deal with the worst attitudes possible and for no apparent reason. I have traveled to this airport many times and this will be my last! I refuse to deal with these security and ticket staff. From now on I will just fly into Tampa and drive to Orlando.
28th October 2018,10,"""appreciated their integrity""","✅ Trip Verified | Honesty, graciousness and hospitality describe my latest trip to MCO last week. I was traveling there because my daughter was having surgery so my mind was scattered. Once I landed after flying for 5+ hours, I was ready to catch Uber and get to her house before her surgery early the next morning. As I was taking off an outer coat due to the 40 degree warmer weather, I set my purse down. When I gathered my things as the Uber driver came up, I left my purse on the planter. Of course when we got to her house - no purse. My Uber driver was going back to the airport and offered to see if he could locate it when I gratefully appreciated. My daughter went on line to file a lost and found report. We prayed and moments later, a detective  called. They had been trying to locate me for more than 30 minutes. The Security Guard at the airport found my purse and immediately turned it in. When I spoke to the Detective, I thanked him profusely and asked about next steps. He said Lost and Found would contact me the next morning. They did - twice. They confirmed the contents with me and gave me instructions as to how to pick it up. I told them I would come after my daughter's surgery was over and they understood completely. Around 1pm the next day, I went back to the airport and found them - they were already waiting for me. I asked how I could repay them - tips, writing letters of appreciation or what. They said none of that was necessary and asked how my daughter was. All I can say is how much I truly appreciated their integrity, concern and graciousness. I will highly recommend the Orlando Airport and Orlando in general and a wonderful place to visit!"
17th September 2018,3,"""not a friendly user installation""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando International Airport is definitely not a friendly user installation. You have to walk and going up and down to reach your luggages and the parking. Also the staff at security gates (TSA) are not fit to handle customers. They are rude, impolite and unprofessional. They need to retrain at Disney Institute, few miles away from the airport, to learn about what is quality service!"
13th September 2018,1,"""Security is horrendous""","✅ Trip Verified | TSA/Security is horrendous and caused us to almost miss our flight. We checked the airport app upon arrival and the estimated wait time for Gates 1-59 security was 6-10 minutes. So we took our time, got some coffee, etc. My wife checked the app again a bit later and suddenly the wait time was 22-26 minutes. We hurried over and discovered the chaos that is MCO security. Several times, several lines merged into one or branched from one line to several. It was like herding cattle. The last time the line branched we apparently chose the wrong line. It just wasn't moving and when we finally got to the front we find that the bag scanner wasn't working properly. All told, it took me 47 minutes to get through security, but it didn't end there for my wife. Her bag was pulled out to be searched, along with a few others'. I went on to the gate to plead with the gate agent because we were about to miss our flight. My wife tells me that the two bags in front of hers were searched because of 1) Disney picture frames, and 2) a hairbrush. For her, it was a handful of quarters. She ran to the tram, then from the tram towards the gate. Luckily I saw her just as the gate agents closed the door. I told them she was on her way and pleaded with them to let us board. They reopened the doors for us and let us on. TSA was rude and condescending, though. I witnessed it myself but my wife tells me it got even worse after I left. We don't travel to Florida often, but it will never again be to Orlando."
9th September 2018,2,"""MCO is the worst airport""
","Not Verified |  I live in Florida but have traveled quite a bit and I have to say that MCO is the worst airport that I've ever been to. Going through the lines for security is a mess. It's like herding cattle. Today I stood on one spot, in a line, for over a half an hour. Once I got to the scanner, the alarm went off. I went back through and it was fine. The lady behind me had the same thing happen. Needless to say, I and the lady behind me, missed our flights. Going to try OIA next time."
31st August 2018,1,"""ill informed rude staff""
","Not Verified |  I have been travelling to Orlando for over 25 years for vacation and work, and over the last 9 months this immigration situation has gone from bad to appalling. You arrive after 9.5 hours in the air to go through a small area with no refreshments or bathroom facilities and then you put your passport into the machines getting a ticket which has cleared you for entry. Once out of this area you are the herded by ill informed rude staff to meet the customs officials and get asked the same questions by these people, some of whom are really nice others can be really obnoxious. So you land at 3.30 pm and get your baggage at 6.00 p.m. Not acceptable. Get this new area sorted get your entry system sorted, get your staff trained in customer service. I have been into dozens of US and other country customs area and this is by far the worse."
31st August 2018,7,"""revaluate wheelchair service""","Not Verified | Wheelchair passengers had to wait 15 extra minutes on the plane before wheelchairs arrived at the gate, even though they wheelchairs had been requested in advance. Then, once we deplaned and had our wheelchairs we had to wait additional time before anyone arrived to push us. OIA needs to revaluate their wheelchair service contractor and demand that they hire additional people and buy more wheelchairs. It's a good thing we didn't have a connecting flight or we could have missed it."
30th August 2018,9,"""definitely my favorite""","Not Verified | MCO being my home airport is definitely my favorite, but I have many reasons that would put this under favorites for many non-floridians. First of all I am a frequent flyer and with TSA-Pre Check you can zip through security lines here. The airport is organized and although there is a high amount of passenger traffic everything runs smoothly. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping areas as well as an Apple store which is awesome. The airport is super clean and transportation shuttles are everywhere so you will always get to your gate on time. I have almost never experienced delays at this airport even during international departures. There is also great Wi-Fi through out the whole airport. Customer service and staff are calm and helpful and always cheerful! The only thing I would add to this airport is more international gates to increase international traffic. The overall experience is amazing though, so if you ever fly into Florida I recommend Orlando International Airport!"
18th August 2018,1,"""an awful place""","Not Verified | I was very disappointed in the Orlando Airport. The lines are extremely long going through security and the airport employees are very rude, disrespectful and loud. I would never hire any of them to deal with any of my customers. I have been through that airport now three times, and always the same thing. I feel sorry for the first time flyer- it’s an awful place! All they need to do is be nice. If I treated my customers this way I would be fired!"
30th July 2018,1,"""tired and ill-prepared airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport I have come across and totally unacceptable for a destination that relies almost entirely on tourism. It is an unfriendly, tired and ill-prepared airport to arrive in. We were held on the plane for 40 minutes because they had no space for us in the arrival halls and then we had to wait in 'holding pens' for a couple of hours in endlessly long snaking queues standing up. Everyone had arrived at that time from long haul flights, so already exhausted. All the children were crying, there were no seats available for those who needed to sit. Nobody wants to spend three hours getting through the airport when they have travelled so far and then need to travel further to their final destination. The ceilings were all coming apart, everything looked very tired and not fit for purpose. Even an apology over the tannoy system would have been appreciated but there was nothing. Only commands to not use your phone or camera. I would avoid this airport at all costs. Plus the signage throughout is terrible!"
27th July 2018,4,"""Very tiring airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at MCO on September 27, departed on October 3, with my wife visiting Disneyland. Very tiring airport, as after arrival have to take a shuttle to reach main terminal and then got to go down a level to collect luggage. Collecting luggage is not the easiest task as there is not enough space to wait around the carousel - tends to be busy most of the time due to Disneyland! Fairly warm as well. Signage there is not as clear as in other airports. Got to ask staff for info most of the time. Most staff are polite and try to help. Similar situation for departure, but signage is a bit better. TSA is much more strenuous than in MIA - put me aside for further check because they ""found something on my clothing"", even though I was wearing just a polo shirt, flip flop no belt and had removed my watch and rings. Then they emptied my carry on and checked my Hersheys chocolate - ""Hugs"", ""Kisses"", etc! An airport that makes you feel tired! I would say avoid it if you can!"
18th July 2018,1,"""passport lines were too long""","Not Verified |  On our arrival from Paris, we were kept in the airplane for 50 minutes because, we were told, the passport lines were too long and there was not enough space in the passport/customs entry area. When we were finally let out of the plane, we were taken to a holding area, where we waited for another 20 minutes, and because my wife and I had Global Entry, we were allowed to proceed at that point to the passport area. Goodness knows how much longer the other passengers, visitors and US citizens mixed together had to wait before being let into the passport lines, which were long enough that it would have taken at least two hours total from landing for them to enter the country. Once we got to the Global Entry line there were only two machines, and one was out of service. The one machine available did not operate properly for many of those in the line with us and in my case it failed to recognize that I had Global Entry, even though the passport official we finally got to admitted that we did. A disastrous experience overall and a wonder that any foreign visitors arrive in Orlando or US citizens decide to use MCO as their international gateway. We live in the area but are now considering abandoning nonstop overseas flights from Orlando in favor of other gateways."
11th July 2018,1,"""The heat was unbearable""","Not Verified |  Worst travel experience of my life. We arrived in Orlando, took around 2 hours to get through immigration with only half of the desks open. We had a family waiting behind us with three young children which included a very young baby. The heat was unbearable, the baby was screaming all the way through, the other children were watching cartoons on their mothers phone in which a security guard told her to put it away as phones were not allowed. The majority of the plane were families with young children and had similar experiences, I had a toddler with me as well. Its an absolutely cruel experience for the little ones. We waited over an hour in a room for our luggage, in which three other flights of people were waiting too. We then had to get a shuttle to the main airport to leave, there was no elevators and I was told by the security guard that I could not go on the escalator with a pram/stroller, I had to drag the pram with a toddler in my arms up the flight of stairs, with two security guards watching happily (I was previously told I would be assisted). A security guard was directing the flock of people through to the shuttle inwhich she had physically pushed my sister in that direction due to it being so over-crowded. In all it took us around 4 hours to get out of the airport, as we waited a silly amount of time to get the rental car out as well. The whole experience was exhausting and cruel, if we decide to visit Orlando again we will definitely be looking at alternative airports."
26th June 2018,1,"""wow what a wait""
","Not Verified |  Well we were warned but wow what a wait! After a long flight into Orlando we disembarked the flight into a corridor and waited and waited and waited. Eventually someone came to get passengers with connecting flights but no explanation. We carried on waiting, the children were tired and thirsty and the corridor was hot. We finally got told that 5 large flights had arrived all at once. I assume this was the schedule and therefore was expected so why could they not either: advise people before they left the plane to be prepared for a wait or have more staff or organise some refreshment in the corridor or even better just advise people of the situation. What was worse was that upon getting the end of the corridor, there was a huge long snaking queue in the customs hall. It took us 3 hours to clear Orlando airport and then we had a 2 hour drive. Never again. I will find another route into South West Florida. Even the Virgin staff looked sympathetic and incredulous at our plight!"
25th June 2018,2,"""worst airport I have ever experienced""","Not Verified |  Absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the worst airport I have ever experienced. I travel frequently and am forced to fly to Orlando once per year to go to UFL. I always dread this airport and today is no exception. Long lines, fed up security staff, very few services whilst you wait for your flight. This time I was met by a 3 page waitlist for the lounge and a completely full bar at every single outlet (all 2 of them). Seriously Orlando, get your act together."
1st June 2018,4,"""the worst experience""",❌ Not Verified | I visited this airport recently and I can say it was the worst experience I have had. Not only was it confusing trying to find our gate but the security staff were very rude to us and weren’t acting professional. I have been to this airport many times for vacation and I am considering going to a different airport next time.
26th May 2018,1,"""It was an absolute shambles""","✅ Trip Verified | This is without a shadow of a doubt the worst airport I have ever flown to. Upon arrival, we were not allowed to disembark the aircraft due to 'congestion in the terminal'. After a 20 minute or so wait, we were allowed off, only to find ourselves queuing in a hot corridor and then a further room for about 50 minutes to get to the machines which have replaced the landing cards. The machines were unmanned with no one on hand to help. It was an absolute shambles. Once we had mastered the machines and taken our printouts, it was into yet another monstrous queue to get through immigration. Orlando airport is an absolute joke. Considering its importance to the tourist industry there, you would expect that there would be investment of some kind to sort it out. Next time, I will fly via one of the hubs which are capable of handling large passenger numbers at an international airport."
14th May 2018,3,"""worst airport I have used""","❌ Not Verified |  This is without doubt the worst airport I have used. We arrived on time using BA, on arrival we were herded into a large hall for 45 minutes with no explanation, after this it took another 45 minutes to get through passport control. The whole airport was shabby and dated."
1st May 2018,1,"""whole airport is terrible""","❎ Not Verified | Probably the worst airport I've been to. On arrival we were crammed into a tiny waiting area for security screening. Two planes worth all trying to get through the tiny area. It was also hot and stuffy. Once through the security question machines we then had to wait in queues for passport check. The whole airport is terrible and a trip hazard as ita going under works or its falling apart. The signage is poor and you have no idea where you're going especially for car rental. The tram from the terminal to the main terminal was unsafe, such a small waiting area which filled quickly then more people kept coming up the escalator not knowing how full it was had no where to go, it was chaos. It took us over 2 and a half hours to get out of the airport. On departure finding the check in desks was actually fine but more chaos from there. We arrived the 2 hours before checked in straight away then was met by 45 minute wait to get through security, there was no movement at all in any of the queues. It got to the point where I had to go and tell our airline we weren't going to make the flight to which they escorted us through. But even with an escort it was slow. Departure lounge and seating was poor, then the airport had delays so the plane was delayed landing. Thing we will be trying the other airport at Orlando"
30th April 2018,3,"""queues totally unacceptable""","❎ Not Verified |  For a supposedly International airport they are not geared up for large scale passenger arrival numbers. The queues were totally unacceptable, I have waited less time with more people in New Delhi for goodness sake! And why is it when you get through and collect your luggage there are no lifts up to the transit level. You have to struggle with the cases up a metal staired escalator. Not good at all."
26th April 2018,1,"""left with a bad taste departing""
",✅ Trip Verified | Worst security check in. Site said 18-22 minutes - it was nearly an hour. Being so close to the master engineers at Disney it would be beneficial to have them help you with crowd management. Such a lovely place to visit but you are left with a bad taste departing from this airport. We left late afternoon on a Tuesday. Rental return also brutal.
12th April 2018,2,"""It was an absolute mess""","❎ Not Verified |  The most unorganised airport security I have ever encountered. It was an absolute mess, lines not properly defined, no clear signs very little room to get organised. We waited over 30 minutes with no communication only for K9 team to be brought out and even then it took a further 15 minutes to get through the scanners. Shops and food places closing by 9 too in an airport where flights were still departing after this time. Very little choice for food and drink. One restaurant by our gates which couldn't cope with the demand and closed early. Extremely disappointing experience and would put me off visiting Orlando again."
8th April 2018,1,"""will use an alternative airport""",✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airport ever. Even worse than the ones in third world countries. Took 1 hour to get through security check with ‘Priority lane’. The word “efficiency” does not apply to the TSA group here. I will use an alternative airport nearby and drive if I have to come back here. Nearly all passengers are showing frustration while standing in line.
1st April 2018,1,"""the worst airport ever""",❎ Not Verified |  This was the worst airport ever. I am not sure if they know what the word efficient means. Everyone reading this should know they should never come here. They also do fake advertising. I hate this airport. We only moved 2 feet in line in 20 minutes.
29th March 2018,6,"""I waited an hour""
","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando is my home and I think overall the airport does a great job. My only issue is the length of time it takes to get bags. Yesterday I waited an hour. While I was there there were several announcements of changes to where other flights luggage was arriving and a lot of frustrated people. Not a great first impression for our visitors. BTW, there was no storm which understandable cause the lightning delays we have in the summer."
27th March 2018,1,"""long, long lines""","✅ Trip Verified | Hard to navigate and long, long lines! My husband, who’s a police officer, often travels with a fire arm in his checked bag. When checking our bags mine went on a belt right at the Sun Counrty ticket desk. However his that had the firearm in a locked box in the suit case needed to be opened at the desk. Then had to be taken to a complete different area of the airport to be checked by TSA. While I know they take extra precautions why is it so far away? While on the trek downstairs to baggage claim where TSA is I thought to myself I hope his bag finds the right plane. Once landed at MSP and at baggage claim his bag wasn’t there. Honestly this is probably a Sun County and a MCO problem as we’ve contacted both and both seem to not understand the severity of the situation. The only people that took it seriously were the MSP airport police when we filed the claim."
4th March 2018,1,"""unprofessional and outright hostile""","✅ Trip Verified | I fly a lot for business and I have rarely been so disgusted with the unprofessional and outright hostile and demeaning attitude of the TSA screeners. To start with, the entire process of going through TSA security took 35 minutes. Despite people queuing up all the way into the atrium of the airport, TSA only had a few lines open. One of them was fully staffed but TSA officers were just standing around, laughing and high-fiving each other for several minutes. Then, they allowed a number of people who had only just entered, to proceed to this newly opened line, when everyone else who had been waiting for 15+ minutes were kept waiting. One particular demeaning and nasty TSA individual on a power trip was working the line I went through. As usual, there were no bins to put items in so I waited next to the belt. I was then yelled at ""Why are you standing around, you're holding up the line"". I politely explained that I was waiting for them to restock the bins to which he responded by yelling at me, ""Nobody told you to do that, keep moving. You're holding up the line"". I turned to the passengers behind me, and they looked as apologetic as I did. Another TSA worker then quickly restocked the bins, but the hostility and rudeness of the TSA staff really shocked me. I don't think I will be traveling through this airport again if I can avoid it, and rather attend my meeting as a phone call, or worst case, drive. I know TSA does not employ people for their customer service qualities, but is it necessary to become so hostile to passengers?"
16th February 2018,2,"""incredibly busy and too congested""
","✅ Trip Verified | As always, incredibly busy and too congested. Flew Frontier and not many choices for dinner. Ordered a glass of wine, which was $16 and asked the bartender and was told that was the cheapest glass of wine. Then plugged into an outlet at the gate and the stand was not charging. Miserable time again at this airport."
7th February 2018,3,"""Terrible security""","✅ Trip Verified | Terrible security. I literally had 3 merge lanes in TSA. This was like moving cattle and survival of the fittest. People pushed by saying they were missing a plane. TSA did nothing. Projected wait times said 27 minutes and here it is 1 hour later. To top things off by the time my bag went through the check site, TSA stopped paying attention causing luggage to jam up, fall off and a suitcase flipped my laptop bin, crashing it off conveyor and slamming a hard case suitcase on top. Clown show and embarrassing as an Orlando FL, resident. I am starting this business trip in a terrible mood and possibly filing a claim for a damaged computer."
30th January 2018,1,"""by far the worst airport experience""
","✅ Trip Verified | This by far the worst airport experience I have had in a long time. The staff were doing busy-work but the administration is very poorly organized. Our Southwest flight (outbound in 40 minutes) did not show up on the departure screens and the information booth said they were not aware of any outbound flights to that destination around the given time. Unlike most airports, different gate groupings are not connected to each other, which is fine, but it doesn’t say that explicitly at the security check point. A confusing sign at one of the gates made it seem like it would be OK to go through any checkpoint. Fortunately our e-boarding pass finally updated with the gate number but we were on the wrong side of gate groupings. We had to double back out and make it through the other side. God bless you if you have to fly out of this airport."
27th January 2018,1,"""worst airport I have ever been to""","✅ Trip Verified | I have travelled extensively all over the world, including many developing countries. This is the worst airport I have ever been to. The “restaurants” and I use that term loosely, all 2 of them, close at 8 pm, despite the fact that there are flights leaving hours later. This was terminal B. Not sure what terminal A is like but I will make sure to avoid this airport at all costs in the future."
21st January 2018,1,"""It is complete chaos""",❎ Not Verified |  The security process is extremely inefficient. There are multiple lines for the first part that don't move forward consistently and no clear lines to get your bags checked. It is complete chaos and requires luck to make the estimated time given at the beginning of the process.
21st January 2018,1,"""absolute rudeness from employees""","❎ Not Verified |  I have never been more disgusted at the uncleanliness of an airport, and absolute rudeness from employees. Seems like everybody is taking as much time as they can to delay you. The floors and chairs are abysmal as they are covered in slopped food, and the employees seem to care far more about their cell phones than customer service. Will never be returning to this airport, I would rather drive to Florida from Canada (24 hours) than arrive or depart from this airport."
15th January 2018,1,"""Avoid at all costs""","✅ Trip Verified | Avoid at all costs. Currently past security near gates 70-99, including international departures w/duty free. Horrible. No place to sit and dining options abysmal. Burger King coming soon next to Outback Steakhouse. Overwhelming smell of fried food. Carpet old and stained. Come on Orlando."
12th December 2017,6,"""at least be somewhat friendly""
","❎ Not Verified |  Unpleasant security line experience. We were taking a 6am flight on Sunday and found ourselves in front of a huge line of travelers one hour ahead of the departure time. While it was our problem to not arrive earlier, I approached a mid-aged male staff guiding the traffic, asking if there is an express line for people with less than 30 minutes to departure, so that we can be prepared if we couldn't make it in time. First, upon seeing me approaching, the male staff just turned his back towards me, and I had to address him in the front for him to speak with me, and then instead of pointing me to a panel with waiting time (it was above the security check), he replied ""No, you have to wait in line."" I then asked: ""Do you think I can make it"", he says with such plain tones: ""I don't know, you need to arrive early"". And then he turned his back to me again! It wasn't like there were other people around waiting for his help. Thank goodness that the lady at the entrance (who was super busy) was kind enough to tell us that we can make it and we actually made it. I just think that if you'd like to have tourists coming back, at least be somewhat friendly and stop turning your back!"
26th November 2017,1,"""International airport it is not""","✅ Trip Verified | What an absolute disgrace. Worst airport I have visited in my 49 years. Took 8 hours to travel 6700 km across the Atlantic and took 2 hours to move though 100 m queue at TSA. International airport it is not. Not sure I would call it an airport. Queue was full of tired elderly and children. Took over 2 hours to get through. Nowhere to sit, no air-conditioning, obvious lack of ""Ambassador' staff. Not the first time. Last time took 3 hours. On top of that you are not allowed to use your mobile in Immigration Hall. Can anyone explain why or is that just some stupid rule from the dark ages. People waiting outside to pick me up then became worried when I hadn't come through even though they could see my flight had landed. Orlando receives over 20 million visitors a year. Airport cannot even cope with two planes arriving at the same time. Just returned from India and got through within 30 mins. They have the same procedures at Immigration control. Suggestion: Don't bother flying through MCO. In my opinion it should be shut down. Worse service than a third world country."
26th November 2017,2,"""it took us forever to clear the immigration""",❎ Not Verified |  I landed at Orlando International Airport after travelling from Malaysia via Dubai for 27+ hours on an Emirates flight. On arrival we had to wait inside the plane because no immigration officer was available. Imagine waiting inside the plane after travelling 16 hours non stop from Dubai. I was with my 12 month old twins and family. The immigration opened after 1 hour or so and it took us forever to clear the immigration because there were only 2 or 3 officers available. We were holding our babies with their wet diapers in a long line up for immigration clearance. After clearing the immigration we picked up our luggage from the belt. We had around 8 bags and there was no porter service available. Worst part is once we somehow managed to move our carts outside the immigration and baggage pick up we been told that we have to drop our bags at another belt and take the train which will take us to main arrival halls where we had to pick up our luggage again. This is a horrible airport for international travel and I will avoid it at all cost.
25th November 2017,3,"""Needs to be updated""","❎ Not Verified |  Needs to be updated, only fast food restaurants (not many). One sit down restaurant that was only open for lunch. Bathrooms are too small for a major airport, long lines and not clean. Outdated furniture and not much to do in the terminal. Outside of TSA isn't bad but once you go through there is limited selection of anything. I would not fly into this airport unless I absolutely needed to. With some renovations and upgraded this could be a nice airport but it needs some major work."
16th November 2017,2,"""get your immigration system in order""","❎ Unverified |    We flew in mid afternoon on a Friday, flight on time. We left the aircraft promptly (should be thankful compared to some) but herded like cattle into a room with no air conditioning, all 455 of us from a 747. There we stayed maybe for 45 mins before moving into the main immigration room with only half of the available desks staffed. The ceiling was falling down and the queues took us all directly beneath the fragile looking ceiling panels. There we queued for another 1hr and a half before progressing to baggage reclaim where despite the time taken so far we still had to wait for our bags. Then we had to go upstairs via an escalator (Staff at bottom ensuring we could be crammed on, young families with their suitcases), so dangerous! Signage seemed ok. We also flew out twice, both domestic flights and a further arrival also domestic within the space of a week. The security queues on outbound flights were about 30 mins long but staff were on hand to make the various lines as quick as possible. Of course we didn't have to suffer the immigration queues and that is their problem. There appear to be new self service immigration consoles in place but weren't in use at that time. Otherwise the airport is in good order lots of food outlets and other shops. Being such a large airport taxi times seemed quite long. Orlando you must get your immigration system in order, its appalling and has put us off flying international into your airport. The worst I can ever remember!"
16th November 2017,2,"""A totally inefficient system""","✅ Verified Review |  The security at Orlando International airport is terrible. They start with two lines. One of the lines breaks into multiple lines but you don't know that when you get in the line. I had 200 people who got in line after me get through secuirty before me. The staff are slow. We had 30 people waiting to go through the screener while our bags had already been checked. Then once through security they block people from going to the tram until the other side exits. A totally inefficient system. Expect long lines, a lot of TSA around but extremely slow. They should take a lesson from Atlanta airport. The busiest airport in the world is also one of the most efficient with regards to security."
15th November 2017,1,"""infrastructure is totally inadequate""","✅ Verified Review |  Unbelievable queues. Airport infrastructure is totally inadequate for the volume of traffic. Planes held 40 minutes before disembarking passengers due to lack of capacity. People waiting over one hour in queue for to speak to immigration officers, 20 minutes queue for X/ray security. Do not take connecting flight through Orlando. There is a high chance that you will miss your connecting flight."
7th November 2017,2,"""you can do better Orlando""","❎ Unverified |    I had a 2-hour layover in Orlando on October 30th which should have been enough time considering I didn’t have any luggage. The plane landed at 5pm, but due to congestion we were not allowed to disembark until 6pm. Since I knew I wasn’t going to have much time, I downloaded the Mobile Passport App to make immigration faster (I had very good experiences with the App in ATL and JFK). However, when I noted to the staff at immigration that I had submitted mine through Mobile Passport, she rudely said that they ""weren't doing that"". Thankfully the line for US citizens was short and I was out of there in 15 minutes. I followed the signs for connecting flights and had to go through security to get to the main gates, which didn’t take long. Unfortunately, when I got the gates and I checked to screens to confirm my gate number, I noticed that my flight was not posted. I asked a friendly staff in the information kiosk and he informed me that I must be at the wrong terminal and I had to take a shuttle to the correct terminal and get out of the airport and go through TSA again. I panicked since it was 6:15pm and my flight was supposed to start boarding at 6:20pm. I arrived at the correct terminal and spoke with a staff member at the exit and she advised that indeed I would have to go through TSA again. When I told her that my flight had started boarding she said “Yeah, you’re definitely going to miss your flight.” Once I arrived at security check I looked for the TSA pre-check line (which I have) but didn’t see it, so asked the person directing everyone in line and I also mentioned that my flight had already started boarding and he said “You’re probably going to miss your flight but just enter here and ask the staff at the front if you can go in the priority line.” When I arrived at the front of the line before the boarding pass check, I asked the staff member if I could go in the priority line since my flight had started boarding and she said “no, sorry!.” I started panicking, so I asked if the fact that I have TSA Pre-Check made a difference and she said “uhm, TSA pre-check is on the other side” and pointed me to it. I rushed over to the TSA pre-check area and was able to complete the security check in 15 minutes, which compared to everything else in this airport, it was a breeze. Finally, the inefficiency of this airport worked to my advantage and although I arrived 5 minutes after my flight was supposed to take off, there were people still boarding the plane. Moral of the story, I just came believe I had so many staff member telling me that I was going to miss my flight, but none tried to do anything about it. I also don’t understand why the TSA pre-check line is so hidden that not even the staff members know where it is. You can do better Orlando."
18th October 2017,1,"""can't currently meet the demand""
","✅ Verified Review |  A shambles of an airport. After a long flight from the UK we were told by the apologetic captain that we were being held on the tarmac due to there being no free gates available to disembark. He mentioned how it was ridiculous that an airport of their size wasn't prepared for our arrival. When we finally disembarked an hour later, we entered the worst immigration queues I have ever had the misfortune of standing in. Two and a half hours it took, in a room with no air conditioning. We had a toddler that didn't understand what was going on and almost collapsed in the heat. No one was offering water or seats, just warnings that phones must be kept in pockets. To add insult to injury we had to endure the constant repeating of the flash entry video about how easy they make immigration. It was inhumane how they treated people, coming into their country to spend a lot of money. Eventually we got to baggage claim where our bags had been removed from the belts and deposited anywhere there was room. Then we were greeted with huge queues at the car rental desks. It may sound sensationalist, but it has honestly put me off travelling to Orlando again. The way out wasn't much better. An hour and a half to get through security on the way out. Staff looked like they didn't care and were rude and arrogant. I'm not sure I understand the idea of all the best shops and restaurants being before the security checks either. You can't spend any time browsing as you don't know how long it's going to take to get through. Once you get through security your choice is severely limited. Can I make one suggestion? Spend some money on the infrastructure and staff. You can't currently meet the demand. Your airport is an absolute shambles and I won't be returning."
24th September 2017,2,"""requires some modernisation""","✅ Verified Review | Upon arrival and at departure there were problems with passengers not being allowed to exit the plane due to congestion. The staff were unhelpful and impolite, failing to remember we were customers. We ended up with a 5.5 hour delay, partly due to this treatment - it was amusing when the pilot explained that the luggage was being loaded onto the plane by 2 staff as the rest had gone home, which he wanted to do too. The infrastructure here obviously requires some modernisation."
4th September 2017,8,"""Friendly staff""",❎ Unverified |  Good signposting / access to taxis. Wide range of shops / restaurants. Friendly staff. Most impressed with support given to travellers with disabilities. Immediately upon arrival my wife (suffering a dislocated knee) was provided with a wheelchair which she was able to retain to departure gate / taxi service.
3rd September 2017,2,"""staff were officious, rude and abrupt""","❎ Unverified |  Quick initial bag check in with helpful staff, but when we reached security the staff were officious, rude and abrupt! My daughter was stopped for a body search and had her hands swabbed by a very unhelpful member of staff. This upset her a good deal and the procedure was at no time explained to her. When I asked at customer inquiries for a form of contact to make a complaint they were unhelpful and seemed uninterested in my query and unhelpful. Very small and overpriced duty free section. A poor end to our long saved for holiday!"
20th August 2017,6,"""the staff were also very helpful""","✅ Verified Review |  As we arrived at the airport the check in was right in front of us, the staff were also very helpful. It was very easy to find our way around as all signs were clearly visible. We didn't have to wait very long in any queue, the staff sent us to a quicker queue. The airport was very clean, but there isn't many shopping stores around. The terminal seating wasn't great, the wifi wasn't great but it does work, just have to wait a bit."
15th March 2022,2,"""American service is definitely not what it used to be""","Not Verified |  This is the worst airport I ever seen in my life. It took 1.5 hours to get through security. Only 2 TSA agent checking ID and 1 belt running, so disorganized, simply ignoring people. The airport employees are rude, just saying use your eyes to find a seat to put your shoes back on, seriously. American service is definitely not what it used to be. This airport is filthy - the departures lounges treated in such a bad way with rubbish such as food boxes and empty bottles left on seating, left on the floor - left everywhere, no garbage trash cans for it. With Covid 19 cleanliness should be a priority - here it is not, people in TSA line not even 6 fts apart. I've been flying for over 20 years, and never seen such a sad airport. I'm hoping someone, like a manager or CEO is actually reading all this bad reviews, and can change this for better way."
9th March 2022,2,"""Worst airport in US""",✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airport in US. Poor signage. A long haul to the rental car center and no idea how far it is. Involves Skytrain and elevators and a lot of walking. The airport website not helpful in planning how to get there. Some waiting areas filthy and this is early morning. Food and grime on seats. One male restroom had only one toilet the rest all urinals. Grumpy American Airlines departure agent unhelpful. ID scanner malfunctioning
26th February 2022,3,"""the worst airport I've ever been in""","✅ Trip Verified | I've been flying solo since I was 7 so over 20 years. This is the worst airport I've ever been in. Staff were less than helpful, TSA was disorganized and simply ignoring people trying to go through the screening, and ""valet"" baggage check people were genuinely rude. Shout out to the guy at currency exchange for being helpful and friendly! He was a lone beacon of professionalism and general politeness. If I have to drive an extra 30 miles or so to go out of Ft. Lauderdale going forward, I will."
22nd February 2022,1,"""poorly trained and poorly supervised personnel""","Not Verified |  I'm glad I finally used Miami as my re-entry port on a return from Jamaica. It taught me a valuable lesson. Never, ever, use this airport for your international connections. They won't certify this review but all you have to do is look at all the previous reviews for the exact same issues weeks and months ago. Woefully understaffed, contract security couldn't even answer questions like. Which line is which and these appeared to be supervisory personnel. They were so bad they couldn't keep the lines organized and there were no signs no directions. The TSA were just as bad. We travel internationally a couple of times a year and have never had to go back through screening after clearing customs and immigration. Maybe rules have changed, but the TSA was overwhelmed. It was kind of sad actually. Dozens and dozens of passengers from any airline coming through on 2/20 in the evening, missed their connections due to poorly trained and poorly supervised personnel. If you don't have at least a four hour cushion to make your connection you won't make it. Just imagine what it will be like when the airports get really busy. Use Charlotte instead."
20th February 2022,1,"""Miami Airport was understaffed""","✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines continues to disappoint, as does the Miami airport. Flight from Barbados arrived 100% on time, and was even acknowledged by the gate clerk who rebooked me on standby the next morning. Connection left a number of us stranded when Miami Airport was understaffed and got our luggage to us late for transfer, and couldn’t get us through the line in time. I’m sleeping in the airport tonight as AA is taking no responsibility for not holding the plane and leaving us all behind. I’ve been flying for 5 decades and this may be the most disgraceful and incompetent handling of a trip I’ve ever seen."
14th February 2022,1,"""Worst airport I have experienced""","✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airport I have experienced in the United States and I fly about once per month. American Airlines terminal security checkpoint took 1.5 hours to get through. I have not seen lines like this since shortly after 9/11. To make matters worse, TSA and MIA employees were doing nothing to assist in keeping the lines organized or moving forward. This entire process was a free for all. Once in the gate area, there is almost no where to charge electronic devices in the gate areas besides one desk with two electrical outlets. The American Airlines customer service was terrible and had multiple gate changes. The gates in this airport can also be extremely far apart and one gate change took almost 15 minutes to walk to without an easier and accessible way to speed this up such as a walking escalator. I ordered food at Wendy’s thinking this would be the quickest possible food and gave up waiting for my food after I had been waiting for 30 minutes. Overall, I can confidently say my experience at Miami International was the worse travel experience I have had in the last two decades. I will make a conscious effort to avoid flying into or connecting through MIA if at all possible."
1st February 2022,1,"""airport employees are rude and give very little information""",✅ Trip Verified | This airport is a joke. It took 1.5 hours to get through security. Only 1 TSA agent checking ID and 1 belt running. Because of this we missed our flight. Had to stand in line another 1.5 hours in a “rebooking line.” What should have been a direct 3.5 hour flight turned into an all day marathon at 3 different airports. The airport employees are rude and give very little information. That was my first and last time I will ever use Miami International.
31st January 2022,2,"""With Covid 19 cleanliness should be a priority - here it is not!""","Not Verified |  American service is definitely not what it used to be. This airport is filthy - the departures lounges treated in such a bad way with rubbish such as pizza boxes left on seating, left on the floor - left everywhere. I can’t believe what I am seeing, such a disgrace. With Covid 19 cleanliness should be a priority - here it is not!"
29th December 2021,1,"""A really horrid, unnecessarily stressful, disorganised experience""","Not Verified |  This place is the gateway to hell. I am totally mortified at the service of this ""Great Nation"", it's attitude towards its visitors is shocking. We were only there for a connecting flight which the rude and extremely unhelpful staff made us miss. Disorganised, over priced, dirty. Apart from the guy that helped us after we missed our connecting flight which there was absolutely no time for due to the queues at passport control and then back in through security check. There were no signs showing where to go for connecting flights. We found the connection flight queue eventually after being stuffed in a huge snake like queue, packed in like sardines. At one point, a guy started letting all the US Nationals through to get their queue down and they took preference over the connecting flights. We only had 35 mins to board by this point. Needless to say flight missed. One horrid woman was so nasty to me when we missed our flight (which I sprinted through the airport to get to) I was stunned. A really horrid, unnecessarily stressful, disorganised experience. Never again! I give minus points. I do not recommend."
29th December 2021,2,"""the worst airport I’ve flown through""","Not Verified |  Miami airport is by far the worst airport I’ve flown through and I’ve had to fly through it several times. Going through customs is always a mess, with long wait times for bags, disorganized rechecking of baggage, and then subsequent security checks that make you almost miss your connecting flights. The lines are always long, the TSA agents are so disrespectful, rude, and separate families who should be together all with TSA pre check. It is always a crapshoot knowing what rules and regulations they are going to enforce and then be rude to you about when you either do the maximum expected protocols, or don’t because the list literally says you don’t have to (take your shoes off, take your belt off or wallet out with an expedited screening.) Such a mess and I feel like I am literally in a foreign country. No staff speaks English to you, they all start out in Spanish and expect you to talk to them in Spanish. If you can steer clear of this airport at all, I would!"
22nd December 2021,1,"""half the staff not wearing masks""","Not Verified |  Worst airport I have ever been in - filthy, rude staff in most departments especially going through security, no please or thank you. Herd you through as if your inhuman, will never use this airport again. Seating area is a mess everywhere, toilets also filthy, half the staff not wearing masks."
23rd November 2021,1,"""Avoid the G gates for departures at MIA at all costs""","Not Verified |  Avoid the G gates for departures at MIA at all costs. The security line on a Sunday morning was over an hour and a half long, and literally snaked through the terminal. As of the time of this review, the following airlines use the G gates: Bahamasair, Southwest, Sun Country, and United Airlines. There is only one TSA checkpoint that serves this concourse, zero signs for TSA PreCheck, and clueless employees attempting to organize the chaos. Additionally, the contracted employees that work at the airport (working for a third-party employer rather than actual airline employees) are absolutely miserable, and treat customers like they're an inconvenience. I think the larger D gates at the airport offer a better experience as there are four TSA entry points. The G gates, with minimal seating, an air conditioner that barely works, and next to nothing for food options, are a nightmare."
30th October 2021,1,"""shambles of an immigration service at Miami airport""","Not Verified |  Can you score a negative? Absolute shambles of an immigration service at Miami airport. When I first arrived, I thought long queue, yes, but 40 terminals, this shouldn't be too bad. I noticed were were moving fairly slowly and then, as I first glimpsed it, the horror hit. For us 'non-citizens' only 27 terminals were available, doesn't sound too bad still however there were only 2 (two - I have to put it in brackets as it is barely believable), officers on duty for us So for the 3 flights of majority 'non-citizens' that had recently arrived (my approximation at least 400) we were being served by 2 officers. Well as you can imagine, considering they like to ask an awful lot of questions and take photos and fingerprints and all of that, it took an awful long time (4hrs by my count). Didn't even get a stamp in my passport (because of COVID) alright for people to stand in close proximity to each other for 4hrs though! First impressions of the 'greatest country in the world'- not so great."
23rd October 2021,1,"""Absolutely terrible airport""","Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible airport. Waited at customs for 45 minutes, they were severely understaffed and were closing lines despite the growing crowds that were about to miss their flights. We then had to get our luggage from baggage claim at the other end? We then had to go check our bags in again? (Why couldn’t they just transport our bags like a typical airport?) Next, we waited at TSA for so so long. We were told to move to different lines 3 times, each at different locations. The TSA staff was insanely rude, despite letting them know (nicely) we were about to miss our connecting flight. We then had to run across the entire airport to almost miss our flight. Terrible experience."
13th October 2021,1,"""rude at check in and getting through TSA""",✅ Trip Verified |  Employees are rude at check in and getting through TSA. The selection of beverages at restaurants and shopping locations is extremely limited. The gate has never remained the same as when booking or arriving the handful of times I have used this airport. I try to eat close to the gate I will be boarding at but with the 3-5 changes per-flight it is next to impossible.
7th September 2021,1,"""65+ minutes for your bags""","Not Verified |  I have never traveled through an airport that is so disorganized. If you want to wait 65+ minutes for your bags, this is the place. Workers must be playing tic tac toe on your bags while they make you wait."
16th August 2021,1,"""So dirty and unorganize""","Not Verified |  This airport has really fallen far since I was last here. So dirty and unorganized, I feel like I just stepped into a third world country. I will 100% never fly through Miami international again. Ft. Lauderdale may be smaller, but this is terrible. Everyone was so rude to us, being here feels like some kind of elaborate joke. So miserable."
26th July 2021,1,"""Worst airport I have ever been in""","Not Verified |  Worst airport I have ever been in. Seating at the gates is practically non-existent, TSA agents are rude and slow, baggage took 40 minutes to carousel. Restrooms were awful, like a dirty mall bathroom. The Eighties called, they want their airport back."
24th July 2021,1,"""I will not travel through there again""","Not Verified |  This July my wife and I were on our way to Panama for holiday and flew from Dammam to Frankfurt to Miami in order to get connections to Panama City. We had been through two different airports on two different continents, for me to arrive for a transfer in my home country. Only in the US was I treated horribly. It started with the Global Entry ""staff"". The man at the desk that verifies the receipt from the kiosk was rude to everyone we saw him interact with, including a man traveling with his young daughter. He yelled at this man for not clearing his child through Global Entry. Next we got to experience collecting our bags for the international transfer. There was no person working in the baggage claim area to answer any questions, such as if we had to do the transfer ourselves. Next we had to check in to Copa Airlines. Rudest airline I have ever dealt with in my travels. Then 34 USD for a beer and small Moscow Mule. Overall the experience in Miami was the low point of our trip. I will not travel through there again. I recommend you avoid the place like the COVID-19."
15th July 2021,1,"""Impatient, rude, short, uniformed staff""","Not Verified |  Impatient, rude, short, uniformed staff! Talked to 4 different staff members and all had an attitude, security was unorganized and no one could inform me in which direction to go."
14th July 2021,2,"""Nobody was policing the wearing of masks""",Not Verified |  Airport was very poorly managed. The TSA staff at baggage security were a shambles. No signs or instructions. The duty manager sat behind his desk and was on his phone on Facebook! The Business lounge was the dirtiest I've ever been in. Nobody was policing the wearing of masks. This with the lack of cleanliness during a worldwide pandemic is unforgivable.
30th June 2021,2,"""Very poor customer service""","Not Verified |  We arrived at Miami International Airport at 7.23 pm from Chicago on June 29/2021, AA flight 971. Two hours later our luggage’s have not even been uploaded into the baggage carrousel, and the airport just said that the ramp has to be closed due to weather. Other flights they arrived much later have already pick up their luggage. This is Florida, an airport of this magnitude should be prepared for rain and heavier weather conditions. This is unacceptable. Very poor customer service. Shame we are forced to fly to this airport."
15th May 2021,3,"""people were trying to get food and there was limited available""",Not Verified |  It took nearly 45 min to get through security and then we wanted to sit down and enjoy a meal and most places were closed at 4.45 pm.

28th April 2021,2,"""Won’t fly here again unless absolutely necessary""","Not Verified |  This is the worst airport I have ever experienced! A 20 minute walk (7,000 steps!) to the train that goes to the rental car center after you get all of your luggage! Concourse G has very little food, beverages or gift outlets. One charging pole with 4 outlets per gate! This is unacceptable to today’s traveller! It’s dark, old and badly needs updates into this century (21 years late!) with the amount of tourism money passing through it would seem logical to use some at MIA! Won’t fly here again unless absolutely necessary."
24th April 2021,3,"""this is no way to treat a customer""","Not Verified |  Today is Saturday April 24th, 1.15pm. I am on the 1st floor E International Arrivals. All information kiosks are closed. There is a woman in uniform sitting at a desk. Clearly works at the airport. I tried to ask her for directions where people from Cayman Airways come out from. She screamed at me to get away if I can’t read signs. I was standing under a do not enter sign attempting to talk to her. All she would do is yell at me in a different language I could not understand. It’s this kind of attitude that I as a business owner would not tolerate. Maybe she was watching something important on her phone and I interrupted her. Who knows but this is no way to treat a customer."
16th April 2021,3,"""MIA is incapable of doing security now""","Not Verified |  MIA is incapable of doing security now. Never have I ever experienced any 1 security line with more than 4 checkpoints at each terminal. On top of this with covid travel numbers. Security doesn't care if you miss flight and they actively laugh at you while living through high stress and anxiety. They have all the tools to make it run smoothly, they have unprofessional and sloth moving people. Covid has created an apathy to get people to work. How are we supposed to get back to work if no one actually wants to do their job. Not once was a supervisor present to get things moving. I also checked the security wait times online in the MIA airport and they were completely inaccurate. My estimated time online was 9 min, at airport it was 12, and then the actually amount of time to get through security was 50 min!"
2nd November 2020,1,"""Not enough staff for the demand of clients""","Not Verified |  The security lines are poorly organized. Not enough staff for the demand of clients, only 4 officials were designated for us citizens, out of 24 cabins only 4 operating. Missed my connecting flight. No one cared, no connecting officials designated to connecting flights what a shame! Wonder if the governor knows where his money is assigned to."
16th March 2020,4,"""slow security lines""","✅ Trip Verified |  Although airport is airy and modern, it’s plagued with the same issues at all US airports slow security lines and long walks from security to terminals, the biggest problem is from when you drop off your car to the security line is between 15-25 minutes depending on the gate, lots of walking, escalators, tram etc."
13th March 2020,2,"""MIA is just not acceptable""","✅ Trip Verified | Landed home to the USA after 10 hour flight in from Europe because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yes, I admit the stress and concerns of social distancing is high but my airport observations despite the travel tensions are true. Kudos to the information booth attendant in terminal 1. However, brace yourselves for the lax unprofessional TSA team. Only once before, serving jury duty, had I ever felt like I was being processed for incarceration - like a bad movie scene. I flew into MIA once before 11 years ago and it was bad. It's worse. I only flew in to avoid JFK but MIA is just not acceptable."
29th February 2020,1,"""Horrible experience""","Not Verified |  Horrible experience. 11 hours flight, then 3 hours queuing to an unpolite policeman. Children and ald people in the same queue. Lost our driver, who was not able to wait more than 1 hour. Something which does not happen at least in Northern Europe, UK or Middle Europe."
28th February 2020,1,"""Horrific experience""",Not Verified |  Horrific experience at Miami airport. Massive lineups at customs and immigration. Then had to go through security to transit. Took 2 hours. Very poorly organised. If u ever feel like a cattle experience Miami where to come and experience it!
28th February 2020,1,"""no signage""","Not Verified |  This airport has the worst international transfer set up I have ever experienced. After waiting in lines for about 40 minutes to get through customs, you have to literally exit the airport. There is no signage for connection flights, you just have to go the baggage claim. From baggage claim you have to collect your checked baggage. Again no signage. You then have to go completely back through security. Anything you bought at your last airport, duty free, any liquids will be thrown out. Again zero signage giving you a heads up that you might want to check anything you've bought while stuck at your last airports. So heads up, this airport is terrible. Avoid it if possible for international transfer. My opinion of JFK just went way up!"
23rd February 2020,5,"""the airport is always too cold""",Not Verified |  Been here several times over the last 3 years and the airport is always too cold. So cold that I have heard many complaints and everyone is wearing heavy jackets. What is up with that? You have to go outside in February to warm up! Doesn’t make any sense and is miserable to be here.
17th February 2020,3,"""What a shambles!""","✅ Trip Verified | After a 9 hour flight from the UK, we arrived in Miami. What a shambles! We queued with hundreds of other people for 2 hours to get through the Visa check. It seemed as if everybody went for their break at the same time! Good planning (not). The line just did not move. We were shouted into a queue to take our photo and fingerprints on a machine and then shouted at again to get into yet another queue with hundreds of people waiting to see a Customs Officer. We were told to present a copy of the photo we already had taken at the machine. He did exactly the same thing as we had already done and took yet another photo but, this time taking fingerprints of both hands. What an absolute joke this airport is. The rudeness of one of the officials astounded us. He must have been an ex serviceman or police officer in a former life. He was aggressive and treated everybody as if they were 10 years old. He shouted at anybody that did not get in the correct line. It is really not acceptable to have these sort of people working in this environment. This has put us off visiting Miami/Florida again. Look at the other reviews, it says it all!"
13th February 2020,2,"""Not professional at all""","Not Verified |  Arrived from Barcelona and cleared customs with sufficient time to get aboard an earlier departure flight to my next destination. The Departures sign board indicated the gate as D 9 (if memory serves), so we quickly followed the signs towards corridor D. But guess what, even though one hallway was clearly marked with a D (and an arrow) it had a barrier across the entrance and a big floor sign: No Admittance. So back we went to the main corridor, where we saw directional arrows for Gates D-E etc, so down that corridor we race, looking for an American Rebooking desk. None in sight, anywhere, despite this being a major American hub. Stopped at one gate that was staffed and asked where the rebooking desk was, and was told it was something like D-37 or D-3, and then the agent volunteered that one might be a little closer, so off in that direction we ran. When we finally got there, we were told that the doors had already been closed (never mind that it would have been about a 15 minute walk to get there anyway). So we resigned ourselves to an interminable wait down near D-1, where a bottled beer was ""only"" $10.50, not counting tax and a ""suggested tip of $1.50."" When it finally was near time for the departure for the later flight, suddenly there was a flurry of activity at the adjacent gates, when apparently four American flights were to depart within 15 minutes of one another from gates D-1 to D-5. And since there seemed to be only one PA, the assembled passengers became understandably restless when the gate attendant announced ""we are now boarding Groups 1 and 2"" without bothering to state the destination or flight number. Confusing? You bet. Especially when said announcement was drowned out by another PA telling ""passenger XXX, please report to the gate."" Final boarding began when five wheelchairs were rolled to the plane, followed very quickly by anyone who simply showed his/her boarding pass and walked aboard. There was only one American gate agent on duty, apparently all the others were still dealing with the adjacent flights. Not professional at all."
30th January 2020,1,"""They are useless, and do not even attempt to improve""","✅ Trip Verified | I had a connection in Miami last week, and not a lot of time before landing from Spain and needing to transfer, so I was in a rush to get to my connecting gate. I used mobile pass and went through and asked the person which queue to get into, and she said 35 or 36. I went to 36, and the officer at the desk said I was in the wrong line. I asked him which line was the correct one and pointed at the woman behind us (she was maybe 10 feet behind me) and said ""she told me to go to this line"" and he just waived randomly to the other 35 lines and said ""back there"". He did not even bother looking up from his cell phone. So, I went back to the woman who had told me originally that it was line 35 or 36, and she said, ""oh, I meant 34 or 35."" (We were standing right in front of lines 34, 35, and 36.) She seriously could not have been less concerned that she's giving out misinformation. The officer in line 36 also could not be bothered to simply say the queue right next to him was the correct one. Seriously. They are useless, and do not even attempt to improve. They should all be fired for their attitudes and giving out incorrect information. This is not the first time I've had a terrible experience flying through Miami and I avoid it whenever possible."
16th January 2020,1,"""disgusted with the level of nastiness and ignorance""","✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely disgusted with the level of nastiness and ignorance by the employees. Our tickets told us to go to terminal H. Once we passed security and went to our gate we were told it had changed to G. The security at G wouldn't let us pass because the tickets said terminal H. It took us forever to persuade them that the flight terminal and gate were changed. At this point my mother-in-law couldn't walk anymore because we were standing in line forever and she is elderly and has diabetes. When we asked for help several employees sneered and were sarcastic asking if they should roll out the red carpet for us. It was just the two of us and 4 kids. My daughter had dropped hot water on her chest just an hour before and was treated by first responders (who were absolutely amazing) at the Military Lounge, so I couldn't help her, my mother-in-law, and the other 3 kids all at the same time. Because my MIL could barely walk we were talking to each other that chances are we'd miss our flight, at which point one of the TSA agents started yelling how she didn't care and sat for over 10 mins without letting me have my shoes or my daughter's ice pouch the first responders gave us. They absolutely refused to let us keep the aloe we were given by the medics because I refused to show them my daughter's burned chest! She is 7! She was already distressed because of the second degree burns. She had huge blisters on her belly and chest that were treated by the medics and bandaged. Where is your humanity? Is your life so miserable you need to take it out on a little girl who sat in pain for 4 hours because you couldn't let her have her medicine? How dare you ask to see my daughter's bare chest to confirm she has burns? It's called HIPAA for a reason. You are not a medical professional. Is your day better because you managed to put down a military spouse, her four children and her mother-in-law? I cannot believe these are the people my husband serves and protects."
9th January 2020,1,"""an absolute joke of a terminal""",Not Verified |  What an absolute joke of a terminal. Nothing open at 21:00 and the staff excuses absolutely shocking. Goodness knows how this place is still doing business. Would never travel out of this place again out of choice.

You run around looking for customs and immigration when you think you caught a break finding the automatic passport control, your very wrong they print this piece of paper that's practically useless because it asks you to visit a customs official, just spent 2 hours running around like a headless chicken. After 2 hours you finally find the queue to go through passport control to find out there are 600 people queuing up and only 5 passport control officers serving at a time, absolutely appaling I literally got 1 hour now till my flight leaves avoid this airport at all costs worst airport in the whole planet."
31st December 2019,2,"""airport needs some serious love and attention""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport needs some serious love and attention! All staff are so rude but also in their defence look very stressed. The airport security is just plain weird, you go down this weird slope, all the staff are chatting to each other grunting at customers and I would say not throughly checking each individual! I went to walk through the security scanner and it was clearly half working it out when I walked through the lady asked me to pause, I waited 2 minutes expecting to be asked to go back through - nope! She looked at me up and down shrugged her shoulders and let me through now that is just crazy! The carpets smell too, the decor is stuck in the 70-80’s whenever the airport was built and they have done nothing to jazz anything up a bit. The departure area consists of a small bar and a Pizza Hut, always a huge queue in each because there is nowhere else to go. I love Miami and have travelled many times but I absolutely detest flying to and from Miami airport. Worst part of my trip by far."
15th November 2019,1,"""Avoid this airport like the plague""","Not Verified |  Avoid this airport like the plague. They treat people like cattle and wait times for immigration can be (and I’m not kidding) 3+ hours for citizens! You can arrive on any day and at nearly any time and lose so much time standing in long lines. I travel all over the world, this is by far the worst airport for entering a country on the entire planet. Don’t believe me? Read the other reviews or suffer the consequences."
7th November 2019,4,"""AC is not working""","Not Verified | This day Nov 6, 2019, the AC is not working and according to the attendant at the counter, it has been like that since yesterday. The last time I was so uncomfortable at an airport was in Lagos, Nigeria where the AC normally does not work. Miami has joined the ranks of underdeveloped countries. Where is the contingency management for a failure like this? Is it the remnants of our Latin Heritage that still prevail in the airport management team?"

21st August 2019,1,"""hardly words to describe how abysmal this airport is""","Not Verified |  There are hardly words to describe how abysmal this airport is. I had 2 hours to make a connection from Mexico City to Hartford. American Airlines should have known better than to book such a short layover through this wretched place. The plane was delayed 15 minutes on the tarmac and then 10 more at the gate when no agent was available to operate the entryway. Then, there was an interminable walk through unmarked hallways to an interminable immigration line. There, after being herded to the automated kiosks, I was herded to wait over 40 minutes for an agent who was gleefully asking smug questions of every U.S. citizens in line, spending an average of 5 minutes with each person. Other lines moved more quickly at this point, so this is clearly a particular agent’s power trip. At this point, when I tried to find where to re-check my luggage, an agent rudely asked me for when my connnection was. This was the first time I was asked about my connection time, notwithstanding the “short layover” stickers that had been plastered all over my suitcase. At this point, the rude American Airlines employee told me to go to a different line from the one which I was standing, with now explanation. I assumed, incorrectly, that this was an expedited line, since I still had around 40 minutes to catch my flight. It was not. The door that the rude agent sent me through took me outside of security to the airline agents for rebooking. I learned from another agent that I had been sent there because other agents decided that the remaining 40 minutes was not sufficient for me to make my connection. And, throughout the process, the half-dozen or so staff members that I had the misfortune of interacting with were extraordinarily rude and impassive to the fact that they were part of an inefficient and abusive machine that was making thousands of passengers miserable. Unfortunately, I need to make this same trip for work several times a year. In the future, it will cost me around a hundred dollars to book itineraries on a different airline (probably Delta) in order to avoid this airport. It will be worth every penny."
8th August 2019,3,"""MIA is in a category by itself""","✅ Trip Verified | I have lived and worked in ten countries and flown into and out of dozens of airports. Some are acceptable, others are good, and a few are excellent. MIA is in a category by itself. Apart from the worst parking facilities I have ever encountered and an urgent need to improve its shoddy appearance, the immigration service seems to consist mostly of incompetent agents. After sitting in the Interjet airliner for a full hour after boarding and a flight of about two and a half hours, it took my wife and little granddaughter another three hours to pass through immigration and customs. Such gross inefficiency and total lack of caring for passenger needs is reprehensible. Those responsible for running such an operation should be relieved of their jobs and replaced by competent personnel. Clearly, the travelling public deserves something better than this. Our family will surely not be the only one to avoid using this airport for our future travel needs."
7th July 2019,1,"""irritated with the arrival line for immigration""",Not Verified |  I am very irritated with the arrival line for immigration. We got there from a 15 hour flight and had to wait in line for 2 hours just to go in to get our luggage. We had plans to meet up with a friend and weren't even able to do that thanks to the delay. A child was with us and they didn't even have they courtesy to let her sit anywhere. Many people had connections and barely/didnt made/make it.
7th July 2019,2,"""Worst customs service I have ever experienced""","Not Verified |  Worst customs service I have ever experienced. There were 75 customs desks but only 2 open. This was to service a full load of passengers from a Boeing 777. It wasn't until I had spent two and a half hours waiting in the queue that they finally opened some additional desks. It took 3 hours just to have my passport checked! It took 30 minutes at Montego Bay in Jamaica. I spoke to a couple, who missed their connecting flight by 5 minutes, due to the unacceptable time waiting in this queue and as a result, lost 1 day of their holiday, Fort Worth Texas, was quicker but still took over an hour. When I asked if there was anyway of speeding up the process, as it was quite likely that I would miss my connecting flight back to the UK, the airport staff just stated that there was nothing to be done in order to speed the process up. This experience puts you off wanting to take a holiday in America in the future."

From the gate to the baggage claim was extremely far, signage was unclear and there were no alternative transportation options. After that, we had to walk with all our bags and two small children two concourses over, easily 1 km. Though we asked if there were any transportation options, shuttle or train etc, there was nothing and we were denied any assistance from those we asked. The line at security took us roughly 30 minutes and they did not have enough trays for people to use. What an embarrassment of an airport."

Have avoided flying through MIA, preferring longer flights and not having to deal with the personnel."
9th May 2019,1,"""Simply awful""

I will never and stress never return to this airport and will avoid it like the plague."
8th May 2019,1,"""An absolute disgrace of an airport""",Not Verified |  An absolute disgrace of an airport. Transiting passengers should not have to go through passport control with the rest of the arriving passengers. Extremely inconvenient to have to collect bags and check them in again. Almost missed our connecting flight due to incredibly long queues made worse by the fact that only 3 lanes were open. To top it all off - extremely unhelpful staff. Worst customer service ever. To say we are disappointed is an understatement.
28th April 2019,1,"""Absolutely awful""","✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely awful. We had just under three hours for a connection, and almost missed our flight. The immigration queues were endless, and most of the desks were closed. We had to jump through the queues for immigration officers (thank you to those who allowed us to do so) having already waited an hour to use the machines. There were virtually no staff around, and those that were there couldn’t care less if you miss your flight. No allowances made for those who have connecting flights. Why do Americans put up with this and why doesn’t the airport do anything?"
20th April 2019,1,"""poor management""","✅ Trip Verified | Zero stars if I could rate that low. We sat in the runway for 35-45 minutes after arrival from Barbados - the reasoning because of “other aircraft that needed to taxi”. Go ahead and start the stop watch. We needed to make a connecting flight to Richmond, and we only had an hour to get to our other aircraft. Well 35 minutes wasted sitting in the runway. Thank you either aircraft controllers or American Airlines. Once we were off the plane (another 10 minutes after waiting on the runway ) we made our way through one customs line where literally 500 hundred people were waiting. We waited in customs for another hour - at this point our plane had already started boarding for Richmond. After making it through the customs checks, there were 6 other customs officers sitting around talking and laughing (twiddling their thumbs) Maybe they could have helped open up more lanes in customs? No - poor management. To add on top of all of this, the one line was full of Miami residents that did not need to make a connecting flight. Maybe they could have opened up a different line for solely connecting flights? No - poor management. After customs we then had to pick up our luggage at baggage claim and recheck our luggage! I get this was American Airlines however this was another wasted 30 minutes. After all of this was said and done all but one American line was open so our so called “pre-check passes were useless “After talking with a behind the counter representative from American, they would not reimburse us for a hotel or could they guarantee a seat in the next flight to Richmond. After staying the night in Miami on our expense, we arrived to our gate and American Airlines informed us only seat was available and that my wife could go ahead while I had to wait for another flight 10 hours later. But guess what? This was not a guaranteed seat either. Looks like I’ll be staying in Miami until the I purchase my own set of tickets again. All in all, this was a nightmare that the airport or American Airlines did not want to admit to their poorly planned schematics of arrivals and connecting flights. Hands down the worst flying experience I have ever encountered. - thank you TSA, Customs and American Airlines for ruining my trip. You can check me off your list of being a returning customer. I hope 1000s will read this so they can be forewarned of possible miseries. Something that could have been completely avoided if Miami knew how to run an airport."

Crowded lounges, not many places to sit, strange DutyFree with taxes and the shops are the same. A little note: when you arrive, passport control will be very fast - because machines check the passports of any country, and when you leave the USA, you don't need to pass thru the passport control."
24th February 2019,1,"""ignorant, impatient and rude""","✅ Trip Verified | Dreadful airport. Security staff were ignorant, impatient and rude. My teenage children felt harassed and chastised during the security process even though they followed orders. The instructions weren’t written or clear and the process was long winded and stressful. We heard the security lady complaining about people being impatient but felt this was totally inappropriate in the circumstances. We are currently sat in the admirals lounge in the flagship area for Oneworld passengers and the service and food are disappointing. The body language of the staff is not good (shaking heads and huffing at guests etc) and overall this airport is definitely not one we want to return to in a hurry."
15th February 2019,1,"""worst airport in the modern world""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst airport I’ve ever had to navigate. We had a 3 hours layover where we were coming in from London. 1. Air traffic control had us circle for 20 minutes. Ok, that happens. 2. Once we landed we were stuck on the tarmac for 40 minutes due to another plane not having docked correctly? and lack of communication regarding which gates the preceding planes were to be at. This doesn’t really happen much, so it was frustrating. 3. We had to go through two different rounds of security screening before having to pick up our checked bags. At the first one, even though we’re had the mobile passport completed, there was no line for mobile passport and with 6 kiosks only 2 were open; one exclusively for crew and global entry with the other for everyone else. 4. We had to then collect our luggage, which took another 30 minutes, to be randomly selected to have them rummage through our things. 5. Once they unfolded everything and left it a mess we were dismissed and sent towards the exit. We then had to recheck our bags at the airline desk which was on a different level and a long way away. Luckily, an airline staff member allowed us to skip the line and simply drop the bags. This was the one person who was helpful; airline staff. 6. Next we had to go through airport security again, however, this time it was the same security you go through if you were just arriving to the airport. Keep in mind we had just gotten off of an airplane here at the airport. Once in the line we got to hurry up and wait while 6 TSA employees condescendingly yelled at everyone. Nothing helpful from them, just threats to slow the line if their power-trip-orders weren’t obeyed. If someone failed to zip up their backpack before sending it through the scanner, instead of asking them to zip it, the person was chastised in front of the crowd. 7. The line of travelers constantly growing while the Walmart approach (having many registers with only one open) was adopted by the TSA staff. One screening conveyor belt was in use while 3 others were closed. With the exception of the lady who was running the conveyor belt, who would not make eye contact with anyone even when asked why my sealed clear bag from the duty free store back in a London was set aside. Nope, my duty free items needed to be taken out and run through another scanner. 8. What was the rest of the TSA staff doing? Literally walking around in circles not know who was supposed to do what. I heard “hey, who is on this one?” And “I though so and so was supposed to be here still” along with other statements that really reassured me our safety was the priority and was being handled by professionals. 9. We were reassured that once through this last “security” check that the gate was literally just up another escalator. Nope. Next we had to jump on yet another shuttle. 10. What’s the best part of this whole experience. The arrival gate (e24) was in the same terminal as the departure gate (e31). All of that fuss was to go through customs. In short, this is the worst airport in the modern world to deal with and I will gladly pay more to fly through another airport in the future so that I can avoid this from happening again."
4th February 2019,1,"""An awful experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Oh dear no. An awful experience. When you stand in a queue for an hour and 15 minutes with no access to a toilet and nowhere to sit it leaves a bad taste. I have to remind myself as meander like I’m in a queue at Disney that we are meant to be in the most advanced 1st world country on earth. I mean the citizens of this country landed men on the moon 50 years ago and sent satellites to the furthest edges of our solar system yet they can’t efficiently push people through airport arrivals. So after an hour and 15 minutes in a queue we were put into an area of robotic machines by semi robotic staff. One must put the four fingers of one hand on a glass plate on the machine, feed their passport into a slot and look at a light for the machine to take your photograph as if you are facing prison. The machine then spits out a paper ticket with your photo and passport details. In our case although the ticket told us to proceed out one of the semi robotic staff put us to another darn queue. This one took another 45 minutes and when we got to the counter we got to do it all over again. That’s to say, fingerprinted, photographed and passport examined. So what moron thinks it’s a good idea to push hundreds of people to machines only to then put them to human beings to do the exact same thing all over again? Insane duplication and a complete waste of time. I think the Germans call this verschlimmbesserung. So two hours with no access to water, toilet or a seat and to make matters much much worse was that whenever airline crew arrived they got preference over us to go through immigration with no consideration for the fact we’d been standing for hours. When I arrived at the airport I had a lot of sympathy for the folks working here because with the 21st century reincarnation of PT Barnum in the White House they weren’t getting paid but by the time I was standing an hour I felt I wouldn’t pay them either. Barnum may be on capitol hill but arrivals at Miami airport was a horrible circus all of its own."

This is by far the worst, unfriendly, unhelpful and delayed airport we have ever experienced. Our decision after the last layover is that we will never ever go through MIA again. They are in desperate need of serious customer service training for all employees from bathroom personnel to ticket counter agents and everyone in between that you will come in contact with. Good luck!"
15th December 2018,3,"""airport is not very customer friendly""
","Not Verified |  The airport is not very customer friendly. I was to go to Terminal E for both trips through Miami and I must say the E is clearly the reject terminal. It’s disconnected from the main terminal and plenty hard to get to. Even with the train, it’s still an awkward and seemingly unnecessary drag of a walk. I’d consider myself an able-bodied, active and healthy young woman but I can only imagine being a passenger who needs more time and assistance to make it from point A to B. Terminal E (the reject) has the worst food and store accommodations I have ever seen. There is very little variety and no real restaurants. It’s pretty pathetic. If I hadn’t spent all that trouble trying to get to E, I would have doubled back to eat in D."
11th December 2018,4,"""not impressed with the experience""","Not Verified |  My husband and I flew into the Miami airport on Saturday, December 1 to connect with a cruise that was sailing that day. Our time in the airport was minimal as we were able to quickly locate the transfer service to the port and we were on our way in a short time. On Saturday, December 8 we returned to the Miami airport to await our return flight to Toronto. We arrived at the airport about 9.30 am and our flight was not until 2.00 pm so we had 4.5 hours to spend at the airport and we were not impressed with the experience. Upon getting off the transfer bus, we were directed to an outdoor counter to check our bags. This counter had minimal protection from the weather and we would have been quite uncomfortable if it had been raining or if we had been there mid-day in the hot sun. As others have mentioned, the cost of simple drink and snack options is extremely expensive. Several outlets did not even post prices but just a menu with a list of options. We settled on a coke, coffee and sandwich from the Starbucks outlet situated near gate D32. This location was convenient, well staffed and very clean. The major disappointment concerned the overall unkept state of the airport. There was a lot of garbage blowing around the waiting area where we checked our bags. The washrooms were filthy and the paper towel dispensers were empty. There were plenty of garbage cans but they were overflowing with trash."
3rd December 2018,8,"""the immigration was fully manned""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived on a British Airways flight flying Club World so one of the first passengers off the plane and managed to be the first at immigration. I had an Esta and was expecting to use a machine. But arriving at the E terminal, the immigration was fully manned. The agent was very quick, took my photo, surprised there was no finger printing and no stamp on my passport and didn’t want my customs form. As I left the terminal no one wanted to collect my customs form, seems the process has changed. Anyway I was from plane door to kerb in 20 minutes. I was only in Miami overnight before connecting to Sint Maarten. Used AA priority check in and there was a short queue. Took the agent a while to check me in (I was wondering if there were problems with my paperwork and was suspecting the immigration agent screwed up the previous evening). Eventually she checked me in she all documents were fine. I used the business class security line at the D gates and was through security in 15 minutes. I wanted to use the AA Flagship lounge at gate D30 (Lounge was excellent). I needed plenty of time to walk to my flight at gate D3. But it was a pleasant 10 minute hike. Gate area was a mess. Although I was in group 1 boarding it was hogged up by people from groups 2 and 3. But gate agents were great at policing the boarding process. I agree the prices at MIA are outrages. $3.50 for a bottle of water!"
1st December 2018,10,"""staff is helpful and kind""","✅ Trip Verified |  Very large airport but, simple and logical. You can use the airport train within your way to the gate. Crowded but fast secuity check. Clean restrooms. Free Metromover to Car Rental Centrum. The staff is helpful and kind."
14th November 2018,1,"""MIA is a complete rip-off""","Not Verified |  All the restaurants nd bars that I've been to have been a rip off! Lousy food, nobody there cares the least about quality, and they charge huge prices. $17 for a lousy burger at Spring Chicken, 10 oz tap beer is $9.50, Islander Bar & Grill near D8 shows certain prices out front only to find that for a margarita you order house version they charge for Patron Silver, they charge separately for mix and tequila so it gets to $16. Two very lousy margaritas and one Heineken $48! When you inquire about that they just say, ""Hey, its in the airport! What do you expect?"" MIA is a complete rip-off! Spent over $100 for a lousy small fast food meal and a couple drinks and all I got in addition was a very bad attitude! I can get a bad attitude for free most places."
2nd October 2018,2,"""Layout is horrible""",✅ Trip Verified | Layout is horrible. Security lines are disorganized and are very far away from departure gates. Skytrain is a good idea but signs aren't clear how frequently they run. Staff are very nice but I feel like I'm being made to traverse the entire length of the airport whenever I'm here. Will use FLL instead given the opportunity.
27th September 2018,2,"""Dirty, disorganized, poor service""
","Not Verified |  Miami airport continues to compare with a third world facility. Dirty, disorganized, poor service (to put it mildly). Shops all sell the same useless wares, and automated distributors out of order. Sad place."
26th September 2018,2,"""disgusted at the level of service""","Not Verified | I am disappointed and disgusted at the level of service at the Miami Airport. We arrived from Costa Rica a family of four, which we had booked our reservations as a family. We were told to stay together through the screening, through customs all the way, which we did. However, the chaos began as soon as we arrived at the Miami airport. My ticket was pre-check as we thought all four would be since they were all booked under my name as the lead person. We were instructed to go to the two different check-points. After being turned around twice, I informed the young lady that we had gone through this twice. If we had to come back, a manager is going to have to get involved. She instructed us to go back to checkpoint three because” the staff member there was new and didn’t know what she was telling us.” We went back, and sure enough, the staff member began to tell us to separate again. I told her what the previous employer had said to us, she pulled up our ticket on her phone and told us to go ahead. I couldn’t believe the level disconnect of communication here in the United States; there is a lot to be learned from Liberia Airport. Courtesy and politeness from the employees for starters. We finally arrived at our gate for departure. As we sat there trying to listen for the changes of gates. The intercom system is not the best; one could barely hear the changes. We saw so many travelers missing their flight and upset, as they should have been. The announcement should have been clear, and anyone on that flight name should have been called before that plane departed. I felt bad for those that were unable to hear the message in the mist of all the chaos. I’m sure that with all the upgrades in technology the intercom system can be much better, employee interaction should be superior. Staff should act as if they want to assist you and not as if they owe you something, remember we are “paying” travelers whether by awards or by credit cards we have paid for service and should be treated with politeness, respect, and clear communication."
31st August 2018,4,"""disappointed with the service""
","Not Verified |  Twice disappointed with the service at the transportation center. I understand that the staff may want to be friendly but they appear to be selectively friendly. I was trying to make a train; the person at the kiosk was having a leisurely chat and had no time to help me with my questions. He misinformed me, pointing me to the ticket machine and stating that I first had to purchase a ticked on the level where he was. Even after I had the ticket he still was talking and giving his opinions on some subject and did not stop talking to assist. The area was not crowded, but I had to figure things out myself. When I got down to the tracks there were ticket machines I could have bought a ticket. But by the time I had traipsed my luggage down the stairs (no mention or direction regarding an elevator) the train had departed. It being a Sunday afternoon I had to wait another hour. A week earlier, I had to wait for more than 5 minutes while the kiosk person spoke to another traveler about where he grew up and the schools he went to. Like I say, friendly—I get it—but isn’t the job one of helping travelers get from one place to another?"
29th August 2018,3,"""they must pay $5 USD""",Not Verified |  It is sad to see that for arriving International passengers they must pay $5 USD if they need an airport baggage cart. That's quite expensive and foreigners may not have American money to pay besides being alot of money for a cart. International arriving passengers may have alot of luggage they need to claim and transfer after a long flight. I have not seen having to pay for a luggage cart in most International destinations. It's a sad comment to welcome them to the land of the free and the home of the brave.
23rd August 2018,2,"""great concept, horrible execution""","✅ Trip Verified | The sky train is an awesome idea but how difficult is it to put a sign in front of the gates “closest sky train at gate xxxx”. You land and you don’t know if one is right around a corner or the other way. Again great concept, horrible execution when a simple directional sign could fix it."
31st July 2018,7,"""All staff were polite""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew into MIA on September 26 from Madrid and out on October 2, going back, both legs on Iberia. Despite of what is being said compared to other airports, Miami worked quite all right for us. On arrival there were some works and had to walk longer than necessary, but went through immigration and an acceptable speed. All staff were polite. At arrivals got the chance to buy a US sim card. Waiting for hotel shuttle was tiring after a long flight, as there was not enough seating there. Also, TSA at MIA is much faster than at Orlando airport. Most importantly, arriving from Orlando on American Airlines and having to pick up luggage, as we didn't have a through ticket, and having to check in for Iberia was not bad! We just had to walk straight on from the AA part of the airport to that of Iberia. No need for elevators, or shuttles! Spanish-speaking staff are polite and courteous and do make an effort to help out. Overall, we have a positive impression of Miami!"
26th July 2018,1,"""Poor organization""",Not Verified | Poor organization of the planes and gates. Our incoming flight had trouble having a free gate to arrive at. Our departure gate has been changed twice and delayed by 2 hours. Their explanation was that they were waiting for a plane to get out of a hangar.
14th July 2018,1,"""it was a shambles""","Not Verified |  Probably the worst airport experience I've ever had. I was only there for a connection as I was travelling from MBJ- MIA then back to the UK. Customs in the UK is so simple and quite quick considering. The staff were so rude at customs in particular at security, they ignored you pretending they were speaking on the radio and couldn't hear. When we had to get our ESTA tickets it was a shambles as we had to do everything in 1.5 hours in time for the connecting flight. Instead of managing the queues one particular staff member kept shouting at me because I was using a different kiosk from my dad, which makes no sense because those questions were long so if there is a kiosk next to him it makes sense to use that - as I did on my way here 5 days ago. Other people were using more than one kiosk but she spent her time focusing on me instead of organising the queue. She kept shouting saying 'Mam Mam Mam' you can't use the kiosk, despite telling her 2 times our connecting flight was soon. The guy at customs was so rude, I'm sure that if you are travelling with a family member you're supposed to go up with them? But, we got yelled at and only my dad was allowed to go, I eventually went up and then a few seconds the customs guy called up another man who was after me - assuming he was my dad, I had to tell him we were not travelling together. In addition, we had to rush through security bear in mind by this point we only had 25 minutes left until we boarded the plane. My dad tried to ask one of the security women a question and she just pretended that she was listening to her radio and that it was so important, she didn't even acknowledge my dad. We kept telling them we were boarding in 25 minutes and no-one cared. Also when they give out blue cards when you go through security - the ones that determine whether you take your shoes off or not/take out your laptop. I just wanted to double check if I needed one as my dad got one and a few people before him did and she just shouted to 'go in that line'. Surprisingly we made the flight, and it was delayed by 45 minutes due to the manifest being typed up incorrectly."
11th July 2018,2,"""signs were not straightforward""","Not Verified |  I've never been to a more confusing airport in my life. The signs were not straightforward. On our boarding pass, it said Terminal CE, but none of its signs stated that, it will state Concourse and a list of letters that did not make any sense to us, which was not helpful at all. Our flight was delayed by 5 hours because the captain was unable to arrive at the Miami airport due to the weather in Tampa, which is completely reasonable. However, the situation could've been handled much better. The people that worked outside the gate were unhelpful. They pretty much expected everyone to have smart phones and therefore were negligent in giving us, customers, regular updates as to when our flight will arrive. They only updated people who stood waiting in line for 15 minutes, instead of just efficiently announcing it to the general public, not that their updates were helpful to the individuals that stood in line because they kept pushing it to every hour, so it was very hard for customers to plan accordingly. By giving us an incorrect ETA, we were not able to decide whether to rebook to another flight or not. If we had known that the flight was going to be delayed for 5 hours, we would've gotten on a different flight. But the people at the gate kept ensuring us that it would only be an hour delayed, and then another hour if we asked again and again. This misinformation is unacceptable. In addition, the airport was freezing. I had to wait in line for 30 minutes at the Service Center for blankets to be told there were no clean blankets. I would check in with them a few more times and was told there were still no clean blankets available, during this 5 hours waiting period, this huge international airport did not think to provide blankets. So not only was my flight delayed, I caught a fever due to waiting at the cold airport for 5 hours, and had to call out of work the next day."
7th July 2018,9,"""well staffed at every turn""","Not Verified | Dealing with a late international arrival, my connection was on time and I really had to hustle! Signage was confusing for getting to baggage, collecting it, navigating customs, rechecking bag and then security finally! It was around 6am and MIA was well staffed at every turn and due to crowds and rushing I overlooked my laptop and ipad after scanning all my carry on stuff. I was down the hallway running to flight when they caught me and delivered those! Thanks Miami TSA!"
3rd July 2018,7,"""like every employees first day""","Not Verified | The people running this airport should not be aloud to pump gas. Unbelievable immigration, baggage claim, security checks. It’s like every employees first day. ""Your flight boards in 5 minutes"" (should have left 40mins ago), ""Your flight is now boarding at a different gate"" (1/2 mile away), ""Now boarding in 40 more minutes"". Never again."
28th June 2018,1,"""lightning delays only at MIA""","✅ Trip Verified |  Another delay on arrival and baggage wait. Not sure why these “lightning delays” only happen at MIA and not FTL or other South Florida area airports. Flight arrived at 8:30, it’s now 10:30 and still waiting on bag. Best to not check in bag for MIA arrival, or fly through other airport. You would think whoever runs the place would find the way to do better."
27th June 2018,1,"""experience here was horrific""","✅ Trip Verified |  This airport is the most unorganized establishment, and my experience here was horrific. Security check in terminal D was where I needed to be at. Without explanation, I was asked to go to Checkpoint E. Get to checkpoint E, asked to go to F (10 min walk). Get to F, go through security, walk 10 min to just come back to see the original security checkpoint area I was supposed to go through! Absolutely unacceptable. Working for a city, my self, I am appalled at this airports lack of customer service. You want to attract tourists, get your airport crew on the same page, talk about customer service to be a number one priority! Take a page from my city airport system - Houston Airport systems...look them up!"
23rd June 2018,1,"""disorganized, unprofessional mess""","Not Verified |  I have never experienced a travel experience as horrible as that of the Miami International Airport. From Check-in, all the way through TSA. The whole system is a disorganized, unprofessional mess. There was not one indication of competence anywhere in that hellish place. I promise that I will never visit Miami again. No way will I risk going through that again!"
18th June 2018,1,"""is an embarrassment""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been traveling throughout the western states for the past week and a half. I have been in 7 different states, and unfortunately, my home state of Florida, the airport is by far the dirtiest. It is an embarrassment. The floors, the bathrooms, the seats are filthy. Developing countries have more pride and cleanliness."
17th June 2018,1,"""staff members have the worst attitude""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible airport. Signs were not clear for security check points and terminal J TSA sent us all the way to H security check point for precheck only to be routed through the wrong line. Terminal employees cut in line and held the line up at check points. All Bathrooms are nasty, staff members have the worst attitude and lack professionalism. Restaurant was fully staffed but no one was “working”. Obviously there was a full bar and no one knew how to make a Mojito. Hope I don’t have to move through Miami soon."
9th June 2018,8,"""toilets so smelly and dirty""","Not Verified | It's a pity, that such a nice, big airport, has women's toilets so smelly and dirty. I refer specifically to the bathroom that is next to checkpoint # 3 (American Airline). It's the dirtiest bathroom I've seen since I live in USA. I hope this serves to improve the hygiene conditions of it. | Es una pena,que un Aeropuerto tan bonito y concurrido ,tenga los baños de mujeres tan malolientes y sucios.Me refiero especificamente al baño que esta al lado del punto de control#3 (American Airline). Es el baño mas sucio que yo he visto desde que vivo en Usa . espero que esto sirva para que mejoren las condiciones higienicas del mismo."
4th June 2018,6,"""clean and easy to navigate""
","❌ Not Verified |  The airport is clean and easy to navigate, you don't have to walk miles between gates. There are not so many restaurants as one might expect, but there is a sufficient variety of dining options. Arrivals: Passport control lines are long, but that is the case in most places. The ""fastrack"" option or using an automated machine and then passing a receipt to the officer actually takes longer because you have to take 5 minutes to use the machine and then join the back of the queue of people who didn't use it. As always the staff shout at you like they are herding cattle. Departures: Check-in is simple and well signposted, queues are short as there are a lot of desks. Security takes a while, the priority line is not much shorter than the main lines. As with most Americans the staff are very rude and unpleasant. One of them pointed at me and shouted ""shoes"" whilst another shook his head and announced to the waiting line ""we shouldn't have to tell y'all the obvious"". It transpired this obnoxious exchange was in fact their attempt to ask me to remove my footwear and place it in the scanning machine, something I would say about 30 percent of airports require, so to me not obvious. But perhaps it was obvious to ""y'all""."
3rd June 2018,2,"""it is not a pleasant airport""","❌ Not Verified |  Can MIA achieve any level of competence? I have long boycotted it and advised others to avoid for immigration purposes, and it is not a pleasant airport to negotiate in terms of TSA security. But I did opt to use for transiting between BA6578 (operated by AA) TPA-MIA and BA0208 MIA-LHR on 21 May. On paper, I had two hours for the transit. Flying time between TPA and MIA is just 37 minutes, but weather-related issues made for a TPA departure that was 20 minutes late. On landing at MIA, we then taxied to a halt that lasted 40-45 minutes before a gate was found for us. Pax with tight connections grew anxious as we waited. The AA captain himself lost patience with the false promises of any early move to a gate. A rush to connecting gates and disgustingly dirty bathrooms ensued when we finally deplaned. BA0208 was just starting to board when I finally reached my gate. This was located in a subterranean area of stygian gloom, the waiting customers looking like lost souls, doubtless with their own negative opinions of MIA."
2nd June 2018,7,"""hard to find the luggage claim area""","❌ Not Verified | My family and I traveled from Miami to Rhode Island with Frontier Airlines - great deals, by the way. Overall I have to say our experience at the airport was fair. It was hard to find the luggage claim area after we landed and it seems like most people there spoke Spanish. One good thing I have to say is we used www.parkon.com/mia for our airport parking reservations. Great ROI. I like that MIA is expanding and upgrading it's features."
29th May 2018,1,"""Absolutely awful""",✅ Trip Verified |   Absolutely awful. At least 90 minutes to transfer from Jamaica to Raleigh even though we were traveling in first and had both Global Entry and TSA pre. Total chaos.
19th May 2018,3,"""security lines were horrible""
","✅ Trip Verified | We went on a trip to Orlando and because we couldn't find a fair price for a flight we opted to fly out of Miami. We arrived at midnight so not much to be said about that. Arrival and luggage was ok as was the transportation to the rental cars. On the way back home however, we 'experienced' this airport. The security lines were horrible. Everyone walks around at an immensly slow speed. One person can't be bothered with helping out others. No real info on who needs to go through regular detection gates and who needs to be bodyscanned. Our carry ons were taken apart after being scanned and it took one single security officer about half an hour before he went through our stuff to check. I don't mind that my carry ons need extra screening for whatever reason but please, do it at a decent speed. The security lines were chaotic at best. Once through security I can't say the airport was dirty but the amenities were very limited as was the seating. Once home I also noticed that the TSA cut the security belt around my suitcase open with bolt cutters, even when it had a TSA lock. And they must have had a key since the suitcase as well had a security TSA lock which was correctly opened. I also put a special cloth sleeve around my suitcase to protect it from wear and scratches which I didn't even bother putting back on. When waiting, there is free WiFi but only for 45 minutes. Great when WiFi was a novelty but nowadays simply incomprehensible. Miami Airport is truly on my to-avoid-list of airports now. I guess when visiting Orlando and the airfare is to expensive, you are even better off flying to Atlanta and drive to Orlando."
29th April 2018,2,"""Took nearly 2 hours""","❎ Not Verified |  Never change here if you can avoid it. Took nearly 2 hours to get through immigration and then we had to run through airport and push to the front of security in order to make our connecting flight (which we had already allowed a 2 hours layover for!). The staff couldn't understand what they were doing, we were queuing into an area where we had to get ESTA receipts and then 45 mins later another load of planes arrive and get guided into a similar area which is inexplicably not being used, with the result that people who had arrived 45 mins after us got through immigration quicker due to poor poor queue management. Cannot understand why those on connecting flights need to do the immigration process, transferring in the UK doesn't require this and it seems really unnecessary when you aren't even leaving the airport."
19th April 2018,1,"""the worst we experienced""","❎ Not Verified |    As an American citizen, I can say that the Miami Internationals airport customs was the worst we experienced after visiting at least 8 other countries in Southeast Asia. Why is there not a separate line for Americans? Every other country does this. Why do I have to wait 2 hours in line so that someone can approve my customs information in 2 minutes! I pay taxes and the salaries of custom officials - foreigners don’t - so make it easy for your own citizens to pass through. How hard is that to understand. Every other country we visited understand that. But, that’s US government for you."
8th April 2018,1,"""chaotic and horrible""
","✅ Trip Verified | From the moment we got off the plane every single employee we encountered in customs and immigration were disrespectful, rude and even down right mean. One gentleman’s job was specifically to tell people which line to filter into and yet he managed to sound extremely annoyed with every human being he came in contact with. The line was painfully long in immigration especially for the non-citizens and when I tried to ask a question to one employee she interrupted me mid question to tell me to keep walking. She treated the next two people who approached her in this same manner. The two women trying to organize the line did it by yelling and talking in bossy, annoyed tones to the hundreds of innocent people who were all just trying to do what they said. When someone made a mistake, heaven forbid if you didn’t exactly understand what “go to the end” means when the room is the size of a football field, then that poor person was berated by the employee who then walked away shaking her head as if every human was an idiot. After our first two negative interactions I started talking to my kids about how we should treat people. They could see how the employees we treating everyone and they could tell that we were just trying to obey whatever “rules” were in place to avoid being singled out. Unfortunately we saw employees act like school yard bullies well over a dozen times and didn’t see one kind exchange in the entire 2 hours that we spent in the Miami airport. Chaotic and horrible."
2nd April 2018,2,"""worst customs and transfer process""","✅ Trip Verified | Returned from overseas through Miami and it was the absolutely worst customs and transfer process I have ever experienced. If this is our “front door” to the world, I am embarrassed to imagine what overseas travelers must think. I have cleared customs in many other countries and they all put their best foot forward. Not so in Miami. Entire process took over two hours, airport is dirty and worms out, and never once did anyone try to assist with ensuring the process was understood. Then that had only one screening line open to get to your transfer and no TSA pre-check, so that took 45 minutes itself. We barely made our connection and had nearly a 3 hour layover! Embarrassing!"
26th March 2018,1,"""Miami airport was literal chaos""","❎ Not Verified |  Miami airport was literal chaos. The employees were just shouting directions, which were unclear and confusing. I witnessed not 1 but 2 different employees talking down to people - one of which was a man who did not speak English. They were shouting at everyone to “keep moving, don’t stop.” At the security point they told us to keep our shoes on and don’t take anything out of our carry on bags to get us through the line faster. In my opinion this jeopardises the security of everyone there for the sake of speediness. The employees were rude and the entire process of catching my conncecting flight was chaotic."
19th March 2018,4,"""waiting times ridiculously long""","✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst handled airports. Everybody knows that Miami has a very busy airport. The waiting time in the lines are however ridiculously long. The airport has obviously not been adapted to its increase number of customers. Waiting time going was at least 1 and a half hours. On the way back definitely shorter (30 to 45 minutes which is adequate) however at the expense of the politeness of staff. The immigration and security officers are extremely rude and obnoxious - amongst the worst I've experienced not only in the U.S.. How ironic to have staff shout ""computers ain't gonna take themselves out of bags"" and ""dont you have a flight to catch"" standing right next to a display saying that employees need to be patient and nice to travelers. Not everyone is a frequent flyer and most aren't familiar with airport procedures. The airport is clean however (toilets, floors and transportation) and the wifi works perfectly"
15th March 2018,2,"""courtesy and pleasantness goes a long way""
","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible experience. The staff were unbelievably rude. My husband went to sit in a chair not knowing it was a handicapped only area and was told to rudely “get out of here”. When we were at the wrong entrance we were again yelled at loud enough for everyone to hear. We got an ice cream at Haagen Daz and were ignored as the two workers chit chatted while we stood there waiting. Then there were paper liners on the inside of the cone. I went into the ladies room and the cleaning woman proceeded to yell at me as I apparently went to the side she was still cleaning on and pointed at me telling me “you! You use this side only!” A little courtesy and pleasantness goes a long way when you deal with the public. I will never use this trashy, obnoxious hole again."
14th March 2018,2,"""poor lighting, no investment""","✅ Trip Verified | Miami Airport where the third world meets the USA. We arrived with no hassles as we had gone through US immigration and customs in Dublin. On the way back packed into a very small room, poor lighting, no investment to make the process slicker and no management. When the screening machine stopped working our line was told to cut into the other two lines. At this stage people have been waiting an hour to get to this stage so lots of grumpy unhappy travellers in all the lines. Make America Great Again - Come to Europe and see how it is done."
7th March 2018,1,"""The worst experience ever""","❎ Not Verified |  The worst experience ever. Will never use this airport again. 2 hours in immigration coming back from vacation in Antigua. Then another hour through security for the 2nd time. Then to show our passports another 8 times. Common sense we wouldn't have got that far without showing our passports in Antigua. Then to run to make the final boarding call for our connecting flight. What in the world is wrong with paying a few extra people to work in immigration. Also, it's always nice to return to your own country and get treated like a herd of cattle."
19th March 2022,1,"""Everyone is rude""","Not Verified | Everyone is rude, it was dirty, no clear signs, staff acted like we were a bother when we asked for directions since there are no signs. Just do not go here if you don't have to."
2nd March 2022,1,"""TSA agents don't have to be rude""","✅ Trip Verified |  No one likes to have to go through security multiple times when traveling international, but the TSA agents don't have to be rude, demeaning and condescending. The United terminal offered little seating, rude agents and rude restaurant employees. The bathrooms were filthy. Very disappointing."
19th January 2022,1,"""TSA agents were incredibly rude""","✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in from Cancun to Houston and then Houston to LAX.  The TSA agents at IAH right off the bat were incredibly rude, I understand dealing with people can be difficult and they don’t have to be nice per se, but making fun of people out loud right in front of their face is pretty low. The airport itself may show off how many restaurants and shops it has but the purpose of an airport is to fly people around. The employees driving vehicles gave little regard to people walking around them, the terminals are laid out very backwards, and there is little seating room at the terminals."
28th December 2021,1,"""very poor customer support""","Not Verified |  One of the worst airports in the world. Complicated, dirty, slow baggage claim, very poor customer support. Constant useless construction work. Horrible parking."
21st November 2021,1,"""She was atrocious at best""","✅ Trip Verified |  My wife, daughter and I just checked in for an early morning flight to D.C. and our experience started off horribly wrong from the time we walked into Terminal C. We pre-paid for baggage well in advance and had our electronic boarding passes and baggage receipt at the ready; however, the United employee at the baggage desk was adamant that we hadn’t paid and we held up the line for a solid ten minutes with her aggressively repeating herself that we hadn’t pre-paid. Finally, she calmed down and decided to help us. We are still trying to figure out what happened and why it happened. We then made our way to the TSA Clear check-in and the first agent we encountered in no way deserves an employment opportunity that involves human contact. She was atrocious at best and I am thankful she is not empowered to carry a weapon in her position - she is dangerous! I do not suffer from any type of anxiety but after our check-in experience, I feel like I have been chased - and to think, we actually paid for the experience months in advance and went through the TSA pre-check interviews and all of the requirements only to be belittled, degraded, and treated like trash. As a resident of the greater Houston area, I am ashamed at what my family just experienced as it is a reflection of not only this airport but also the area in which we live and the people who live here. There is obvious change needed in this country right now and a great place to start would be Bush Intercontinental Airport. We will probably see what Southwest has to offer in the future and drive to Hobby."
3rd November 2021,1,"""Is this an airport or a prison?""","Not Verified |  The TSA workers here are openly hostile and rude. Is this an airport or a prison? I suggest you send them to Middle Eastern airports, they could learn a lot about efficiency and respect. Shame on the TSA for allowing this pathetic behavior in its workers. I'm guessing they all lead pretty miserable lives and it makes them feel better to treat everyone like dirt. Maybe you could offer them therapy or anger management. These workers are way too highly strung to be working with the public and it will end with one or more of these losers killing someone. Perhaps it's time to disband this ""organization"" because I doubt you will do anything to change this cop/prison guard attitude you have going on right now."
16th August 2021,10,"""this woman just went above and beyond overall""","Not Verified |  A United staff member was especially kind and helpful when I was by myself with my two small kids trying to get our luggage checked in. Besides my kids, I had two car seats, a suitcase, a diaper bag, a couple of other small bags to drag around, which was impossible to do myself. Though it was a busy morning at the airport (August 6th), this woman helped me out with carrying my stuff and letting me cut in line and just went above and beyond overall."
18th July 2021,1,"""The parking is the worst""",Not Verified |  The parking is the worst. I was not able to find a parking spot and they charged me because I waste 14 minutes trying to find parking. I talked to the supervisor and the parking and they were a waste of time. I also called the customer service and they were not help at all.
9th July 2021,1,"""no TSA agent guiding us""","Not Verified |  TSA Customs from an international flight. We arrived on a Wednesday at around 6pm. It took us 2 hours to get through Customs. There was an estimated 1000 to 2000 passengers waiting in the Terminal E to show Passports. Out of the 40 or so Customs Lanes available only 5 were being used. Once we finally got through that, our luggage was spread out all over the baggage claim area. Once we claimed our baggage, we went through TSA where we were yelled at and threated by a woman who said things like ""pay attention"" there was no clear guidance on anything, and ""I wish one of you would lose your cool"" basically trying to pick a fight. Passengers have no say so in what the policies are when going through TSA, no clear directions, no TSA agent guiding us to the right lines to get into. So unprofessional."
8th July 2021,3,"""One of the worst things about living in Houston is having to use IAH airport""","Not Verified |  One of the worst things about living in Houston is having to use IAH airport. We must travel to France routinely to visit family, but each time we paid $300-$500 more than had we flown out of Austin, Dallas, or even LA! I just checked flights to Paris today and the difference between Houston and Austin is nearly $400 per ticket! We have driven to Austin and even Dallas before to save money when there were five of us flying, but when there is just me and my wife, we’ve had to just bite the bullet and pay the high prices."
17th May 2021,4,"""The arrogance of the TSA here is unbelievable""",✅ Trip Verified | Rude TSA. They yelled things like “you need to start paying attention” and “how can I do my job when people like you make it difficult?”. The arrogance of the TSA here is unbelievable. I’ll avoid this airport in the future.
23rd April 2021,1,"""They were rude and downright hostile""",Not Verified |  This was by far the most stressful and negative experience in my travel history. The whole set up was a mess and the entry point to check into customs was completely out of compliance for COVID-19. They were so understaffed that we made our connection by the skin of our teeth. Never again. The worst was the absolutely bad attitude the TSA projected. They were rude and downright hostile. The only good point was the golf cart driver that was amazing. He did everything he could to get us to our gate and showed genuine empathy for our situation.
3rd January 2021,3,"""no signs to tell you where to sit or not sit""","Not Verified |  The new seating is nice. There are no signs to tell you where to sit or not sit. If you aren't a frequent flyer, you will stand there looking foolish. The boarding process is a nightmare. No clear instructions. Kindergarten kids could do a better job. What a disaster."
27th December 2020,2,"""airport has an impersonal, cold, robotic feel to it""","✅ Trip Verified | I dislike this airport and avoid it as much as possible. Food prices are  inflated. Most businesses do not accept cash, can’t print out a paper receipt (they want to send it to your email address or phone number).  Food and other items are ordered on tablet computers. If I have to pay $10 for a taco or $6 for a cup of coffee I would like to have some human interaction. Very few vendors speak any language other than English. On the other hand, most of the vendors are friendly and polite, if you can find them. The airport is spotlessly clean and fairly comfortable for a longish layover. The airport has an impersonal, cold, robotic feel to it."
1st December 2020,1,"""threw away my full Starbucks""","✅ Trip Verified |  I'm sitting here listening to music and relaxing for my 6 hour layover and the trash people just came by and threw away my full Starbucks. Dont clean up when a person is clearly sitting there. You pay $6 bucks for a cup of coffee and don't even get to drink it. If I had left my seat okay, but I was sitting there, headphones in and look up they're walking away."
6th October 2020,3,"""Someone needs to get them in check""",Not Verified |  Airline was nice and polite to customers but TSA was not! Someone needs to get them in check. I witnessed a TSA lady yell and degrade this gentleman that forgot to take change out of his pockets. She then turned around and yelled at everyone in line. Who gives them to right to treat people like that! Now if that gentleman would of stuck up for himself he would of been in the wrong! Will never fly through there again just for that! The 15 people that were in line waiting to get screen agree and will not be flying out of IAH either.
9th September 2020,1,"""received nothing but rudeness""","✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines attendant was very rude. I'm on military orders and flying home finally and she was not helpful or nice when having issues checking in. TSA staff were also very rude. I asked where TSA precheck was (apparently I went to the wrong checkpoint) and did not tell me until I finally got through. The TSA staff stated ""if you didn't want to take it your electronics you should have went thru TSA precheck line"". Funny, I didn't know that was an option. Seems no one at this airport likes their job. I came to Texas to support the state, but received nothing but rudeness. Do not fly through Bush."
21st March 2020,1,"""Why isn’t this conveyed to people before""","✅ Trip Verified | At the security desk when checking my bags, they stopped me for my duty free bag which I bought from Mexico, they took a look at it and took out a bottle that I bought that was freshly bought from the duty free store, the lady took my bottle and said I can’t test the bottle it’s not transparent! Firstly, where is this message told to the passengers before buying or carrying, secondly, why is there no alternate method to test something that is not transparent? Instead they gave me two options, either leave my bottle which cost over $120 or pay extra $30 and go through security again (my flight was about to leave). Why isn’t this conveyed to people before!? Why do I have to lose the money I paid for something they can’t convey prior to me buying? I’m really frustrated by this."
19th March 2020,7,"""normally quite an easy experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Use this airport several times a year for visiting family and it's normally quite an easy experience. As I do pre-clearance I arrive as a domestic passenger, and baggage tends to arrive quickly. Good selection of restaurants but can be a little pricey but that's not unusual nowadays. Seems to be improving, and most recently enjoyed a nice musical performance in Terminal A. Impressed."
25th February 2020,1,"""TSA employees absolutely awful""","Not Verified |  TSA employees at this airport were absolutely awful. I asked if I needed to remove anything from my knapsack Like an iPad and was told no. On the other side my bag was flagged I was told I was supposed to have taken out my iPad. Everyone around me had done the same. Signage would have helped. They took it out, but then kept Rescanning my bag. Each time someone would take my bag and walk very very slowly to the other end of the room and put it at the back of the line . So now it was something in my bag and not the iPad. By the 4th time they decided to check my bag. But the security woman was nasty towards me for showing signs of stress. I had been there for at least 40 min. Apparently I looked at my watch - I was told to stop doing that and to Calm down. She then proceeded to aggressively lecture me. I just said that if I had been informed at the beginning about the iPad all of this could be avoided. Never ever say anything. Lesson learned. Most airports I’ve been through don’t require iPads to be taken out."
12th January 2020,1,"""Customer service is extremely lacking""","Not Verified |  Customer service is extremely lacking here! First of all, the guy checking in our luggage moved so slowly, the longer line next to us moved twice as fast at least. I was worried our car seats might not make it on the plane because we had to run off to security. We couldn’t wait to watch him put them on the belt for checked luggage. He just sat them on the ground next to him and moved like a slug doing I don’t know what. The airport is giant and you can’t see the TSA PreCheck from the regular security check line. So I asked a lady, she pointed and said, ‘Over there.’ Ok, short and to the point. We went to find where ‘over there’ was. Found the TSA PreCheck line but it didn’t display our gate # overhead. So I asked if it was the line for TSA PreCheck to our gate because it didn’t list our gate number. She just said, ‘Do you see the TSA PreCheck sign?’ I was so shocked by the tone and response I paused for a moment and said, ‘I don’t see our gate listed.’ She said, 'You walk around'. Everyone in our party was taken aback and told her there was no need for the attitude, just a simple question. She just continued to be snippy. We rushed past in a hurry to get through. We showed up exactly two hours earlier than our 6am flight and everything took so long, we made it to our gate 10 minutes before boarding! Getting on the plane was such a relief to be welcomed with the customer service that the Seattle based flight crew of Alaska Airlines always brings!"
24th December 2019,1,"""IAH has still not moved into understanding customer service""",Not Verified |  Arrived on BA195 from LHR feeling relaxed due to the excellent service on the 9 hour 45 minute flight. Unfortunately IAH airport has still not moved into understanding customer service. Firstly my global entry application was ignored with an X printed on my receipt and then my wife and what appeared to be all other passengers arriving on ESTAs also had x printed on immigration receipt. We then duly joined the queue which moved very slowly for over 1 hour 30 minutes before arriving in front of immigration lanes. Unfortunately it was now 3pm local time which resulted in at least 90% of the gates closing and our processing taking an additional 40 minutes. Fortunately for us we had allowed 3 hours transit time for our connecting flight to MIA or otherwise we would have been like many other passengers in missing their connecting flight.
11th December 2019,4,"""rude and very unprofessional""","Not Verified |  On 11-30-2019 I experienced terrible assistance from the wheelchair attendants, they were rude and very unprofessional. I overheard one worker say she didn’t need the job and she wasn’t going to deal with these people. One gentleman took me off the plane and left me sitting, my wife had to eventually push me because we had a connecting flight with a very short time limit due to sitting on the plane for a hour and a half, because first another plane was at our gate then the ramp would not line up with the plane. I understand it gets busy and confusing from time to time but that doesn’t mean you have to be disrespectful."
4th December 2019,2,"""direct wheelchair assistants""",Not Verified |  Watch out if you need a wheelchair. To be picked up from the plane was pretty easy and on time. Until I was ask to hold in an area for 30 minutes for another person to roll me out. You may want a supervisor to direct those wheelchair assistants and give direction. It will expedite the process.
30th November 2019,1,"""disrespectful and downright mean""","Not Verified | I’m not sure what’s going on with these TSA, but they are rude, disrespectful and downright mean. I have several metal implants holding my spine together, and I told the TSA woman this. She insisted on doing her pat-down, which whatever, do your job, but she was so rude, and aggressive in her demeanour. She basically told me to shut up at least twice. Her partner was a man, and he was so embarrassed by her behaviour that he wouldn’t even look at me. It’s a very busy place, and once I went thru the full-body scanner, I didn’t hear it beep and there was no indication that I was not permitted to proceed, and it was someone else instructing me. So, I went to grab my things out of the grey box to get out of the way. She says to me, I didn’t say you could leave. Ok, I responded. Then she says, stand on that mat, and don’t move, but instead of asking as a normal person would, she’s talking to me like I’ve done something wrong. She then informs me she’s doing a pat-down, and she now has myself and two other ladies waiting for the same treatment. She then asks me if I have pain anywhere, I responded yes, I have pain in my back, she says again with needless aggression, I didn’t ask you about your back, I asked you if you have pain in the front (which was not what she said). She’s yelling this at me. She says I’m not patting down your back like I was somehow supposed to know what she meant! So, again I corrected myself, and I responded with no, I have no pain in my front. Then she does her pat-down but is going around my yoga pants waistband to my back and down my legs. Maybe the TSA could use a crash course to teach their representatives some basic anatomy as she most definitely was patting down my lower back. I also was holding my passport, you know normal behaviour to have your passport in hand in an airport, she says, put your passport down! Then she swabs my hands, she actually looked disappointed when she couldn’t find anything. Is this the way they treat visitors to their country? That was the most disgusting behaviour I’ve ever witnessed and experienced in an airport, ever! I’m all about keeping everyone safe, these safeguards are put in place to protect all of us, I agree with screening 100%. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. My disabilities are a big part of my life, and I do my best to fit in with everyone else, this woman should not have a job dealing with the public. She demonstrated quite proficiently that she has no regard for those with disabilities. Shame on you for treating people like this! You should be ashamed of yourself. My only regret is not getting her name. I will gladly pay more money next time, so I don’t have to go thru Houston."
29th November 2019,1,"""Learn how to treat people""",Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever! I went to pick up my husband who was able to come home from the military base for a short holiday weekend. I tried to get help with directions and security working were so rude and disrespectful. Learn how to treat people!
23rd October 2019,3,"""an absolute joke""","Not Verified | This airport is an absolute joke, most places to eat don’t accept cash? Couldn’t get a beer anywhere that would let me pay cash. Seriously a joke, washrooms were filthy, and no paper towel to dry hands. Worst airport I’ve been to."
12th October 2019,3,"""one of the dirtiest I've ever been to""","✅ Trip Verified | I've flown in and out of George Bush Intercontinental numerous times over the years. Honestly, this is a hard airport to like because it just seems stuck in 1989. But this is also a hard airport to truly dislike, as I've never had a particularly negative experience there. The biggest selling point for me is that I don't ever remember coming across rude or gruff personnel, even TSA during peak traffic hours. I'm sure a rude TSA or ticket agent exists at Bush, because it's a massive American airport after all, but I've thankfully never encountered them! They have a pretty cool display in (I believe) the American terminal which walks one through the evolution of Houston's space program history, nothing fancy or attention-calling, just factual with a few artifacts. There is a selection of decent bars and restaurants throughout, though not much in the way of anything Texas-specific that I can recall. Other than these things, the terminals are dirty. United's terminals are separated and disjointed. Security lines can be painfully slow if you don't have TSA Pre-Check or clear. The airport is honestly one of the dirtiest I've ever been to in the developed world - yes, I just reiterated the point! Seating is very crowed, and so are places to actually charge your phone, iPad, or Kindle. As I said, it looks like the airport hasn't been updated (or, in some cases, even cleaned) since 1989 - when George H.W. Bush, this airport's namesake, was actually president! Some parts of the airport have an indescribably strange smell that I can only describe as dank and damp. The WiFi connectivity is something I'd expect in a developing African country (or Australia, where it's also surprisingly bad). The shuttle bus system from and to economy parking lots is just chaotic and abnormally unsystematic - and illogical. Honestly, if the City of Houston could just improve the layout and dump a lot of money into modernization, Bush would honestly be an amazing airport! Until then, it's like an old lawnmower: just barely running on choke mode while sitting in idle. What a shame."
31st July 2019,2,"""We were ignored by staff""","✅ Trip Verified |  The worst airport for customer service. We were ignored by staff too busy gossiping to  acknowledge our existence. I witnessed an employee sleeping in a massage chair outside our gate. YAnother was seen belittling a traveler, telling him “well it’s always on the boarding pass. You could pay attention sometimes.” "
18th June 2019,1,"""Very stressful experience""","✅ Trip Verified |   Weather issues shut down the IAH airport shortly after arrival. No problem - completely understand. We came in on a 10.5 hour international flight and were trapped between customs and security points waiting on luggage. Very little seating. 150+ passengers. The airport personnel were not unloading luggage so we sat for over an hour. We were told not to worry about connecting flights, since the airport was shut down. Well luggage came and we heard the boarding call for our connection. We dashed to the security point. We had pre-TSA tickets but there was no pre-TSA line. TSA personnel just shrugged and told us we had to get in line. We made it through and heard our final boarding call. Our carry-ons went thru the scanner, were sitting in sight but we could not reach them. We very politely asked 2 different TSA staff just to please push our carry-ons about 3 feet where we could grab them - both shook their heads ""no"" and would not help us. So, when we could reach our stuff, we grabbed it and ran like the wind. I didn't even get my shoes on. Had to race 10 gates to get to our flight. Mind you, we are 60-something old and running through the airport is not something we need to be doing. Glad we still do some jogging or we would not have made it. We have a profoundly disabled son at home and we needed to get home to relieve our staff before the shift ended. We made it home by the skin of our teeth! We had given ourselves 5 extra hours just in case. Very stressful experience. I hope passengers from other countries don't think this is the way Americans are."
27th May 2019,1,"""Worst airport award goes here""",❎ Not Verified | Worst airport award goes here. The most unorganized security lines I have experienced. I have traveled all over the world. Slow and nothing but slow. These folks need efficiency training in moving folks through and not create back up lines. Not enough lanes opened for sure.
26th May 2019,1,"""Directions to terminals not clear""",✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airport ever. Directions to terminals not clear. Attendant gave me wrong directions. Bathrooms in terminal A were all out of order. Tried asking security personnel directions to a working restroom. Given a snippy response. Totally unprofessional. 
22nd May 2019,1,"""Appalling introduction into the US""
","Not Verified |  Don't go to this airport unless you want to queue up for at least 1.5 hrs whilst 3 officers check your passports and onward travel. There was in excess of 300 people behind us and as people became vitriolic about the wait a female agent approached the queue and threatened to remove them to the back of the queue if they continued to complain. By the time we got to the carousel to collect our cases, they had been taken off and put to one side. This has to be the worst airport in the US and the rest of the country's I've visited. I've given it 1 star but really dose not deserve any. Appalling introduction into the US."
9th May 2019,1,"""so slow and nobody cares""
","Not Verified |  This airports security check in process has to be one of the worst in the world. So, so, so slow and nobody cares! It is all about the money and purchasing TSA pre. This is one of the ugliest airports in so many ways and I wish I had other choices in getting out of Houston. Fly into another State if you can!"
8th May 2019,5,"""where is common sense?""","Not Verified |  After a lovely visit to the United States, our New Zealand family had the worst experience ever at the Houston International Airport. Their flight was cancelled on Friday night and was not rescheduled until Sunday evening. After going through TSA and having a humiliating experience only to find out they were not going to be able to fly out until Sunday evening. The people at TSA were rude and had my sister-in-law go through a horrible screening. She has had 2 knee surgeries and told the TSA about it. They didn't care, they put this sweet lady through a humiliating screening. We understand safety, but where is common sense? After their flight was cancelled, Air New Zealand gave them accommodations for 1 night. They had to reclaim their baggage. That took until 1 am because a belt on the baggage claim was broken. They had an extra 48 hours in Houston at their expense. Sunday arrives and they finally believe that they will be able to board the plane for a 13 hour trip to return home. My sister-in-law was very nervous because of the previous experience with TSA. Again she explained that she had metal in her knees due to surgeries. The TSA agents were again rude and disrespectful. They put her through the humiliation again! Many people dislike Americans. They find us rude. It is unfortunate that some make a name for us all. This is not the America we want the world to see."
3rd May 2019,2,"""arrival is amongst the worst ever""","Not Verified | My arrival experience was very similar to that described by the previous reviewer. It was utterly shambolic and I have spent much time over the years arriving into US airports. This particular arrival is up there amongst one of the worst ever. The passport machines rejected over 90% of all applicants and help (though not needed by myself) was not readily forthcoming at all to other passengers; when another passenger asked for assistance she was told, ""no, not my problem. You should read it properly"" by a staff member. I was in another lengthy line for just over an hour after receiving a cross on the paper from the passport machine. Out of the many desks available for use only two were open that particular evening and there were no other officers around. What never helped matters either was having the airport greeters walk up and down the line with various accoutrements attached to them like clipboards and radio handsets (to show how important they are no doubt) telling passengers that it is not their fault and not the fault of the officers either!. At least the immigration officer I saw was friendly particularly when he realised that I shared the same birthday as he. Departures through Terminal D back to LHR has nothing much to write home about in terms of restaurants. Would suggest that you eat elsewhere before arriving here. Not many seats around the gate area of D7 either."
28th April 2019,1,"""inconsiderate, inept system""","✅ Trip Verified | George Bush Airport management need to try travelling through their airport to experience the hell we passengers have to contend with. We arrived on a surprisingly sparsely populated flight from London, a ten hour flight on which we were able to lie across three seats each - we thought we were lucky! (In retrospect, it seems other travellers have, perhaps, learned the lesson from experiencing what we were were just about to endure - and they found alternative routes). Plodding the long route to ‘Immigration’ brought us to a large hall where we were confronted with, probably, 20 modern, state-of-the-art, passport-reading, data-collection machines. It is apparent from 95% of all the passengers being directed to the snake-queue (with a cross on the machines’ print-outs) illustrate that these state-of-the-art machine were as much use as a chocolate tea pot! I estimate that there were 300 passengers in the queue (line) for immigration and only two of the immigration desks were open. 2 hours later we emerged from this inefficient, utterly farcical process, to rush on to Baggage Reclaim to retrieve our luggage for onward travel. All the carousels were stopped, little in the way of a clue which group of off-loaded bags might contain ours. 10 more minutes wasted. With just less than an hour left we rushed off to check-in our bags. Scanning the labels affixed in London we were then told that our flight to Pensacola (21:30) was ‘delayed’ until the next morning. (This is not any definition of delay with which I have been previously aware: the flight was cancelled, cynically categorise as ‘delayed’, without any regard for the inconvenience to us, United Airlines customers, or for those who were travelling to meet us.) As with others’ reviews, finding a member of staff to provide any help, reassurance or information was nigh on impossible as we passed through to this point. The staff directing us just were’t interested in our concerns at the speed of the queue/processing: indeed they said that we should complain to the immigration officer - see how we got on! We did: it’s all because of the reallocation of staff to the Mexican border, we were told. Seems to me that the technology employed to replace the immigration officers is unfit for purpose, the immigration management team are not fit for purpose. Please don’t think that this inconvenient, inconsiderate, inept system is only foisted on aliens (from outside the US) there were US citizens with us in this queue as a result of the ineffective, technologically defective equipment. In conclusion, reviews on this website of the Houston Airport’s customers seem to indicate that our flight was only 30% populated because those in the know have found another airline/hub airport to use in preference to this shambolic shower. It is fair to point out that after queuing for another 40 minutes, we spent a further 40 minutes being processed - we were provided accommodation at the local Holiday Inn and food vouchers - and a flight ticket to continue our journey the next morning. Interestingly, our onward flight was completely full - accommodating passengers who’s earlier flight had been cancelled. After this trip, we will not fly by United Airlines to George Bush Airport again. George Bush Airport management need to recognise and address these problems before they lose their rest of their passengers to others."
27th April 2019,1,"""this was really ridiculous""","Not Verified |  This is truly the worst connection airport ever. We had 1h25 minutes for our connecting flight to Frankfurt, but after 4! security checks we had to run to make it to our flight, if we were 1 minute later we would have missed our plane. Why isn’t there a separate queue for connections? We had a digital and manual passport control, a security dog check and when we thought that was it, we had to go through the scanner again! Already twice at our departure airport. We weren’t even entering the USA, but still had to go through this? I understand that security is important these days, but this was really ridiculous. Including rude security officers."
26th April 2019,8,"""appreciate their hard work""","Not Verified |  I had to send my Mom on a Qatar Airways flight alone, it was a very difficult time for me, but the Houston Airport staff at all levels made this process as smooth as they could. I greatly appreciate their hard work and consideration."
25th April 2019,2,"""signage at this airport could be much clearer""","Not Verified |  The signage at this airport could be much clearer, they need to let someone with an advertising background revise them. The customs line was an hour and 45 minutes, then security was another 18 minutes and of course, after all that, we missed our plane and had to deal with totally unconcerned Spirit agents, but that's for another review. TSA agents here are surly and unhelpful if asked a question, when we were rushing to our (already departed) plane after waiting what felt like an interminable time in customs, my daughter asked an agent a question about the location of a terminal, and, I kid you not, we had to wait a few seconds so he could finish softly singing his song before he reluctantly turned his inept attention to us. The tram was so slow it felt like a children's train Cedar Point. Avoid this airport if you can."
24th April 2019,1,"""did not help us whatsoever""","✅ Trip Verified |  We were on our way home to UK from Cancun via Houston . Our flight was delayed by United Airlines due to storm in Houston. Fare enough. Instead of 3.5 hours we had about 1,5 hours, landing about 2 pm local time at HIA. We had 1 hour and a half to catch our flight to London scheduled for 16:25. Going through the whole process of passport checks, security checks and customs we realized that we have very limited time and started to worry. As we approached the last hurdle the baggage check we were told to go to a certain queue obviously for other people like us catching other flights. My friend was also doing it on the next line. I noticed they searched his bottles of Tequila that we both bought in Cancun. They were properly sealed and put back in the boxes and we were assured that this is ok to travell via Houston. I went to ask what is going on and asked kindly what is going on and that we are running late for our flight. One of the girls working as security replied to me -What is it got to do with me! At that point i thought that this was appalling to get answer like this but as we had very little time to get to the gate i decided not to get involved anymore. I few minutes later to my horror i realized that i have forgotten the bag with my two bottles. Immediately returned back and asked for it. An officer has given them back to me but they started checking them one by one the slowest possible way. In the meantime they confiscated on of the bottles from my mate although they wanted to take the other one as well. While i was waiting nervously for it to happen rep of United airlines looked at the screen and said my flight was now gone and i have no chance of getting on the plane. I desperately tried to call my wife who was at the gate but could not get through. Eventually a got my bottles and looked at the screen hoping for delay but there was nothing to confirm it. I had to run to gate E5 with my 13 old son and when we got finally there, there was a huge queue and people were still getting on board. Obviously the flight was delayed but nobody advised us on that and it was not shown on the screens. I cannot believe how unhelpful and rude were some of the people from security department and United Airlines. They kept repeating we are going to miss the flight and did not help us whatsoever. It was the opposite. They were rude and sarcastic."

I know the job can be stressful and I do not think the customer is always right but these individuals do not seem to understand common courtesy. Excuse me, please, and thank you go much further than poor attitudes and bad tempers. This is the worst group I have encountered in my global travels. I hope that this gets fixed and does not become a representation of IAH."

We have TSA and got three different half uttered, 0 eye contact answers about where the TSA was and if it was open or not. In the end they didn’t honor our TSA and performed a thourough search. There is no art or any small attempt to look anything but industrial. The food and drink is wildly expensive even by airport standards. The iPads everywhere are nice but otherwise I would avoid this airport if possible."
30th March 2019,1,"""Rest areas are non existent!","Not Verified |    I have been to nearly 40 to 50 airports and have to say that Houston airport is the worst one I’ve been to in my life. First of all, the connecting international flight after a 15 hour flight from Australia was scheduled only 90 minutes apart. Which means we only had 90 minutes to 1) Go through customs. 2) Go through TSA screening. 3) Retrieve all of our checked in luggage and take it on a 20 minute walk across the airport and send it through the scanner. 4) Go through security Again with our carry ons. 5) And finally get to our gate which was another 20 minutes away. We had 2 little kids with us and every time we asked the security staff to let us cut the lines because we will miss our connecting flight. The answer was the same: we will make sure we get you to your gate on time. Well. Guess what happened? We missed our flight. We were stuck at this horrible airport for an additional 6 hours because appearently United Airlines closed their gates 10 minutes prior to departure even though they’re missing passengers and the security staff kept telling us to not pay any attention to the boarding time but the departure time is what we should aim for. Completely dumb and uninformed. At this point the gave us the boarding passes for our next flight which was on the other side of the airport. And we had to walk to the customer service to get those boarding passes which was at the other end of the terminal we were at. The worst thing was that the gate was changed one hour prior to boarding to a completely different terminal. We had to walk for another 25 minutes carrying our kids who at this point had not had any sleep in 30 hours and every time we asked an employee with a cart (people mover) to help take us to the gate, they kept coming up with some excuse to not take us by what seemed out of complete lazyness. I found 2 carts parked and attempted to drive one myself but it had a pad with a code on it to start it. So. Back to the walking we went. Rest areas are non existent. Terminal seating is horrible and you can’t find any family oriented restaurants in terminal C, D or E. It’s all a bunch of bars and snack shops."
25th March 2019,2,"""What a disaster""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston Bush is truly an ok airport if you are traveling domestically, as I have in the past. The terminal is clean, well lit, and modern. You start to realize why you should avoid this airport at all costs if you travel through customs. Got global entry? They didn’t staff the kiosks, back of the line. Got mobile passport? That line feeds in to the regular line overflowing with people. Once you get past the customs line do you realize you have to then wait in the three times as long TSA line. Got pre? They don’t have a preline. I gave myself a three hour connection in Houston and still missed my connecting flight. What a disaster."
9th March 2019,1,"""it has been a nightmare""","Not Verified |    I have decided to stop using United because they route me through Houston. The last two years I have traveled through Houston to a destination in Mexico. Both times it has been a nightmare. Departing wasn't so bad, except that I couldn't find a functioning water fountain even though I walked up and down two concourses looking for one. When I asked I was sent to one that was out of order. It is returning from Mexico that is horrendous. Even though we have Global Entry and TSA Pre, we invariably are sent on a wild goose chase (the employees don't seem to know that TSA Pre in Houston is closed and they always sent us to a different building so we can go through TSA Pre). We end up running like mad, trying to grab a sandwich and still making it to the gate in time to board. I suspect the TSA worker at Houston are some of the unhappiest. I would be too, working in such a poorly managed environment."
7th March 2019,1,"""such poor signage""","Not Verified |  I fly quite a bit. But haven't experienced an airport with such poor signage. You can watch it everywhere. People stopping in their tracks and looking around for some sort of instructions to get to their gate. There also should be an advisory informing walking time as opposed to taking transportation. Signage to subway is poor, never saw any. Very few workers to ask. If possible, I'll avoid IAH like the plague."
11th January 2019,10,"""very friendly and polite""","✅ Trip Verified | I wanted to complement the staff in the security line on the morning of January 6th. Despite it being the early morning shift, in which you encounter groggy and stiff personalities, I wanted to say that they were very friendly and polite. They greeted me with a smile and kept the line going smoothly. Also to note, my husband was wearing his San Francisco government badge and they let him pass through without being scanned. Because they did that though, he accidentally left his garment bag in the conveyor belt. Luckily I heard them announce it on the intercom. It was a a very pleasant experience and I hope to fly through again."
11th January 2019,2,"""the most uncomfortable waiting area""",✅ Trip Verified | Houston International Terminal C has the most uncomfortable waiting area I have ever experienced. Tables with iPads and charging stations everywhere. Chairs bolt to the ground. What normal seat that is available is limited to one row per cate. The club music from the bar floods the terminal. One review says this terminal is “Sexy”. Yes that may be a good thing for a night out clubbing but not waiting for an international flight. Thankfully I didn’t have a delay or long layover.
27th December 2018,2,"""Stuck trying to get to gate""","Not Verified |  Stuck trying to get to gate for 2 hours on airport tarmac. Seen other flights moving in and out, but my Spirit flight was halted, supposed to have been at gate at 10:45 didn’t arrive til 12:45, don’t know if I will have a room anymore at my hotel because of the delay. There weren’t weather issues if other planes were departing, so what was the issue?"
27th December 2018,1,"""no food or drink for over 8hrs!""","Not Verified |  My flight was delayed for over 8hrs. All I had on me was cash. Nothing in the whole place would take my money. I was stuck with no food or drink for over 8hrs! They wouldn't let me go outside to smoke. If I did I wouldn't be able to get back in til morning! So I'm stuck, can't eat, can't smoke. Customer service said there was nothing they could do for me. They were rude and acted like I was a pain to them! Never ever fly into Houston IAH! If your flight is delayed you will be trapped! Customer service is a joke! Why haven't any of these issues been solved yet."
2nd December 2018,1,"""Rudest security agent""","Rudest security agent had ever encountered in my 36 years travel experience. My flight was going to Paris from Houston, IAH. While I was going through security check to enter into airport gate, this agent had practically insulted me. Whenever I was putting my carry on luggage on the belt, she said ""who told you to put it on?"", so I pulled it back down and waited for her to allow me to put it on the belt. Then when the person ahead of me moved to the front, I moved forward as well, then she said ""stop, who told you to move?"". At this point, I was about to explore, so I took a long look at her, then she shut up. I had to calm myself down and told myself to just swallow it and don't make any trouble. I don't know if this was employee of airport or airline? I definitely had the worse day."
26th November 2018,1,"""give this airport a big zero""","Not Verified |  The iPads are a great idea, but why can’t you just make an order with the bartender when they aren’t busy? Why so much emphasis on zero human interaction? I give this airport a big zero because I’d always rather be at home but especially when I have a long layover in Houston."
8th November 2018,1,"""this airport needs functionality""","Not Verified |  Landed at this airport on 11/04/18 via United Airlines. This airport is entirely too big to function effectively. The gates are to far apart, so do some inquires before hand to see which gate you land at and which one you will depart. As for me, I was asked to go to gate C from gate A. Quite a journey due to my heart surgery. There was absolutely no one to help me go from gate to gate, even though they had numerous empty golf type carts. An IAH employee called 3 separate times for a pick up for me but no one ever showed up. This airport is more concerned with the shops/restaurants than with passenger safety. I am a true Texan at heart but this airport needs functionality instead of being a big broken Texas mess. I will not be traveling through this airport ever again. You have officially lost my trust."
14th July 2018,1,"""only one TSA agent verifying tickets""","Not Verified |  I have never had issues with this airport. I have flown in and out of Bush for years now. I had a flight that departed IAH at 5.15am on Saturday morning. I arrived at the airport early, as I always do, just in case something unexpected happens. I guess I should've given myself four hours because the line to get into security was around 200 people deep with only one TSA agent verifying tickets and identifications. I waited in that line forever. Then, my flight was scheduled to leave in 10 minutes. I knew I wasn't going to make it because there wasn't enough staff to accommodate the growing number of passengers entering the security line. There was another TSA agent, but he was just sitting there helping the small line of TSA-Pre Check. When there wasn't anyone in the Pre-Check line, he just sat there in his chair and didn't even bother helping the growing line. Once I got up to the TSA agent, she met me with anger. She was rude and didn't even communicate to me with words! She just motioned me to move to the side without any explanation. I had to wait another 10 minutes, and by that time, my flight had already left the gate. I am very dissatisfied with my experience. Why was there only one TSA agent? I'd probably be rude to customers too if I was the only one working that terminal with a line of 200 people and growing. If you're going to the airport, just remember to be there maybe about six hours before your flight, because you never know how short staffed they will be on any given day."
2nd May 2018,3,"""Not many comfortable seats""
","❎ Not Verified |  Worst for comfort, assistance to gates, signs for direction, and distance to change planes. Computer seating is very uncomfortable to wait at for flights. Not many comfortable seats for layovers. Walk, walk, walk, and have to stop people to ask diresctions. Poor signs. "
20th April 2018,3,"""lack of organisation""",❎ Not Verified |  The installation of new security check machinery has been let down by a complete lack of organisation of the personnel. I witnessed three individuals wait in excess of 15 minutes for an opt out search due to no communication. Bags that were pulled required a 25 minute wait until a team member could perform a search due to an absence of “appropriate” staff. A request to expedite the process (I nearly missed my flight) was met with aggression as opposed to an explanation. Fair to say that the investment of personnel has not been matched with employee training.
6th April 2018,2,"""slowest TSA operation""","❎ Not Verified |  My experience at IAH mirrors the other negative reviews posted. I was returning from a vacation in Mexico with my teenage daughters and almost missed my flight due to the slowest TSA operation I have ever encountered. Customs was efficient and a simple process but not security to get on my connecting flight to VA. I figured it being spring break would add to congestion but when other passengers are panicked about missing flights because lines aren’t moving then it is truly Houston we have a problem. My sister traveled on a different fight and missed her connection due to the hold up. Agents were predictably rude, unhelpful, and uncommunicative. I actually had an agent push her finger into my stomach and asked why I still had a belt on and told me to lift my shirt up high. Guess what, no belt, just a muffin top. The airport looks nice as we raced around trying to get to our gate-would have enjoyed being able to eat at one of the restaurants."
21st March 2018,2,"""Worst airport experience ever""",❎ Not Verified |  Worst airport experience ever. TSA took their time as if we had nowhere to go. Even shut the lane down for 10 minutes when they only had one lane open in the first place. Our group missed our flights and had to instead drive to ATL from Houston (terrible experience with Spirit Airlines customer service as well). Will never fly into this airport again.
16th March 2018,1,"""need to employ more people""","❎ Not Verified |  The immigration queues are the most horrendous I have come across. I had 1.5 hours between flights and thought this would be enough, but no. There appeared to be only 3 desks open and 2 large aircraft landed at the same time, so the queues were very long and no staff around to speak to. When I finally arrived at the kiosk, the lady asked me why I didn't tell someone that I had a flight to catch! IAH need to employ more people! It is a ridiculous system in the US where you actually have to collect your bag then check it in AGAIN for onward travel. This is the only country where you have to do this. Every other country you can check your bag all the way through to your final destination. For a first impression of the US, IAH has sorely disappointed and unfortunately this is the airport I have to travel through every time as I now live in Houston."
12th March 2018,1,"""some of the rudest I’ve encountered""
","✅ Trip Verified | Absolute worst customer service I’ve ever experienced in an airport. I travel to Houston often and am so very disappointed in what they’ve allowed their airport to become. Check in was a completely disorganized mess and the airport employees are some of the rudest I’ve encountered. I felt like I was in New York, not Texas. Houston should be ashamed. I will definitely try to avoid this airport at all costs in the future."
15th January 2018,2,"""Horrible experience all around""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible experience all around at this airport. Every security employee berated each passenger as they went through security, even using curse words and muttering under their breath about how stupid we all were because we did not know the proper security procedures, which at times were different than other airports (for example we did not need to take off shoes, and were yelled at for doing so). On top of all this they lost my luggage!"
9th January 2018,1,"""unbearable after an 11 hour flight""","❎ Not Verified |  This must be the worst airport in US! We are on a transit flight and we needed more than an hour for immigration check! Lanes were labeled open, then they closed, and people standing there had to go back like us. We pick up the luggage for transit, and have to scan again and wait in line for another hour! This is unbearable after an 11 hour flight! No service, people unfriendly, and some women from United are screaming at the passengers! I know we cannot do anything about it, but more people have to report to make changes. I cannot recommend a transit via Houston!"
24th August 2017,1,"""has no accessible charging stations""",✅ Verified Review |  Southwest terminal has no accessible charging stations! It is 2017! How the heck is there only one charging station at a gate and it's on 1 old school power strip. Only 6 people can charge their phones when there are over 80 seats available. We live in a time where we are dependent on our phones and you can't make the charging stations more available. You should be ashamed of yourself.
3rd August 2017,10,Houston IAH customer review,"❎ Unverified |  Very good airport, it has a good choice of shops but the airport is quite big so I'd recommend to only do shopping around the gate. The staff there are polite. However the parking lot might be quite dirty and the airport is usually crowded. You usually can find what you want or need at the stores or the supermarket."
30th June 2017,9,"""very cool and hip experience""","✅ Verified Review | A few months ago I've heard of a brand-spanking new high-tech Terminal C North was constructed at Houston and I was very pleased that my flight was there. This was the terminal of the future. The design was very modern and clean. Blue LED mood lighting filled up the whole terminal much like the one in the 787 Dreamliner. The terminal is huge with very high ceilings. The restrooms were like I was in a five-star hotel - very modern and clean and big. There was a nice selection of food and beverages to choose from. The restaurants were not your typical Mcdonalds (no McDonalds at IAH anymore though) or Subway restaurants rather they were the specialty, high-quality local restaurants that made it all the more special. There was also a decent amount of shops to choose from though I felt there too many selling the same things: souveniers, neck pillows, and magazines. What really got the kick out of my Terminal C North experience was the seating. They were not your typical airport seats rather they were leather and very cushioned armchairs and in front of you a table with charging ports and an iPad. Yes, an iPad in every seat! You can do countless things with the tablet to get you occupied such as games, access to the Internet browser, shopping, magazines and you can order food and drinks from it! Very cool and hip experience at Terminal C North and I can't wait to be there again!"
9th May 2017,8,"""airport staff are also helpful""",A beautiful airport to say the least. Excellent design so when passengers arrive they have a long walk to get to their luggage which reduces the waiting time for luggage. Souvenir shops are also really nice and airport staff are also helpful. Would definitely visit again.
24th April 2017,4,"""nothing to do but wait""",✅ Verified Review |  Layover to and from a family vacation in Roatan. On arrival was 15 mins too late for shuttle trains between terminals. I had several hours between flights so I walked between Terminal A and E only to discover security and United counter were long-past closed so I couldn't check bag or get to more secure part of the Airport. On my return flight I arrived earlier in evening. Was told I couldn't check my bag until it was within 12 hours of my flight. Went back at the appointed time - original info was incorrect and again I'm outside the secure area - only another 6.5 hours to go. Nothing to do but wait - not paying $300 for a room. I have books and puzzles but even Starbucks is now closed. Place is bright and clean enough but there is not even anywhere to plug in my phone.
16th April 2017,8,"""very pleasantly surprised""","✅ Verified Review | Before transitting via Houston from an international airline to United Airlines I read the reviews on this site. The reviews had me very concerned about that 2 hours we had for transit from Terminal D (internationl) to B (domestic). My husband also required a wheelchair and this only added to my concerns and yet, we were very pleasantly surprised by the help and friendliness of the American staff. We received help from the airport staff who assist passengers with needs such as with the wheelchair (but you must book the wheelchair or other assistance with your airline). We did not experience the long queues at customs and they were not rude. Note. We landed and departed at off peak times - ie midday and 8pm. The airport is very modern but there is a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) distance from Terminal A to Terminal D.and so you definitely need to take the upstairs Skytrain between terminals. There are some curvy corridors when navigating from arrival lounges, shops and the Skytrain but there are plenty of signs that point the way towards the Skytrain and other terminals. Note. For international to domestic transits you really need to allow 3 hours in case of queues and flight delays but it can be done within 2 hours if you are organised and only have carry on luggage and study the online airport maps to get an idea of where the Skytrain is located. Plus, the local USA airlines tend to stop passengers on to the domestic flights if is within 30 minutes of the plane leaving."
19th March 2017,1,"""Customs was the worst""",✅ Verified Review |  Customs was the worst we have ever dealt with. The waiting lines were more than 2.5  hours long. The staff was rude and kept moving us from line to line only to get put back in another line. There were dozens of people around me that missed their flights for the lack of help with customs. Out of all the times and places I have traveled I have never felt so frustrated. No one was helpful and they were certainly were not in a hurry. This airport has been the worst one of my life!
10th February 2017,1,"""an airport to best be avoided""","✅ Verified Review |    An airport to best be avoided. If you do use it for transit, be sure to talk with the crew of the incoming flight. They may be able to help speed things up. Otherwise it seems you need to allow at least three hours transit time. There is no transit area, so you must clear immigration. There is an automated system, but it rejects most people and you go into another queue for manual processing. When I was there, there were 3 immigration counters operating. It took about two hours with no possibility of sitting, eating, or going to the toilet. Staff were uncommunicative and only sometimes apologetic. Once out of immigration you must collect your bags and find where to drop them again. It seems easier if you are travelling United or Star Alliance. It's a longish walk to the departure part of Terminal D. After leaving your bags, you must go through security to get to the departure gate. It is extremely thorough. Because I missed my connection and was coming next day the line was short. There are no signs about the rules, but they include: Remove everything from pockets, remove laptop from bag, empty water bottle, remove shoes and belt. You get scanned in a machine, wiped with explosive test, then patted down. I forgot to empty my water bottle. If I wanted to keep the bottle, the only choice was to exit and repeat the whole process. Did so as I had time and no queue. Everything was repeated including patting down. In the gate area there is good fast free wifi. Lesson: travelling from NZ to Europe, go via Asia."
10th February 2017,8,"""pleasantly surprised""","Pleasantly surprised. Having read all the reviews here I was anticipating a nightmare with queuing times for everything. But I flew through all queues. Immigration, customs upon arrival. Check-in, security and immigration upon departure, and this was on Super Bowl weekend when there was higher traffic volume everywhere. In terminal D there is a small variety of food and shopping options, but they are high quality. There was no arrival duty free which was one downside."
2nd February 2017,1,"""I'm done with this poor excuse of an airport""","✅ Verified Review |  I'm done with this poor excuse of an airport. I fly internationally every month and will assiduously avoid IAH when coming in from Latin American cities. DFW is a much better alternative - international transfer security Pre-Check availability and TSA agents that don't treat you like garbage. IAH is also a dirty airport in general. You can tell when an organization has pride. At IAH, you can smell indifference the minute you get off the plane."
20th January 2017,1,"""2 hour typical wait at immigration""","After 13h flight into Houston IAH, it's inhumane to have a 2 hour typical wait at immigration and this time with my infant and toddler. It's just sad that I have to come through here. I would do anything to avoid it. Having half the windows only operating is just humiliating to visitors. It's a disgrace to the American people to welcome their guests like that."
18th January 2017,1,"""rudest TSA ever experienced""",✅ Verified Review | By far the rudest TSA I have ever experienced. I went through terminal A at Houston IAH. The employees were continually yelling at us as if we were incompetent. They were not helpful to anyone. Instead they made snotty remarks and gave so much attitude to passengers. I can usually tolerate rudeness but it was all I could do to not say something back. I'm sure their job isn't easy or fun but they could at least have some humanity.
7th January 2017,1,"""travel through different airports to avoid unnecessary stress""","✅ Verified Review |  The worst airport with the rudest staff. I travel all the time and I have never met ruder people in my life, they seem extremely unhappy working there. They are yelling at people like we were going through military training. We were traveling on our honeymoon, coming from London, through Houston to Costa Rica. It was such a bad system, we had to go through customs, wait in line forever, why? I have no idea when we were in transit just trying to get to Costa Rica with no intention of staying in Houston. On the top of this, they had two hours to transfer our luggage and they failed to do so. They lost them! I will avoid this badly organized airport in the future for sure. I suggest you travel through different airports to avoid unnecessary stress."
29th December 2016,1,"""horrible experience for our family""","I am a Kiwi (NZ) I have a permanent residency card here in the US in which everything is up to date and valid, and I got pulled aside and had to wait in customs at the extra security check point and for two hours, while my wife and kids where waiting seperatly from me. Just to be asked where we departed from. This was after the customs guy that just checks the passports never said a word to us and was exfremly rude. Horrible experience for our family and makes us think twice about every flying out-of-state Houston again."
21st December 2016,4,"""wish there were other options""","✅ Verified Review | We have been through Houston IAH airport 6 times now. We wish there were other options. Once again the arrivals hall and immigration was full of hundreds of people. About 5 lines were open. It took over an hour to get to the immigration official. Then we were in another long line, about 40 minutes waiting for security screening to re-enter the terminal and go to our gate. We were lucky with a long layover and bags checked through but poor folks with tight connections and baggage that had to go through customs were really hooped. People using this airport for international travel need to be aware that one hour connecting time doesn't even come close to what is needed."
12th November 2016,2,"""do something about restaurants""","✅ Verified Review |  Nice arrival & departure - on time both ways. But please do something about the restaurants. I am Vegan as are many of your visitors. Nothing at your airport is Vegan nor Vegan-friendly. Please note that even small airports and international ones like Cancun have Vegan-friendly options at their restaurants. Do know that the entire world is not ""grits and gravy; ribs and chitlins; as is assumed in your airport. A salad of lettuce-only is not sufficient. How about some other options! Even chain restaurants offer Vegan-friendly. Do better; be inclusive. "
2nd October 2016,2,"""one point only 1 kiosk open""","This was the worst immigration I have been through. I flew Cartagena to Panama City to Houston to Denver. I had 2.5 hours between landing in Houston and leaving for Denver and I ALMOST didn't make my flight. I'm a Canadian with a TN visa, so had to be in the international line. There must have been 200 people in that line and at one point only 1 kiosk open. The most they ever had open in the 2 hours I was there was 3. The ""greeters"" would just nod and tell people, too bad, when they mentioned they were going to miss their connecting flight. When I got to the kiosk I was told that it was my own fault for not having NEXUS. I ran for the plane and made my connection but everyone on the plane was talking about how terrible it was. In future I will go out of my way to avoid this airport."
1st September 2016,3,"""clean, but not helpful or friendly""","✅ Verified Review |  Upon arrival, I was: treated in a condescending manner at security because I did not understand the precheck system even though I had already purchased it, ignored when I had questions at the gate to clarify I was in the correct place, workers on their phones instead of acknowledging passengers, I felt like I was an inconvenience. I have never been treated in this way at any other airport. My experience occurred in terminal B, United airlines. The airport was clean, but not helpful or friendly."
25th August 2016,1,"""terrible customer service""","Please allow at least 3 hours transit time, the immigration queue is terrible, there are machines for reading passports for holders of ESTA, however please note that they reject far more people than they clear. If you are rejected you must go to the back of the main queue to see an agent,  even if you only have a short transit time, they will not let you go to the front of the line, you must wait your turn. They say if you miss your flight simply contact your airline. Terrible customer service."
23rd August 2016,1,"""transferring is only getting worse""",✅ Verified Review | Horrible long immigration pass at Houston IAH. Despite having ESTA kiosks you still have to line up in ordinary lines. Transferred through Chicago 5-6 years ago and zero waiting. The most backward process I ever experienced. Same with customs. This airport is operated as it was a 2 gate domestic airport. Of course lost my connection flight. I have been transferring through IAH at least 50 times and it is only getting worse.
17th August 2016,2,"""security was packed""",Although my final destination was DIA we were expected to eat dinner there before our flight but when we arrived from Costa Rica we ended up going through customs twice due to computer malfunctions and security was packed. We probably waited in line for at least an hour because we did not have time to eat witch we had a 3 hour layover and we had to run to our gate. I've been through customs many times and I have never had to deal with this ever before.
15th August 2016,1,"""found this airport ridiculous""","So. Like everyone else here, I found this airport ridiculous. The staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful. I had just about a 2 hour window for my lay over and ended up in a line at those terrible machines for over an hour. The lady standing there, doing nothing productive, just kept telling us it would ""take 20 minutes"". That wouldn't have been a problem if it were even remotely true. After struggling with this god awful machines we finally went to get our luggage. Which never turned up because it had been marked for transfer. So we ran through to customs. And we told the lady again that we had 20 minutes now until boarding time. She didn't help us. Thank you to the passengers who let us through. After that it was a sprint to those buses to get to another terminal. Then a super sprint to find our gate. We just made it in time before the flight was scheduled for take off. I will never use this airport again. And if you can avoid it - avoid it. Oh. And our luggage never arrived."
5th August 2016,8,"""a good airport""","Houston IAH is a good airport. It is quite far away from the city. However I don't see why the average rating is only 2 out of 10. The security is only full at certain times in certain terminals. This is a hub airport for United and it is extremely cheap to travel to / from here. The main terminal offers a lot of space, but the bathrooms aren't that clean. It has nice view, and you can see airplanes coming and going. This airport has good and bad points."
24th July 2016,7,"""this was something unique""","I transited from Houston during my round-trip to Shreveport, Louisiana. I took the train to change terminals in Houston. For my flight to Shreveport, there was a general ""waiting area"" for regional flights. You proceed towards your gate from ""waiting area"" only when boarding starts. I thought this was something unique. Overall, I had a positive experience and wouldn't mind transiting through Houston again."
29th June 2016,3,"""customs and immigration line over 2 hours""","Customs and immigration for US citizens at Houston IAH is a ridiculous mess. Glad this is our final stop. So many people missing their connecting flights. After waiting in the self automated line over 2 hours, they started allowing the back of the line to skip to the counters which means everyone behind you is now in front for phase 2. We don't even have our luggage yet."
30th May 2016,1,"""2.5 hours connecting, I barely made it""","Same experience as other travelers at Houston IAH. Immigration service is slow and staff just do not care if you miss your flight and are extremly unfriendly. I had 2.5 hours connecting time I barely made it - I had to ask others to let me pass by. I would love to transit over Dallas unfortunately Lufthansa does not offer this airport for a connection from Europe to Guadalajara, Mexico. Connecting in Dallas I had great experience, everbody tries to help if you are tight on changing plane, well organized."
30th May 2016,2,"""horrible walking distances""",Landed ayt Houston IAH on a redeye flight from Seattle into Terminal E. Horrible walking distance to anywhere else - at least a half mile walk to the Skyway to go to other terminals. Why the half mile walk? Because Terminal E is setup as the International Terminal so if you transfer domestic to domestic you walk to Terminal D with no help from moving walkways. We flagged down a electric cart as the walking distance is absurd but it explains the exhausted people we saw entering the Terminal E domestic gate area.
25th May 2016,1,"""worst passport control""","Houston IAH has the worst passport control service I have experienced in any developed country - only 2 out of 40 lanes open, several immigration agents at counters not working. Waiting time of more than 1.5 hours on a regular Monday evening. Visited Houston last November and have seen no progress, if anything the situation is even worse now. Feel bad for all the people losing their connections, who is paying for this bad service, the airlines?"
13th April 2016,9,"""very impressive""","First time to the US with Global Entry clearance. Given reviews of Houston IAH, I was keen to see what difference this made as I had erred on the safe side and left 3 hours transit time. No queue at the Global Entry machines, hand baggage only so quickly through customs, and managed to switch to an earlier flight. Overall no more than 30 minutes from doors open to being ready for the domestic flight, which was very impressive."
13th April 2016,1,"""long queues for machines""","1 hour 23 minutes transfer time at Houston, plus 23 minutes as our flight from London Heathrow was early but never made the connection due to the long queues for machines, immigration, hand luggage check and body scan - even though this had all been checked in London. I spoke to 5 individuals and explained that we had a flight to catch and nobody cared and in fact blame was passed from immigration to the airline or airline to immigration depending on whose employee I was speaking to. Result, 18 hours overnight at Houston Airport waiting for the next flight out. Complaint to United Airlines resulted in a tough luck reply and a few airmiles points and complaint to airport got no response at all. I will not travel through this airport again."
7th April 2016,1,"""slowest airport witnessed""","Came from Panama to Houston to catch a plane to Germany. Had a 1h40min connection time and my first flight landed early. I'm used to long lines at immigration into the US but this was the worst I have ever seen. There are self service kiosks and I waited 60min to get there - it didn't work for 90% of the people so we had to stand in line (another 30min) to get through regular immigration. There were many officers and I called to attention that my flight was already boarding for 10min but they said that was no problem. Thanks to all the passengers who let me pass. After immigration I ran to get my suitcase and check it again. There was another line to go through customs which everyone had to go though (even with connecting flights). And then came TSA. Being used to mostly European but also US airports where there are different lines according to the proximity of your departure time, there was no such thing here. And even asking officials they said there was no fast lane. Again thanks to all the people who let me pass. Fortunately, after a sprint to the gate I made it to my plane and they closed the gate behind me. I will never ever go through IAH again - the slowest airport I have ever witnessed and no surprise that my suitcase went to Cleveland instead of Frankfurt."
1st April 2016,1,"""lovely facility, horribly run""","Lovely facility, horribly run. We had a 1.5 hr connection on United coming in from Mexico. Had to move through customs, collect and recheck baggage, re enter security, and take a transit train to get to our gate. We saw lots of travelers stressed and running to catch their connections. In our experience, not a chance with many of the stops manned by a handful of people to process us and a customs department operating at half speed. Ended up missing the connection - having a 24hr layover in Houston before United could fly us within a 2hr. drive to our final destination. Either that or wait 48hrs in Houston before they could get us back on a flight. We opted to fly asap and rent our own car to drive home. None of this was within our control nor was compensated at any stage by either the airline or airport. Makes one frustrated at both parties."
3rd March 2016,1,"""had to run for the plane""","Just connected through Houston on a flight from Cabo to Newark. Had 1 hour 45 mins for connection and had to run for the plane. The immigration process and personnel would embarrass a third world country and customs was worse. Four agents spent 20 minutes inspecting my wife's underwear and were either obtuse, rude or just moronic. Once you are done with that debacle you have to line up again to go through another security check. No TSA pre. No first class lines. Just another 30 minutes of incompetence. Embarrassing that this is what visitors see when coming to our country."
21st February 2016,1,"""stuck yet again""","I'm stuck yet again in a long queue at passport control at Houston IAH Airport. I'm in transit, only 10 lanes of 40 open, along with being so slow. Each time I come through here I'm greeted with incompetence or rudeness. Will I make my connection, who knows."
5th February 2016,1,"""embarrassing welcome for visitors""","Houston IAH is the worst airport to be traveling from. Checking in for our flight to DXB was an hour's wait, and immigration on the way back was another hour. There are no TSA Pre or sufficient number of security counters, which means lines for security can take up to 30 minutes. The immigration kiosks for US passports are a gigantic waste of time, it takes a family of 4 at least 5 minutes (if they're quick) to scan each passport and take pictures. They probably need to triple the number of kiosks if the lines are to get any shorter. Baggage handling was an absolute mess, passengers had to go hunt for bags, which sometimes came on a carousel different from the one indicated for our flight. After you collect your bags, customs is another 20 minute line. The entire ordeal from gate to exit took over 2 hours. All in all IAH is the most embarrassing welcome for visitors to our country, and the worst possible way for Americans to return home."
3rd February 2016,2,"""this airport is the worst""","This place is a nightmare. I flew through here on United from Guatemala City to Chicago, as a US Passport holder, and it is a debacle. First, they now have a kiosk to enter your info, scan your Passport and give you a receipt. You then proceed to hand this to an Immigration Officer, and exit to recheck your Bags for your onward flight. The Kiosk throws everyone for a loop, and it was so crowded, the lines were all the way out of the hall, on Jan 4, a Monday. After that fiasco, you then encounter another 3 ring circus that makes most developing countries look like a Swiss Bank. The area to get thru security is too small, so you can not even go up the escalator, to the Security area, they had to stop the escalator, and wait for the security to clear out. Are you kidding me, a new airport, can't handle the passengers coming from Immigration? Then, after you finally get thru security, you need to take a train, as IAH is huge. I am ashamed to be an American, and see what we put foreigners thru, this airport is the worst, and I am on my 3rd Passport, so I get around."
2nd February 2016,1,"""security for connections is hideous""","I have never been in such a terrible airport as this one. What a disgrace. My husband and I were coming back from Costa Rica to San Francisco through IAH. We had to line up in one line to use a kiosk to fill out the information we already had on our form, and have our pictures taken. Then another line to bring the forms and talk to a TSA agent. Why have the kiosk when I still have to line up and clear with a TSA agent. Both my husband and I had TSA PRE, and there was no option for TSA PRE. Then TSA held up my husband for a while with no explanation, and I had to wait outside the room for half an hour, even though he qualified for TSA PRE and is a US citizen. No one secures your luggage. The security for connections is hideous, inefficient, and no one cares if you are close to missing your flight. There is no TSA PRE in the security checkline after clearing customs. We had a two hour layover and just made it to the gate on time for boarding. I will never ever come through this airport again."
20th March 2022,1,"""Worst airport in the USA""","Not Verified |  Worst airport in the USA. This is the second time I have used this Airport in a month. It appears as if international arrivals Airport staff want you to miss your connecting flights. They are unorganized (only a few staff actually do things to help). Then to add more misery to the problems TSA precheck was closed at 8pm on a Saturday. While waiting in the Immigration line many people were discussing how they have missed their flight due to excessively long wait times. I will never have this Airport on my itinerary. If I book a flight and see this Airport on it I will change carriers, change travel times or whatever is necessary to avoid landing here."
13th March 2022,1,"""This airport is not managed well at all""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is not managed well at all. Waited 20 mins to get a gate. Waited 20 mins to get the stroller at the jetway, arrived at 6.45pm and it is now 8.30 and we are still waiting on our luggage. Not clean no. Nobody to help you and no notice of what luggage carousel your luggage comes out on."
3rd March 2022,1,"""The worst airport ever""",✅ Trip Verified |  The worst airport ever. Took 2hours to get through immigration they gave zero cares in the world . Such an antiquated system and airport. I like lots of people missed their flights there was no help no assistance just oh well its not us. Really you work at the airport. Never fly here it's a joke.
3rd March 2022,1,"""the worst airport I have ever flown through""","Not Verified |  This the worst airport I have ever flown through. This is my second time flying through this airport and each time it gets worst. I have seen so many people miss their flights. This airport is horrible any smart small business owner can fix the problems in the airport arrival procedures. Honestly if TSA think this how you solve America security, then I am disappointed to be an America. These lines are long and redundant, and they make absolutely no sense. It took us over 2 and half hours to make it through immigration. It makes the traveling experience horrible. You come back to your country and it's the worst entry system. I believe the only reason this is horrible is most of the international flights are coming from the Caribbean and South America. If these flights were coming from Europe, TSA will find solutions to make this airport entry very smooth. This another form of discrimination. TSA refuses to fix this problem because those flights are from third world countries."
1st February 2022,1,"""avoid this airport as much as possible""","Not Verified |  The worst thing you can do when traveling internationally is to have these Mickey Mouse airport as your port of entry. They never know what they are doing. Going through customs is a mess. They never have any control of the two different lines, one for citizens and one for non-citizens, that will direct you to the proper federal agent. When you are done with customs, they make you go through the process of re-entering the airport as if you were doing it for the first time. You have to go through the x-ray machine, get padded down, have them go through your carry on and then hope that items that are safe to carry with you are not seen as unsafe by these bunch of idiots and get confiscated. For the individuals running this place common sense is not in their skills set. Apparently they have never heard of six-sigma. They don’t have to hire a black-belt to improve the process of making a connecting flight easier and not as stressful as they make it to be. My advice to you is to avoid this airport as much as possible. It has always been the same, organized confusion at its best."
24th January 2022,3,"""Where were the guides?""","✅ Trip Verified |  I had traveled through Ft. Lauderdale international airport previously but did not recall the confusion. Having processed customs, coming from Bahamas, I did not see any information or helps on where to go next for my connecting flight. Did I miss the help desk? I carried my recovering wife’s luggage as well as mine all the way to terminal 3 after dragging it all around terminal one while looking for help. Ft Lauderdale is a clean, nice looking airport and I don’t mind the construction. However this exasperating experience left a dark cloud over the rest of my travel. Where were the guides?"
17th January 2022,5,"""Unpleasant and exhausting""",Not Verified |  This is the most difficult terminal to move from gates e to g. I am 76 and walking with carry on and wearing a mask was horrendous. Took me 15 minutes. Unpleasant and exhausting. Need to improve the ability for seniors to change gates
2nd October 2021,1,"""Unorganized and incompetent systems""","Not Verified |  Worst airport experience of all time. If I could give zero starts I would. Unorganized and incompetent systems. Puts people in holding before processing customs with ridiculously long lines, in a tight crowed space. Had to stop here for a connecting flight but promise I will avoid this place like the plague in the future."
27th September 2021,1,"""Every single time I arrive at the airport it is a mess""",Not Verified |  Worst airport in USA. Broward county is a misery of politicians and Transportation department. Worst airport for immigration. They never seen to be in another airport before to learn. They should be all of them fired. Wait and staff is so incompetent and rude. Administration of the airport is the worst. Every single time I arrive at the airport it is a mess. Chaos through every line. Even mobile passport.
21st September 2021,1,"""most ridiculous process""","Not Verified | This is far the most ridiculous process. This is not an airport to fly with children. I landed at 4:57pm waited 15/20 minutes for the airplane to open the door because the immigration line was packed. Once off was making the line which were 60/70 people in front of me mind you have my 6 year old son with me which he’s already hungry! They asked us to get out of line to get our bag, to make another line for customs! I have my connection flight which leaves at 8:40pm. They need to find a way to make this process faster and easier. If you have kids let them make a separate line, if they have a connecting flight that leaves within 2 hours make a line for those!"
30th August 2021,1,"""worst airport I have even been to""","Not Verified |  This one of the few, actually the only, airport i know of where you have to exit security to go from one terminal to another if you have a connecting flight. Not only do you have to exit security, but you have to walk outside the get from one terminal to another. The do have a bus, but be aware if you're in terminal 4 and take the bus to 3, 2, or 1, it will take well over 30 minutes to get there. The bus stops and waits at least 10 minutes at every short term, long term, and rental car lot that they have. If you're lucky enough to transfer in the same terminal, be aware that none of them have a restaurant or bar worth anything. Chili's is about the best you'll find if it's open. I'm 70 y.o. and have flown all my life in and out of the USA. This is the worst airport I have even been to."
28th August 2021,1,"""it’s truly miserable at FLL""","Not Verified |  Customs and baggage claim at this airport was worse than a third world country. I could not believe the mile long lines and wait times, total chaos. Even our bags were sent to the wrong area. Passengers were yelling because they were missing connecting flights and sheriffs had to get involved. I spoke with an employee and she mentioned it’s been this crazy for a few weeks. I suggest trying to fly out of MIA for international flights, it’s truly miserable at FLL."
27th July 2021,5,"""the arrival process has always been long and annoying""","✅ Trip Verified | I’ve used this airport for my trips for many years and the arrival process has always been long and annoying. Lines are super long every single time. But usually the departure was easier, well, not this time. The line was so long that part of the time I had to wait outside in the sun while doing the line, and spent like an hour in line. The boarding process wasn’t very organized either and the gate didn’t seem to have much space. I hope they improve all of this."
12th July 2021,1,"""immigration was horrible, customs even worse""","Not Verified |  Worst airport, immigration was horrible, customs even worse. One guy checking bags took like 2 hrs, if you have a late flight all restaurant and shops are closed. Never fly to or out of this airport again."
4th June 2021,1,"""there was no where to get any food""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the generator to the worst airport I have ever experienced. Besides being poorly designed, there was no where to get any food. There are lengthy lines everywhere, people are waiting to get food and then find out that you can order food to go with any of the restaurants that are on site in the terminal one. The design for the terminals for self parking is horrific. It has been this way for decades."
28th May 2021,1,"""It is just not a well designed airport""","✅ Trip Verified | There are two restaurants in the entire B terminal. Neither of which are family friendly. You have no restaurants that are good for children. One is a Margaritaville, the other a whiskey bar. No place to grab a quick bite, like a MacDonalds or a Dunk-in doughnuts. Why you have a make-up store and a Sunglass Store I can not imagine. When we tried to plug in our electronics not one outlet was working. It is just not a well designed airport. We could have flown into Miami, next time we will."
8th July 2020,3,"""It was a mess!""","✅ Trip Verified | The Allegiant ticketing/check-in counter was seriously lacking the number of agents necessary to check in passengers on this flight. We stood in line for over an hour and barely moved. While in line, the Allegiant agents began calling up passengers for another flight to check in in front of everyone waiting in line. This prompted other passengers who were not paying attention to jump in line. It was a mess!"
22nd March 2020,6,"""overall rating is bad""",Not Verified | I rode with Spirit and the employee's and customer support was terrible. They had us go through so much more than what we have ever done at security and they had a rude tone. It took them way too long to give us our boarding pass and went through unnecessary precautions at security that we have never done before. This made my morning horrible and my overall rating is bad.
1st March 2020,1,"""customer service is seriously lacking""",✅ Trip Verified | This airports customer service is seriously lacking. Very rude and slow check in to even get your bags checked initially with Allegiant Airlines. I visited this airport 3/1/2020 at 4 am for a departing flight and decided to visit the auntie Anne’s inside of the airport and the girl working the counter acted like she couldn’t look up from her phone to answer a simple question. I asked her when they open and she was rude and condescending. She should be fired immediately for how she is acting. It’s a very bad look on the airport and auntie Anne’s. This isn’t the first time I’ve had this encounter at the same location! Please do something about the terrible customer service!
29th February 2020,1,"""This airport is ridiculous""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is ridiculous. To change terminals we had to walk a mile to make it to our connecting flight. There was a bus but every employee told us it was too much trouble to find and bother with. So, with a baby, toddler and handicapped woman, we hiked to the next terminal. In addition to hiking a mile, you have to leave Security and go through it all again at the mile-away next terminal. That’s absurd. I did not believe any modern airport could be this difficult to navigate I would rate it a 0, 1 or whatever the lowest possible rating is."
28th February 2020,1,"""Terrible organization""",Not Verified |  Terrible organization. They had 2 agents handling about 500 people. Insanely long wait time and no staff present who seemed to care. Worst airport I’ve been to in a while and I travel all over the world.
26th February 2020,5,"""Very bad system they have""","Not Verified |  It is ridiculous how bad customs is in that airport. I missed my flight to NY and had to stay the night there because they took in flight by flight, meanwhile all the machines that are used to check in at customs were empty. I use mobile passport to get thru the line faster, and they made all of us using the app wait with everyone else. I mean what is the purpose of having the app. Then they put us on a line, and the officer did not accept mobile passport, so we were sent to another line. They need to have a better system for this, they are aware that several flights come in at the same time, it is not new to them. This is the second time this happens, and I heard a lot of people saying that mostly everyone misses their connecting flights due to customs. They also need more customs officers there, there were many empty cubicles. Very bad system they have there."
25th February 2020,1,"""Staff are rude and disrespectful""",Not Verified |  Worst airport I have been to in my life. Staff are rude and disrespectful. TSA will yell at you and degrade you. Parking is unorganized. Airport was stuffy and had a mouldy smell. Will never return to this airport again.
24th February 2020,1,"""Worst US airport experience ever""",Not Verified |  Worst US airport experience ever! We are frequent flyers and have never experienced such rude and unprofessional treatment of passengers entering the country from Jamaica. My husband was in a wheelchair and wheelchair customers were moved over to the side in waiting stations. It took more than two hours to get though security. The attendant was loud and rude and constantly complaining. She was pushing my husband into other customers and knocking other customers out of the way with the baggage. Passengers in line with canes were yelled at to get out of line and another passenger became hysterical during the process. When we finally arrived at our gat and my husband tipped her. She opened her hand and spread out the bills counting them in front of everyone. Shame on FLL! This should never happen at a US airport.
23rd January 2020,1,"""most disgusting experience""","Not Verified |  Going through security was the most disgusting experience. My boyfriend had to give up his necklace with his best friends ashes in it. The extremely rude security women told him that he could go back in line for checking in our baggage to put the necklace in there, though with only 20 minutes to spare and the extreme wait on the lines from the incompetent employees, he would of missed his flight and would of had to wait and PAY for an entire other flight. How can you go home after work knowing that you’ve thrown away someone’s remains because the necklace “resembled a bullet”. Regardless of the fact that we were able to unlatch the necklace, show the remains and it had a religious prayer on it. Avoid airport at all cost."
19th January 2020,2,"""spent 4 hours sitting on the floor of the airport""","Not Verified |  We were returning home from a cruise through the Fort Lauderdale airport. When we arrived at the airport early, we were told that we could not check in any earlier than 2 hours before our flight. We spent 4 hours sitting on the floor of the airport, along with over 100+ other travelers, before the Southwest Airlines representative would allow us to even check our luggage. The sign in the airport clearly stated that ‘Baggage May be checked up to 4 hours prior to departure’, yet we were shunned away and told we had to wait until 2 hours prior to departure. So you had a room filled with people sitting on the floor with their luggage because we were being told we could not check luggage until 2 hrs prior to departure when signs posted clearly stated the rule was 4 hrs before departure. I can provide a copy of the sign if needed."
11th December 2019,2,"""This airport is nasty""",✅ Trip Verified |  This airport is nasty. The floor where you sit has garbage on the floors and you see no one cleaning the area at all. The people at the counters are rude when you ask them a question. Never seen a airport that does not care about the upkeep. When you walk in the E area for gates it smells like old mopped water. Smell like mildew.
11th December 2019,1,"""Worst security staff I have ever seen""",Not Verified |  Traveled all over the world. Worst security staff I have ever seen or experienced. Staff not doing their job with conflicting directions to passengers. Staff arguing with each other and passengers. Just horrible.
17th November 2019,1,"""employees were either rude or of no help at all""","✅ Trip Verified | While traveling with 11 family members, my 85 year old mother was injured on an incoming international flight by a fellow passenger dropping luggage on her from an overhead bin. We asked for medical and security assistance on the plane, but none was provided. After de-boarding the plane, we were given a wheelchair. Family members were then instructed to proceed with the wheelchair through custom, through luggage pickup and then through luggage re-check, with little to no assistance. After luggage re-check, we were told we could  not take the wheelchair through TSA to our next gate without airport personnel's assistants. After waiting for over 30 minutes with 9 other wheelchair bound individuals and no one coming to assist, we finally found someone and begged them to help us make the next flight. We made it to the gate just before takeoff. With the exception of the lady that helped us make the gate, other employees were either rude or of no help at all. Even after asking airport security to help us file a report again, we were told to talk to the airline personnel. Not a good experience."
1st November 2019,1,"""TSA was extremely rude""","✅ Trip Verified | It took us two hours to go through security when they were only about 20 people ahead of us. TSA was extremely rude. When my mother, who is 80 years old, came up to go through the x-ray machine, they asked her how old she was? When she said she is 80, they virtually shoved her toward another lane and said: “you go here without any explanation.” We were then separated. And she stood there and waited for several minutes, feeling humiliated and shaken up until an attendant just came and let her through another gate. It is unacceptable."
14th October 2019,1,"""staff were rude talking back""",✅ Trip Verified |  My mother fell yesterday was unable to walk without cane assistance. This just took place yesterday upon arrival at Allegiant outside drop off I ask to men working United for help was told no. Then at Allegiant bag check in the lady said stand aside at 4:45 for a 6:00 flight boarding. After waiting 10 minutes and in fear of not making boarding due to lines at check point security and staff were rude talking back. I took it upon myself to get her in one. Now we have 2 personal bags and 2 paid checked carry on. I myself have had two back surgeries so I am struggling I passed 2  employees setting on a wall by Auntie Ann Pretzel on a wall just chilling.

15th September 2019,3,"""service at terminal 1 was awful""",Not Verified |  I was in the airport helping my 90 year old mother to take a flight with Southwest Airlines. The service at terminal 1 was awful. I had to ask for a wheelchair because nobody came to help us. I also needed a baggage cart and none of the more than three baggage handlers moved to help. I had to walk to another entrance to get a cart and the guy there in a very disrespectful way requested $10 just to give me the cart and carry my luggage 20 feet. All the service personnel related to the outside entrance had no courtesy. I haven't ever seen such an impolite group of persons.
17th August 2019,1,"""the entire layout needs to be fixed""","✅ Trip Verified | After a delayed ten hour flight from Europe, we had the most ridiculous parade of nonsense getting through customs.

The moment we went through the checkpoint we were pulled to the side our bags were taken away and we had to wait for over an hour for the airport security to rip our bags open check the alcohol just to put it back the way we had it, of course, we missed our flight and were put on standby. Good advise, do not bother with the duty-free stores if you want to make your flight."

10th July 2019,2,"""a poor excuse for an airport""","✅ Trip Verified | This is a poor excuse for an airport. I have travelled throughout many airports in the world and this ranks as one of the lowest. There was absolutely no thought or planning put into this thing. Getting to the airport is a hassle as the signs are terrible - especially if you are trying to return a rental car. The guys driving the shuttle buses to and from the rental car location are absolutely idiotic and do nothing but pander for tips. Hint - you can walk faster to your terminal than taking one these buses. The terminals are small, crowded with virtually no shopping and horrible restaurants. The security is a total joke - they make up the rules as I go along and act like Nazi's. I had one idiot tell me that I was wearing the wrong type of underwear for Florida. I am not so sure he just didn't want to pat down my crotch. My wife's purse went missing and security ended up doing an ""inspection"" of it. Our travel cash was in it and we aren't so sure that the guard wasn't trying to take some of it. The restaurants inside the gate are horrible with terrible service and food. This whole place is the lowest of the low. If you need to travel to the area do yourself a favour and go to the Miami Airport it is 100 times better than this monstrosity."

I was abruptly stopped and was aggressively asked “Where is your ID?” I proceeded to look for it in my bag. I usually get my ID out while I wait in the TSA line. He got more aggressive and said “Does this look like a game to you?” He then told me to check in my baggage. The same bag I was able to carry on with AA from DFW to Fort Lauderdale. When asked for his name, he claimed that his name is “Brian”. However when asked to see his badge, he would not comply. He continued to state “If you don’t like the way you’re being treated, go to a different airport”. I am filing a complaint, because I do not appreciate the way that I was treated. I also could’ve been late for my flight. This type of behavior is not suited to represent your airport. If he met someone more confrontational, they would’ve recorded it and all of this would be all over the news."

My husband who suffers from vestibular neuronitis (a problem with balance) took a seat at the table as he was feeling dizzy. My husband is a Royal Airforce Veteran. He then suffered a tirade from one of the servers who told him he couldn’t sit there until the person at the table had finished his meal. Told him it was rude to sit there and asked ‘who would do that’. She continued with her abuse to myself and my daughter and added that we could not just have drinks, this after making us wait some time for her attention. We are from the U.K., were unaware that it is not allowed to take a vacant seat. This is an international airport where people from around the world with different rules and regulations visit. This woman is a very poor example of customer service, a disgusting ambassador for the airport and America. She left our family extremely upset with her atrocious behaviour. We had just spent two weeks in Florida where until this incident we were treated with respect and great courtesy by everyone we met. They were friendly, and helpful. I hope we never come across her like again."
5th May 2019,2,"""What genius came up with this design""","Not Verified |  I live in FLL, this airport which has just had a lot of work completed is horrid. I dropped off a friend at terminal 3 a few days ago and at departures they have designed so there's no cover from the rain - this is a place that gets 6 months of thunderstorms a year. What genius came up with this design. The result - everyone sitting in their cars waiting for the torrential rain to stop before getting out to get their luggage out. Talk about adding to what is an airport already at capacity and backed up with check in and security - I blame Spirit Airlines for that. Another thing - there is no decent lounges - this is an area where wealthy people travel through all the time for cruises and yacht trips. I hate Miami airport but at least they have nice lounges there, FLL needs to catch up and sharpen their game. On top of that last time I was there I had no mobile signal (T-mobile) and their WIFI is awful. I go to central and South American and have better WIFI - this is the USA there's no excuse for that!"
5th May 2019,1,"""the worst airport I’ve ever flown into""","Not Verified |  Quite literally the worst airport I’ve ever flown into and I fly frequently for work. We had a layover in Fort Lauderdale and had to exit the airport to go to a different terminal to then re-enter and go through security again, and to top it off TSA wouldn’t let me go through precheck. Meanwhile my initial boarding pass is TSA precheck cleared and I showed the gate agent my TSA number, to which he rudely replied ‘this happens everyday’. If this is a daily occurrence how has this not been fixed yet!? Meanwhile we have to throw out all brand new drinks we bought at our first airport. Then my husband is stopped by security and has to throw out items that were already cleared through our first airport, which is one of the busiest airports in the world. Now sitting at the gate, the seats are covered in filth, trash is everywhere and there isn’t a single worker to be found cleaning the mess. I will never fly through this airport again."
3rd May 2019,1,"""below the class of the USA""","Not Verified | I'm disgusted with what I experienced exiting the terminal on arrivals level. There was no security exiting the terminal. I was literally mobbed by men posing as Taxi and Uber drivers illegally. No police around to monitor and protect people from unauthorized solicitation. I deal with this in other countries, but never thought I would see this in the USA. This is way below the class of the USA."
25th April 2019,1,"""food and trash littered all over the floors""","Not Verified |  I have never experienced an airport as bad as this one. Terminal 3 was truly disgusting with food and trash littered all over the floors and seats. We didn't want to sit in the chairs and sat on our bags instead because there was food grime everywhere. TSA pre check was closed and half of security was closed leaving us to navigate hours of waiting time. The kiosks at Jet Blue didnt work and again, over an hour wait. When we finally got through and were starving at 9:30pm because of a long day of travel, all of the restaurants were closed or closing and the only thing left was the fast food shake and burger place which was absolutely disgusting - food all over the floor of the kitchen area and trash everywhere. I could not believe I was in the United States - have travelled everywhere for years and this was truly the worst experience. Avoid this airport at all costs."
2nd April 2019,1,"""airport is absolutely disgusting""","✅ Trip Verified |  This airport is absolutely disgusting. I’ve flown in and out of here many times before but it’s been several years and I never remember it being this unclean. We are currently flying out of terminal 3 and the carpets are covered in food crumbs, trash, and things are just generally very dirty. It’s so filthy in here it actually stinks. Waiting for flights in airports is normally very annoying but this is so bad I’d actually rather be sitting and waiting on a plane. It’s also in need of some serious updating and tech updates. Oh, and the TSA agent was extremely rude. I got a full pat down and her hand went up my skirt which made me very uncomfortable. She also neglected to direct me to do what she needed me to do, she just stood there until asked her how she wanted me to hold my hands for whatever she needed so I could be done and move along. Will avoid flying in and out of this airport if I can."

18th March 2019,1,"""I have never been more insulted""","Not Verified |  TSA subjected me to a full pat down in front of my children and the entire airport due to my infants bottle testing contaminated. I, originally, departed from a different airport and they used testing strips to test the formula. At FLL only a machine was used, and before all of this took place my body and hands were scanned. All of this showed obvious signs that I had nothing hazardous or trafficking of any products. I have never been more insulted in my life! The airport is extremely dirty with the gate areas being covered in food particles and trash. I will never use this airport again, and I will continually warn others of the harassment that a mother can experience while traveling with her child/children."
27th February 2019,1,"""construction at terminal 2""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at Fort Lauderdale, three hours early to have dinner with the wife and kids, nowhere was it posted that there was construction at terminal 2 with nothing to choose from until you arrived at the gate. Three 6 inch cheese pizzas, almost $40.00 US! They weren’t even good pizzas! The wife picked up a panini. $10.00 US! So for about $70.00 CDN we had the privilege to eat. Thanks terminal 2 Fll. If you enjoy the airport shops, forget it, you have perhaps 2 for your shopping pleasure. Will choose MCO, MIA, or TPA in the future."
27th January 2019,1,"""surely unacceptable""","✅ Trip Verified | There is an extremely long wait at Immigration. We spent about 3 hours in the line. A hundred plus people waiting patiently attended by only two officers. No courtesy was shown to the elderly or infants. People were given no seating or water. People fly very long flights, myself having taken 16 hours Emirates from Mumbai. This is surely unacceptable to any international visitor to the America"
20th January 2019,9,"""problem using FLL airport""","✅ Trip Verified | I was on vacation in Florida with my husband and daughter and lost my purse which had all my identity in it. We arrived to airport early Sunday morning the 13th at 7:45am. (our flight was boarding at 10:25am). We proceeded to the line for Security since we just had carry on items and was surprised how fast the line was moving. My family went through without a problem but I was detained due to no Identity (no license). The Lead Traffic Controller was notified and arrived within a 1-2 minutes to question me. He was professional and very kind. Because I did not have any identity, He had to get an Identity questionnaire which took only another 1-2 minutes. I could tell he was extremely busy as his Communication radio was going off, but he took it in stride and actually lowered the volume so he could give me his full attention. He called Washington and after answering a few questions I was able to sign the form and go through security. He guided me through the security process, searched my bags. His biggest challenge was finding a female officer to pat me down. He had to rotate some Male officers around in order to free up the female officer. I was amazed how smooth he worked and how respectful the other officers were to him. Finally, I was cleared and was able to reunite with my family. I was most thankful to him and all the staff. They are all working so hard with minimal staff during this difficult time with the Federal Shutdown. On another note, the Airport and bathroom facilities were clean - in one bathroom there was a very attentive worker facilitating the line and keeping the room clean. I would have no problem using Fort Lauderdale Airport in the future."
14th January 2019,1,"""dirty men's room""",✅ Trip Verified |  Terminal 4 con G dirty men's room. Smelled like urine. Needs cleaning can smell it 200 yards away use cleaning solvent or bleach. Attention to detail.
13th January 2019,1,"""worst in the USA""","Not Verified | Wow, this airport truly has to be one of the worst in the USA, and maybe at the bottom for worldwide rankings too. This airport is clearly run like a ""government agency"" versus local economic engine or ""pride of our community"". Bathrooms are cleaner and fresher at a municipal sports stadium. As a professional whose job is large campus plant operations it is clear to me airport executive leadership (OPS executive) is not rounding each and every day like they are supposed to be. If they were, they'd see how much is wrong. Just today, flying out of SWA Terminal, the bathrooms adjacent to the B gates had no soap in any dispenser for 8 (yes, eight) sinks. Oh, BTW, there's was an attendant there reading his phone. Carpets are stained and rarely vacuumed. Crumbs and food spills are there trip after trip."
3rd January 2019,1,"""customer service is horrible""",Not Verified |  I live locally and I have flown out of this airport over 100 times. I don’t think I have ever had one great experience with this airport. The customer service is horrible. The traffic is always busy however there is rarely ever an attendant to help move the traffic along. The baggage claim takes at least 30 minutes longer than any other airport baggage claim I’ve ever been to.
29th December 2018,1,"""last time there was no parking""","Not Verified |  I had used the airport before, but this last time I went there was no parking, I was 30 minutes looking, when we were late we decided to go to the front, apart from that there was no parking, the airport was full, difficult to mobilize. I helped my mom to get her bags, it only took me 5 minutes and the transit agent gave me a $ 79 ticket just for helping my mom because they also do not show the ease of helping people. Terrible service."
21st December 2018,1,"""airport is disgusting""","Not Verified |  This airport is disgusting! TSA employees are rude when you ask a question but yet, do not tell you any information like if you need to take off shoes etc. Food court is nasty. Nobody cleaning tables, lines are all over the place. Nobody knows what is what. Hardly enough seats at every gate, leaving many people sitting on the floor. I will pay more money to go to other airports."
30th November 2018,1,"""no manners whatsoever""","Not Verified |  The TSA agents in charge of the security checks were rude, condescending, threatening people with no manners whatsoever. They treat passengers, including the very elderly in wheelchairs, with zero respect. Fort Lauderdale is perhaps the worst airport in the world solely because of them. A class in sensitivity training, or basic human decency, would go a long way. It is sad that they are getting paid to scream at, humiliate and belittle travelers."
28th November 2018,9,"""bags were quickly delivered""","✅ Trip Verified | After reading some of the reviews posted here it was with some trepidation that I approached my first experience of passing through FLL. My concerns proved to be groundless though. There were no queues at Immigration and we were speedily processed through. Our bags were quickly delivered and there were no hold ups at Customs. On our return, we were pleased to discover plenty of desks open at Norwegian and check-in was quick. There were no queues at the security checks and, again, we were swiftly through. Overall, a very impressive experience."
24th November 2018,1,"""Staff was not helpful""","Not Verified |  Had a wallet stolen Friday night, nobody could help because lost and found is only open week days. Cleaning staff was in the restroom where the wallet was left and it was still never reported! Staff was not helpful at all! Never again will I fly here."
19th November 2018,8,"""a horrific and very unpleasant smell""","Not Verified |  As I imagine that you pay a company to clean your restrooms, the restrooms near gate G11 had a horrific and very unpleasant smell. Now, about the rest of the airport, there was great service and I was very pleased with how diligent everyone was with their work."
18th November 2018,2,"""Don’t pretend to be environmentally friendly""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is just ok in every way. However, I was appalled to watch the woman who came around to collect the trash and recycling. She took the bag out of the recycling bin and threw it directly into the trash can. When someone came up to her with a plastic water bottle and ask to throw it in the recycling, she directly the person to throw it in the trash. The person again said she wanted to throw it in the recycling and the woman directed her to throw it in the trash. She then sealed up the trash with the recycling in it and put in her cart. Don’t pretend to be environmentally friendly if you aren’t!"
14th September 2018,5,"""open one decent restaurant""",✅ Trip Verified | I only fly Delta and therefore only ever pass through Terminal 2. There are only two sit-down dining options in this terminal and both serve their food on plastic plates with plastic utensils. I wish they would open one decent restaurant in this terminal.
5th September 2018,1,"""No regard for people""",Not Verified |  Nobody was at customs when we arrived. We took over 50 minutes to get through it. One agent continually threatening people. No assistance with a wheelchair. Missed connecting flight. No regard for people.
23rd August 2018,2,"""poorly designed and mismanaged""","✅ Trip Verified | This was the absolute worst airport I've ever been to. Getting here is like herding cattle, you are made to wait instantly on arrival from any international flight. They made my brother wait 3 hours on the plane because there were too many people in line at immigration this airport so obviously poorly designed and mismanaged. They are definitely not capable for handeling international flights. You go from one line to the next line and each space is smaller than the next with no air conditioning or windows. Everyone goes in this never ending line no matter what status you are. Citizen or not. Baggage claim is also a mess. Various bags thrown everywhere from various different flights that you are supposed to search through. Prepare to maybe miss a connection due to this airports negligence. All in all the worst airport experience I've ever had in any country not just the US."
31st July 2018,1,"""Horrible in every way""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible in every way. Slow, rude TSA security, despite my having PreCheck. Hopelessly inadequate gate seating - passengers were sitting on floor and other passengers tripping over their outstretched legs. Filthy bathrooms. Few and overpriced places to eat. Signage, when it exists at all, is misleading."
2nd July 2018,1,"""This was the worst airport""","Not Verified |  This was the worst airport I have ever been in. We landed in terminal 1 at gate C and realized we needed to go to gate E. We didn’t see that on any of the signs so we asked people at the help desk. They told us they had no idea what or where that was! After googling it ourselves, we realized we had to go outside to terminal 3 and leave the airport, this meant that to make our connecting flight we had to go outside and re-enter the airport and again go through security! This was for a domestic flight! I have never heard of such a thing and I have traveled in the US fairly often. This led to a huge line and we almost missed our next flight. There was also no outside bus that we saw that would take us between terminals (we waited where it said to). We had to drag and carry our luggage in the heat. Everyone we encountered seemed rude or had no idea how to answer our questions! I will never fly though here again and that is saying something because a lot of airports are busier and less convenient. Terrible!"
27th June 2018,1,"""not fly through FLL  again.""","Not Verified |  My husband and I have traveled all over the world and this is the first airport/entry in which all the travelers wait at the same line, regardless of the passport your holding and if you have a visa or not. All other countries have a line for local citizens. Where is the loyalty? First, we had to wait to be deplaned because the customs area was full. We then had to wait after passing the jet-way on the hallway. We were then allowed to go downstairs where the ""fun"" began. Have you visited Walt Disney World? Well the lines were just like that. One ""maze"" to get to the automated machines. Then another ""maze"" that eventually will take you behind the machines, around the room and surprised, another room full of mazes. TWO HOURS later we were able to get our luggage. The whole process shouldn't take more than 15 minutes, but like most government jobs, nobody seemed to care. I really feel sorry for the folks that will be traveling during the holidays. I will not fly through FLL ever again."
19th June 2018,1,"""airport is extremely disappointing""","Not Verified |  This airport is extremely disappointing. For an airport serving such often visited cities and known for hospitality and services, this airport is extremely disappointing in terms of ambience, facilities and services. It needs upgrading and perhaps even overhauling. I travel through frequently and frankly I dread having to use this airport. I do not believe that the authorities are taking feedback seriously. I am a priority club holder, sometimes with long wait time and there is no lounge in terminal 3 where many flights originate and arrive. What kind of airport is this? Please open a hospitality lounge in Terminal three. It is badly, sorely needed."
27th May 2018,1,"""terrible experience""","❌ Not Verified | Terrible experience. TSA had to tell people if they were precheck or not (even though most competent people should know). Then the TSA agent proceeded to open a new line for precheck where the back of the line got moved to the front. The guard who was looking at my ticket needed to make sure I stayed behind the line even though I was with the man in front of me. The Cucina & Co hostess was very rude. When I asked for a cup of coffee she made me get up and walk down to the register to pay, cream, sugar, etc instead of providing customer service by bringing those to me. Will avoid this airpo at all costs."
14th May 2018,1,"""it is always a terrible experience""","❌ Not Verified |  I have flown out of this airport plenty enough times and it is always a terrible experience. The employees are so rude. Yesterday I was supposed to fly out and my mobile ticket wasn't scanning. The employee had me behind the desk using the other scanner by myself. I don't know how to use it and she just kept screaming at me to leave the long security line I just waited in to go stand in an even longer line to get a printed ticket. She never once even tried to help me to make sure I was doing it right. Needless to say I missed my birthday trip to see my family. I was so upset and after talking to several people outside this airport has an awful reputation. I will pay the extra money to fly out of West Palm. The people at FLL do not care about your experience. Everyone I tried to talk to (and I was being very polite) either ignored me or told me ""I don't know""."
3rd May 2018,1,"""by far the worst airport experience""","✅ Trip Verified |   This is the worst airport I have ever been through! I have travelled in many developing countries and been to over 30 countries. This is by far the worst airport experience I have had. It took 3 hours to get through arrivals, the staff were pretty unfriendly and they stressed a lot of people out, especially people that had transits. If you have any other option I would arrive at a different airport. Departure was fine but lack of food after 9.00pm is pretty unusual for an airport in a developed country. As a side note this is the first negative review I have ever left for an airport."
27th April 2018,1,"""never use this airport again""","❎ Not Verified | I flew on a Thursday, believing it would be easier than dealing with the airport on a weekend. I'm sure it was but that didn't mean this was a pleasant experience. It just meant there were less employees on duty. Getting off the plane, we were led to believe we were going to baggage, then customs. Surprise! We had to wait behind 150 or so people to use the kiosks, devices created by Satan himself. Why kiosks? We already filled this information out on our customs papers and our photos are on our passports! The woman in charge sent me to the wrong kiosk where I was asked where I came from. Was she kidding? No. That only took 30 minutes. No big whoop. Next: customs and another huge line. Only 2 counters were open! The customs guy was having a great time chatting it up with passengers and taking his time. Good for him, bad for someone who is about to miss a flight. Next was baggage, where I waited about 10 minutes before being told our carousel had been changed. I waited another 10 minutes when, a staff member finally told me another employee across the way had my bag. Why? I don't know. At the airline counter the representative wanted to know how I was doing. I'm surprised she isn't afraid to ask that question. Then it was on to the TSA. Again, employees asking how you are. Please. The food selections are pitiful. One floor had a Starbucks, a pretzel store and a giant bar. It my be an alcoholic's dream but, no good for anyone looking for something resembling a meal. I will never use this airport again. If it's the only choice, I will go to another island instead."
22nd April 2018,1,"""Seating is horrible""",✅ Trip Verified |  No accommodations for guests that are having long stay overs. Seating is horrible the area for cell phone charging and plug-in doesn't work half the time. And all announcements over the PA system are extremely loud.
17th April 2018,1,"""worst airport we have ever used""","✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airport we have ever used. After a nine hour flight we were told that there were no buses available. We were left in the aircraft for thirty five minutes. When eventually we were bused to the terminal we saw at least four buses parked up at the perimeter. On entering the building we queued for twenty five minutes for the automatic passport readers, we then walked a distance and had to queue again for a further fifty minutes to go through immigration again this time a manned one. There are numerous desks here but sadly only four were operational, this is shameful to treat people this way. There was a female member of staff walking up and down acting as though she was some sort of principal teacher smirking at the line of passengers and then having a conversation with the immigration people from time to time. She seemed to find the whole thing humorous. I doubt very much that any American citizens would stand for this kind of treatment arriving in a British airport - appalling! Having now spent one hour fifty minutes we arrived at baggage reclaim to find that our luggage hadn't been offloaded! We then waited as per the instruction board for an hour at carousel Number three. Finally our luggage was found going around on carousel number two!, To summarise this airport this airport is not fit for purpose. It is totally degrading to treat fare paying passengers in this manner. Management and staff would do well to remember who keeps them employed!"
16th April 2018,1,"""shameful way to treat passengers""","❎ Not Verified |  The very worst experience in terms of queuing for both accepting passengers into terminal (we had to stay in the airplane for more than half hour), but even worse for passport/security check, which took more than 90 minutes standing in long lines. After traveling from 10 hours standing up for the long security wait felt like a real health hazard. I think it is a shameful way to treat passengers."
5th April 2018,6,"""better than led to believe""","✅ Trip Verified | Reviews of Fort Lauderdale Airport have been none too complementary, particularly in relation to getting between terminals and the arrival experience. The airport is undergoing extensive refurbishment to bring it into the 21st century and more humanely manage the 32 million passengers that passed through its gates in 2017. As of March 2018, there's still some way to go. Arrival from LGW on a BA flight started off badly as we were kept waiting 30 minutes until we could disembark. This is commonplace, apparently. A touch of amusement was added to the frustration when some new glass doors just inside the terminal refused to accept a key code. Eventually, they did open and one had a chance to see what the new airport is going to look light: light and spacious, but with the usual long walkways to get to customs and baggage collection. Like other US airports, FLL has Automated Passport Control (APC) which gives passengers the good feeling that getting through customs will be much quicker, but which turns out to be just another level of bureacracy and adding yet more mug shots and fingerprints to the database that the US must have on every entrant. The overall process of getting through customs and baggage collection, plus someone to check that the APC had a stamp on it and another to relieve each passenger, added up to just over an hour. That's not that bad, as many reviews report waits of several hours. Once out of terminal 4, it's then a matter of waiting for the complementary shuttle to take one to terminal one where the car rental is also based. In the end, we gave up with the wait and paid $20 each to a man with a minibus who took us there a lot quicker. For the return trip, we used the complementary shuttle and were impressed by the helpfulness of the driver, who actually got out of his seat to help people on and off with their luggage. Check-in for BA Club World was absolutely fine, but the security check process was made over-complicated by staff putting everyone through the 3D body scanner and insisting that everything (tissues and gum included) were removed from pockets - and giving passengers plenty of attitude if those requirements weren't adhered to. Surprisingly, there's no business class lounge in the international terminal, which seems a huge oversight if FLL wishes to attract premium customers. That said, there was a spacious area prior to the gates with plenty of seats (including rocking chairs) overlooking the runway and a number of food and drink concessions. And there was free WiFi. Unfortunately, some of the staff possessed the same attitudinal problem as that encountered going through security. Overall, FLL was better than we'd been led to believe and we'd use it again in preference to Miami."
26th March 2018,2,"""poor service""",❎ Not Verified | Third world country airport at Terminal 4 arrival. 40 minutes in line for customs while travelling with children. They do not bring the stroller. You have to pick it up with the suitcases. Poor service. For departure : terminal was filled up with too many people blocking access to the counter. Security was hell long. Very bad airport at this terminal. Sad Florida state.
24th March 2018,2,"""needs some serious updates""","❎ Not Verified |  This place is sad, the restaurant selection is terrible, check in is ridiculous. This place needs some serious updates. Overpriced foods, airport was dirty and dingy, had to hunt for an outlet to charge my phone. Seating is old. I don’t want to travel through here again."

21st February 2018,1,"""transfers within the airport are pretty dire""","❎ Not Verified |  Fort Lauderdale Airport. I know this isn't in Orlando, but some might be lured by the lower prices to use this airport instead of flying direct to Orlando. We have just used it, and saved £1600 for a party of six, including two children, into the bargain. But was it worth it? Well yes, I suppose it was, but the transfers within the airport itself is pretty dire. There are four terminals, BA arrive in Terminal 4, the hire cars are in Terminal 1, which involves a bus ride and no means of transferring luggage other than to carry it. Luckily we were only doing it one way, on the way back, as our BA flight to FLL was cancelled and we flew direct to Orlando on the 4th February instead of the 3rd to FLL. Bear in mind we are four adults, two children aged 5 and 2, five cases, sundry handbaggage and two car seats and you can see the problem. Ten dollars for two trolleys from the car hire drop-off, up one floor, and outside to the bus. A bit of a scrum, everybody is carrying large amounts of luggage trying to get on. The bus driver did his best, no doubt illegal with the amount of cases stacked on the floors because the racks were full. So round to terminal 4, another ten dollars to get two trollies to wheel into the dparture area, a total of about one hundred yards. You can walk it apparently, but it would take about twenty minutes. Hot, dirty, tired, andand extremely annoyed, the name neither has the glitz of Hollywood and certainly none of the slickness of an International Airport. Once inside things improve a bit. Didn't use the catering so can't comment. Seemed to be staffed by agency staff who's command of English was pretty low in some cases, and the use of some screeching announcer who not only talked too fast but the pitch of her voice made her unintelligible."
20th February 2018,1,"""over crowded and poorly manned""","❎ Not Verified |  Immigration was over crowded and poorly manned. I am a Canadian, but I can't believe they would make US citizens go through this 2 hour process to get back into their own country. It must be a way of justifying their jobs. I will certainly avoid travelling through this airport."
10th February 2018,1,Fort Lauderdale Airport customer review,"❎ Not Verified |  I was flying to Casablanca, Morroco from Fort Lauderdale via Dubai on Emirates. First, I get to FLL airport which is one of the worst airports I have ever traveled out of, no airline lounges, hardly no shops or restaurants pre-check in. I had flown in to MIA and took a commuter train to FLL, I had 6 hours to spare in FLL, which I thought I would spend in a nice restaurant or lounge, that did not happen. I will avoid traveling out of FLL in the future. No doubt."
5th February 2018,1,"""no lounge, no seating, queues for toilets""","❎ Not Verified |  I found the airport to be the worst I have experienced since Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic 25 years ago and I expect that airport has improved since then. You expect long immigration in the USA but 2 hours is very tedious. On the way out no lounge, no seating, queues for toilets, dining, coffee and pretty well everything in a hot uncomfortable environment. Avoid. I presume the Americans don’t really want tourists."
1st February 2018,2,"""the worst airport in the USA""",❎ Not Verified |  By far the worst airport in the USA I have been to. 4 hours from landing to clearing baggage claim. Horrendous lines at immigration very slow moving with no air conditioning and no water to drink. On departure long lines for shuttle buses to transfer from car rental to terminal and at gate it was chaos with crowds of people standing waiting as not enough seats while people trying to get off planes had to fight their way through the crowds and you couldn't hear any of the announcements as the PA system was too quiet. Very limited food and drink facilities.It seems like they have expanded too quickly and can't cope with the volume of passengers now using this airport.
22nd January 2018,1,"""Worst airport I’ve ever seen""","❎ Not Verified |  Awful. Held on plane for an hour at arrival and a further hour in queues and baggage reclaim delays. Departure from a small wing of the terminal which was rammed, one place to eat and drink absolutely packed, overpriced and staff openly complaining and arguing with customers. WiFi barely functional (one hour to connect and another hour to post a Facebook review). Everyone stressed. Worst airport I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen a few."
5th January 2018,7,"""arrival was fairly smooth""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew into Fort Lauderdale Terminal 3 on December 19, and, following our cruise, flew out from this same terminal on December 30, 2017. Arrival was fairly smooth, and our luggage was at the carousel shortly after landing. On our departure date we had a four hour wait because we had to leave the ship in the morning, while our flight did not leave until mid-afternoon. Although very busy, I considered it fairly easy to get through security and to our departure gate. Our section of the terminal had a couple of fast food outlets/coffee shops, and one sit down restaurant named ""Jack Nicklaus"" where we ate lunch. Much to my surprise, our meal was quite good, and, (for an airport), reasonably priced. The one recommendation I would make to airport management is to provide some seating at the hotel shuttle pick-up point located between Terminals 3 and 4."
15th October 2017,7,"""I much prefer to fly out of FTL over MIA""
","✅ Verified Review |  I prefer to use Fort Lauderdale international for my trips over Miami International for a number of reasons, but primarily parking and getting in/out of the airport. I generally do not fly in/out of this airport on international trips as I'll go with an airline that has connections in one of their hubs: typically Atlanta or New York. So I cannot comment on the experience coming through customs at the international terminal. I live in South Florida and they are building a new international terminal, so perhaps the experiences will be improved after that. At peak times it can get very congested and if you're picking up a UBER ride (which has become more popular), the space allotted for them is not large, so that can be a hassle identifying your ride. Communication between you and the driver is key. The terminals I fly through are quite clean (terminals 1 and 2 primarily, and occasionally 30), the security lines can be slow at times, so I always get to the airport 1.5 to 2 hours ahead of my flight. Food selection is OK, and if you're leaving on a late flight, your options may be limited. Parking is pretty good as they have some large parking garages, but if you're parking when it's a holiday or peak travel days, you may be forced to park in one of the remote lots, that's a real hassle. Plan ahead and get there even earlier if that's the case. As for friendliness of staff at the airport, that's pretty much a premium. But despite all of this, I much prefer to fly out of FTL over MIA."
19th August 2017,1,"""not a family friendly airport""",❎ Unverified | It is hotter inside Fort Lauderdale airport than outside. There is only 2 places to get food for you family. This is not and I repeat not a family friendly airport. When you get to the gates the areas are extremely crowded and limited amount of seats. They should be paying us to fly in and out of this airport.
26th July 2017,3,"""no bathroom facilities for 4 legged friends""","❎ Unverified | I was a passenger on a Jetblue flight to Boston. The flight was originally scheduled to leave FLL at 4:06 p. m., arriving at Boston Logan shortly after 7:00 p.m. However, inclement weather in the NY/NJ area caused what turned out to be a four hour + delay. Although an inconvenience, I understand that these things happen. Traveling with me was my eight pound Yorkshire Terrier. She travels in a Jetblue crate, and sits under the seat in front of me. She is considered one of my carry ons, and the charge for her is $100.00 each way. What I do not understand, however, is why there is nowhere within the terminal for dogs to relieve themselves? During my delay, I was forced to take my dog outside a total of three times, and go through security a total of three times! I feel this is unacceptable, and, with more and more people flying with dogs/cats, cannot fathom why there is no bathroom facilities provided for our four legged friends. Believe that a ""hydrant"" area has recently opened in terminal one, and feel the same facilities should be provided in each of the FLL terminals."
14th June 2017,1,"""avoiding this airport indefinitely""","✅ Verified Review | Fort Lauderdale airport is by far the worst I have ever been in. Baggage claim area is a joke. There were about 500 people in a cramped area with 2 area to get your luggage. Asking for assistance by their employees was a joke. They were extremely rude and discourteous. 2 hours to get through customs. Customs agents were rude. Everyone seems unhappy to work there. We arrived 20 mins early at 4:20 and was not finished through customs until a little after 6pm and our next flight begins boarding at 6:30. I will be willing to pay more money for better service and treatment. Therefore, I will be avoiding this airport indefinitely."
2nd June 2017,3,"""force people to take the bus""","Seems the Fort Lauderdale airport officials want to force people to take the bus when moving among the different terminals since there are very few signs directing those who wish to walk. To encourage walking it would be helpful to have signs indicating the path and the approximate walking time. Example, 'This way to Terminal 1', 'Walking time 14 minutes'. Or you may choose to take the bus."
21st April 2017,1,"""luggage hall was blocked solid""","✅ Verified Review |  When we encountered the revised method of automated immigration at Fort Lauderdale, we shuddered, however this was very efficient and fast. Then we passed though to collect our luggage. Absolute chaos. I waited with our hand luggage while my husband went to retrieve our hold luggage from the carousel. One hour passed, another hour passed and by this time more planes had arrived with passengers crowding in for their luggage. The luggage hall was blocked solid and I found out later the carousel had broken down. The staff varied from very courteous and helpful to downright rude. To treat visitors to USA the way one of the male assistance did was nothing short of abusive. There were many elderly passengers due to join a cruise and many were struggling. Four hours after flights arrived we exited the terminal, completely stressed through not being able to join up with our travelling companions. Then outside to get our shuttle was equally chaotic. Not a pleasant experience and would completely put us off using this airport again.. Note this was nothing to do with immigration system as that went well, the failure was luggage collection. Bad experience altogether."
18th April 2017,1,"""1.5 hours waiting to get off aircraft""","✅ Verified Review | Second time in 6 weeks I have flown to Fort Lauderdale from London - terrible. This is not an international airport. They just can't accommodate, last month it was 1.5 hours waiting to get off aircraft, customs painfully slow, then to find the baggage still hadn't been unloading. Tonight I'm sitting here on the plane for 45 minutes awaiting a bus - total rubbish."
5th March 2017,3," ""dreadfulness for different reasons""","✅ Verified Review | I had a domestic departure after a cruise from Fort Lauderdale airport. My experience echoes others' in dreadfulness but for different reasons. First, at curbside, there were no Smarte Cartes - we had to drive to the next terminal where there were still none although a sheriff's deputy went in the terminal and located an abandoned one. So then I got to push it fully loaded back up the hill outside in the heat to my original terminal. And at the departure lounges, there are 4 outlets apiece on the concrete pillars - 11 outlets for 3 departure lounges. Airport management here is either clueless, incompetent or just don't give a damn about users. Avoid this airport."
6th February 2017,2,"""they need to build more facilities""",✅ Verified Review |  There is only one restroom in terminal C. Every time I fly through this airport the bathroom is packed. They need to build more facilities. Eliminate the United Club if you need more room. They also need to add partitions between the urinals.   
18th January 2017,1,"""no respect of all of their customers""","✅ Verified Review |  This is the worst airport to arrive at. No respect of all of their customers. We had to wait for more than two hours getting the permission to embark the plane on January 10th, 2017. Getting into the terminal - the immigration control took nearly two hours as well. We didn't catch our connecting flight to Europe. We had to purchase new tickets for the next day costing us a fortune. The same experience we had one week before. That time we waited 1½ hour at the plane, and were cuing for more than one hour at the immigration control. Never - never again!"
24th December 2016,1,"""touchdown to leaving the terminal - 5 hours""",In common with many other reviewers we found international arrival at Fort Lauderdale a dreadful experience. Flew in ahead of schedule from London Gatwick on Norwegian 18/12/16. Kept on the plane two hours before being allowed to disembark. Many conflicting reports from the embarrassed captain about why we were waiting but looking at earlier reviews the crew must have known what the reason was. Then 3 hours in snaking queues to clear immigration. Only at best one third of the immigration stations were manned. So from touchdown to leaving the terminal - 5 hours. I would have been dangerous from exhaustion behind a car steering wheel. Comfortably the worst arrival experience I've ever had anywhere and I've been flying regularly internationally since 1964.
18th December 2016,1,"""TSA staff were very slow""",✅ Verified Review |    Horrible departure experience at FLL. TSA staff were very slow. We had to go through additional screening for an 8 ounce bottle of mouthwash and a box of lemon heads. The TSA checker couldn't explain why the items were flagged. Then our flight was delayed for 1 hour for some unexplained reason.
11th December 2016,1,"""avoid until they have built their new terminal""",Avoid Fort Lauderdale airport until 2018 if you arriving from outside the USA. The airport is not equipped to handle the amount of flights for international arrivals. It's a disgrace to the USA and to the wonderful city of Fort Lauderdale. Be prepared for long waits on arrival unless you have global entry and hand luggage only. Avoid until 2018 when they have built their new terminal.
22nd March 2022,1,"""They literally sell fifteen kinds of water in this spirit""",Not Verified |  They literally sell fifteen kinds of water in this spirit and no sparkling. None. All these “different” kinds of water are marketing ripoffs. Surely you could manage a perion somewhere in there. One damn bottle. Also not a bag of pretzels. Three hundred kinds of the same thing is not choice. Come on!
14th March 2022,1,"""took over 1hr to check us in""","Not Verified |  This is the worst airport ever! I never had such a terrible experience as I had yesterday. I was flying out for vacation with my family. I arrived at the airport before 5:00am for an 8am flight with united airlines. Due to a lack of staff because of Covid, they took over 1hr to check us in because of a system issue. I had to wait in a long line at customs and when I got to my gate, the gate was closed! They told me that there was a 10am flight that I could possibly get to if I would go to customer service. When I got to customer service, they gave me standby tickets and told me the flight would be delayed until 2pm. I waited all day for them to tell me that the flight was full! I am highly upset, I did not even go on my vacation. They told me to try for another flight for the next day which would be a red eye, but that was completely pointless since my vacation was only 5 days long."
20th February 2022,1,"""poorest airport I have ever departed from""","✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown all over the world, & Newark is simply the poorest airport I have ever departed from. Security was chaotic, understaffed & judging by the equipment, lacked investment. The departure lounge has insufficient seating, no defined queuing areas, is massively overcrowded, has no facilities, is far too hot, & the PA system can't be heard over the noise. In short it is a complete shambles. New York/New Jersey authorities should be utterly ashamed & embarrassed by such a poor, dysfunctional airport. I have experienced far superior airports in countries with GDP's less than that of New York."
14th February 2022,4,"""no professionalism in anyone""",✅ Trip Verified |  Fly here if you want to deal with rude TSA workers. I understand working in customer service can be a huge pain but there was no professionalism in anyone until I got on the plane. Also walking through the airport every worker looked like they hate their lives and the airport.
6th February 2022,1,"""Avoid this place""","✅ Trip Verified |  Avoid this place. We had a reasonable 38 minute layover at Terminal 3, with both flights on the same big airline. Newark Facilities couldn't figure out how to connect the terminal ramp to the normal plane, so our deplaning was delayed about 10 minutes. We hustled to the gate of our connecting flight and arrived 8 minutes early. Only to find no one there and the plane gone, while the sign said ""Now Boarding Zone 3"". No announcements about boarding were heard on the fast trot there. Customer Service tells us Newark Facilities (the same clowns that delayed our deplaning) ordered our connecting flight to leave early. Thus between 4.30 to 9.20pm, we were stuck at this place. Good size terminal with many shops, but nowhere to sit down and order a nice dinner from a human and relax. The few shops that sold food, sold the same 12 items or so, at every place. Nothing healthy and nothing gluten free, which we need, just the exact 12 things everywhere. If we wanted to buy chips (potato, Fretos, Doritos, etc.), they had 1000's of options to choose from, but the opposite for every other type of food - it was ridiculous. As a captive market we expect to be gouged at an airport, but this place was by far and away the biggest gouger - triple most airports. $24 for a simple mixed drink, $17 for a small re-made salad or sandwich. No humans to order from, just the same kiosks everywhere, half of which didn't work."
2nd February 2022,7,"""a nice airport with lots of amenities""","Not Verified |  Newark Airport is underrated - if you know what you're doing. To most travelers, EWR is a very confusing airport with lots of (not so great connections) around the airport. However, once you get the hang of things, EWR is a nice airport with lots of amenities. Getting there, parking is very open most of the time, and most of the time you have to either book 24hrs in advance or go to Short Term parking. They accept multiple forms of payment such as EZ-Pass and credit cards (Terminal C accepts Cash). Getting there on train is also convenient from the city as NJTransit operates to Newark every 15-30 minutes from NY Penn Station. The AirTrain could be down occasionally, so make sure you have time to get to the terminal before your flight. About terminals, Terminal C and B have adequate facilities and places to shop. Terminal A however, is being torn down to make way for Terminal 1 in the future. Terminal A is one of the most dated terminals there is, and I would only recommend flying out of it unless you HAVE to (i.e JetBlue, United Express, Air Canada etc.). Security can be very slow at times at Terminal A (especially during busy hours). Terminal B is the international terminal. This terminal is somewhat dated, however, is way better than Terminal A. Customs are relatively quick here, never had an issue getting through. The last terminal (and where most of EWR's travelers go through) is Terminal C. Terminal C is the best terminal at current hands down. United has modernized this terminal to fit the needs of the modern traveler. The TSA process can be from what I experienced to be anywhere from 5-20 minutes, which isn't that bad. Be warned though, prices do get steep here in terms of retail options and dining options. There is very little cheap food options (besides the Wendy's and Dunkin Donuts, or the Starbucks pre-security), so if you want a good meal, be prepared to shell out some extra cash. Getting to any gate at Terminal C is relatively easy, as if you don't need to walk, there's buggies driving around taxing people through crowds to get to gates. (don't forget to tip them!). So in short from this review, if you're going in Newark, if the trip is a couple bucks extra going out of Newark on United in Terminal C, do it. Terminal C will be your greatest for connections, as well as overall amenities."
6th January 2022,1,"""set up to horribly disappoint""","✅ Trip Verified | It appears that Newark Airport vendors are set up to horribly disappoint, if not anger, all travelers with reasonable expectations surrounding price, customer service, transparency, consistency and quality. Let's start with prices. One expects prices to be higher than normal in an airport but Newark has determined to outdo all other airports and even NFL stadiums in this category. $25 for a gin and tonic, $15 for a breakfast burrito (a marginal one at that) are examples of prices experienced. Convenience store items like snacks are priced similarly, knowing that no one would purchase if the price was visible, you never know the price until you check out. I had the pleasure of ordering breakfast at the Grand Bazaar (fancy name for food court). Order food on the tablet, then you are told to go pay elsewhere. Go to another tablet in a different area and pay (with a horribly convoluted process if you are given food vouchers which obviously won't cover the full price of your meal). You are given the option of ""no receipt"" which most opt for (luckily not I) as when you return to where you ordered your food you are required to present proof of payment. I saw that happen a half dozen times in less than 15 minutes. After waiting a very long time, I asked about my order (having already provided proof of payment when called earlier) and was told she could see my order. Interestingly, a container with my order number was sitting right next to her which I pointed out and they then assembled my order. I have to say, McDonalds breakfast burritos are far superior in taste to the one I got. For starters, it mainly consisted of about 6 eggs worth of unseasoned scrambled eggs with part of a sausage link cut up with a couple of small pieces of bell pepper and onion. It came with a side of cut up potatoes with no options for condiments to add flavor. With a career in retail, I've never seen a misalignment of personnel, product and process as bad as this."
27th December 2021,1,"""No enforcement of Covid-19 protocols""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst airport or transit location of any kind I have ever been to period. Unhelpful staff watched idly by as myself and other travelers struggled to figure out directions, signage, procedures and hours on our own. Extremely poor seating, especially pre-check in. Not disability or elderly friendly. TSA entrance was not properly labeled and I waited for 3 hours sitting on the floor in the wrong area, along with 5 other travelers before anyone told us TSA was open in another area. Disabled people, the elderly and families with children were treated terribly and not given proper attention or treatment. There is a horrible disconnect between all airport staff and no one knows anything or are withholding info and making fun of travelers. Bathrooms were not maintained with broken doors and bodily fluids everywhere. No proper security or safety measures. No enforcement of Covid-19 protocols with many, many travelers not wearing masks. Will never be traveling here again."
30th November 2021,1,"""Never in my life had I experienced such vile behavior""","✅ Trip Verified | Was only in Newark for transit, had to go through Secondary Passport check just for having a UK passport even after stating I had not been in the UK for over a year. TSA staff in the passport check room were absolutely vile, not to me personally but I had to see how denigrating they were to other passengers, screaming at them, making fun of them to their faces, laughing out loud every time they would deny someone entry to the US as if they got a thrill from it. Never in my life had I experienced such vile behavior, the abuse of power is very clear. Will avoid at all cost ever having to go through Newark Airport again, the experience was honestly traumatizing. There is a special place in hell for the 3 TSA agents I saw that day in the secondary passport check office."
29th November 2021,1,"""Most of the staff are arrogant and rude""","✅ Trip Verified | I get it. It’s exhausting working with people, but damn! Most of the staff are arrogant and rude! I’m not asking for the staff to have a smile on their face, have some courtesy. I love New Jersey, but this airport sucks!"
21st October 2021,1,"""I was totally disgusted with this experience""","Not Verified |  I travel across the globe and this has to be one of the worst airports for lack of customer service, arrogant and aloof staff and a general staff feeling of I don't care less. What is in the water there? Dirty, escalators out of service, rude employees, crowded and the ""restaurant"" prices are outrageous. I have seen 3rd world airports where I have been better treated and surrounded by a better atmosphere. What a way to be greeted in the NY area. Someone needs to teach their employees manners and a way to interact with the world that isn't so abrasive and ""I don't care attitude. I was totally disgusted with this experience and will try my hardest to avoid this airport at all costs in the future. Now to be fair, the airline staff do not fall into this category but the local folks that have contact with the public need some real work. Perhaps it is a cultural thing here, regardless it isn't comfortable."
19th September 2021,1,"""the rudest airport ever""","Not Verified |  This has to be the rudest airport ever. TSA pre paying passengers fair warning, they still make you take your shoes off, empty your backpacks, yell at you in front of your children, remove your belt, and cell phones out of your purses. We were even told “We don’t care if your TSA Pre, remove everything”!! Fly somewhere else."
27th August 2021,1,"""not a handicap friendly airport""",✅ Trip Verified |  I waited for over 1/2 hour for a wheelchair which never came. I then had to walk the length of the terminal and stand in line for security. After that I had to walk to the end of the wing to the last gate. By the time I got to the gate I was doubled over in pain. This is not a handicap friendly airport!
17th August 2021,1,"""TSA is by far the worst in the history of all jobs created!""","✅ Trip Verified | TSA is by far the worst in the history of all jobs created! Used my wife to train a new hire, I understand they random check bags but, they left her in a room alone for twenty minutes, went through her bags again. She is standing there begging for them to let her get on her flight and the woman from TSA says, I don't care if you miss your flight! You people are by far the most overpaid disrespectful people in all the world!!"
2nd August 2021,1,"""What social distancing in a pandemic""","Not Verified |  6 or 7 International flights came in all at once. Luggage was lumped on 2 separate carousels. TSA lines were terrible! What social distancing in a pandemic, TSA is rude and unprofessional and need to be fired! I had 10 minutes to my next flight and was detained unnecessarily because I spoke up and told them I was late. I was searched in front of everyone as punishment for saying I was going to be late. Train your staff. I am a seasoned world traveler and to be treated this way is disgusting!"
28th July 2021,1,"""TSA agents are rude and inconsiderate""",Not Verified |  Every time I fly through here it is bad. TSA agents are rude and inconsiderate and treat pro travelers the same as first time flyers. I have global entry with TSA Pre and got yelled at for my laptop. Rather that. Be professional to a business flyer they yelled at me and made me wait even longer. Fly into JFK or LaGuardia.
19th July 2021,1,"""This place is disgusting""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been travelling for over 25 years. Worst experience of an airport I have ever encountered. The drive in was bad, the TSA employees are rude, and the Security lines are disorganized. Never mind about being TSA approved, it means nothing in this airport. Then there is the walk into the terminal. Federal mandate says you have to wear a mask. They should take a look at the condition of the Filthy common areas. The floors are disgusting, the bathrooms are makeshift bathrooms you would see for the homeless. Nothing is open no lounge no bars. Everyone that works there is either on their phones or just have no intentions of doing anything. Truly a free ride. This place is disgusting. It looks like a Third World holding pen in here."
9th July 2021,1,"""this airport truly is one you don’t deserve to experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Avoid this airport at all costs! The worst at everything you can imagine. $30+ for a philly sandwich, ($22+ for a cocktail), re-check through security to travel between terminals, mind numbingly inept and careless employees in security, food or any other service you can imagine. Dirty and disgusting everything and an international terminal so run down that it has to be an embarrassment for the airport authority. I don’t normally write reviews, but this airport truly is one you don’t deserve to experience."
8th July 2021,1,"""Is this the new normal?""",✅ Trip Verified | Is this the new normal? Gouging for overpriced food. Everything is automated which is nice if service and product is good but no one to complain to when you buy $40 terrible meal and sit at a filthy table. If the A/C is turned on I’m not impressed. Sitting here sweating eating overpriced garbage food at a table that no one ever cleans. Can’t wait to get to a foreign airport where they take some pride in their spaces. Way to go Newark!
4th July 2021,1,"""The terminal was disgusting""",Not Verified |  The terminal was disgusting. The tables were filthy! I was required to wear a mask yet it looked as if the floors and tables hadn’t been cleaned in days. Lots of staff members sitting on their phones. This may be the worst airport terminal I’ve seen thus far.
14th June 2021,5,"""terminal has a large number of food offering""","✅ Trip Verified | I arrived in terminal C, which was United's flagship hub. The terminal has a large number of food offerings and was very clean. After I dined, however, I began having issues. My next flight was out of terminal B, which meant I had to use the AirTrain. Unbeknownst to me, I had to clear security again, which had me rushing to my gate. I later found out that I could have taken the shuttle, however, the employees at terminal C never mentioned it. After making my way into terminal B, I had to walk around security multiple times, as it looked as if the checkpoint was closed, even though it was opened. I had just managed to make my flight on time, even after the gate agent told me that I needed to buy a KN95 mask, which Newark sells for 20 dollars. Beware of the mask policies - US airlines allow any cloth mask, but EU airlines demand a medical one. EWR is a great airport for a long connection, especially terminal C. I would not recommend this airport for a short connection, especially if a terminal change is required."
13th June 2021,1,"""possibly the worst airport in the world""","Not Verified |  This is possibly the worst airport in the world. Limited food, nothing open, Prices are 2 to 4 times higher than any other airport. No place to get any type of meal I would highly recommend that this airport be bulldozed."
8th April 2021,1,"""crammed into this place like an ant hill""","Not Verified |  It is impossible for me to conceive how any authority would allow this airport to operate as it does while there's a virus going around. People are crammed into this place like an ant hill everywhere. Checkin lines are out if control. It took us 10 minutes fighting through crowds to get upstairs to the business check-in. Security lines especially after you retrieve your carry on bags from the belt are just plain in your face unsafe. Again, anthill. While thick crowds shuffle through, people sit in the middle of the walkways with masks off because they're at a bar. How is this ok? Avoid."
12th December 2020,1,"""unnecessary stressful situation today""","✅ Trip Verified |  I had an unnecessary stressful situation today at the Newark. I had my bag held for at least 20 minutes because I had a tub of lysol wipes. There was 10 bags ahead of mine, the person checking the bags was by herself doing it. I tried to talk to her that I would miss my flight if I had to wait for all those bags. Her answer I will get to it when I get to it. So after waiting impatiently she finally gets to my bag to only grab my thin tube of lysol wipes and wipe it with something and give me my bag. I had to sprint run to my gate. I mean where do you guys hire such insensitive people? Why do other businesses care about customer service and you don't? Do you offer any training to your employees or do you just take them off the street and put them to work? If you want to be checking bags for unreasonable reason then hire more people and educate them."
25th November 2020,3,"""disorganization and chaos""","Not Verified |  We were flying home from a weekend in New Jersey on Sunday, November 15, 2020. We arrived around noon for a 3:00 pm flight on United Airlines. The disorganization and chaos was something out of a movie. Nobody at United knew where to go, the lines were out the door, and the employees seemed lost. Nobody was able to answer questions. One guy (not with us) was yelling out loud for someone from United Airlines to please assist with the chaos. We had my grandsons who are 7 and 5 years old. Thank goodness they were patient because it took us over 100 minutes to check in and check our bags. I have never in all my years experienced anything like it. I had TSA recheck on my boarding pass and the lady acted like she didn’t know where it was. I went through the regular line to avoid more problems. (on another note, I flew home on October 12 from here and the TSA precheck was CLOSED. People were livid! Why do we close that on a busy Sunday?) United Airlines should take most of the blame for this but Newark gets a little also. It was awful! We grabbed a quick bite before the flight and paid $36 for a salad and a small soda.  I certainly hope someone sees this and does something about it. Thank you!"
3rd October 2020,3,"""Dirty Terminal A""","Not Verified |  Dirty Terminal A, almost nasty. TSA precheck were bumbling around, fumbling with bags on the belt, standing around chatting with each other and basically not paying attention. True amateur hour."
4th May 2020,1,"""Water vending machines needed""","Not Verified |  Water vending machines needed after security.  All stores obviously closed due to COVID. Pass the security only a water fountainis available. Is that hygienic considering the rate at which the virus keeps spreading?  There are 2 vending machines that sell electronics. Please exchange those for a water one! In the meantime, bring an empty bottle of water with you."
13th March 2020,1,"""Worst experience ever""",Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. I had a long lay over and wanted to go to a lounge in a different concourse but was unable too. Every time you go to a different concourse you have to go back through security if they let you. They prescribe your tickets and if you are set for a different concourse they block you. I will never go through here again.
9th March 2020,1,"""I want to change this policy of separating family""",Not Verified |  I was travelling with my family for a vacation. This is the first time we encountered the barking dog security check and it was horrible. My son was sniffed by the dog and was asked to step aside by the security as we the rest of the family was standing there. I had to walk beside the barking dog and was asked to come back to the starting place to walk again with the dog. My son was taken by a cop to another scanning area when we the three of the family were standing in another area for checking. Why couldn't they take all of us together when we were travelling together. He was terrified so were the rest of the family. We couldn't see him. After we were checked in the cop brought him to us. My son said he was scared. Please stop this practice. I want to change this policy of separating family for additional checking.
7th March 2020,1,"""the staff were absolutely awful""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport was horrible. Stopped here for a connecting flight home from London. Most of the staff were absolutely awful. This was only my second time flying and my mother’s first. Staff did not acknowledge us or attempt to help us, when we asked they acted like we were a bother to them. The customs person checking passports and boarding passes snatched my phone from me to scan my boarding pass. The woman in TSA had a major attitude and got mad when we told her that the bins under the table that she said were empty actually had stuff in them. I was in a great mood after my vacation but the staff at this airport ruined it completely. The staff at London Heathrow, Richmond International, Dulles, and Dubai International airports were never rude and disrespectful like this. It’s a shame, honestly, that first and second time travelers, let alone anyone at all, should have to be treated like this and made to feel dumb."
17th February 2020,7,"""I'd still rather fly here than to LaGuardia""","✅ Trip Verified |  I flew into Terminal A and out of Terminal C the next day, both on United Express. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to leave the airport on public transit on the weekend because NJ Transit schedules 3 trains within 15 minutes of each other, then makes you wait 45 minutes for the next one. For that reason, I reluctantly shelled out for a Lyft into New York. I really appreciated that Newark lets you get into Lyft vehicles directly at the curbside - too many airports these days make you walk long distances to a distant parking garage to get your ride, but Newark's customer-friendly decision to let me get picked up at the curb meant that I could be on my way within 10 minutes of arriving, for which I give them high marks. Departing out of Terminal C was a little more hectic, the signage for how to get to security from the check-in desks was inadequate, and the employees who were supposed to be directing traffic were rude when asked for assistance. The food in Terminal C was overpriced, but I thought the quality was actually decent, and I liked the ability to order food on a tablet at the gate and get it delivered. Newark isn't great, and I wish the public transit powers that be would spread the trains out a little more so that there aren't 45 minutes wait for trains. But I'd still rather fly here than to LaGuardia."
31st January 2020,1,"""What an embarrassment""",✅ Trip Verified | Used Newark as a connection on my way back from London. What an embarrassment. Terrible systems in place for international travel. Filthy dirty with trash everywhere. Food is very overpriced. I will pay extra to avoid this airport in the future. I've been in a lot of American airports and this is the worst by far.
30th December 2019,1,"""never, ever again use this airport""","Not Verified |  I fly the world over and still can’t believe the free market has not eliminated this underperforming airport. Hard to believe there is no dedicated custom for people with connections nor do they have a dedicated security line for connecting flight. I am skipping comments to the airline which was as blatantly not caring or competent. Promised myself to never, ever again use this airport."
11th December 2019,3,"""Severe need for an upgrade""","Not Verified |  Every time I come here the waiting area is at least 78 degrees, much too hot to wait for an hour for a flight. Searched all areas of the gate area and not one cool spot. Very restricted food and drink availability at the gate area. Only one restaurant one snack bar. If you are hungry eat before you come to this gate. Bathrooms are clean! Severe need for an upgrade. Very out dated and dirty looking terminal."
2nd December 2019,1,"""disgusted by the experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I am disgusted by the experience my husband and I had at Newark airport this morning. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6am, so we arrived a little after 4am. We breezed through check-in at the Delta counter with zero issues. Everyone was kind, professional, working efficiently, and quickly checked our bags in, printed our boarding passes, and directed us to security. A quick trip up the escalator and we were “greeted” with an enormously, annoyingly excessive long security line. Though the electronic signboard stated the minute-long wait for TSA pre-check, priority boarding, and regular, they informed us all lanes were closed but “regular.” This was was the first major slow down. Next, there was a large number of TSA agents per customers, the majority were dry, cold, and lacked professional courtesy/basic customer service (and some were just straight up rude) as they pushed people through this single lane and barked repetitive reminders about the speed in which to walk past the dog, etc. We are frequent flyers and have seen many other airports use the police dogs much more effectively than Newark. Why can’t they take a page out of JFK’s or DCA’s policy and just keep the line moving at a normal pace and have a lane for the dog to pass everyone? This was the second major slow down. We finally get to our security scan belt around 535am, knowing our flight is already boarding. They switch out TSA people to watch the screen, which stops our line. They yell over and over that nothing may be in a bin except large electronics and edibles. Again, the cold, curt way in which we were spoken to was unacceptable. We finally make it to the scanner and I’m randomly selected for additional screening. That didn’t take as long as I thought it might, but again, I’m now fearful I’m going to miss my flight that takes off in 15 min. No one cares. That was the third slowdown. We get through security to then be yelled at to take our shoes to a bench to put them back on... why can’t anyone show a bit of kindness???? Meanwhile, nearly everyone was passing, in front of or behind, us complaining about how horrible security was today. Why would they not open until 430am knowing people are scheduled to board 6am departing flights at 530? We made our flight but did get to the gate after boarding had already begun. I will be doing everything in my power to avoid the Newark airport for future travel and will tell my friends and family to do the same."
27th November 2019,1,"""Terrible service""","Not Verified | Departed and arrived at this airport for an international flight. Signage is terrible. Services such as restaurants while waiting are extremely limited. But the worst part was upon return getting through border control and customs. Landed early after a 10-hour flight and got in the line for US citizens. There were only 2 agents working. This for a place where planes carrying hundreds of passengers land. After nearly an hour we went past the agents to the machines to scan our passports and answer customs questions, when we had already filled out a form on the plane. We then had to get in another line to see another officer and this line also only had 2 officers working. We were part of a group trip and noticed nobody that had been in line ahead of us or behind us was in this new line. We noticed that no one else in the new line we were in held US Passports. We asked if we were in the right place and were told to stay in line with no explanation as to why. When we finally got to the officer he told us it was bad luck and scanned our passports. Nobody actually ever looked at the customs form. It took us two hours to get through customs and to our baggage. Terrible service. Will never fly through Newark again."
25th November 2019,7,"""Staff were pleasant and helpful""",✅ Trip Verified | We ended up on a United flight following the collapse of Thomas Cook who we had a flight booked with into JFK. Having travelled into JFK many times before I was comparing my experience in Newark to JFK. On arrival signage was clear and there were no queues for immigration. Only the queue that formed from our plane. Staff were pleasant and helpful in contrast to the rude staff at JFK. Baggage collection was fine and we were out of the airport within 40 minutes from arrival. This was at 12.00 pm on a Tuesday afternoon. Returning we found the check in quite confusing but we had plenty of help. There was a reasonably long but fast moving security queue and staff were serious but polite. Really liked the food ordering iPads and the free use of iPads in the departure lounge. Really nice feature. The food and drink outlets were very expensive. All in all a good experience and much better than JFK and I’d use United again next time I go back to New York.
24th November 2019,4,"""security is always a big drama""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Newark a couple of time for domestic and international flights. It is a descent airport with aged facilities. Queuing for security is always a big drama, which is common for us airports. However Newark is pretty horrible in this regard, especially for international flight. That's why I try to avoid this airport as possible as i can. EWR ranks definitely last among new York airports."
23rd November 2019,5,"""A very average airport""","✅ Trip Verified | A very average airport in term of quality of infrastructures and cleanliness. Will need to be modernized in the near future. But overall, the biggest problem with this airport (and other in USA) is the people who work there. Many give more attention to consulting their phone during work time rather than offering a quality service to the passengers! The security staff of TSA are unprofessional, not dedicated to their work, rude and not fit to work with people. It gives a strong impression that the main criteria to work for TSA is to be a loser."
20th November 2019,1,"""lines are ridiculous""","Not Verified | Posted signs and directions are the least useful I have ever seen. No clear direction to rental car, air train, or even what airlines are supported at what gates. Asking airport staff results in attitude. TSA lines are ridiculous, and attitude of TSA staff is horrible. TSA exit provides for only three seats to allow travlers space to re-pack and put on shoes. There is plenty of room for additional seating, just none provided. Restrooms - thought I was in a third world country. Semi permanent outhouse? Complete with queue like TSA? Totally ridiculous. If/when you actually get into one, it is filthy. Terminal - gate area, wide open, good seating, but not one flight monitor. I'm sorry, but if the e-ticket does not provide gate number, and the gate area provides no monitors, you are forced to stand in line to ask at a random gate station about other gate info. Once again - large amount of attitude."
6th November 2019,2,"""airport really is pretty awful""","Not Verified |  This airport really is pretty awful. Overcrowded, generally surly staff, not enough restrooms. At least it is generally clean. I arrived from an international destination a few years back and never again. Try finding a Lufthansa code share and connect in Frankfurt or Munich instead. This is a United hub so I connect here occasionally but try to avoid it. Overcrowded and tired United Clubs. I think I will start using LaGuardia once the construction there is complete. It really is pretty bad."
21st October 2019,1,"""two hours to clear immigration""","Not Verified |  Avoid this airport when flying international and allow at least 3+ hours for changing flights as the queues at immiagration hall were horrendous with so many agents booths unoccupied, surely they know when to put more agents on with the number of international flights arriving. It took me two hours to clear immigration, had a departing flight with United from terminal C so planned to use United shuttle bus at gate 67 which means you don't have to go through security. When i went to recheck my bag in the belt had broken so they were using buses to terminals where you had to carry your baggage onto and as i was now out of the terminal had to clear security again at terminal C causing further delay, i ran to the gate and my flight was just boarding. Staff here are rude and don't answer any questions, signage is very poor and on returning gate signage was wrong sending me the wrong direction for my flight, will avoid this airport again."
21st October 2019,7,"""staff were not very nice""","Not Verified |  To my surprise, the airport was quite clean and kept in well order. The staff were not very nice for some reason, and I strive to always be nice to everyone that works hard like I see these people doing. I did not get my kindness in return. It wasn't too crowded for a Saturday afternoon, and the lines were alright as well"
16th October 2019,1,"""asked multiple employees to help and nobody did""","✅ Trip Verified | I had a flight today from Newark Airport into Detroit. I got to the airport at 8.45 for a flight that was scheduled to depart at 10.05. I had 3 bags, so I knew I needed to check one of the bags. Most airports let me check a bag at the gate. I have done so at Newark before. The TSA Worker stopped me and asked me to show her my boarding pass before I entered the security line as expected. Than she told me that I had 3 bags and therefore had to go downstairs to check one. I than said that I planned on just checking my bag at the gate. She said ""downstairs"". And I said ""wait can't I check it at the gate"". She said I wasn't allowed through until I went downstairs. So I went downstairs. The staff were very unhelpful and the lines were ridiculous. When I finally checked my bag. I went back up to the security line. The same worker as before was trying to tell me I couldn't have 2 bags and had to check the other (which clearly isn't true, your allowed a personal bag and a carry-on bag). They were both small backpacks so its not like they were big. I think she may have been trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm a freshman in college and look like I don't know what I'm doing. I'll give her the benefit of doubt and say maybe it was miscommunication though as she wasn't clear and kept just saying ""check bags downstairs"" and wouldn't really answer my questions. I then was in the security line. The signs said 15-20 minutes. This was at 9.05, so an hour before my departure time. The line was moving pretty slow, so along the way I asked a couple of workers if they could help me since my flight was pretty soon. They said no, which was understandable considering I still had 30 mins until boarding started, and the lines were only ""15-20 minutes"". At about 9.25 (boarding starts at 9.40, ends at 9.50), I was still pretty far back in the line and it was clear the line wasn't moving. I then again asked the original TSA worker to help me as she was right next to me at this point. She said ""I can't do anything about it. If boarding starts in 10 minutes the gate is already closed."" First off that doesn't even make sense. The gate closes after the boarding ends. Anyway I kept on going through the line, and I was pretty close when it was 9.40 (boarding start). However, the line was going very slowly. I got to the point where you put your bags onto the belt at 9.45, 5 minutes before the gate closes. Since there were so many people putting their bags on their, my bags weren't being moved into the moving line. I asked the worker if she could put my bags in quickly since I had a flight to catch. She just stared at me with a blank stare. A kind man and a woman behind me asked me when my flight boards. I explained that the boarding started 5 minutes ago. They both said that it was ridiculous that they had seen me ask multiple employees to help and nobody did. The 2 people in front of me heard the conversation and let me move in front of them to try to make my flight. I got out of security at 9.48 and sprinted to the gate. When I got there at 9.51, there were 0 employees at the gate, and none at the surrounding gates either. I eventually found an employee at a gate 6 away from mine. He was the most helpful employee of the day. He told me to go to customer service and helped me get a new free ticket for a flight 4 hours later. It turns out that the flight left 10 minutes early and they closed boarding early as well. Terrible service. I'd rate them a 0/10 if possible."
13th October 2019,1,"""subjected to music we do not want to hear""",Not Verified |  The music is so loud and annoying. I tried to watch a movie with noise cancelling headphones on and could not hear it over the music. It also makes it difficult to hear the announcements. Not everyone likes the same music so I don't know why we have to be subjected to music we do not want to hear. I hate to fly out of here but sometimes I am forced to use this airport and I always dread it. Why does the anyone think it's a good idea to create a more chaotic environment. It seems an easy thing to fix. Lower the volume.
12th October 2019,2,"""lazy, entitled, abusive, rough and mean""","✅ Trip Verified |  I have never reviewed TSA or any other airport for that matter, but these people are so abusive in their perceived 'power' over the public that it is inconceivable to not give a review. The majority of the TSA staff at Newark are not just rude ... they shouldn't be assisting people in any capacity whatsoever. The initial 'greeter' was a woman that glared and yelled at every one filling up their baskets in the most hostile fashion that people seemed to be cowering. As you moved thru the line she intermittently yelled at older travelers if they moved to slow, or used the wrong kind of basket (although she didn't do anything to replenish the 'correct' ones to her bays) and generally terrorized the guests. It was actually so absurdly over the top that it was humorous at first until you passed thru the scanner and made it to the other side where the remaining 7-10 TSA employees (definitively more TSA employees than in any other airport that I've seen at any one time), loitered and talked amongst themselves and pointedly refused to assist anyone. They would not make eye contact or converse with guests who were trying to catch a flight. If you can avoid Newark airport in general (all Union restaurant and bartenders) ... and of course I had to wait to review because the wifi is so useless...you'll be happier, but that is just the icing on the cake. If you can avoid Newark TSA 'agents' .. lazy, entitled, abusive, rough and mean. I'd say you've dodged a bullet. I feel like someone should report them to their superiors .. but to have hired those people in mass makes me think whomever is in charge wouldn't care to improve."
4th October 2019,2,"""Avoid Newark if you can!""","✅ Trip Verified | I'm a frequent traveler and never have been compelled to write a negative review for an airport experience until now. Lack of proper signage to tell you where you should go. Worst of all is the rude TSA staff that feel the need to hurl snarky insults to the taxpaying passengers who pay for their salaries. They live up to the stereotype of Newark, New Jersey being called the most unfriendly city in the world. First time to EWR and probably the last. Avoid Newark if you can!"
3rd October 2019,1,"""It is too small to cope""",✅ Trip Verified | I would avoid Newark Airport as much as possible. It is too small to cope. Even many of the washrooms are only portable chemical sheds. The screening lines are long and the supervisors rude. I waited 45 minutes in one line only to be told to move to another due to my hip implant where a full body scan was required. It would have been helpful to have some signs or instruction. Even the Air Canada business class lounge was terrible. My wife and I need to stand for some time before finding a small desk to share with other disgruntle passengers.
1st October 2019,1,"""the most ridiculous setup I’ve ever experienced""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst setup for getting food at an airport. Tried to get a quesadilla at Philley Cheesesteak. No signs or indications where to place your order, pay for your order, or where to sit with your food. When asked food service staff they were rude with directing me as if it should be obvious that you pay for your food across the aisle at a separate counter. I placed my order and it took 45 minute to get a quesadilla only after I called the lengthy wait to the staff’s attention. I received a text that my food was ready 1 hour after placing the order. Whoever thought of this concept for food service should be fired. I’ve never written a review for anything before. This experience was so bad. A two hour layover that should have been relaxing was replaced with the rudest food staff I’ve ever encountered and the most ridiculous setup I’ve ever experienced for getting food anywhere."
29th September 2019,1,"""must be the worst airport in the world""","Not Verified |  I have traveled to 45 states and 20 countries and this must be the worst airport in the world. Totally inadequate and disorganized, with unfriendly, rude people everywhere. Do not do an international transfer from this airport unless you allow 3 to 4 hours. EWR is over rated with a score of 2 out of 10."
22nd September 2019,1,"""This airport is a joke""","Not Verified |  This airport is a joke! One security line for hundreds of people, unfriendly staff, free WiFi doesn’t work, departure screen never updates so had to rein on my cellular data, at a charge to get updated info because WiFi doesn’t work. Portapotties for bathrooms, no employees to ask for help and extremely dirty! Avoid this airport if you can!"
15th September 2019,1,"""Not a pleasant experience""",Not Verified |  I was departing late at night. None of the water fountains in the waiting area were working forcing passengers to buy bottled water at ridiculous prices. There were only 2 food places opened and both with huge lines. The coffee machine didn't work. Not a pleasant experience waiting for your flight.
13th September 2019,1,"""TSA here really over extend themselves""","✅ Trip Verified | The TSA here really over extend themselves to make you miss your flight. They wouldn't let go of my mothers insulin at security, almost breaking and ruining her cooler insulin bag and damaging her insulin and making a mess of her two carry ons. They made her stay there for 30 minutes because the staff had never seen a cooler insulin bag like that. Because of TSA ignorance she almost lost her insulin and her flight. Secondly, a United bag drop personnel was making such a big deal about me getting their paper tags that were on top of the counter for passengers to use, saying that I should have asked, so why the heck is it on top of the counter without a sign to ask for it? If we paid for the tickets including luggage we have the right for tags so tags are included and what we paid for. This staff just look like they are miserable and want to pass that on to you at your own time and expense."
9th September 2019,2,"""will do my best to avoid""","✅ Trip Verified | Arriving was ridiculous. I understand there were weather problems, but even Americans were required to speak to a border agent. Had US passengers been granted entry with the machines, then waiting wouldn't have been so bad. In the end, filling the card was useless and the machines served essentially to take your picture and to tell you to report to passport control. It took one hour just to leave the airport. Signage was confusing, border agents weren't very friendly and the layout is illogical. I asked the supervisor, apparently everyone speaks to a border agent. Then why are there machines? Leaving, security was a bit slow. I will do my best to avoid this airport in the future."
7th September 2019,1,"""Coming into immigration was a disaster""","Not Verified |  United Airlines arrived on time, and we disembarked in a timely fashion. Coming into immigration was a disaster. First we had to wait in a line to scan our passports and fingerprints, and customs form, we had already filled out a hard copy on the plane, and a picture. Then we had to wait in line over an hour, it wasn't particular full, just not enough windows open. Then we got to the immigration officer, a nice guy, he scanned our passports, which we had already done, he took our finger prints which we had already done, he took our picture which we had already done, and looked over our customs declaration hard copy, which we already had filled out on the first machine. No reason at all to have to wait twice in line for the same thing. After collecting our luggage we had to wait in line again for about 20 minutes just to pass thru the customs officer, only 2 officers were there, before we could exit. It took over two hours from leaving the plane till exiting the airport. That is after a 8 hour flight."
18th August 2019,1,"""This place is terrible""","Not Verified |  This place is terrible, I have traveled through here many times but not for a couple of years, on arrival I had a 3 hour layover but made my connecting flight by 10 minutes due to the lack of staff both at immigration and security for the next flight? The queues were ridiculous, on departure things were no better, 4 hours to spare so decided to gave a meal and a drink, the prices for both are ludicrous, a steak with no accompanying fries or anything was $47 (before we start with the tipping con) a single beer comes in at over $10 and every bar or food outlet has identical pricing ! You have to order through these horrible pads with no cash option (what happened to the states love of the free market here ?) I will endeavour never to use this airport again.c"
15th August 2019,2,"""airport does not have enough wheelchairs""","Not Verified |  Senior Citizens - Expect the worst at Liberty Newark.. I am a 79 year old man. I was traveling with my wife who is 73 years old. Both of us have mobility issues and therefore we had tickets that allowed us to avail wheelchair facility at the airport. (I was traveling from Mumbai in July.) To my utter disappointment, the airport does not have enough wheelchairs. We were made to wait for a significantly long time to get one, when we needed two. I made it known to the airport official that we will not leave unless my wife also gets one. To this, the official was absolutely rude, rude to the point that he made me stand up from the wheelchair that I had and asked me, in a ruder tone, to wait further. Without an ounce of respect for our age, and consideration of our disabilities or the fact that we have been traveling for more than 16+ hours, he left us to our fate. A young attendant after some time finally came to our rescue with another wheelchair which I was given, while my wife walked slowly behind. If the airport cannot take care of senior citizens, particularly from far off places, then the airport is in no position to boast of service quality. Expect the worst when you travel to or from this airport. Having less facilities is understandable, but a rude behavior from officials should simply not be tolerated. The staff need a lot, a lot of training with customer interaction. This is not my first time traveling to a foreign destination. We have travelled to 12 nations of the world. I never expected that my first experience with a US airport would be the worst. I am booking my return ticket from New York."
15th August 2019,7,"""ground security are efficient""",✅ Trip Verified |   This is fairly good airport. It is clean and the ground security are efficient. We had an easy peasy check in and boading time when we were there. There are plenty of food options in the airport and wifi is available.
10th August 2019,1,"""Everything is wrong""","Not Verified |  Everything is wrong about this airport. Why cant they they have areas for smokers? Wouldent affect the non smokers at all so why cant smokers smoke when they want to smoke here? Our plane was delayed, and we had to buy some food. But at what prices? I have never paid so much for so little. 11$ for a Pizza slice! Gate was changed 3 times, and every time we had to pass people coming out from Security check."
9th August 2019,1,"""I am outraged""","NotVerified |  I am outraged. Our flight was delayed for an hour, and then we had to wait an hour after we landed to get off a plane. Now we have to wait two hours to get our luggage because they won’t tag the bags out until then."
3rd August 2019,1,"""no gate available""","Not Verified |  Plane on time and no gate available, this was Terminal C, United Airlines, more than an hour waiting for a damn gate. Sat on this plane tired and hungry. Unbelievable."
31st July 2019,2,"""2 hours to go through immigration""","Not Verified |  Crazy situation at Newark after arrival from Heathrow. Hundreds of people came in from various flights but initially only 3 operatives were working. Eventually ( and I mean eventually!!)another 3 desks opened. While I understand the need for security , it was very frustrating to take 2 hours to go through immigration after an 8 hour flight when all it would have taken would have been more operatives being employed who could deal with passengers more efficiently and effectively. On the other hand, on return to the airport to Heathrow, security staff were laughing and joking with children and passengers and shouting out which computer games were the best which seemed to me inappropriate for such an important role. I mentioned a stray case which seemed to have been left. The response was less that concerned! Beware Newark!!"
30th July 2019,1,"""disorganised and unhelpful""","Not Verified |  Totally disorganised and unhelpful. Airport machines are stupid. 2hours 20mins in transfer and the whole time was spent queuing and stressed. Their unhelpful attitude really does not help, we just made our flight out of Newark"
24th July 2019,1,"""terrible customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | I have never seen a more demoralized, slow, and unmotivated TSA team than the one working at EWR. Not to mention unbelievably rigid. Nowhere outside of Newark airport does the TSA so unapologetically take your belongings. For instance, they threw my Nalgene water bottle in the garbage because it had the tiniest amount of water. Face wash that I was allowed to bring on the plane on the last flight was thrown in the garbage. It’s slow, chaotic and unfriendly. What is management doing to these people that they operate at such a low performance level? From the moment you step in the airport your accosted with terrible customer service. This place contributes to NJ’s poor image throughout the country. As an NJ native, it bugs me that we do so poorly."
22nd July 2019,1,"""chaotic and poorly designed""","Not Verified |  On no level did this airport succeed in providing a satisfying or even acceptable experience. Have had far more pleasant and efficient experiences at airports in Africa, Asia, and Latin America in supposed 'third world countries' than at this abomination. I am a native born American fluent in English, yet there was virtually no signage, unjustified delays, no information, my gate and departure time was changed three times, exceptionally inefficient management of space (inadequate space for TSA and always between gates), filthy and overcrowded bathrooms, an obnoxious and distasteful obligatory system for making an order at a restaurant, pathetically high prices, overworked and insufficient quantity of staff (who were also largely uninterested in being helpful), exceptionally poor connections between terminals. Over an hour for the luggage to make it from the plane to the baggage rotisserie. Then a chaotic and poorly designed means to re-deliver baggage for a connecting flight. There were a good number of plugs and outlets to recharge a laptop of phone. That is literally the only redeeming thing I can say about my four hour misery in this airport. Avoid at all costs. This airport is a travesty and an example of how poorly designed, inefficient, and unpleasant so much of America's infrastructure has become."
21st July 2019,3,"""among the rudest people""","Not Verified |  The staff here is among the rudest people I've ever encountered (except for the lady in customs.) I flew in from Barcelona and everything was fine until we got to security going back in. This one TSA agent gave a nasty attitude to every person in line, making a big deal out of putting items in the bin. In terms of food options and shops, the airport is decent. However, I'm giving the airport a low rating solely because of the staff."
16th July 2019,2,"""hard to find anything that worked well""","Not Verified |  We travelled through this airport for the first time, and having been through many of the airports in the world, this one is on the bottom of the list with NAIA Manila, as well as most African airports. It is hard to believe this airport is in a first world country, as the service and facilities (in Terminal A) are pathetic, to say the least. It is hard to find anything that worked well, and in addition, Terminal A food options are severely limited. Will do everything possible to not use this airport again."
13th July 2019,1,"""Really bad airport""",❎ Not Verified | Rude TSA at check point 40-50. Spirit is the worst airline I have ever used. Canceled my flight and didn’t tell me where my luggage is or give me guidance on how to reschedule. Parking is confusing. Most of the luggage handlers and gate people I have seen barely speak English. Really bad airport.
9th July 2019,2,"""It was like an oven in the terminal""","Not Verified |  Terminal B-1 (gates 40-49) at EWR sucks! I was flying through here to Detroit. The security line was a mess with rude agents and the process took way too long, most of the restaurants in the terminal were closed and the ones that were open were way overpriced, and the terminal had no air conditioning in the middle of July. It was like an oven in the terminal and there was one dingy old fan for ten gates. Also the carpet was dirty and there weren't enough seats. It's like this terminal was made in the 60s for turboprop planes and never redone! Somehow, LaGuardia is significantly better than EWR. Never again."
4th July 2019,1,"""seating is very limited""","Not Verified |  Worst airport ever. Got in at 11.00pm after a 9 hour flight and had to get another 5 hour flight 5 hours later, so we needed a place to sit and relax. The seating is very limited. Most airports provide rows of seats, however this airport has replaced the normal seating with large tables with limited seating that is somehow meant for ipad surfing at the tables and there seems to be a charge for this. The few row of seats that still exist are divided by metal arm rests which prevent the overnight waiting folks from stretching out, and definitely prevents mothers from holding babies and children, a very family unfriendly airport. It simply does not accomodate families at all. The alarm at the gate door keeps going off. It has been going for over an hour. What good is an alarm if the staff does not come and investigate. Customs requires a checkin at a kiosk. We tried four kiosks, and none if them actually worked. One man was helping people, and he was nice enough, but he couldn't get them to work either. He said the internet connection was slow and they have problems with this all the time. Really? Fix this! We finally managed to get the 5th kiosk to work, but it took us about 20 minutes. Then there was the line for the agent. Then there was the line for the luggage. Then it spit us back out into the unsecured area and we had to go back through TSA. The food look awful and was horribly overpriced. We waited to purchase something on the plane. We weren't about to buy poor quality overpriced food at this airport. Bathrooms were filthy. The tables with the ipads are filthy underneath. The chairs are bolted to the floor so apparently they can't get in there to clean. The way the seating was arranged is not family friendly. Worst experience ever at an airport."
27th June 2019,2,"""security ridiculous""","❎ Not Verified | I entered International from the Port of Spain heading on to Washington Dulles. I cleared customs, rechecked my baggage on the green route and tried to take a shuttle to Terminal C. it didn't work. I was told to walk by a customer service agent. So I did, and found that I had to go through an entire security line again! By doing so they took three hot sauces from Trinidad I brought back for family and friends. I did not think at any point I'd be going through security again so I had put it in my carry on after buying it at a shop at the gate in POS. I've never had to reroute to security after landing and having a connecting flight. I nearly missed my next flight too. The airport was dirty, the signage confusing or lacking completely, and the security ridiculous. Never again."
25th June 2019,1,"""a great airport to avoid""","Not Verified |  I got off the jetway of an SAS flight from Stockholm to Newark to Phoenix. That was the last good thing that happened at this airport. All the bad things that happened: 1) Passport Control/Customs: Huge line, took nearly an hour to get through, because half the kiosks were closed or broken and half of the agents booths were unmanned. The staff providing directions were unintelligible most of the time. 2) Baggage check: Signs directing me to transfer my bag after customs were confusing. I ended up in a line for United Air when I needed to be in another terminal. 3) Inter-terminal transportation. Train between terminals was down, and nobody could determine if it would be up any time soon. Worker yelled at people that they could walk, with no other info. 4) Signage - sucks. 5. Walk between terminals was long, over broken sidewalk. Because of that (and #3) I nearly missed my checkin. All in all, a great airport to avoid."
25th June 2019,2,"""TSA seemed understaffed""",❎ Not Verified | Started with check-in. My bag was placed on the belt without my bag tag given to the agent. She initially pulled up the wrong travelers to get us checked in. TSA seemed way understaffed and very slow. Nothing was clear about what lines were what. It was very chaotic. Then nothing was open at 10am to eat except for two small coffee shop type places. Green Bean Coffee customer service was awful. The guy at checkout kept checking his phone. The breakfast sandwiches were cold and smoothies were not available but on the menu.
18th June 2019,1,"""airport is dirty and poorly kept up""","Not Verified |  To say that Newark is a ""terrible airport"" is a compliment. Any words to describe it are not for publishing was they are so awful and profane. The personnel are not a happy and helpful bunch. They're doing you a favor to be there. You feel that you are imposing on them. The airport is dirty and poorly kept up. The USA is the only country that I know of where luggage trollies are rented. Welcome to the USA. This is not what we are all about. Customs is a joke. They're understaffed, unfriendly and belligerent. The redcoats (non customs officials) herd and yell at you like cattle and remind me of what my grandparents told me when speaking of concentration camps. This is Newark International for better or worse. Mostly for worse."
7th June 2019,1,"""a terrible airport""",Not Verified |  Newark is a terrible airport. From the unfriendliness of all the staff to the small boarding areas with pitiful options for food and beverage at your gate. I will never fly out of here again.
3rd June 2019,2,"""only gets worse with age""",Not Verified |  My home airport for over 50 years and only gets worse with age. While they have updated the terminals over the years customer service is poor to non-existent. Recently flew back from Barcelona on Sat. 5/25/19 (holiday weekend) and trying to get through US Customs was not only a nightmare but a national disgrace. At 3pm only two (2) yes that's right 2 were on duty to check through hundreds if not thousand of flyers entering the USA. A near riot nearly broke out due to the people having to wait over 2 hours for no other reason than poor staffing. The agents on duty were slow as sap in January (apparently they deal with this low staffing all the time) and have no sense of urgency in getting folks through customs. I was told this was normal staffing levels. As an American I gotten use to poor service in public transit but it does leave a sour taste with foreigners entering the US for the first.
2nd June 2019,1,"""Worst airport in the country""",✅ Trip Verified |  This airport is always backed up and causing so many delays. They delay flights all the time for the stupidest reasons and the tsa lines are slow the drop off area is always a mess. Worst airport in the country.
30th May 2019,1,"""dirty, inconvenient, dated""","✅ Trip Verified |  Short and sweet here: Travelers apparently rated this the worst airport in America in 2018. That's unfair only to the extent that other airports probably don't deserve to be denigrated by even being included in the same category as Newark Liberty. It's dirty, inconvenient, dated and inefficient, staffed by a lot of incompetent and unfriendly people, and the area around it is bleak even for a generally bleak spot like northern New Jersey. They should just flatten this place and route traffic through other places that care about doing a decent job and know how to do it."
24th May 2019,1,"""single worst airport""","❎ Not Verified | The single worst airport I have ever experienced. Nearly 1000 passengers entered customs at about the same time, and there were only two agents to process them. After an hour of waiting, I traipsed all over Terminal B trying to follow instructions for Baggage Control, another security check, getting to Terminal C, etc. Whoever designed the signage for Newark Liberty should be fired. Roughly three hours later I arrived at my gate to discover that they were already boarding a bus, where 50 people were stuffed shoulder to shoulder for about 20 minutes before boarding the plane. In my hours at the airport, only one employee was either kind or helpful. The others I dealt with were unbelievably rude and unhelpful. I am an older woman, and I hope I have never treated a fellow human being the way I was treated. The bottom line: if you can avoid Newark, do so at all costs. I certainly will."
22nd May 2019,2,"""Security set up is not fit for purpose""","✅ Trip Verified | Security set up is not fit for purpose. I waited in line for one hour for security checks. There were only three aisles in operation, one for first class/priority for all international flights from terminal 2. And once through security the gates area is horrible. Restroom facilities aren’t big enough for the number of passengers (just four stalls in the men’s, with the lack of privacy and cleanliness typical of bathroom facilities in the US). Oh, and when I arrived here the other day from London I was stood in line for 2.5 hours at immigration. Just a hopeless and depressing way to enter and leave NYC. It makes London Heathrow seem positively heavenly by comparison!"
19th May 2019,1,"""Newark is an embarrassment""","Not Verified |  Well, I can say at the least, Newark is an embarrassment. We arrived at terminal A, and had a connecting flight to Frankfurt, Germany. We had to navigate to terminal B, specifically gate B62. I looked up for the signage, directing me to the appropriate terminal. Terminal B was down a level, and by bus, the signs said we would be arriving. We took the elevator, as we had some carry-on luggage and the stairs looked, precarious. I could quite possibly be over-exaggerating, but we waited at this old elevator for what seemed like a solid 5 minutes, before the door opened. It was like a time warp, back to the 80's inside this elevator. We exited and saw a bus. As I approached the airport worker, I asked her if this bus went to terminal B. Very rudely, she asked me which gate. I told her gate B62. She said that this was not my bus, no bus goes to B62, and that I would have to go back up to terminal A, take a right, and another right and then I could get to terminal B. Confused because of the signs I just read, directing us to this bus, we turned around. Not wanting to wait for the slow elevator, we opted for the stairwell. The stairwell leading back to the terminal, was completely atrocious. Bird wire fencing for walls, trash, dirt and cigarette stench enveloped the narrow and steep stairs. I am not sure if they are even OSHA compliant. There was room for only one direction of travel up and down the stairs. A person walking down would have to stop, mash up against the bird wire fencing and wait for them to pass by. So we take a right and then another right, and we see a sign for terminal B and an arrow, but the ""B"" has been painted over, as if to signify that terminal B was not in the direction we were directed to go! We were basically leaving the airport, by following this rude airport workers' advice. I asked one of the security workers in that hallway if we could get to terminal B this way, and he rambled off on some rude tangent about can't I read the signs? Totally rude and un-helpful. Not wanting to miss our flight by leaving the terminal, we back tracked to the area we began from, in hopes to see another poorly illustrated sign. Luckily a flight attendant was sitting close by, and saw the look of confusion on our faces. She informed us that yes, we were supposed to leave the terminal, take the sky train to terminal B, gate B62. Off we went. When we got off the train, all I could see was a long line of passengers, waiting to get through security. Regrettably, we had to join that line. The line was formed with mis-matching, dated stanchions, crooked and not even wide enough to pull a carry-on through. In the back ground, all I could hear was security officers yelling and belittling passengers for having candy in their bags, over and over again. Publicly shaming these poor foreign passengers, in my country, which I love and have served and protected. I was so embarrassed. Is this how America treats people? First impression is the most important and this was a complete nightmare. Thank goodness my flight to Frankfurt was delayed, because I would not have made it home that day. We got through security and all the passengers at gate B62 were still standing in a long line, waiting to board. The entire airport was dark, dank, out dated and just rude. It was so refreshing to arrive (late) at Frankfurt, where there is order and cleanliness and polite people. Get your crap together, Newark. You are a shameful experience. Never again. Never."
14th May 2019,1,"""Dingy. Tired. Dated""","Not Verified |  As other reviews state, we should be embarrassed. Upon entering terminal B [International Terminal, where one might think we'd showcase our best side], there is woefully poor signage to direct you to you check-in area. Then, after asking 2 airline associates at 2 different areas, we located the SAS counter. Next Security! 1hour, 40 minutes. Nope, not exaggerating. And to add insult to injury, several other passengers in the line stated this was 'the norm'. Frankly, it took less time to drive to the airport from Pennsylvania! Not acceptable. Then into the departure terminal. Dingy. Tired. Dated. Ok, we'll feel better after a bite and a drink. Alas we had exactly 1 choice. Shameful. Could I be more aggravated? Yes I could. 2 bratwurst, 2 draft beer, tip. Go ahead, guess. Nope. OK: $52.00. Incidentally - this is my 14th flight this year, lest you think this is a random complainer. The saddest part is the view this airport gives to our foreign visitors. Yes, I am deeply embarrassed. I see a new terminal is in planning to replace Terminal A. That and B can not happen fast enough. Shame on us."
8th May 2019,8,"""Pretty smooth transitions""",Not Verified |  Pretty smooth transitions from each security checkpoint. The TSA line was slightly longer but that's usual and it was not that bad. Airport staff were quite nice and the food choices in the Airport are very wide and good.
6th May 2019,1,"""for dining were frighteningly limited""","Not Verified |  Horrid. There was no seating option before check in, upper and lower decks have been cleared of virtually all seating, not even anything for the elderly. Also, the only indicator for where our checkin would be, Iceland Air, was a tiny logo on a carry-on bag size check stand. At the gate, the options for dining were frighteningly limited. Outlets for charging are limited and taken up quickly as well. I remember EWR being much more gracious 15 years ago. It is rapidly approaching 3rd world standards, with which I am also acquainted. I will endeavor not to travel through Newark again."
6th May 2019,1,"""underwhelmed and angry""","✅ Trip Verified | The most despicable way to welcome and greet people to any country if this is how they treat them at immigration. I travelled on an ESTA from the EU with an EU passport. The waiting time was 2.5 hours. There was no apology, no sense of staffing more booths, no facilities for elderly people to take a seat, drink water, use the toilet without losing the position in the lines. We had just come off an 8 hour flight from Heathrow. How on earth does the self proclaimed ""greatest country on earth"", one of the richest nations on our planet think it can treat people like that is completely beyond me. The staff - true to form - treated the situation as a normal everyday occurrence (which is even more concerning). The eventual mini interview was conducted in the standard cold, non-apologetic way. I'm so underwhelmed and angry about how this major airport represents the wonderful American people I got to know."
4th May 2019,1,"""rude and completely apathetic bossy staff""","✅ Trip Verified | I’ve never encountered more rude and completely apathetic bossy staff as at immigration. Everyone had a withering horrible attitude. They can’t look you in the eye, they say “have a nice day” (or nothing) with the worst deadpan tone that purposely conveys how much they hate their job and you. Their faces could sour milk. Welcome to the US indeed. They treat perfectly polite travellers like we are animals. Also the prices for food are astronomical. Hard to believe anyone would actually shell out that much money for junk food"
3rd May 2019,1,"""airport is a disgrace""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew to Newark from the UK. At immigration the hall was completely full - about 500 people I would guess. I waited two hours to be seen. There were 3 members of border staff and at one point 1 went on a break. I missed my connection and had to fly the next day. The red coats who had the badge “here to help”, when I said I was going to miss my connection said” not my problem honey”. Firstly having so many people queuing for so long is a health and safety issue, hardly a welcome to the US. I fly frequently worldwide and have never experienced such treatment and rudeness by staff supposedly there to help. This airport is a disgrace and management should employ more staff and certainly train them in manners. It is customer service at the end of the day. Also,there are other airports in New York and I will use them in the future."
29th April 2019,1,"""old, neglected, unpleasant and inefficient""","Not Verified |  I think it's the worst airport I've ever been, being in the US and moreover serving basically the city of NY. At the arrival I found extremely long queues at the immigration desk for ETSA (I think we have been standing for about 2 hours after a 9 hours flight from Europe arrived at night). I departed from the terminal B and here I found the same story: incredibly long queues at the check-in and at the security and baggage check. (Fortunately I arrived 4 hours in advance) In addition the guys at the security were really bossy. What to say about the kiosks selling food at the terminal? Actually there were only 3 or 4 selling common junk food for an exaggerated price. There's no shopping area at all at that terminal. In other words an old, neglected, unpleasant and inefficient airport that you could never expect to find in the US. Scandalous!! I think I'll never fly again to this airport."
21st April 2019,1,"""one of the worst airport experiences""",Not Verified |  Probably one of the worst airport experiences. Immigration lines for ESTA tourists and US citizens lasted approximately 1.5 hours. Then there are two more lines before a passenger is outside the terminal. The AirTrain is old and constantly delayed. It made 6 unplanned stops before reaching the railway station.
31st March 2019,1,"""it is ridiculous""","Not Verified |  Long lines, horrible food, uncomfortable seats, music too heavy, probably the worst airport I have ever seen. For the US, it is ridiculous."
21st March 2019,2,"""lines were long""","✅ Trip Verified | Terminal C check-in was chaotic on the morning of March 18. Several kiosks were down and lines were long. The TSA pre line was blocks long, and passengers could not locate the end of the line. Line jumping was common. United staff response: ""I have no idea."" United needs to remedy this chaos. Until then, I will avoid Flying United out of Newark Liberty."
17th March 2019,1,"""should be ashamed""","✅ Trip Verified | Maybe, if we focused on fixing our infrastructure instead of wasting money on walls, we would not have a NY airport that is routinely described as a dump. Are we really content to be a third world country? Whoever is running this place should be ashamed. No soap. No paper towels. No air conditioning until April 15 even though every patron is covered in sweat. Really? Pathetic. I will never again schedule a flight through this hellhole."
10th March 2019,2,"""Down right rude employees""","✅ Trip Verified | Down right rude employees. I would be fired on the spot if I treated customers the way this airport does. There was a very pleasant lady at baggage check but past that, especially security, there is no small talk, no “Hi” or “have a nice day” at one point I heard one of the employees tell at person “yeah, you or I don’t actually care who steps up but someone needs to now!” I’m appalled."
27th February 2019,1,"""just downright rude""","Not Verified |  Every person that works in this airport has an attitude, don't even try to ask anyone for directions. No one wants to be there and are just downright rude. I will avoid this place in the future. From desk attendants to car rental these people do not deserve jobs! Being stranded in this huge hole is scary and there is no compassion at all! Was not even treated like a human being."
24th February 2019,10,"""Amazing customer service""",Amazing customer service from TSA and airport security. Running late for my flight because of traffic and accident on major highway. Let us go forward in the line and got us on the flight just in time.
23rd February 2019,1,"""Avoid this dump""","✅ Trip Verified | Do not transfer through this airport! For me to get from one terminal to another I had to first take a bus to another terminal, then exit that terminal and then take the airtrain to the terminal and then go back through security! I have traveled for many many years, 2 to 3 times a month, and this is the worst, most poorly laid out airport I have ever gone through. (This includes 3rd world airports I have traveled through!) Charles de Gaulle is now 2nd place in the worst airport to transfer thanks to Newark. Avoid this dump. Plus the food choices are few and far between. Go to Atlanta for any transfers. Best US large airport for transfers."
22nd February 2019,1,"""most disrespectful TSA""","✅ Trip Verified | First, I encountered the rudest TSA agent who treated everyone with disrespect. She even yelled at an elderly woman being assisted in a wheelchair. That is when I asked a TSA agent to report her. Stuck in Terminal A, there were consistently long lines of 15 or so to the women’s washroom. We had it good as the men’s was totally disabled and they had to use the “permanent” porta potties. 3rd world airport, 1st world prices, most disrespectful TSA (do they know who pays their salaries?)."
14th February 2019,1,"""long lines, filthy bathrooms""","✅ Trip Verified | There is a reason this airport ranks so low on all reviews-and apparently the management/owners couldn’t care less! It is so bad it is like you are proud of the bad service, long lines, filthy bathrooms in the hallway-like port-potties, rude wait staff, rubbish coffee, horrible, overpriced. Do you work at making the experience a misery? Gut the place and start over-admit your epic fail and try harder next time, try like you care."
13th January 2019,2,"""nothing appeals to me""","✅ Trip Verified | Terminal C Seems airport made anagreement for the same operator run the majority of the non-fastfood restaurants. They all have ipads everywhere. Seems the kiosks are run by the same company. What a lack a vision by management. Take a look at Copenhagen which I know well. All restaurant are franchises of popular restaurants in the city, there is an H&M and all the usual luxury shops. You actually want to eat and shop there. In EWR nothing appeals to me. Not enough seats as they have all been replaced with bigger ipad desks."
13th January 2019,1,"""Did not enjoy the experience""",✅ Trip Verified | Customs clearance took over an hour. Not many desks open and people cutting line. Suitcase found thrown off the belt in baggage hall. Faceless check-in where we were unable to change our seats to sit together at the front desk. Not everyone is computer savvy or has the time to check in on line and not everyone carries a credit card. Ordering a drink by the app took over an hour to receive as we did not know where our order went. Eventually did get some help and our drinks by asking someone. Did not enjoy the experience of going through Newark airport.
1st January 2022,9,"""staff seem friendly and helpful""","Not Verified |  Neat little airport. The staff seem friendly and helpful. If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty."
6th May 2017,10,"""the perfect size for someone on foot""","✅ Verified Review |    Easy to get around. It was the perfect size for someone on foot. The staff seemed like a small town community. Everyone seemed to be in effective communication with each other. Traveler satisfaction was clearly a priority for the staff at Akron Canton airport. I felt a good, positive energy there. I liked the choices of food and beer that were available throughout the gates. I liked how well my emotional support dog was greeted and welcomed into the airport and on all three flights I took home. I will fly to and from this airport in the future. "
28th June 2021,2,"""Very frustrating""","Not Verified |  Very frustrating - today 6/27, 11.30 am, B gates going through pre-check TSA my husband was returning with our son (12) to San Diego. The lady at TSA said “our son couldn’t go through security without an ID”. Patently false - he flew RT to Texas the week prior. This is a training issue and she almost caused them to miss their flight! Please train your staff!"
7th January 2021,2,"""I have had horrid customer service""","Not Verified |  Avoid American Airlines at this airport. I have had horrid customer service in December 2020 and January 2021. I had a female ticketing agent charge me $170 for 1 overweight bag (54 lbs) because she claimed my husband's military orders were dated in March. Orders aren't posted the month you transfer ma'am. As a 17 year active duty wife, I may know a thing or two. Then said ""just because you are a military dependent doesn't mean you get free luggage"". I never in my life have experienced such horrid disrespect. On top of it I am a COVID crisis relief RN. I was blown away and have since vowed to never fly American again."
24th May 2019,3,"""lines were so incredibly long""","❎ Not Verified | This airport can’t seem to handle the passenger traffic. I was flying American on May 21, my flight was delayed to the point that I wouldn’t make my transfer. I was bumped to the next day and the check-in lines were so incredibly long that I missed my flight the next morning and was forced to fly standby. I have heard similar things from friends flying Southwest Airlines at this airport"
1st March 2018,2,"""TSA are almost always rude""","❎ Not Verified |    Very rude TSA, been through many time and always felt it was very quick and easier to get through other than the airport staff. Not the airline staff, they are great. But TSA are almost always rude, barely smile and speak down to people going through. Not just my family but others around us in the line, and really there is nothing you can say. It is not necessary to always look like you are in a bad mood and don't want to be at work."
10th September 2016,10,"""convenient and reasonably priced""",This is my favorite airport. There is rarely a line to check in and check baggage or for security. On site airport parking is convenient and reasonably priced. After getting through security there is a wide assortment of restaurants and shops along with an aircraft observation lounge. There is an abundance of seating in the gate areas and the free airport wifi is very fast. Definitely recommend.
29th May 2014,2,"""an airport in decline""",ABQ is a wonderful small airport however it is an airport in decline. The basic problem is lack of competition by carriers in the Albuquerque market. Southwest has significantly cut back service to/from ABQ and eliminated non stop service to a number of cities like Seattle and Portland. I addition this lack of competition reflects in much higher fares to the same cities when compared to fares from DEN. Why the airport management at ABQ is not more aggressive in attracting carriers to the Sunport is a mystery. Without more competition in the Albuquerque market to only alternative for non-stop service at reasonable prices is to fly from DEN and do the drive to the Denver airport.
3rd March 2014,9,"""great regional airport""",Great regional airport. Good food - reflecting the unique New Mexican cuisine. From drop off through ticketing and security shouldn't take more than 15 minutes. As stated before the observation area is nice and quiet - with good views of the Monzano mountains and the active runways. Decor is South-western and very classic - with a lot of the original building that existed prior to the terminal upgrade back in the 1990s. It's not O'Hare with lots of flight options but also not the delays and crowds. Just wish there were more flights as prices can be high to various hub cities.
8th January 2014,2,"""worst airport I have visited""",The worst airport I have visited. My flight arrived here as a connection that was delayed so we arrived close to midnight. Aside from janitors there was no one that worked for the airport readily available. As I attempted to sleep in the very poorly heated terminal until the next morning I was woken up by a security guard who told me that I cant sleep in the terminal and must go outside and then re-enter security in the morning. In the morning I was informed by the TSA agent that even though I was active duty military I cannot go through the pre-approval line unless I'm in uniform even though she knew that we are no longer supposed to travel in uniform.
19th February 2013,7,"""easy get away and arrival""",I have used ABQ for departure and arrival 3 or 4 times mostly at a time when I was doing business with a local company. What I appreciated most about this airport was the easy get away and arrival. The traffic was never bad and that allowed me to get my car and get out or get to the airport and on to the check in counter with little delay or problem. The facilities are not extensive and the amenities are modest. But with 25 gates it is not overwhelming. The facilities are also aesthetically quite pleasing.
22nd May 2012,8,"""fast baggage claim""",A shame ABQ doesn't have many flights other than Southwest because it is definitely the best airport in the Southwest. Good security fast baggage claim and no terminal transfers since they hold everything in one building which even blends into its surroundings. Food is a little pricey as well but otherwise it is harder to find a better airport.
22nd November 2011,9,"""a terrific airport""",Albuquerque is a terrific airport. Parking is easy and affordable. Getting in and out is a breeze. The only down side is the wait at the TSA checkpoint can be long and slow so give yourself a couple hours before your flight leaves.
19th July 2010,4,"""distances are relatively short""",Albuquerque International Sunport is a functional medium-size US airport. There is only one terminal with 25 gates so walking distances are relatively short. The corridors are wide and ceilings are high so a bright airy feel. The airport is immaculate. The taxi and rental car shuttle rank are only about a hundred yards from the gate area exit and only steps beyond bag claim. The security queue moves relatively fast. The one negative is that food and beverage options are limited to a Quizno's a bar and grill a bakery offering mediocre sandwiches and a New Mexican restaurant offering very mediocre food.
9th August 2009,3,"""Rental cars are extremely expensive""","Rental cars at this airport are extremely expensive. To save a lot of money I found that renting from an in town location even with return to the airport can easily save 40% or more. The trick is to reserve before with the in-town location take a cab to the location. The cab may cost $25 to $35 but the savings can be much greater. I rented a Hertz mid-size car for 9 days with an AAA standard discount and saved $300 compared to the airport price same rental same discount card! Another point about this airport if you're traveling economy on Delta watch out! On my trip Delta had no curb check-in for baggage and the ""self-check"" inside the terminal had a line with about 200 people. Extremely annoying even if you've ""checked-in"" by Internet beforehand."
21st January 2008,5,"""a hidden gem""",I always try to have plenty of lead time so I can go upstairs to the observation lounge - a hidden gem above the main food court. Free wireless internet leather sofas work tables and spectacular view of the mountains all make this a great place to find calm after security before the flight. Look for the two stairs flanking the large eagle-catcher statue. That's another thing: check out the permanent art collection located throughout the complex. NM is known for its native arts and what a more fitting place.
9th November 2007,n/a,"""fairly modern airport""",Mid-size fairly modern airport. Looked like free parking in front of the rental car building. Shuttles between the terminal and rental car building seemed to run quite often even at night. Decent selection of restaurants and shops for this size airport though security line area was typically chaotic.
30th November 2005,n/a,"""extremely expensive""",The southwest decor makes this airport unique. Easy rental car return with shuttle bus drivers friendly and eager to hoist your luggage on and off the bus. Certainly airport concessions everywhere can be expensive but beware the snack bar directly ahead of you after security is extremely expensive. They wanted $7.00 for a coffee and danish!
20th October 2005,n/a,"""great views of the planes""","I've lived in Albuquerque for the past 11 years and use the Sunport frequently. Long-term parking is a breeze and I've always enjoyed the Southwestern decor of the terminal -- can't get enough of the vigas the tribal art etc. It feels more like an art gallery in areas than a drab & dreary airport!! And if you have time be sure to check out the reproduction of the first airplane to land in New Mexico and the many display cases of model aircraft (before security). There's an abundance of interesting shops and good places to eat (my favorites are Garduno's and Quizno's. It's rarely too crowded except at peak times at the concentration of gates at the far ends of the two piers. Large windows afford great views of the planes taking off and landing; I've never actually climbed the stairs to the special -- and expensive / controversial -- observation deck however. My only ""complaint"" would be that the terminal can resemble a ghost town if you arrive on a late flight (say after 10 or 11 pm or so). It would be nice if at least one place to eat would stay open for the later arrivals (the last plane from Phoenix typically arrives around 2:30 am)."
7th March 2005,n/a,"""terminal is laid out well""",I'm pretty satisfied with the ABQ airport. I personally am not a fan of the Southwestern theme but I suppose it gives the airport character and fits in with the Albuquerque atmosphere. The terminal is laid out well and there's plenty of signage. Restaurant on the second floor is tasty. The best part of this airport is the FREE wireless internet! If only all airports could offer free wireless.
21st November 2004,n/a,"""a good airport""",This is a good airport and one of the few I know of that offer free wireless Internet access. I found that while up in the observation area. One piece of advice. it is IMPOSSIBLE to find a gas station anywhere near the car rental building--which is not onsite and only gotten to via a bus from the terminal. If returning a car make sure to fill up your tank before taking the exit for the airport. I found this out the hard way.
22nd October 2004,n/a,"""very accessible to the city""",I live in Albuquerque and it's always a relief to arrive at ABQ after a long flight. It's got to be one of the easiest airports in the world to navigate and one of the most pleasant and it's very accessible to the city. Parking is simple and the amazingly inexpensive outer lots have good reliable transportation to the terminal. Why can't all airports be this good?
18th July 2004,n/a,"""what a delight""",What a delight is the Sunport at Albuquerque! A nice smallish airport but very nicely laid out and pretty in a southwestern motif. The walk from the gate to the baggage carousel is short and pleasant due to the shops and restaurants one passes along the way.
7th March 2022,2,"""this is the worst by far when it comes to customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Airline staff, TSA, and food workers all seem miserable. No one greets, everyone seems put out by having to actually work. I’ve been to a lot of airports lately and this is the worst by far when it comes to customer service."
24th February 2022,3,"""security staff still treated us rudely""","Not Verified |  I was traveling with my mother, who is low vision and we were treated very rudely by an airport security personnel. After realizing that my mother was low vision, security staff still treated us rudely, trying to quickly usher us through their security system without much regard to her disability."
1st December 2021,10,"""personnel was friendly and very helpful""",✅ Trip Verified | Parking-each spot marked with assigned numbers. Each elevator marked. Kiosk was convenient to get tag for luggage. Personnel at the desk was very polite and helpful. We then proceeded to security and a couple of employees on the way were helpful and responsive to direct us. I wasn’t a passenger but was allowed to take my mom on wheelchair straight to the gate (my documents were checked and security point passed). Security check line was long but organized. People in wheelchairs didn’t have to be in line. Officers were focused and informed us on each step in the process. Airport building is spacious and constantly being cleaned. We noticed people cleaning bathrooms and hall handles. At the gate personnel was friendly and very helpful! Order was maintained throughout our departure. Five stars!
24th October 2021,3,"""I cannot believe the level of inefficiency""","✅ Trip Verified | The rental car system here adds 30-45 min each time you go to the airport. I cannot believe the level of inefficiency displayed in this process. What clown decided to have the rental car lot 5 miles away? I will never, and I repeat, never, come back to this airport again. And I will be telling everybody I know."
5th October 2021,2,"""customer service is horrible""",Not Verified |  The customer service reps at gates A8 and A11 were very rude at Baltimore airport. Our flight in Manchester was delayed and our flight on to Nashville was delayed. I went up to both of them to ask questions because the flight number on our boarding passes were different. I only wanted to know if the flight number had changed because the flight number on our boarding passes on the screen said already departed. Our plane from Manchester arrived after the departure time. He kept arguing saying we missed our flight. No we did not miss our flight if it was delayed. He was a very rude and hateful man whom does not need to be dealing with the public. No reason for the hatefulness and rudeness. Very bad for business. Airport is very nice and well maintained but customer service is horrible. The lady at gate A8 would not even help us at all. She said I can’t help you and don’t know what to tell you. That’s terrible customer service. I usually fly into here but more than likely will not again. Very disappointed!
7th September 2021,1,"""A bad experience and I will not be going back""",Not Verified |  Terrible airport. Made me go through TSA lines twice and charged me an extra $30 to check a bag all because they did not like the fact that I had a souvenir inside of my bag. A bad experience and I will not be going back.
29th July 2021,7,"""I am thoroughly unhappy with the service at this airport""","Not Verified |  I am thoroughly unhappy with the service at this airport. The removal of skycaps was a terrible disservice to your customers, especially those who are in need of assistance. My 93-year-old mother was brought a wheelchair to the ramp and told, ""Oh, I can't push her to baggage. Someone else will have to help you."" I had recently had a left hip surgery and had to push my mother in order to get down to the baggage area. How can an airport with this much traffic, not set up a contract to help with their customers in need of wheelchair assistance? Please consider hiring a group through a contract that can help with this service. Our senior population is neglected in so many ways and the airport should not be one of those places. I wish that you would consider addressing my concerns. Thank you."
25th July 2021,2,"""avoid this airport for future travel""","Not Verified |  Having been to many airports, I found BWI to be the worst customer friendly ever! Total chaos, and not very helpful staff (rude), when asking questions. TSA/Security were the worst, barking orders and talk to customers with total disrespect. I have never encountered such rudeness. We will surely avoid this airport for future travel."
14th April 2021,1,"""has the absolute worst TSA system""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore/Washington International Airport (Concourses D) has the absolute worst TSA system. There was not a designated Pre-TSA line and when I was asked to remove my shoes I told them I was Pre-TSA. The guy said ok, but a lady with a very nasty attitude told him no she needs to show her boarding pass but by this time my purse and phone with the boarding pass had already gone though the machine and they wouldn’t pass it back. Now keep in mind that I paid $85 not to remove my shoes and I wasn’t prepared so I was wearing shoes where I didn’t have on socks. But that’s not the point. The point is their system should be set up correctly for Pre-TSA customers. Then to make matters worse my purse had been pulled for extra checking and when they didn’t find me because I was being held up because of the shoes situation they made me wait while they checked others when I finally made it though the line and held me there for more than 5 minutes. Then found absolutely nothing in my purse. When he couldn’t find anything he took everything out to say that I was good. So back to my point. Baltimore/Washington International Airport (Concourses D) has the absolute worst TSA in my travels and I travel all over and a lot."
28th March 2021,3,"""Very unpleasant experience""","Not Verified |  One of the most annoying airports for two reasons. First the rudest and angriest airport workers I have ever seen. Second the rent a car experience is horrible, nothing telling you when you arrive that you need to takes shuttle bus to a special facility that is quite a distance away. Asking people working there where to go is not pleasant. Took a while to find one to tell me. Very unpleasant experience."
16th February 2021,3,"""the people with the nastiest attitudes work here""",Not Verified |  Is there a standard issue bad attitude that comes with the TSA and ticket agents? It seems as though the people with the nastiest attitudes work here. Its annoying and unnecessary.
20th December 2020,1,"""by far the worst TSA I have experienced""","Not Verified |  I have traveled all over the world. This is by far the worst TSA I have experienced. It takes them forever even in TSA prechecked. You have to throw away hair products under 5 ounces. They don't even go by their own guidelines. Good luck if you have to fly, through this airport."
12th November 2019,1,"""Worst rental car bus service""","Not Verified |  Worst rental car bus service. I am stopping all my company business travel through BWI. Busses do not come often enough for the traffic. Could not fit in two busses, then when I did they were packed in like sardines. Took a long time to get to rental car lot. On return missed my flight to do this. "
23rd October 2019,1,"""30-minute wait for a rental car shuttle""","Not Verified | Wow, not a real airport. A 30-minute wait for a rental car shuttle. The obviously crowded bus as people have been gathering for so long like most airports nowadays. ""Who cares, use a different airport if you don't like it""."
23rd September 2019,5,"""TSA employees are the nastiest""",✅ Trip Verified |  I have been flying often for over 30 years mostly work related. I have utilized more than 55 airports in 10 countries both before and after 9/11. I have always loved BWI because it is very convenient for me. The TSA employees are by far the nastiest to traveling public than the security staff at any other airport. I truly believe the TSA staff at BWI actually hate the traveling public for making them work. Most obviously the way African American TSA employees interact with Non-Hispanic white travelers. This racist treatment toward Non-Hispanic whites extends beyond the TSA employees but most BWI employees down to and including the BWI parking shuttle bus drivers seem to have this hatred of people of light skin. I have not noticed the Airline direct employees acting in this manor what so ever.
10th June 2019,1,"""awful, awful place""","Baltimore is a beautiful, modern airport but is poorly designed, like a maze, and passenger/user unfriendly in the extreme. Sadly, the airport employees/TSA are shockingly rude and even hostile to varying degrees. This, I find is a mirror-reflection of the Baltimore area in general. Never have I encountered such rude, arrogant, unpleasant people in my life. What is it about Baltimore that just can't help but bring out the worst in people? As I said, the place is as confusing as a maze, so be prepared to spend an hour looking for your car, as the A,B,C,D,E,F,G, etc. parking lot designations don't follow any logical sequence and abruptly end and confuse the heck out of people! I spent almost an hour trying to find my car! When I asked a passing TSA employee for directions, I was given the rudest ""I have no idea""! rebuff I have ever experienced at any airport! To add insult to injury, I became so agitated that I started to experience rising blood pressure and dangerous light-headedness/angina. In all the unpleasantness of this BWI place, I inadvertently dropped my ticket somewhere searching in vain for my car. I then spent another 30 minutes looking for my parking ticket, in vain as well. I only found my car by pure luck, even though I had written down its precise location in the parking lot. It cost me $22 to get out of that BWI hellhole. (I am thinking of another word, not appropriate to use). I got the feeling that if, I had in fact, suddenly collapsed from a heart attack, absolutely no one working there would have done a thing! I am really disgusted by that place! If I could give ZERO stars to BWI airport I would. Sadly, the airport management couldn't care less and the (government) employees are absolutely unaccountable to the public. Awful, awful, awful place! Try to avoid it if you can."
19th May 2019,3,"""Not TSA’s finest moment""
","Not Verified |  I arrived at the airport at 5:00am for a 6:20am flight. TSA only had checkpoint B open and A and C was closed for general boarding. There was an 45 min plus wait to get through. Oddly enough, checkpoints A and C were open for Clear customers. I missed my flight. So, if you pay extra for Clear, you get next level service even though I am already paying for TSA via taxes and fees. Not TSA’s finest moment. To be fair, I fly 4-7 times a month and this is the first time I have encountered today’s fiasco."
17th April 2019,1,"""Worst luggage service""",Not Verified | Worst luggage service from plane to terminal that I have ever encountered! It should not take 45 minutes for luggage to come off the plane into the airport! Our flight straight up disappeared off the carousel board and then another plane got their luggage before us. Not good service.
25th November 2018,3,"""one of the worst""","✅ Trip Verified |  It’s amazing how the airport authority has taken one of the best business airports in the country to one of the worst. Rental cars are insane distance away. Then the walk to the rental car pick up shuttle is just as bad. TSA is slow and the agents care more about who did what last night than moving things along quickly. They are among the most unfriendly in the country. I always fly Southwest out of BWI. Either to there or changing planes. They also have the distinction of having the most unfriendly southwest agents working the gates. Attitude and could care less about customer service. If this hub changed I, as well as a great number of road warriors would welcome the change. I use other airlines as much as possibly now to avoid this airport. And you want attitude or poor customer service. Get a cab at the airport to one of the hotels in the hotel zone. Yeah, maybe i don’t want to wait in the weather for a shuttle bus. God Forbid. The cab drives are rude and will have meltdowns when you tell them where you are going. I tip hefty and would have done more for them than most...but not when they cop an attitude. Again, one of the least pleasant airports to fly into. Make it even better, utilize the end of Concourse C and no moving sidewalks. "
16th November 2018,3,"""Disgusting bathrooms""",Not Verified | Disgusting bathrooms and worst TSA I've ever seen. The TSA agents were completely unorginized and seemed far more worried about chatting and laughing with each other than screening passengers. I know bathrooms can get dirty quickly but with how disgusting the bathroom was I can't imagine it had been cleaned in days. One factor keeping me from relocating to or even wanting to travel to Baltimore is BWI.
11th October 2018,4,"""the worst when getting baggage""",Not Verified | This is absolutely the worst airport when getting baggage after a flight. It takes at least half an hour every time we arrive except when on an extremely small airplane. We pay airport fees don't we? This has been the case every time we fly into the airport. We have priority baggage but it's disgusting because it never gets out earlier. Would it help to write our representatives in the US Congress or in Md? I am so disgusted with the lack of service at BWI. The airport is close by and it's not worth making the trek to Regan or Dulles. What can we do as passengers to improve this unacceptable situation?
17th July 2018,6,"""arriving is the worst""","✅ Trip Verified | Of the three airports in the Washington/Baltimore region the one I dread arriving at is BWI. Now yes the A and B concourses for Southwest are very nice as is the rest of the airport, but arriving is the worst! It takes so long for luggage to arrive at the carousel that I receive my luggage quicker at Dulles arriving on an international flight with two or three times as many passengers!"
10th July 2018,2,"""awful TSA security""","Not Verified | Just had an awful TSA security experience. Very long initial line moving very slowly, even though airport in general apparently not too busy. But then we were diverted to a different line that moved even more slowly while we watched many others who had been far behind us pass right on thru the other lines. TSA employees seemed totally indifferent and not interested in trying to improve the situation. Even our 10-year old son said, ""that was by far the worst airport security we've ever had."" What's going on BWI? Other airports seem to be doing much better."
20th May 2018,1,"""Can't we do any better?""
","❌ Not Verified |  I travel through this airport often, so I know from experience that the TSA, baggage handlers and other airport employees at Baltimore Washington International Airport are the rudest and most arrogant group that I have interacted with in this country and Europe. The worst part is that I come from this area and I am embarrassed by the terrible first impression that these people make on the millions of visitors that have had the misfortune to pass through this airport. Can't we do any better? How about a class on common courtesy?"
14th May 2018,7,"""work on their arrival process""","✅ Trip Verified |  Baltimore Washington is my home airport and generally I have no issues with it. That was my experience for the departure. Check in was a breeze. Actually, since Southwest accounts for 70% of the flights at BWI, if you are on another airline it is usually easy. We were flying British Airways. After check in we had a nice meal at Passports Bar and Grill which was right next to our gate. Finished our meal, got on the plane and flew! Easy! Then there was the return. Not as good. First, we stood in line to check in at the kiosks. Then we stood in line to go through customs. The flight had 200+ people on board and there were two agents to process us. It seemed like a long time. Then finally when we got our bags there was yet a third line to get outside. I honestly have no idea what that last line was for. I thought they were going to check our bags and bag receipts to make sure we had the right luggage, but when we finally got to the front of the line we were just waived through. BWI is expanding their international section with the plan to attract more international flights. If they do, they definitely have to work on their arrival process."
23rd February 2018,1,"""the worst airport I’ve ever been to""","❎ Not Verified |  This was painfully the worst airport I’ve ever been to. First of all navigating through is all backwards. The staff are extremely rude. I went through TSA checkpoint and the guy working “forgot” he let me though when there was no one behind me and made me go through again. The bartender at the green turtle was hands downs the rudest bartender I’ve ever delt with. I then tried to just get fries from McDonalds and the woman taking my order didn’t smile, didn’t ask what she could get for me, just stared at me hanging / slouching over her computer. Lastly my flights were delayed three times. To get home I had to book a flight through another airline and I had 30 mins to walk out of the concourse and go back through security. When I got back in line was being yelled and had very inappropriate comments from the staff to me and felt extremely uncomfortable. I’ve flown through BWI countless times and this will be the absolute last!"
7th January 2018,3,"""It has never improved""","✅ Trip Verified | I live in Baltimore. I fly in/out of BWI extensively for the last 12 years. While the airport overall is about comparable to many of the others I frequent, the baggage service is among the slowest in any airport I fly through. It has never improved and I see many reviews complaining about this same fact. Why doesn’t BWI management care enough to correct this issue. They clearly don’t care!"
13th December 2017,3,"""I am disappointed with this"" ",❎ Not Verified |  The wait time for the security check today was atrocious. There was at most 50 people in the line and it took over 30 minutes to get through the check with only one lane open. Furthermore the TSA officers were not helping the line to move quickly. I am disappointed with this as I travel frequently and can get thru LAX in a faster time with 4 times as many people.
12th September 2017,5,"""Not designed well for changing planes""",❎ Unverified |  Not designed well for changing planes. No transportation between the terminals which makes it hard for older people or for those who have health issues. You can get places but you may be late and exhausted or both. I would book a fight not to change here. The powering stations for your electronics are cute but poorly designed to handle a lot of people. You get one if you are lucky. Free WiFi but you will probably have to ask someone how to get on. Some Gate wings have good restaurants with TV options but others do not. Put your Fitbit on walk and you can find lots of things and make your 10000 steps. Designed for the young and healthy.
30th August 2017,7,"""fairly painless to navigate""",❎ Unverified | Transited through Baltimore Washington twice with short layovers. A and B concourses are fairly painless to navigate. There were a decent number of places to eat and the rest rooms were clean. Not much else to say because there is a lot of this airport that I just didn't have the time or the need to use.
13th July 2017,6,"""longest of any airport that I visit""","✅ Verified Review |  I live in the BWI area and have had many experiences similar to my July 12, 2017 flight from LAS-BWI. The time to retrieve your luggage is consistently the longest of any airport that I visit which is over 50 different airports. The airport itself gets a good rating except in the baggage handling area. The low rating for airport staff is specifically for the baggage handling department."
23rd May 2017,1,"""non-customer service attitudes""","Upon arrival at Baltimore Washington - baggage claim took nearly an hour and they switched carousels 4 times, then it took forever for bags to come out on the belt. Departure - my young daughter had 1/4 cup of water in her canteen she forgot about. Rather than having her drink it or pour out - they made us choose to toss a $20 canteen or go all the way back through security - another 30 minutes. Employees from TSA to clerks at restaurants had lazy and non-customer service attitudes. I plan to avoid this airport for future trips to D.C."
15th May 2017,5,"""a long time to wait""",Our flight arrived 15 minutes early at 9.45 am. We taxied to the gate but had to wait 10 minutes for someone to drive the walkway to the door of the plane. Then we spent 30 minutes at the luggage carousel. I finally got my luggage at 10.36. Seems like a long time to wait.
26th April 2017,2,"""baggage claim was horrible""","Baggage claim was horrible, it took longer to get my bags than to fly from Altanta! The passengers were all upset that they changed carousels twice and had to wait 45 minutes for the luggage. This happens every time we fly here. Something must be done or we will stop flying into Baltimore."
28th February 2017,10,"""a fantastic airport""","✅ Verified Review |    This is a fantastic airport. They have a great children's area, local pricing, plenty of charging stations, good eats, and it's clean. I can't vouch for security though because this was a connection for us. I didn't use the wifi either so I'm not sure how good that was."
28th November 2016,8,"""never had a bad experience""","✅ Verified Review |  BWI is my ""home"" airport. I could also use DCA, but I prefer Baltimore. I have read some unfavorable reviews of this airport, but sometimes think that they must be talking about a different airport. I will say that this is a medium sized airport, so it will not have many of the same choices as the large airports. But I have used this airport for over 30 years and never had a bad experience. I have never experienced long delays at security. Usually five to ten minutes and you're through. One thing has recently changed that is a big improvement is the ability to move from one concourse to another post security. This was an issue in the past because Southwest handles about 70% of the flights to and from BWI, so the best food choices were in their areas. Now there are more choices no matter which concourse your airline is leaving from."
14th November 2016,1,"""no better, only worse""","This is the third time I have flown into Baltimore in 60 days. What is wrong with the baggage delivery? I have waited no less than 30 mins for my bags each time. This flight came in early, we were excited but it quickly fades when you have to deal with the incompetence of whoever does the simple job of taking bags off the plane and riding them to baggage claim with their carts. Why on earth does it take so long to load and unload bags? I will say again 30 minutes at least each time in 60 days. In Houston, stopped at restroom, got to bag claim and bags were there. Same for MCO. What is wrong with the much smaller airport at BWI? In 30 years of flying it is no better, only worse."
27th May 2016,2,"""not for those who travel frequently""","This airport is not for those who travel frequently. They do not have enough restaurants and bars and the ones they have only seat a few people. The airport staff and the restaurant staff are incredibly rude as they don't know how to handle a lot of people. I have decided to only fly into and out of Washington because of these issues. For those who haven't seen top notch airports, the lack of quality may not be noticed."
20th April 2016,8,"""a good option to fly to/from""","Baltimore Washington is a nice airport that looks like it had been renovated recently since the last time I had used this airport a few years ago. I do like this airport because it is clean. When I was parking I had a little bit of trouble finding the long term parking because there is not a lot of signage for the long term parking. The buses to the main terminal are frequent and convenient. When I got to the main terminal I checked in quickly and then got to go through the nightmare that was security. I spent one hour in the security line because there was only one security agent working in the entire security line. The line was not that long, but it moved so slowly. For a Friday afternoon, I was surprised that they did not have more people working security. I almost missed my flight due to the security line. Coming back to Baltimore on Sunday night was longer than I thought. When we landed in Baltimore there were delays at the gate so we waited on the plane about a half hour longer than we had to. When I got to baggage claim, there were a few flights there at the same time, so everyone had to share the same carousel. They quickly realized how crowded it was and then moved some flights to another baggage claim belt, which was nice. There was a little bit of trouble at the credit card kiosk at the long term parking, which was a little frustrating, but long term parking was cheap so I can't complain. Overall, besides security, BWI is a good option to fly to/from."
14th April 2016,7,"""virtually no queues""","It's been a while since I've used BWI, but I'd say they've done a nice job renovating it. There were virtually no queues as my flight departed at 6 am and returned around midnight. Some of the signs were not placed well, like the ones directing you to security and the parking lot bus waiting area. Overall, a nice, efficient airport that I wish was closer to where I live."
12th March 2016,7,"""arrive early""",Baltimore Washington is a fine airport. It is by no means the best airport I have seen but I have also seen far worse. The food offerings are nice for tourists to try local Maryland fare and try the crab cakes. I have flown into and out of BWI an uncountable number of times and the only major problem I have ever had was lines at security. They can stretch on for quite sometime so arrive early.
9th November 2015,2,"""the services are awful""",Lots of money spent on this airport but the services are awful / not working. No power at the workstations. Internet has security issues beyond any seen at many other airports.
22nd April 2015,3,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,I fly out of BWI Southwest Airlines once a month to Tampa. It never fails when I return to BWI I have to wait 30 mins to an hour for my bags and it always starts like this. Your bags from Tampa will be on belt #1 and about 10 mins later they announce your bags from Tampa are now on belt #5. If you get lucky you might not get another belt change and in 20 min or so you bags will come out. If you have oversize bags such as golf clubs you can add another 10 min. The young workers in the oversize baggage area just sit on chairs and play with their cell phones never greet you or even recognize that you are there. The bottom line is that that baggage department at BWI is the worst in the country by far.
8th October 2014,1,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,Are they serious about the rental car situation? This has to be the worse setup in the US. To get from the terminal to the car rental facility the bus takes 4 left turns on busy roads. On the way back you routinely get stuck in traffic - the rental shuttle tells you to allow 2 hours on your return! All of this in a region where cabs are as non-existent - you need a rental car for any appointment outside of downtown Baltimore.
26th August 2014,8,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,Great airport fast TSA checks with friendly smiling faces lots of food options and spacious boarding areas. The Southwest staff were friendly and professional from curbside to boarding lounge.
3rd March 2014,n/a,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,Extremely long wait for baggage is unacceptable. This has been an issue for at least 5 years and BWI has done nothing to remedy this.
2nd June 2013,2,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,"Possibly the worst airport I've flown into. Flying in I already had a car reserved but it took over an hour to get into a car and out of the airport. First you go to the car rental counter in the terminal and wait to get the contract set up. The car rentals are managed from a different building and it took 20 minutes for a bus to show up to take us from the terminal to the rental facility. When the bus arrived it was standing room only. On arrival at the car rental facility it's a fairly long walk from there to the individual pick up locations though the parking garage. No walkways just stripes to walk between. Then you wait again for a rental attendant to look over your contract and point you in the direction of the type of car you've reserved. After that debacle I determined to allow myself an extra hour to return the car and be on time for my flight. Return was somewhat better although the stop designated for my airline turned out to be incorrect because of construction. Returning the car only took half an hour from driving into the garage to arriving at the terminal. That meant I had plenty of time to make my flight so I set up my computer for the ""free"" WiFi. For free you're required to sign in again every 15 minutes. You can upgrade your service for $5 for an hour or $8 for the day. But you probably won't need more than an hour because you won't have found a place to plug in your computer or other rechargeable internet ready device. I ended up sitting on the floor next to the luggage carts because there was an outlet there. There was one other outlet I saw on the concourse but two people were already plugged in there and that was the limit. Before 9/11 tightened security and the major computer age I used to fly in and out of BWI fairly often. It was an attractive airport and close to home. Since then I've mostly used one of the two DC airports but I got a really great deal on a flight to BWI. I don't know whether in the future I'll consider any deal good enough to get me back into this airport."
15th January 2013,9,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,We flew from BWI to JFK. Check in went smoothly and quickly. The security line was long but moved quickly. The airport is clean and bright (especially when compared to JFK) and had decent food choices. The restrooms were clean for public facilities at an airport. Luggage pickup was pretty fast on our return. BWI is my choice of airports when flying into the DC/Baltimore area.
2nd January 2013,1,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,The time to get bags at BWI is unacceptable. Usually the slowest of all airports I use. It took an hour to get bags from a flight recently.
27th October 2012,4,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,"As one of Southwest's major connection hubs I cannot believe BWI would shut down one of their runways ""under construction?"" and due to their ATC trying ineptly to direct air traffic caused thousands of people to miss connections! I lost a vacation day parking fees and a day and night with my 4 grandchildren in St. Louis today 10/25! What a mess and intentional? Why they couldn't schedule construction from 11pm to 6am and avoid the major air traffic I cannot imagine. I am now re-booked through Midway! Such a shame because I usually try to schedule through this airport."
12th August 2012,4,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,August 8th arrival and August 10th departure both with SWA. Like your previous commentator the BWI experience is awful and it makes no difference if its arrivals or departures bags take for ever to appear when arriving and then the little matter of the so called 8 minute ride to the rental car terminal. It is a shame because airside the terminal is one of the better USA airports in terms of facilities available but then again some of the employees no most of them are clearly not a very happy contented bunch so beware and don't ask them for anything. Overall this is not a traveller customer friendly airport.
28th June 2012,2,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,I travel weekly for work. BWI is in my opinion one of the worst airports in the country. I try to always avoid but many times the fares are just right compared to other DC area airports. Car rental buses are few and far between then you have a not so quick journey out to the rental car facility. Returning is even worse - why could they have not put a train system or built a road where the shuttles could easily go between the rental car facility and the terminal - just bad design. Then security at least at Concourse D is always packed and slow - they don't appear to know how to handle crowds. Again just my opinion - keep in mind that I do like the Atlanta airport.
18th November 2010,4,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,On this trip we only arrived at the airport. Getting to baggage claim claiming our bags and getting a shuttle bus to the rather distant consolidated rental car facility was quick and easy. It's nice to have all rental car companies together so one can easily compared availability and prices though on the particular night we were there selection was very very limited.
19th March 2010,3,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,Very variable experience depending on airline and time. Long lines at Southwest early but clears quickly as they are well organized. Horrible long lines at D security mid-morning. Delta check-in hopeless. Very limited food options landside but more choice airside. Excellent short-term parking situation though expensive. Beautiful International terminal with virtually no flights.
5th November 2009,3,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,"BWI has been updated/refurbished but it seems to have suffered a decline in passenger traffic as have other airports. The one decent restaurant outside security that I remember is being made into a Subway sandwich restaurant. The two gift shops I found (Hudson News) were small and curiously did not sell TSA luggage locks (I seem to recall seeing these locks over at one of the area's other airports Washington National). Also did not sell luggage (the only place I found that sold luggage was the American Airlines counter to which I was directed by Delta Airlines; they sold only large bags none suitable for carry-on). Security line was not long and moved quickly. In Concourse C the choice for dining included an overcrowded ""pub"" a somewhat pricey small restaurant towards the entrance and something fas food-related."
30th August 2009,2,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,I frequently fly through BWI (every other week or so) because unfortunately this is the closest and cheapest aiport from where I live. Although departing from BWI is always a piece of cake and it really is a very nice aiport arriving here is another story. After several long waits in the baggage claim I began keeping track of the time and found that the BWI airport was adding on average 34 minutes to my trip. That's 34 minutes of just waiting in the baggage claim area. The longest wait I experienced was over an hour and that was not just for my bag but the entire flight! I'm not sure if this is simply mismanagement or if there is something else going on but after this last trip (50 min wait in baggage claim) I will avoiding flying through BWI whenever possible. I recommend the same to anyone else.
14th July 2009,5,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,Flew in on Southwest and out on AirTran. Despite the size of the airport you are at your gate within 5 minutes of landing. The Southwest terminal is very easy to get out of. Light rail is a great way to get into Baltimore City just be prepared to walk about 10 minutes if arriving on Southwest. On departure there was a short line that moved quickly with upbeat and friendly TSA officers. AirTran's terminal is basic but has everything one needs. BWI is a very nice airport
4th September 2008,2,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,The airport is nice and modern and convenient to the metro Baltimore/Washington area. There is a nice observation area in the center of the terminal prior to airside which is a good place to watch planes and/or relax prior to your flight. Unfortunately if renting a car here this is the worst airport I've ever used. The consolidated car rental facility itself is very nice and spacious however the common rental car shuttle you must take from the airport is absolutely pathetic. I've used this on multiple trips over the last several years and it's been horrible every single time. The whole idea of using a common shuttle should speed things up getting to the rental facility however there are simply not enough shuttles running. Today at 2:45pm I waited at the USAIR baggage claim along with approximately 30 other people for several minutes for the bus to come. I was standing at what I thought was the end of the line and it turned out to be where the bus stopped. I felt guilty walking on the bus in front of all the people who had been waiting however I wouldn't have gotten on the already crowded bus otherwise and furthermore there was no organized line anyway. I was the first passenger on the bus and it was already standing room only! There was absolutely no where to put the luggage and it was cramped beyond belief. This is absolutely unacceptable and this wasn't an isolated incident. I can't imagine how a handicapped person elderly person or anyone with multiple bags could manage this fiasco. There should be several other busses in line waiting at the busy baggage claim area and when one is full (meaning everyone gets a seat and has room for their luggage) the one behind it then loads passengers. Considering this services ALL rental car agencies and there aren't other busses to get there this is pathetic customer service. If you are renting a car I would not recommend using this airport especially if I you have any large luggage (try DCA or IAD). If not renting a car then the airport is great and convenient however I give this airport a poor rating due to the absymal car rental shuttle service. A business traveler needs quick and efficient service and this airport does not provide it to rental car customers. (It formerly had the rental cars on property but moved them years ago to install higer-revenue parking garages).
21st May 2008,4,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,Flew into BWI recently on Southwest. Airport is easily accessible from Baltimore city (20 min by car 30-40 min by light rail). Southwest has consolidated its two concourses with a centralized check-in desks and security lanes. Airport has been recently renovated so facilities tend to be bright and spacious. Security lanes were well-staffed and efficient. Usual mix of shops and restaurants airside. Only drawback is that there can be long walks between the gates at the end of concourses and check-in desks and/or baggage claim.
12th February 2008,3,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,I flew to BWI from LHR to take the train to Washington DC being fed up with the long immigration lines at Dulles. BWI is a modern airport which benefits from not being a main international point of entry. I was outside waiting for the shuttle to the train station about 35 minutes after getting off the plane - unheard of at IAD. But that's where the good news stops... too long to wait for the shuttle bus and the airport Amtrak station is a mess - confusing not good information and a slow slow elevator to get over to the southbound track. But DC's Union Station is a great place to arrive!
22nd October 2007,5,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,Great airport with easy access to Baltimore. Interstate 195 spurs off I-95 and takes you straight to the terminal. Everything here is bright modern and flashy looking including the parking garages which are linked to the main terminal with shuttle buses that come very regularly. I flew Southwest out of BWI twice and its been great experiences a lot less crowded than other airports I've been in. There's a small aviation museum in the terminal and also an observation deck near the control tower which is good for waiting for flights. The food selection is very good and I would definitely recommend Philip's Seafood which has a location near the Southwest gates this serves authentic Baltimore crabcakes/seafood. My only real complaint about this airport is that it's actually too modern and flashy giving people false impressions of the area. Once they pass through the airport and drive into Baltimore there's in for a pretty unpleasant surprise. Besides the Aquarium no architecture in Baltimore can compare with BWI. I won't even get into why the Dominos sugar sign set on top of an abandoned factory could be considered a major landmark.
30th July 2007,4,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,We flew in and out of BWI this summer using the international terminal - how easy and quick. Very nice facility. Even we travelled with kids - checking in and the wait untill the flight was no problem. People were very friendly and helpful. BWI is a true alternative to IAD.
10th December 2006,n/a,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,I really like this airport. It is a good size and things move quickly. My experience of the staff tat BWI is that they have always been friendly and helpful. It feels manageable.
9th November 2006,n/a,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,I flew out of BWI recently to go to ORD. I like BWI because it is a managable airport. The new Southwest terminal is great. This time I flew on AA to ORD. The airport is undergoing a major refurbishment and so there are not many options when it comes to food at the moment but new restaurants should open soon. BWI is one of the most modern convenient airports in the US. It does not look tired and dated like most airports I have visited. I would recommend this airport is you live in the DC/Baltimore area.
17th May 2006,n/a,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,BWI and Dulles are roughly equal in the number of passengers served they differ by under 2% and I am not sure which is busier. BWI is great to fly out of. Traffic in the BAlt/Wash area is pretty bad in general so it can be a chore getting to it from NoVa. However from my place in Baltimore I can get to Philly faster than I can get to Dulles in even moderate traffic - but I am 10 minutes from BWI so that pretty much sums up my airport choice! Easy departures is BWI's strong point. The terminal is pretty well laid out and very accesible Light Rail and train to Baltimore train to Washington. Baggage claim at BWI is a nightmare - perhaps the slowest in the US. However Dulles has those crappy trams between terminals this alone makes BWI superior - even if it takes you 30 minutes extra to get to BWI v Dulles you can make up the time right there. Of the three airports it is hard to say which is best as I said before traffic can be horrendous skewing the equation. One thing is for sure if Baltimore is your destination Dulles is out.
17th May 2006,n/a,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,I find BWI to be a great alternative to IAD. I've flown in here internationally a number of times and consider it the best starting point for US travels. The airport has gone through a number of renovations and there was still construction going on near the International terminal last time I was there in Jan 06. The airport is very well-kept and the bathrooms are immaculate. One thing that could be improved at BWI would be to extend the hours of some of the kiosks past security. I had a late night flight to Germany and nothing was open - it made for a very long night doing nothing.
12th March 2022,1,"""People were the rudest I’ve ever experienced""","✅ Trip Verified | I have travelled all over the world through many different airports, heck I even live in NYC where people are supposed to be the worst. I was connecting through Boston because I left from Paris to then final destination NY. I had a two hour layover which I figured would be plenty of time — I got out and had to take the bus to the next terminal which itself was very time consuming after having to do all the international security border checks, then when I went to Terminal A to go back in, the treatment was horrendous. People were the rudest I’ve ever experienced in an airport in my life. There weren’t many people but the lines were so disorganized and the staff were yelling just for the sake of being demeaning. The security guy looked at me and barked at me because I moved something within the bin and he yells “are you listening to me”. I almost missed my flight, and keep in mind I was traveling business class. The treatment within the check-in and airport was so bad that I’m actually laughing in disbelief because it felt actually comical. Like is this a movie? Why do I feel like I was just a prisoner being yelled at in a prison yard? Needless to say, will make it a point to never fly through Boston again, no matter what cost."
4th February 2022,9,"""No complaints about security or immigration""","Not Verified | We checked in at the American Airlines counter and greatly appreciated the fact that their employees were =bilingual, fluent in English and Spanish. This was important because my girlfriend was flying to Chile and she doesn't know a lot of English. Everyone was very kind and courteous at the ticket check in. No complaints about security or immigration, fast and efficient. Admittedly there were not a lot of people in the airport because of the upcoming storm and Covid but we have flown to and from Columbia in December 2021 and I have nothing but good things to say about Login Airport. Wait, just one, due to Covid, no restaurants just Starbucks and a convenience store open. Pack your own lunch!"
29th January 2022,1,"""the most awful experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve travelled all over the world and have departed from Logan dozens of times but this last experience was the most awful experience I’ve ever encountered by the airport staff. One of the delta checkin ladies in terminal A was next level rude as she yelled at passengers waiting in line, even refusing to check me in even though I was next because she didn’t, “didn’t want to deal with me” , so she accepted the man standing behind me instead. Luckily the lady I did end up with was very kind. The security staff was also incredibly rude and hostile with the way they yelled at people to line up. There was an open slot at the security counter so I went to take the spot when it was my turn and I got yelled at for not waiting until they told me it was OK to take the spot. I’ve flown all over the world and I’ve never gotten yelled at for taking an empty spot at a security counter. The hostility and tone of voice of the staff was really alarming. What is going on in Boston??"
27th October 2021,5,"""Not very nice to deal with. Do better Logan""",✅ Trip Verified | After having our flight home to Hawaii delayed by 10.5 hours we hung out at Terminal E which was quite empty because of limited international travel. The terminal appeared clean but after sitting for a short time we started seeing numerous mice scurrying all over the area near gates E7 to 4. We proceeded to tell at least 4 airport employees but in our entire day here saw absolutely nothing being done about the situation. Not very nice to deal with. Do better Logan.
17th October 2021,1,"""worst experience at an airport""","Not Verified |  Worst airport experience of my life. The security line wrapped around the baggage check location. There were no directions given, so many stood in the wrong line for over 45 minutes and had to start over. Passengers were skipping lines, jumping over barricades, and the employees said nothing. We finally get to the actual security step to place our belongings in the bins, and our stuff was skipped over and over again as new passengers placed their items in front of ours. We had to ask an employee to please place our stuff where it should be in the first place. He acted indifferent, as they all did all morning, and seemed irritated we were even speaking to him. We have traveled all over the world, and this was definitely the worst experience at an airport."
26th July 2021,4,"""Horrific experience - especially in Security""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrific experience - especially in Security. They treat everyone like a terrorist/criminal. Shout orders, yell at passengers. One older lady was yelled at to take her shoes off against policy. They did a pat down on me - I’ve had them before- but this lady was rude, pushy and took forever. Yelled instructions at me and insisted on repeating them when I told her to just go ahead. Then someone else pulled out a small cold pak in a ziplock out of my carry-on that is needed to keep my $800 medication cold. She threw it out (even though I traveled to Boston with it), insisted it wasn't cold anyway. When I asked to check, was yelled at for holding my hand out towards her. Another customer was trying to file a complaint for bad treatment and was told he had to back off and calm down and was rushed by security. I will make every effort to never fly out of this airport again."
2nd June 2021,2,"""arguably the worst-staffed airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  Boston Logan was arguably the worst-staffed airport that I have ever had the displeasure of traveling through, and I have been travelling domestically and internationally for over 40 years. I am disabled and upon arrival at Terminal E I found no wheelchair staff (the BA agent had to call for one after I had been standing for nearly 10 minutes, which is physically difficult for me) and no skycap to handle my family's nine pieces of luggage. The driver who had brought us to the airport had to risk getting a ticket or getting towed to help my son get the luggage inside and then my son had to place the luggage on the scale with no assistance. After we went through security, we were taken to the gate to wait (even though we were Business Class passengers) because the lounges were not open. We also were unable to find food to eat or coffee because all of the shops were still closed, even though many restrictions in Boston have been lifted with regards to the pandemic. The only other time that I have experienced such a lack of service was in Seattle, which has a much smaller airport. Seriously people, if you can't provide a wheelchair or a skycap for a disabled person, why are you even open? The only plus in this entire experience was the gentleman who finally showed up to take me through the terminal in a wheelchair (after they called him). He was great and came back on time to help me board my flight. At least someone there understands customer service."
1st June 2021,2,"""Completely unprofessional staff""",✅ Trip Verified | Truly the rudest TSS staff. Rude tone. Clearly don’t want to be there. Feel they have power over travelers and can bark orders. Clearly just a job and have no customer service training or desire. Shared feedback with manager and she just blew me off. Completely unprofessional staff. A please and thank you would go a long way. This Incident occurred at the Alaska gate.
15th May 2021,1,"""horrendous customer service""","Not Verified |  Unacceptable delays and horrendous customer service. Ridiculous they dare complain about pandemic hitting travel industry, but can't be bothered to be polite or efficient when going thru security, waited 40 mins for someone to check my bag while they just stood around wasting our time. Must be Orientation Day!"
20th January 2021,9,"""The employees are the biggest asset to this airport""","Not Verified |  This airport is honestly way better than everyone says it is. First of all, I used mass transit, which connects to the airport real well, and I can’t say anything negative about getting to and from the airport. I also flew AA, so I can’t say anything about terminals A,C, or E, or the ease of inter terminal movement. Also, no, I do not know why there is no terminal D. As for land side B, it is a little cramped, but overall nice. Airside, however, is extremely open, airy, clean, and generally pleasant! The food options are pretty run of the mill, which was good as I showed up 2 hours before my departure to eat. Also, get a load of this, I was through standard security in 7 minutes, in New England’s busiest airport! The employees are the biggest asset to this airport as just like about every single person I met between Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, are extremely nice!"
26th November 2020,4,"""facilities seemed nice enough and personnel were friendly""","Not Verified |  Departed from C terminal to Dublin. Most businesses and lounges were closed due to the low traffic in the airport, but otherwise facilities seemed nice enough and personnel were friendly. But they were blasting CNN at the gate and you couldn't escape it. After three hours I was going crazy. I don't come to the airport to hear hours of how much the US president sucks, I just want to read or sit quietly. How this can be deemed a service to travellers is beyond me - it was torture."
2nd November 2020,9,"""I'm very impressed and hope to visit there again""","✅ Trip Verified | My friend and I traveled to Massachusetts through Logan. I want to commend the people we dealt with throughout the Delta section of the airport. Getting of the shuttle I twisted my knee quite badly. We got into the terminal and the young man at baggage check called for a wheelchair for me. The attendant at the gate made sure to contact Detroit Metro as well as our final destination of Milwaukee Mitchell. She was also able to get us a few rows up which was a gigantic help. All the people we dealt with yesterday, especially the young men that had to push me were so very respectful and helpful. I'm very impressed and hope to visit there again."
1st October 2020,2,"""Don't get stuck here!""","✅ Trip Verified | An airport I would not ever want to go through by choice. On my 1st layover I was having lunch at the burger joint and a mouse was running around ON the eatery floor by my feet. The second return layover again a rodent was running around on the carpet floor in the lounge area. Keep your bags off the floor. Employees hanging around like its a club, some sleeping in different dark corners. Bad management. Everything closed, can't even get a cup of coffee in the morning, food is also sparse. Don't get stuck here!"
4th March 2020,1,"""The attendants were beyond rude""",✅ Trip Verified | TSA check-in. The attendants were beyond rude. My husband misplaced his license and called ahead and were told to bring other forms I.D. Which he did. The attendant wouldn’t give him a chance to speak and explain - she kept saying this is no good - it’s expired! And the rest of the TSA staff were just as obnoxious barking at us while putting our belongings into the bins. It is unnecessary as the airport was very quiet. My experience has almost always been the same at Logan airport - so be prepared. Lighten up - it’s people like you giving us Bostonians a bad rap!
8th February 2020,2,"""a very unpleasant experience""","Not Verified |  Boston Logan Terminal B, the American Airlines near monopoly, is one of the noisiest terminals in the USA. Insipid music competing with blaring TV terminals and gate announcements make this a very unpleasant experience. Just throw in some annoyed American Airlines employees and you get misery. A good example of near governmental lack of intelligence and sensitivity."
28th January 2020,10,"""Airport with a heart""","✅ Trip Verified | Visiting our Grandsons Wrestling Tournaments from California. After a weekend of Proud Grandparenting of picture taking and such wonderful memories, I had taken hundreds of pictures on my iPad. Leaving Boston after a visit is always hard and we had the opportunity to have lunch a Limoncellos before leaving. Going through Security was a breeze so I went to wait for my husband to finish going through he had the leftovers from lunch so when he joined me I mistakingly put the iPad in the to-go bag. We went to sit down and wait for our flight and I couldn’t find my ipad. I remembered putting it in a case to go through Security but didn’t remember anything else. I was heartbroken. I went back to the TSA security but they didn’t have anything checked in I couldn’t believe I carelessly left it. I thanked the staff for looking so hard they went above and beyond for a Grandma who was just so upset. They told me to check back before my flight we might get lucky but I left forlorned. When I got back to the table that I had poured out my large purse belongings my husband was going through them again and then by some chance, I looked in my take out bag and there it was! While I was just getting up to go back to tell the wonderful staff I found it here they come heading around the corner to our gate to tell me to look in my take out bag. In this day and age who goes through that much trouble for one old lady. Thank you for hiring such diligent professional but caring staff. To me and my family, Bostin is the Airport with a heart that still cares about people."
22nd January 2020,3,"""do not recommend this airport for International arrivals""","✅ Trip Verified | I do not recommend this airport for International arrivals with a connecting flight because there is no internal transfer for incoming international passengers to connecting domestic flights. After immigration, customs and rechecking you baggage you will have to leave the international terminal and go to another terminal. This means you are basically out in the street and you'll have to reenter the airport. Directions to the other terminal are poor and it is a long walk. When you arrive at the other terminal you will have to go through security with all other passengers entering the terminal, which can take a long time. The whole transfer from international to domestic can take a long time and is not comfortable. The Domestic terminal does not offer a lot of choice in shops, food and beverages."
5th January 2020,2,"""the worst airport I have seen in the States""","Not Verified |  This is by far the worst airport I have seen in the States, going from one terminal to another is quite a hike (poorly marked, we could not find the shuttle bus). Something that really annoyed me was doing the security check again even when I was coming from a domestic flight, it's ridiculous going again through that check twice in the same country."
28th December 2019,2,"""the worst wait I have ever experienced """,Not Verified |  We just waited 1hr 45min for our bags. This is by far the worst wait I have ever experienced in three decades of global travel. Boston is home and this is embarrassing. Come on guys get your act together.
21st December 2019,1,"""Worst I’ve ever experienced""","Not Verified |  Appalling. Waited one hour for an arrival gate, it was clear from captains voice that he was getting exasperated. When permission to open the doors was granted we stood waiting for 15-20 mins for ground staff to wave first passengers off plane. In spite of several hundred people queuing to get through immigration only two officers were on, both looked disinterested, unfocussed and lazy. Couldn’t give a toss. One left his desk to chat with a colleague who was passing. They chatted for several minutes about family, oblivious to passengers - queues were getting longer. Now been waiting 40 mins for baggage belt to start. C400 passengers from super jumbo plus other flights on other carousels - BA and Virgin. Probably 1000 plus people waiting on adjacent baggage carousels. No staff, couldn’t care less. Trump needs to sort out this appalling culture in US public services (worst I’ve ever seen, worse than 3rd world) before he starts criticising other countries. Wake up America, the impression you give to travellers, people spending money in your country, is abysmal. Worst I’ve ever experienced and I travel all over the world. No pride, can’t be bothered. Won’t return. Ps landed almost 2 hrs ago and still awaiting luggage."
19th December 2019,2,"""Horrible location for Uber""","Not Verified |  Horrible location for Uber pick ups! They must want these guys gone! Be ready to walk, and if you are near the American gates in Term B the signs are ridiculous. It say follow signs to central parking and there are none."
11th December 2019,2,"""it makes me not want to use this airport""",✅ Trip Verified | Logan used to be the easiest airport to fly in and out of and was even a good reason to live in Boston since it was so much easier to travel from than other cities such a NYC. They have recently changed their RideShare policies and force their customers to be dropped off and picked up in a very inconvenient area that they have to walk to with all of their bags etc. simply because they are worried about the taxi revenue. Taxi’s are so scarce in Boston that there is literally no other way to travel to the airport. Do they expect me to walk several miles from my apartment? I’m very confused as to why anyone thought this was a good idea and it makes me not want to use this airport.
24th November 2019,4,"""extremely difficult and poorly marked""","Not Verified |  The new location for Ride App pickups for terminal B is absurd. After a long trip and with a pregnant wife and a baby in a stroller the 15 minute walk was extremely difficult and poorly marked, with us getting on the wrong elevators at one point."
14th November 2019,1,"""You need to walk 10 minutes""","Not Verified |  Your change to get a Lyft or Uber is unacceptable. You need to walk 10 minutes. As it is never liked flying into this airport, now you have made it worse. What your taxi revenue went down, you think that you can force us on using them so you make us walk?"
12th November 2019,1,"""Long lines and horrible airport""",Not Verified |  I’m writing this review sitting on the plane heading home from a month long tour of Europe. I had 2 duty free sealed bottles that were my only 2 things I was bringing home. I was completely following the rules and these bottles had been all the way thru customs and we were getting on our domestic flight home and the TSA make up their own rules! Long lines and horrible airport! Don’t get me started on the lack of signage for Uber and Lyft rides! I will do anything not to use this airport again!
28th September 2019,1,"""extra-long security lines""","✅ Trip Verified | We left the US through here and re-entered here with connecting flights. If you have a terminal change or an international flight you have to exit and re-enter through different security. Not only did we almost miss our first international flight due to long security lines, but coming back in, all our duty-free bags were cut open and tested. All olive oil from Spain had to be poured out or checked. On top of extra-long security lines, losing a litre of olive oil to the trash can, the agent was rude as though we should know we could not take duty-free olive oil back. We asked prior to leaving the country and was told it would be fine as long as it was in a tamper-proof duty-free bag with receipt (which it was), but that is not the case. Had this been any other port of entry with a transfer flight we would have been able to keep our duty free. Never again will we fly through Boston until they change their system."
9th August 2019,1,"""issues with gate assignments""",Not Verified |  There appears to be issues with gate assignments at this airport. My flight had to wait an hour for a gate after landing and an hour to take off when I left. Upon leaving there were also four gate changes.
31st July 2019,1,"""nightmare of an airport""",✅ Trip Verified |  Complete disorder and confusion. The staff standing by the lines gave me wrong information. Many staff standing around in groups socializing instead of helping all the people around them that were obviously confused. Everyone around me at the airport was complaining about the disorganization (it wasn’t just me). I saw many lights on signs not working and the floor and waiting area were filthy. I couldn’t wait to leave this chaotic nightmare of an airport.
15th July 2019,1,"""area is so disorganized""","Not Verified |  Arrived on the evening of June 21 and then again on July 10 for the return part of our flight. Arrived on Alaska Airlines, airport personnel were very unhelpful trying to find our way to Icelandair. Upon return on July 10 one airport person was very helpful to find the Alaska air counter We were sent to terminal C which is a horrible place to spend any time at all. There is one bathroom in the terminal it’s filthy and the area is so disorganized it’s hard to believe this is in the United States even worse in Boston."
17th June 2019,1,"""Filthiest airport I’ve ever been in""","✅ Trip Verified | Filthiest airport I’ve ever been in! One look at the floors tells all. Vinyl, broken seats smell like unwashed masses. Massive dirt balls 3-4 in circumference roll in entry doors. Never mind the dirty bathrooms. Pathetic in comparison to other busy city airports!"
9th June 2019,1,"""freezing my butt off""",✅ Trip Verified |  I am sitting in Terminal C right now freezing my butt off. It's 73 degrees outside and approximately 58 inside. Why? Do I need to remind you that its the accumulation of these types of bad decisions that will lead to the demise of our planet. Please get your act together.
16th May 2019,6,"""airport has a lot of room for improvement""",Not Verified |  This is our first time to use Boston Logan Airport. We’d been to several other airports and we feel that this airport has a lot of room for improvement. The signs are not very clear. Even the signs going to the airport are not straightforward. The $5.00 cart rental fee is too exorbitant. We simply do not a pleasant experience here and will try to avoid this path as much as possible.
21st April 2019,3,"""Chaotic""","Not Verified |  Chaotic! Very poor information boards. Announcements for adjacent gates made at the same time so nobody can hear! Ladies’ toilets by C31 a disgrace - dirty, doors broken. What an awful airport."
13th April 2019,10,"""grateful to wonderful people""","✅ Trip Verified | I returned from a long trip and went to my car at economy parking lot. After I got out of the lot, I inadvertently hit the curb right outside it and I got a flat tire. I tried to move a little bit and it was impossible beyond a few meters away. I called AAA and they told me I had to talk to Massport. Within minutes, a policeman came and he had notified Massport towing trucks. He waited with me until the truck came. I thought I had a spare tire and a jack and all, but it seems someone had stolen them from my car at some point over the past few months, and I was unaware of it. The tow truck then towed me to central parking and I waited for my AAA to show up. As I was waiting, several of Massport's tow truck people passed by me and stopped to help and to offer help. Two in particular actually went out of their way to try and get me a donut tire to use, and they tried it on but it just was too big. They waited with me and helped me out a great deal until my AAA truck came. I am very very grateful to these wonderful people."
4th April 2019,1,"""there was a bottleneck situation the other day""","✅ Trip Verified | People arriving from abroad have to go through customs procedures and security checks, which can take an hour or more at American airports at peak times. Logan Airport seems at first sight to be well organized for this - staff to direct you, electronic devices meant to speed up certain procedures, etc. However, there was a bottleneck situation the other day because 3 flights arrived at more or less the same time, and so it took all of 2 hours from the time I left the aircraft to the time I left the airport. This in and of itself is unacceptable, especially considering that it was mid afternoon and only about half of the posts were open. But even worse was the fact that many of the people in line with me were getting very nervous because they were afraid they would miss their connecting flights. However, when they asked if they could go through first, they were told it wasn't possible because everything had to be done on first come first served basis. The argument was that people who did not have connecting flights would protest and would never be served because in the meantime other flights would arrive. Not true because by the time I got through there were very few people still waiting in line. I for one would gladly let someone who is in a rush for a good reason go before me and I'm certain any sensible person would do the same. Other airports have staff available for the very purpose of directing people who have little time to catch their connecting flights. Why not Logan? It's a question of courtesy and common sense. And it's especially important here because for many foreigners this is their first experience on American soil! A fine welcome!!"
24th January 2019,3,"""very inefficient""","✅ Trip Verified | UBER and Lyft driver’s doing “pick-up” jobs at the airport cause signifant traffic delays, especially at Terminals B and C. There is only one way, in and out of Terminal B and C, so drivers (and passengers) need to be considerate of others to keep traffic moving. Taxi driver drive with the flow of traffic. UBER and Lyft drivers cause the traffic because they do not follow any rules and block traffic. I fly into Logan weekly and tonight is a perfect example of UBER drivers blocking the road so no one could drive out of the terminal. (200 were waiting to leave Logan and it was not a busy night at Logan. Thursday evenings are worse). It’s chaos, insane and very inefficient. For people arriving into Boston, it is a terrible first impression of the city. As a solution, restict UBER and Lyft drivers from Terminal B and C. Only allow pickups at Terminal A, Terminal E or Central Parking (like the old days with Black Cars and limo’s)"
20th January 2019,5,"""terminals are huge but empty""",✅ Trip Verified | Such a big airport with huge terminals but there is almost nothing to do there. I have been to different terminals there (flying quite a lot to Boston due to my work) but all of the terminals are huge but empty.
1st January 2019,2,"""extremely slow with loading the luggage""",✅ Trip Verified | I’ve had numerous experiences of arriving at Boston Logan. 80% of them bad. They are extremely slow with loading the luggage onto the belts. Today they made us sit on the runway for 45 min after flight arrival because the gate was occupied. This has happened several times before. I don’t usually write reviews but this airport is really awful.
15th December 2018,3,"""a ton of airport staff sitting""
","Not Verified |  TSA guy was nice, no waiting. I got to JetBlue terminal early. There were a ton of airport staff sitting in the terminal and the airline provided no wheelchairs. They were there over an hour so loud and on their phones. It seemed like 2 out of ten of them were working hard while the rest did nothing but hang out and have a good time. I am sure the hard working ones will get sick of that soon and get a better job. It was just so so annoying!"
3rd December 2018,6,"""mostly quite rude and non motivated""","✅ Trip Verified | Boston Airport surprised me by two things: I needed just 15 minutes to get through customs and immigration when I arrived and I did find decent shopping facilities at departure. The airport is close to downtown, just cross the tunnel and you're there. Facilities are in general pretty old-style and looks in a way used-up. Security checks are as expected in the US, very disorganized and staff that are mostly quite rude and non motivated. I don't know why they behave like this."
24th November 2018,10,"""Easy airport to travel through""",Not Verified |  Easy airport to travel through. Long lines at security but it was Thanksgiving weekend. Even though long the line moved quickly. Easy airport to navigate. Arrived early due to holiday. Not many shops or food outlets. Lots of charging areas.
20th November 2018,3,"""crackling PA system""","✅ Trip Verified |   The departure zone at Boston’s Logan Airport is Air Canada’s penultimate attempt to break their customers. It is the air transport equivalent of a Greyhound bus stop at a last stop gas station. If you have ever watched “The Good Place”, you will know what I mean when I say I think this is “The Bad Place”. Everything from the flickering fluorescent lights and the crackling PA system, to the malfunctioning paper towel dispenser is designed to push people over the edge. On a positive note. The AC staff are stoically managing our hell without lashing-out at us."
31st October 2018,8,"""lacked empathy or understanding""","✅ Trip Verified | I have just returned from Florida with my family including a 4 month and a 22 month granddaughters. There was a Noreaster in the area with gusty winds and torrential rain. Because the central garage was full on Wednesday October 24 the security directed us to the economy garage. I asked my wife and daughter to stay with our granddaughters and the luggage inside till my son in law and I went to get the cars from the economy lot. As I returned to Delta at terminal A the man and women (in yellow jackets) outside would not let me run for 10 seconds to get my family with the 4 month and 22 month during a Noreaster. When I asked them where can I park the only thing they kept yelling was keep moving. I asked each one of them at least twice and got the same answer, not my problem, keep moving. They certainly were extremely rude, obnoxious and lacked empathy or understanding. A very bad representation of an otherwise fine airport. If those 2 people worked for me I would fire them on the spot."

25th October 2018,10,"""so frequently impressed""","✅ Trip Verified | I am so frequently impressed when traveling in/out/through Boston Logan. I use PreCheck for security and got through, and I am not exaggerating, in three minutes. The standard lane was not too much longer. Restaurant options are plentiful and not heinously priced, by USA airport standards. My most recent flight departed from terminal C with JetBlue. Gate area was impeccably clean, with an almost excessive number of outlets and cozy leather booths, as well as modern tables and chairs throughout the gate area. If you are arriving to Logan, make sure to use the silver line (SL1) to get to town. It can be crowded but it is free right to South Station in the center of town (about 20 minute ride). On your way back to the airport, it costs the standard one ride cost of $2.25."
16th October 2018,1,"""What a poorly run airport""",✅ Trip Verified | What a poorly run airport! We were flying with a TSA precheck but it took unnessecarily long because they combined the TSA precheck and regular lines for about the first 10-15 minutes of waiting. What's the point of precheck? Then I had to go through secondary screening with an X-ay and pat down. I understand the need for security and I've had to have that before but this was different. The woman performing it was very inappropriate and invasive.
2nd September 2018,10,"""was so impressed""","✅ Trip Verified | 100% turn-around at Boston Logan. I have been complaining about the international terminal for arrivals and departures for years, but was astounded by the change during my August 2018 visit. First, the nightmare of international arrivals has been completely alleviated for US and Canadians by use of the free Mobilepass phone app. I was out of the terminal (including picking up 2 checked bags) before my flight was even scheduled to arrive from Switzerland. It was amazing. Granted, few people were using the app and most were in the long line, but even those in the line were through quickly. Moreover, one no longer has to stand in that awful old hallway as in years past. The passport areas is expanded, brightly lit, and the line is organized and swift. And the wifi works in the arrival area. Second, the departure lounges have been completely redone. There are new marble bathrooms with fresh flowers, plugs at every seat, counter seats to do work and more food options. I was so impressed, I even took photos. Finally Boston has an international airport worthy of the great city Boston is."
25th August 2018,1,"""treated like cattle""","Not Verified | U.S. Customs in Boston is unhealthy place, treated like cattle going to their slaughter, very dirty, unorganized, just large fans no AC, understaffed, electronics used for processing kept coming up with errors. Shame on both Boston and U.S. Customs."
20th August 2018,1,"""have only had negative experiences""","✅ Trip Verified | Any time I arrive I either wait in a huge line to boarder control or waiting for luggage. For example today 8/16, 1 hour wait and luggage still didn’t arrive. For about the last year I have only had negative experiences with this airport."
19th August 2018,1,"""terminal is the pits""",✅ Trip Verified | Alaska terminal at Boston is the pits. One bathroom for each gender. One quickie food service place. One news and water stand. And if you catch the early flights there may be no services at all! Also PreTSA may not be open if they don’t think there are enough people.
6th August 2018,1,"""Avoid this airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Avoid this airport for transit flights! The terminals are separate entities, and so if you want to go to another terminal to get your flight you have to leave the terminal you are in and then go through security etc all over again. This is terrible when you are in transit and have to catch your next flight. If our connecting flight was not delayed, as was the case, we would have missed it."
17th July 2018,4,"""Jet Blue terminal is filthy""","✅ Trip Verified | The Jet Blue terminal is filthy. Countertops haven’t been wiped, carpet is in desperate need of vacuuming. Customer service staff in red vests are sitting at power bar sniffing/sucking mucus loudly. Gross. La Guardia does a better job."
14th July 2018,2,"""absolutely ridiculous""","Not Verified |  The international arrival customs line for US Citizens was a 67 minute wait for passport control. After a 9-hour international flight with two small children, standing in line for over an hour was absolutely ridiculous. The customs line at Logan is always longer than at any other airport, but this was absurd."
24th June 2018,1,"""avoid flying through Boston""
","✅ Trip Verified | We flew in from Amsterdam. We had to collect our bags in the international terminal, which is understandable; however, we then were required to take our bags from Terminal E all the way to Terminal A and then have to re-check the bags and go through security again. I can’t think of a more onerous and inefficient process, not to mention time consuming. In the future, I will make every effort to avoid flying through Boston."
7th June 2018,1,"""Crowded, dark and unwelcoming""","✅ Trip Verified | Very rude TSA barking at passengers orders using words like ""shoes"" and ""move"". International terminal had very little and overpriced facilities. Crowded, dark and unwelcoming. A disgraceful little airport for such a great city."
15th May 2018,1,"""What an awful airport""","❌ Not Verified |  What an awful airport. Every problem is under control of the airport management, US immigration and TSA, not airlines. Skybridge for international arrival was ""discovered"" to be inoperative. Passengers forced to remain on aircraft more than one hour while airport marshaled buses to drive them around the airport to another walk-in entrance. Baggage transfer location (transfer bags from international to domestic connections) staffed by only one person at desk; another staff gave incorrect instructions causing delays. US immigration required everyone to walk through a Disney maze for 5 minutes even though there were no other customers (late flight); had to use automated scan system; then had to go through another actual line with INS agents to do the same job. Way-finding signage after baggage transfer non-existent. Inquiries to uniformed police resulted in more misinformation sending us to locked doors, stairs without elevators and eventually walking outside to walk to terminal. Terminal design is terrible (as others have commented); but the simplest aides to overcome (signage and staffing). Because we were forced to go outside, had to go through TSA screening again; TSA staff were clustered together talking about their off-times and how long their hours were; and the few working were surly and slow. We are experienced international travelers. It is easier to negotiate airports in non-English speaking airports like Stockholm, Paris, Barcelona and Tokyo than Logan."
27th April 2018,3,"""the most poorly-designed airport""","✅ Trip Verified | I've never felt compelled to write a review about an airport before, but I had never been to Boston Logan Airport before either. This place is the most poorly-designed airport that I've ever encountered. I think someone would literally have to TRY in order to construct something more horribly inadequate for flyers. I had no issues with staff or anything, my main issue is with the fact that the terminals are segregated into tiny sections that are wholly unequipped to accommodate the number of people that have to occupy them. Security dumps everyone out right into the gate areas, which make traversing through the already puny space incredibly difficult. There are maybe four tiny restaurants in each wing (which means they're packed at any reasonable hour) and the gates have far too little seating. I walked around for over an hour before I was able to poach a seat at a random gate that had just started boarding. It's that bad. What a mess!"
17th April 2018,1,"""apathy  does not build confidence""",✅ Trip Verified |  They closed pre TSA at 8 pm. Then the TSA people - where do they even get these guys who seemed so unconcerned. I know they are trying to screen and protect us. But their mannerisms. Their apathy really does not build confidence.
16th February 2018,2,"""Doesn't anyone monitor them?""","✅ Trip Verified | A couple of the baggage staff were quite rude and sarcastic (""this isn't complicated people""). I was told 2 days earlier by the security staff in Raleigh, N.C. that I didn't need to remove my Ipad, then the opposite by a member of the Logan security team. ""I don't know why anyone would tell you that"". While I understand the job may be stressful, don't take it out on me and other travelers by being rude. We all have stress in our lives and I don't need your rude behavior to aggravate me and make my day worse. Doesn't anyone monitor them?"
3rd January 2018,1,"""Absolutely predictably awful""","❎ Not Verified |  Delays every week on my return trips home from business travel. Absolutely predictably awful. Ground delays or some other excuse. Use another airport if possible. Oh, and the most expensive airport parking Fly elsewhere. I recommend MHT if possible."
26th November 2017,5,"""less appealing airport""","✅ Trip Verified | After many years that I am traveling to and from Boston I can tell that Boston is still one of the less appealing airports I traveled in. They improved a lot the arrival zone, but terminal E is really depressing. Always a long line for the security - luckily the staff is friendly - and 4 shops, literally. It is too bad for an international airport like Logan."
12th November 2017,9,"""TSA staff were working hard""","✅ Verified Review |  Arrived terminal E, 7.30pm. After delay waiting for airbridge to disembark it all went well. First time ESTA passenger, line initially looked long slow and disorganised, but TSA staff were working hard to send people to the shortest lines, bags waiting on reclaim belt. On SL1 to downtown within 50 minutes of landing. Can't complain. Departure at 9.40pm was equally painless, check in fast security not bad, staff not the friendliest but the hardware they are given is cumbersome compared to that at somewhere like LHR. The only downside was the Priority Pass 'Club'. It looked as if it has been refurbished recently, but with the cheapest dingiest materials available, more like a government waiting room, and I mean the old soviet block. Food was very poor. Hey but not as bad as the Aspire lounges in the UK."
18th October 2017,1,"""no appealing dining options""","✅ Verified Review |  Airport should be scraped from the ground and rebuilt from ground up. Massport's planning is grossly inadequate and infrastructure inadequate. This airport is a bad nightmare of 1960's shortsighted planning. Wifi is terrible, bathrooms filthy, no appealing dining options and surly staff."
15th October 2017,3,"""major overhaul is required""
","✅ Verified Review |  At Terminal C the lines for security checks are a slow and tedious process, not because of thorough checking, no that would be acceptable. The reason for the tardy lines is the attitude and laziness of the (clearly not supervised) TSA agents. A major overhaul is required Boston, the airport is many people’s first, last and over-riding impression of a city. Boston’s Logan lets down an otherwise friendly place. Marty Walsh, it’s a good job no-one is running against you! The city should be ashamed of the TSA staff and the lasting impression of a lazy, poorly organised team, not what you see elsewhere in New England."
7th October 2017,2,"""rude and unhelpful today""","❎ Unverified |  Security staff terminal A. While I appreciate that they do a vital job for the safety of all of us, and they are under a lot of pressure, the security staff at terminal A were rude and unhelpful today. I was told off by one staff member for leaving one item in my pocket, as if I were already under some sort of investigation. It was a clear plastic wallet containing money, which I did not want exposed to public glare. I then found four trays of my belongings piling up at the end of the runners tipping over, being pushed by the following trays, risking my laptop, kindle and phone being sent crashing to the floor. I had to grab them and was left with an empty tray to get rid of, with nowhere to put it, and no staff offering to help. My reaction was to throw it back onto the runners as I felt I had no other choice, and the staff thought I was throwing it at them. I admit my reaction was not the best one, but I felt pushed into a corner by the staff doing nothing to help me and being rather aggressive. When I asked where I could go to sort my things out the answer was ""I dunno, get outta here"". Unhelpful, rude. This contrasts markedly with the courtesy, helpfulness, and friendliness of everybody else we have met in Boston, including strangers. It also contrasts with the attitude of security staff at other airports I have travelled from recently, such as London Heathrow, Arrecife Lanzarote and Gibraltar. I apologise for my own reaction, but may I respectfully suggest your terminal A security staff undergo some more training in how to be constructively helpful and courteous?"
19th September 2017,3,"""very sad impression left""","✅ Verified Review | Congrats on the helpfulness and speed of arriving through customs - person directing flow and the immigration officer were very helpful and friendly - however that's where it stopped - the baggage claim attendants were obviously more interested in their phones and being obstructive than helpful - I was directed to the wrong carousel and when I actually found where my bag was I was told ""to be nice"" to people who were trying to ""help"" me - all I wanted was my bag not to be given a lecture by someone in a customer service area (after an horrendous 48hrs of trying to get to Boston) - very sad impression left of what should be a smooth process given the international reputation of the country; staff perhaps need to be reminded they are in a position to assist not lecture when a simple question was asked. I cannot overall rate effectively as for the arrival and customs staff I would rate 10/10 but the baggage claim staff I would be flat out giving a 1/10 - recommendation I have said yes - only because it doesn't allow me to separate between areas and it is the only way into Boston."
31st August 2017,8,"""serves its purpose reasonably well""","✅ Verified Review | Seems to be getting an undeserved bad rep here. It's a major airport on the East Coast, expect lines to exist. It's not JFK, but it's busy, and there's lots of people coming through here. Otherwise, it's not bad: free and decent wifi, decent selection of food options, plenty of seating, cleanliness is fine, signage is decent (the only place in Boston where that's the case, however!). It's an airport, it's not the happiest place, but for the most part, it serves its purpose reasonably well."
14th August 2017,5,"""tons of them doing absolutely nothing""","✅ Verified Review |  Our arrival was incredibly simple, but we didn't check bags so it was pretty simple. It was the departure that was frustrating. We made it to the airport in good time - about an hour before take-off, made it through the first ID and boarding pass check quickly. Then the security bit. The TSA agents were flat out rude. Not only were they getting frustrated and unnecessarily annoyed with a woman who clearly did not speak English (after they asked her to do something 4 or 5 times and then getting progressively angry with her I finally had to tell them she obviously doesn't understand), but there were tons of them doing absolutely nothing. Both our bags were held because I had saline solution that I knew needed to be tested and my partner forgot he had carried in our water bottle. We and 2 or 3 other folks sat at the end at the security check point for (and this is a rough estimation) about 10-15 minutes before anyone started checking bags, but there were security people sitting around. Talking with each other. Standing around. And all the while our plane is about ready to begin boarding. I was furious. After waiting another 5-10 minutes for our bags to be checked and for my partner to go through security (a second time) with their water bottle we were finally able to make it to our gate. The guy who looked through our bag was nice, but it was like no one knew what their job was that day! Overall I hope I never have to fly out of this airport again. I've never been so annoyed or had this much trouble travelling."
22nd July 2017,1,"""airport was hot and stuffy""",❎ Unverified | Flight 2863 arrived into Boston from Manchester U.K. I had a connecting flight to Tampa. Had to go through immigration then collect my luggage and walk miles to connecting flight terminal. I was sent to wrong line by the terminal reps who did not know what they were doing they were very unfriendly and not helpful. The airport was hot and stuffy. Long lines and unfriendly personnel. To make matters worst I had to go through airport security second time for same flight. It was the worst experience I've ever had.
15th July 2017,5,"""Deeply disappointed""","❎ Unverified |    I am unhappy with this airport. First of all, the staff at the terminal C Jetblue counter are rude and don't tell you whether or not your bag is overweight. They also seem to not know what gate flights are at. Deeply disappointed, though wifi is good. Unfortunately, I have to fly through Logan once a year."
19th June 2017,2,"""horrible, inexcusable delays""","❎ Unverified |  I have never found Logan Airport to be efficient or well-run. It's runway renovations are causing horrible, inexcusable delays. I am sitting on a Dallas runway waiting to take off to Boston on a Sunday morning and we have already been delayed twice. Three weeks ago, I experienced a six hour delay due to this same thing. I am going to start driving to RI or other airports rather than waste time trying to use Logan. Colleagues of mine in Boston are also doing the same."
15th April 2017,2,"""security very slow, badly organised""","I flew from Boston Logan a few weeks ago on my own. Getting into the airport is good - traffic was well organised and I parked easily. This was the only good comment I can make. Security / bag check must be the worst airport I have travelled through. Very slow, badly organised, unacceptably long queues. Surly unhelpful staff. Extremely poor choice of dining. The usual Fast food (very busy). A restaurant was dingy with long queues. A wine bar looked okay. The staff were overworked but pleasant and trying their best. No food after 9:00. My flight was 22:40. The toilets were smelly. I travelled through again this week. Exactly the same. Send someone to look at Gatwick or Terminal 5 Heathrow to see how it should be done. I gave it 2 due to good parking."
9th April 2017,2,"""poor customer service""","✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I used Boston Logan to fly to Toronto then Japan. We took Air Canada and it's hard to not notice the poor customer service. We had 4 people ""working"" at our Gate. Three of the ladies gossiped loudly and endlessly about how bad one of their fellow employees was. It's an embarrassment! Needless to say, when we flew to Japan, employees would bow and run to greet us with smiles. They tended to their stations with a high degree of professionalism and exuded politeness and friendliness. What happened to our airports? How bad have we lowered our standards? What ever happened to customer service and a respect for the position? Furthermore, these ""workers"" are the first impression people from other countries are greeted with when they come to the United States-can't we do better?"
6th April 2017,8,"""lots of additional seating""","The queue at immigration on arrival was terrible - 90 minutes. However, my departure experience was very good. I was pleased to see that the E gates area has been upgraded, with lots of additional seating. Plenty of sockets and USB charging points at the seats and desks to work at if you needed to. I'm surprised that they didn't increase the number of shops and catering outlets at the same time though. Delighted to get free and fast wifi without a time limit - well, I think it might have been 12 hours, but that was plenty!"
28th March 2017,3,"""troubling and problematic""","✅ Verified Review |  I have flown in and out of Boston Logan many times. This was my first international travel in/out of BOS. My experience departing from BOS was smooth and timely. However, my arrival and experience getting through Customs and Immigration upon arrival in BOS was horrible. My flight arrived at approximately the same time as another international flight, as the lines were very long. Customs was understaffed. Upon getting through the automatic booths and the first round of Customs, you enter baggage claim. Here, even if you weren't collecting a checked bag, you had to wait in a single file line that wrapped behind the baggage carousels because Customs officials weren't organized enough to get set up for the number of people coming through. At this point, I was confused whether everyone had to wait in the same line whether or not you had checked luggage, and I asked two airport workers and neither could answer my questions, which was very frustrating. As the long line finally progressed (slowly because there was only one person taking the forms from us), one Customs official yelled at me for using my phone even though I wasn't at the booth and (I would like to emphasize) there are no signs saying you cannot use your phone in that section. The Customs official was just completely unnecessarily harsh and I would have been very happy to hang up if he had asked, but as I said goodbye, he yelled at me a second time, simply stating, ""NOW!"" On a side note, there was not a single female Customs official working throughout the whole process, and I find that very troubling and problematic."
6th February 2017,6,"""I would not use Boston""","Decided to use Boston since Hainan Airlines flies from here. Departure was easy with short immigration and security lines. Took about 30-45 minutes to get thru in Terminal E. Very few shops thereafter, but place was not very busy in mid afternoon. Arrival is a different story, immigration lines were very long. The ESTA system in use, with two counters open. Took one hour plus to get thru. By then, bags were on carousel. Cart provided free, and long custom line next. Fortunately, one of the officer waved us thru a special line with junior sleeping over my shoulders. Conclusion, I would not use Boston thinking it was easier than JFK."
21st January 2017,7,"""okay airport to transfer at""","✅ Verified Review |  On arrival I started to see how dedicated the airport staff and TSA agents were. I was transferring from American to Westjet and having never been to the airport I didn't have the best idea of what I was up to. Upon approaching staff they made sure I had every ounce of information they could think of to make sure I would be going in the right direction. Talk about outstanding customer service. Being that Boston is right on the great Atlantic almost every variation of food has some form of seafood in it (a plus for me... there's nothing better than a good piece of lobster), but it does tend to be overpriced. There aren't that many shops (at least where my gate was) so it might be a bit underwhelming for the fanatic shopping-passengers. The airport was mostly clean, but the washrooms could have had some more attention paid to them. Overall, Boston is an okay airport to transfer at, the staff are very good at what they do, and although you may get bored, you probably won't have an issue flying through there again."
10th January 2017,1,"""employees basically standing around doing nothing""","Security at this airport is grossly inefficient and takes forever. We arrived at the airport two hours prior for a domestic flight. To start with, we were placed in an insanely long line by a TSA agent. Ten minutes later, we were pulled out of that line by another TSA agent and told to go to the back of an even longer line. When we told the agent that another TSA agent had put us in this line, her response was a curt, ""I don't care."" It took us well over an hour to get through security, then there was another ridiculously long line as they were scanning/checking bags. They had two scanners that were malfunctioning, and a bunch of employees basically standing around doing nothing. With all the security hassles, we barely made our flight with only 3 minutes to spare. All this after we showed up 2 hours beforehand! If you are flying out of this airport, I recommend arriving 3 hours prior if flying domestic, and be prepared for rude, unprofessional employees who constantly contradict one another."
16th December 2016,2,"""the security line was absurd""","✅ Verified Review |  The security line was absurd. Thankfully the line was not long when I arrived and I purchased extra speed check in through my airline because the TSA folks who were checking the bags in the X-ray machine were slower than I have ever experienced at any airport. There were at least 8 other tsa workers who were not doing anything, and did not assist the sole woman checking the bags. This equated to a 45 minute wait to get through X-ray and obtain my bags. Completely unacceptable. I had to run to my flight to make it as they were announcing my name over the loud speaker. I am lucky my flight waited for me. I am very disappointed in my wait time today and the lack of attention the tsa workers paid to everyone waiting for nothing."
20th November 2016,8,"""never had a problem with sufficient airport seating""","Logan has been my home airport since 1980. Pretty much used every terminal. The airport is in a constant metamorphosis. Slowly each terminal is being remodeled, and then again remodeled. It's constrained by limited real estate and traffic patterns much like Washington National. There is is no comparison to the bad old days of 1980 when it was essentially a regional airport. However long one must walk, it's nothing like Philadelphia. I agree that a post-security people-mover type of shuttle between terminals for connecting flights. Boston is not a hub airport. I wouldn't think of making a connecting flight out of Logan. It's only recently they've begun real bona-fide international flights to Europe. Every international flight I've ever taken has me switching in Newark/NY. Many of the comments I've read here are terminal-specific. Services are vastly different from one terminal to the next. Don't broadbrush the whole airport. I've seen TSA shut down their lines when demand is low, but then open right back up when it surges. Seen this at many airports. When it is open, it never, ever takes me more than 5 minutes to get through, worst-case. Restaurant quality and quantity is greatly improved. Cooked food after airport security? Yes, there is, again, depending on the specific terminal. Up until last year, you needed to pay for wireless. That's changed. The inconvenience of 45 minute disconnect is a small price to say. Even still, the Rochester, NY wireless service beats Logan any day. I've never had a problem with airport staff. Be friendly, you'll get it back. Be a jerk, you'll probably get it back. Never had a problem with sufficient airport seating. They are slow to install power connections in or near the seats. Lack of toilets? I've never had a problem and I always must go as soon as I get off."
10th November 2016,2,"""airport is badly in need of updating""","This airport is badly in need of updating and a poor choice, especially if you need to change terminals between flights. There is no internal people mover between terminals so one either has to go back outside and take a shuttle bus to the next terminal or walk a very long corridor between terminals. Then one must get in a long line and go through security again with very curt, rude security workers. Also, Logan does not accept the Global entry card except on Delta, not even for national pre-TSA. The terminal was so overheated, especially after coming off an international flight and having to go without water until I got through 2 long security lines with a long passage in between. I have medical problems such as heart arrhythmias and carry a cane for lupus arthritis, so these issues could have caused a medical emergency. So my family will avoid this airport until it goes through the needed renovations,"
8th November 2016,1,"""one of the worse places to be stuck on a long layover""","An embarrassing gateway and one of the worst airports for a layover. 1) Gateway: As is always the case when someone arrives from outside North America to a US port of entry, we had to claim our baggage. And in every other airport in the world, we would re-check it immediately after customs. But not in Boston. There was no baggage re-check desk for the Star Alliance nor was anyone who worked there aware of one. I asked one of the people in the recheck area what to do. She snarked that we had to take our baggage to the check-in desk in Terminal B. To put this in perspective, the gateway for international passengers is in Terminal E. Boston has no shuttle train between terminals and its bus stop is quite a bit away from the terminal and goes off-site to the T station before returning to the airport, so we had to walk it three quarters of the way around the not-so-small airport to get between terminals. It’s not the most straight-forward of walks between terminals: it goes inside and outside, up elevators, across parking garages—you get the picture. When we arrived at Terminal B, the airline staff member said, “Oh, we do have a drop over there.” I said it wasn’t marked and no one there knew about it. He snarked, “Well that’s the airport.” 2) Layover: If you like cramped waiting areas with 1 recharging station serving passengers at three gates inside the secure area, or visiting Dunkin Donuts stands whose staff desert them but fail to leave any indication that the place is closed or lounges whose servers who keep saying the other server will help you, then this is the place to hang out. But for the rest of us, the cramped conditions, lousy selection, lousier service, and lack of any suitable place to wait makes Logan one of the worse places to be stuck on a long layover between flights. When the layover occurs following an international flight to world-class airports in Europe and Asia that were designed for comfort and efficiency between flights, the conditions at Logan look all the worse. 3) Overall: After experiencing some of the efficient, pleasant, spacious gateways in Amsterdam, Helsinki, Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Copenhagen in recent months, my trip to Logan made me feel like I had gone back in time from the 21st to the 20th century. As a former Boston resident, I expect to find history in Boston-just not at the airport. And as an American, I felt like this gateway was anything but welcoming to visitors."
17th October 2016,3,"""over 2 hours later we cleared immigration""","Well, what can you say, we were a party of our, traveling from London into Boston, arrived on time, ushered into the hall leading to the immigration area, barked at by an official to stand in the left or right depending on your status. We were then ushered in to hall (notice on wall stating no washrooms after this point). We then moved very slowly, out a possible 8 desks 2 were staffed, at one point these closed while they changed shift! Over 2 hours later and with 2 of our group bursting for the ""restroom"" we cleared immigration. We are fully aware how important and serious homeland sercurity is but come guys, get your act together, you know full well when the busy times are and you know where the planes are coming from, get more staff. On telling others of our disappointment it appears this is an ongoing problem. This situation must be affecting tourism. There were notices in the hall to say who to contact if you were unhappy but also notices to say no photos, so to head of homeland security, take note please. The good news, departure was smooth."
4th October 2016,7,"""airport is conveniently close to the city""","✅ Verified Review |  The airport is conveniently close to the city and it is easy to get to. The terminal I used - E - had a grand hall with complimentary internet, which worked just fine (despite only allowing free sessions of 45 minutes each time). However, I was a tad taken aback when I passed the security checks - which were very quick, I must say - as the terminal looked too utilitarian and did not really make anyone feel comfortable or welcome. I did like the many electricity sockets available and the rocking chairs by the windows. Also, the screens all over the airport only show the flight numbers, times, airlines and terminal and do not show if the flight is boarding, for example. It would be convenient to have such information on the boards, so that people do not rely only on the information over the speakers. Not to mention that some people have hearing impairments."
3rd October 2016,9,"""quick, fair and friendly""","Arrived at Logan early evening and expected a long wait for immigration, I was wrong. There were a few empty desks which I initially thought was a little unfair considering how many intercontinental flights were all in attendance. However, desks were opened and immigration and customs were quick, fair and friendly. No frills, but who wants that when you have a hotel to get to. Domestic departures (Terminal C) was clean, efficient and smooth. Very nice indeed."
31st August 2016,10,"""departing was smooth""","✅ Verified Review |  Reading other reviews I was preparing myself for the worst when arriving and departing from Logan. However this turned out to be unfounded. We were off the plane and waiting on the silver line bus which takes you to downtown boston for free within 10 mins. Not many airports offer this perk. Departing was smooth, good food options at the airport to suit all budgets. Lots of seats at the departure area. Will love to use this airport again."
5th August 2016,8,"""long walking distances""",Boston Logan is a good airport - however quite long walking distances between the gates and different terminal facilities. I did love that the international terminal and the domestic terminals right next to each other. So you were able to see the international airlines fly in front of you. That is a very beautiful sight. Very busy though...
27th April 2016,1,"""a sight to behold""",Normally great service but today's baggage foul up at Delta was a sight to behold - two or three bags jammed at the belt so they shut down the carousel and announced a problem - one individual I assume at the baggage office grabbed his coat and left - a little later a young man came and pulled the bags off and the carousel started a matter of minutes after the man lifted 2 bags off. No one from the baggage office moved and we all waited for the fellow in the safety vest to show up as my wife stated she could have easily done that as the bags were at the carousel. Point being either this is a union issue or they need to hire motivated people who want to do the job.
28th March 2016,9,"""easy to navigate and great signage""","Since I live just outside of Boston, I always fly out of Logan. For those not used to big airports. Don't worry. Even though Logan is huge, it is quite easy to navigate and has great signage. Terminal C is for JetBlue and affiliates like Cape Air. Terminal B is Delta, United, and Air Canada. Terminal A is Southwest and AA. Terminal E is all international departures/ arrivals excluding Air Canada. The downsides are that it is usually busy and the wifi is hard to connect to. Boston rarely loses baggage anymore which is good. Plenty of food options and stores. Very friendly staff and a calm environment. Including the fact that Boston is soon accepting A380s and B747-8, I truly recommend d flying via Logan International."
11th March 2016,2,"""acceptable, barely""","Coming in to Boston: acceptable, barely. Hard to find a restroom. Departing Boston? Horrible. 90 plus degrees in departure gate areas. No cooler place without leaving security area. No prepared food or drinks in gate area. Have to backtrack through multiple security checkpoints to find food. No pre-check options at some. Hot sweaty. Just the way to start a 5 hour flight to be followed by another 3 hour flight. Can't imagine it won't smell like a cattle car by the end - lovely."
24th February 2016,2,"""only a single bathroom""","I arrived into the international terminal of Boston airport after two 10 hour flights from Thailand. To my amazment and disappointment, there is only a single bathroom (and just guessing, a water fountain) after departing the plane and making it through passport control, baggage claim and customs. To make it worse the bathroom is at the other end of the hall after every single entrance to passport control. Once in the line it's hard (or rather time consuming) to get back out. If you do need to use the restroom after making to to phase 2, baggage claim, then you get to do phase one all over again. Finally the lack of drinking water available is appalling. There once again are no fountains of bottles for purchase until making it through customs. No water and no toilet are a great way to make weary travelers cranky."
29th November 2015,8,"""very clean, well lit and well directed""","Used Boston Logan when on holiday a few months ago - flew BA to and from the airport. Reached the airport pretty late and the first impression I got is - this is a a really busy airport, if an intercontinental flight is held for 1/2 an hour awaiting a (vacant) gate allocation. Arrivals experience was somber - after you live in the UK where there is a lot of hype and over the counter talk of small things - the airport - right from the moment I got off the aircraft - to CBP (Customs and Border Protection aka ""immigration"") was a very utilitarian experience. Very clean, well lit and well directed. Staff are on hand all the time so if you are dazed and don't really know what the heavens is going on (typically at the end of long haul flights) - they will direct you with minimal fuss. Toilets are clean - America has again, this no-frills attitude - you want to use a toilet, you get an american toilet - simple. CBP staff - interacted with two - one a native Italian speaker about 52 who tried his humanly best to welcome and wake me up - but my apologies was tired. The other one was the lady who checked us off and stamped our passports - no silly questions. It is refreshing to see immigration control in America so different to the one in UK and India - not a hint of arrogance, questions asked - all that was said was ""Welcome to America"" - this is something I will remember for a long, long time. Departures: Very nice departures area - clean, well kept and no complaints - might be handy with heating started a bit higher please. Check in at the BA desk was a 5 minute affair - American staff have a smile and again are utilitarian unlike the English examples in the UK. Security is a big thing in America - you drink all the water if this exceeds 100 milliliters, get scanned - pat down - all with a smile. There is a fair amount of ""duty free"" shopping there - something well laid out too. Catering is not great - if you are hungry please eat first and then check in - food is expensive, staff are surly and bored and food quantities would not be enough for a baby. One thing - this is all about terminal E - international departures and arrivals. British Airways has gates E37 and E37A allotted (as of writing) - so you know where you going and these gates are in the left corner after you clear security."
3rd November 2015,2,"""from there it went downhill""","Signage to reach the airport very poor and misleading, we had a grand tour of Boston before actually managing to get there and that was with a satnav and apple maps. Rental car drop off smooth and transfer to terminal good. From there it went downhill. We had to wait an hour and a half for checin to open, once through security - thank god it was not busy because it was extra slow. Once airside, I expected to be able to relax in the airline lounge (Aer Lingus) only to find it did not open for 90 mins after check in opened. Once in the very small lounge we passed the time until boarding. A trip to the rest rooms showed an 'interesting' side to Logan airport. The hike along corridors took you past areas resembling a church hall jumble sale, a clothes rack strewn with discarded clothes, a store area for old and shabby furniture and I have it on good authority, though I did not investigate for obvious reasons that the men's urinals were rather full"
22nd September 2015,7,"""I was driving out less than ten minutes after I got off the bus""","Boston Logan has improved a great deal in recent years. I arrived without checked bags, so getting from the aircraft to the rental car shuttle took a little time. There is one bus route to the rental car center and the buses run frequently. As a member of the frequent rental program for the rental company I used I was able to walk to the left of the rental counter queues and go straight to the parking area. My name was on the board and I was driving out less than ten minutes after I got off the bus. Departure from Logan to head north on I-93 is trivial and well sign posted. If you don't mind the added cost of 'renting' a toll pass they really make things easy and I would recommend making sure you have one. Boston is reputed to have bad traffic but even on a holiday weekend I had no trouble following the exit through the tunnels and on to I93 north. Returning to the airport it is easy to find from I93 south. There is a gas station in the airport, but since I have GPS I use a cheaper gas station near the airport. Without the GPS I'd just use the in airport station. Drop-off is easy again, just follow the sign off the ramp for your rental company and then take the elevator to the 1st floor to get the shuttle back to the airport. I flew with Jet Blue so there were loads of self check-in booths and it only took a minute to print my boarding pass. I had paid for extra room which comes with a shorter security queue. Airside for Jet Blue is pretty crowded at busy times but they have free WiFi and there is power on every seat in the waiting area. There are enough bathrooms and they are clean and well maintained. I got coffee and DD and sat down to charge my toys while I waited. This isn't a first class lounge but it is OK for the rest of humanity. It could be better, they could have more space, the Internet could be faster. But it's a better place to wait than many."
31st July 2015,1,Boston Logan Airport customer review,"Not enough staff to handle lines in baggage claim and at security checkpoints, so extremely long lines and wait times. Flight delayed multiple times by more than 2 hours. All bathroom toilets blocked up (tried 4, all were stopped up). Water fountains not working. Hot at gate/terminal areas. Customer service not helpful. Horrible experience."
14th July 2015,3,Boston Logan Airport customer review,"Boston Logan has maintained its abysmal record of uncleanliness in the women's restroom opposite the Delta Airlines boarding area. On a recent trip, as on a previous one in the fall of 2014, this restroom had dirty toilet stalls and nonfunctional ""automated"" sink handles. The airport is, in general, user-unfriendly. Yesterday I had intended to wait for a friend on an arriving flight in the cell-phone lot, which I'd not been to before. The signage to the lot was so confusing that instead I ended up in the central parking garage. Signage from the garage to the US Air arrivals area in the terminal was similarly unedifying; I had to ask an employee for directions. Same thing to navigate the return to the garage. The signage for the terminals and parking is not only confusing but also dangerous: any attempt to change lanes runs the risk of involving oneself in a crash with one of the numerous fast-approaching vehicles on one's tail. I always dread having to pick up anyone at Logan and often resort to telling visitors they must take a cab."
4th June 2015,7,Boston Logan Airport customer review,I've flown out of here a few times recently as it tends to be cheaper than my hometown airport (MHT) the Virgin America boarding area is small for the number of flights it handles and places to eat in Terminal B are kind of sparse. With all the international carriers coming in as well as being a focus city for JetBlue BOS does need to step its game up if it wants to compete on the world stage of airports but at least its wifi works for the most part!
31st May 2015,1,Boston Logan Airport customer review,Really sorry I chose to transit through Logan. With waiting for buses queuing surly TSA and airport staff it has got to be one of the poorest airports. They conspired to gobble up over 2 1/4 hrs in a simple transfer from Terminal B to E. Why an advanced country such as America and a wealthy city puts up with such a shambles I can only guess and it seams to be getting worse. The management need to get out and see how a proper airport is run.
12th February 2015,10,Boston Logan Airport customer review,I love this airport didn't have to make a line for security since I had the TSA Pre-check. Terminal A is very clean and has some good restaurants.
31st December 2014,n/a,Boston Logan Airport customer review,Huge delays even for US citizens. One line just to get to the computerized passport scanners then another line to talk to the immigration officers to collect the customs forms then yet another huge line for everybody where there is one person to collect the electronic printouts. This is going backwards not forwards in time and efficiency. And after a long international flights it is painful. The last line is for everybody and one person there to collect the forms. This is absolutely ridiculous.
19th August 2021,1,"""Incredibly rude TSA employees""",Not Verified |  Incredibly rude TSA employees throughout the entire check-in process. Going through security is the absolute worst. Every employee was rude. TIA service is terrible all around anymore. They used to be very polite.
4th August 2021,1,"""it has gotten progressively less customer-focused""","Not Verified |  Parking: Had a cruise scheduled, with flight out of Tampa International. Due to last minute CDC and govt Covid rule changes, it was canceled. Every other group did a full refund or at least full dollar credit for future purchases, since the cancelation was due to COVID and govt reaction: airline, 3 shore excursions, cruise line, hotel. The only deposit we could not fully get back was parking at Tampa International. Of the $90 charge, we got back only $45. Tampa airport used to be the best airport in the country. Since Lopano took over, it has gotten progressively less customer-focused. Maybe Tiliocos, VP of Customer Service, has something to do with it? I emailed those two and the Feldman, head of parking. Obviously they got my emails, since Feldman, head of parking, called me to tell me personally to bugger off. Of the $5K for the trip, 45 is peanuts. But it shows how cold and uncaring the TPA has become. My flying has decreased in recent years, but I used to have gold cards on 4 different airlines and traveled at least once every week, out of Tampa. I marveled at having one of the best airports in the country nearby. I'd be extremely cautious about booking anything through TPA in these times of Covid."
15th June 2021,1,"""The whole ordeal was ridiculous""","Not Verified |  The TSA security check in was one of the worst and rudest I've ever been through. The only people security bothered to run through the wringer of special security checks are senior citizens and those needing assistance. I am on crutches and was told I should have been in a wheelchair because TSA did not provide chairs for someone like me to sit on to take their shoes off. I told them that I'd happily takes my shoes off if they could provide a chair. They didn't. Then after going through the xray they had to pat me down. Twice. And check for residue. Why the heck did I have to hobble through the xray without my crutches if I was going to get pat down anyway. Looking around as I was pat down, the ONLY people getting the special security treatment was senior citizens and persons like me. And on top of that they weren't even polite about it. Someone need to answer why those two groups are treated like this. I would understand it if they at least selected some random people or other demographic but for the 20 minutes it took me to go through security they did not once check anyone else and multiple times had people go through the regular walk through metal detector because the line was getting long. The whole ordeal was ridiculous. I rarely leave reviews so this is a whole level up of bad experiences."
1st April 2021,3,"""A smile and gentle reminder would have been far more effective""","✅ Trip Verified | Dear female TSA agent, gate A, 4/1/2021, 1.20pm who chose to shriek at me and berate me for forgetting I had an electronic in my purse. Top of her lungs - “Yeah! There’s an electronic in your bag - despite him saying over and over to remove your electronics you chose not to listen, now we had to take it out!”  Wow! A) The area was hugely crowded, overhead announcements etc - people may have a hearing impairment and cannot hear in that situation - even with hearing equipment. B) I’m traveling with a special needs Child - my attention is on him as much as possible helping him to navigate a crowded and confusing situation. C.) I’ve just experienced a tragic death in my family. D) I’m sorry I forgot. I’m human last time I checked. People fly, as you know, for all reasons. While I understand your need to educate - your tone, terrible attitude and general demeanor are a terrible reflection on TSA. Sorry you had a bad day. Leave that at the front door. I can promise you didn’t make mine any better. A smile and gentle reminder would have been far more effective."
10th March 2020,1,"""the rudest people I have ever encountered""",Not Verified |  The Delta employees at Tampa airport were the rudest people I have ever encountered. Throughout the entire experience trying to get to my plane was one rude person followed by another. I will never fly Delta again because of the Tampa employees.

Poor management with little staff to meet the heavy demand. Find this off putting and would make me chose an alternate Florida airport in the future. Even US nations mentioning how this is embarrassing.

Now I love it more for the following reasons. I was bored so I started walking toward gate 75 (Delta). I saw an outdoor smoking area. My goodness, it was about time as TPA had eliminated the big outside smoking area inside the airport (what is this world coming to). When I saw the people smoking there, I went inside."
6th April 2019,3,"""Terminal A restroom smells""",Not Verified | Terminal A restroom smells of urine. No hot water. Water fountains do not work. Carpet dirty. Got through security very quick at 0730.

9th February 2019,1,"""security people are extremely rude""","The security people are extremely rude, mean and the threatening people is absolutely absurd. I will never use this airport again. This huge man threatened me several times because I wasn’t moving fast enough. Then when I put my briefcase on the rollers it slipped, then a woman threatened me, I didn’t do anything wrong at all! Then the big guy gets up in my face again and keeps yelling at me telling me he decides who comes and goes. There was no excuse for their behavior. "
14th December 2018,7,"""whole departure experience was dreadful""","Not Verified |  After waiting for several hours in Tampa Airport we were finally allowed to board. As I approached the ramp I realized I had lost my boarding pass. I spoke to a Spirit employee, I had spoken to him earlier in the evening so I know he recognized me. My wife told him I needed to board the flight. He said, ""I was going to be nice and help you, but you can go over go the ticket counter and get your boarding pass reissued."" I am a retired, disabled military member. I also have MS."" This whole departure experience was dreadful. This staff member made the evening that much worse."
3rd October 2018,5,"""too large for its own good""","Not Verified | I have to say I have been flying in and out of Tampa airport since the 80's and I understand that as it has grown in passenger volume, it has gotten too large for its own good. I will say that, what I call a Mall with shops and endless food options is fantastic. However the extremely high escalator is ridiculous and the distance you have to go with the tram and the speed at which it goes to the rental car location is way too far and too fast. I have anxiety and the speed is just waiting for a accident as it is way too jittery. And once you are their you have more to walk. I am not old but I did have major heart surgery but for elderly it is not passenger friendly to have to walk that much. This all makes me wonder about choosing a different airport or a different way to travel. I loved when the garage housed the rental cars. It was perfect. I would have kept the 1st and 2nd floor of the garage for car rentals and the top floors for passengers who kept their cars there. And why dont you have stars below for the Tram to the rental facility or the rental car experience."
14th June 2018,9,"""always ample TSA agents""","✅ Trip Verified | I always love flying to and from the Tampa Airport. From the drive into TPA, the airlines are cleverly color coded and then you are directed to either arrivals or departures. Then you simply have to look for the door with your airline. Once inside the main terminal, head to the appropriate ticket counter. If you have pre-checked in online, just take the air conditioned tram to your terminal (A–F). There you will go through security. There’s always ample TSA agents there to keep the crowd moving along securely and swiftly. Once through security, you are welcomed into a massive airy terminal. There’s plenty of food options from Cigar City Brewing (a popular craft beer producer in Tampa) to The Colombia Restaurant, a staple in Tampa since 1905 serving authentic Spanish fair. There’s plenty of workspace and outlets to charge up your devices. I flow the flow of this airport with plenty of signage. It’s almost impossible to get lost and everything is relatively closeby."
26th April 2018,6,"""a reasonably good, user-friendly airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Have always found Tampa to be a reasonably good, user-friendly airport. Overall it's still not bad but had a few red flags come up this time. Arrived in terminal E and used the men's washroom only to find the floor completely flooded (helps if you don't think too much about that). Fair enough, stuff happens. Except when we left a week later the same washroom still had a flooded floor. Seriously? Are there no plumbers in Tampa? Pretty disgusting. Check-in areas in the main terminal are starting to show their age. Trek to the car rental facility is a bit of an adventure. Up and down endless escalators plus a far from smooth train ride. Layout of the car rental area also seems to be an accident waiting to happen. Pedestrian walkways are not well defined and (in the case of Avis) cars were parked on the walkway back to the main building. Still gets a recommended grade but barely."
21st April 2018,1,"""conflicting passenger flows""","✅ Trip Verified |  Avoid this airport!! Passenger flow choke points, intersecting traffic, triple tram rides just to get to security check point, conflicting passenger flows, enter on fourth level, go down to second them back up to fourth. Three dimensional dysfunction! Time and frustration makes the chaos of Orlando much more appealing. "
15th April 2018,2,"""Suggest to fly into Orlando""","✅ Trip Verified |  Have been flying in and out of TPA for 15+ years. The experience was always a pleasant one. After landing, take the tram to the luggage area, get you bags, cross the street and pick up your rental car. The current set-up requires that after bag pick up - drag your luggage across the room, take an escalator up for 3 flights, drag your luggage to another tram,  ride a run away twisting bumping tram for at least 5 minutes to the car rental counters (at least 2 stops on the tram), drag your luggage to the rental counter, take the escalator down 2-3 flights, drag your luggage to another rental car counter to get the car keys, and finally drag your luggage to the car. This entire process took over 1:30 hours. My 1,000 mile flight from Newark to Tampa took 2:21 hours, my 5 mile track to the car rental took 1:30 hours. Suggest for future flights is to fly into Orlando and drive the 1 .5 hours from Orlando to Tampa"
4th April 2018,1,"""a total disaster in terms of customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been traveling through this airport since the early 1980's. The airport was clearly well designed from the start with a central hub supporting multiple airsides via automated trams. The system worked and worked well for many years. After 911, the main long term parking terminal was closed and a remote long term parking garage was built away from the main terminal. It wasn't a great solution, but the shuttle buses ran quickly and delivered you right to the correct airside. Later, the original long term parking area was reopened with increased pricing. The new remote site was renamed ""economy parking"", though at $10 per day it was hardly economy. But that price was better than the $18 per day of the reopened long term garage. So, for many years I would park in the economy garage then ride the shuttle to the main terminal. From there I would check-in at curbside and take the tram over to my airside. Recently the airport has undergone major revisions which include a monorail system that joins the economy garage to the main terminal. Also, a new centralized car rental facility has been built which is next to the economy garage and also served by the monorail. The result is a total disaster in terms of customer service. I don't know who designed this mess, but I can tell they have no idea how to move people through an airport facility. First you must find parking in the economy garage, which isn't easy because the space inventory system is now broken. There used to be signs that would tell you how many spaces were on each floor. Apparently the new construction broke that system, so good luck finding a space. Next you have to take the elevator down to the first floor, even though the monorail is located on the 4th floor. Then, you drag your luggage to the middle of the garage road and jump on the moving floor system. Yes, they mounted the moving floor in the middle of the garage's shuttle roadway. Not on the sidewalk (where they have plenty of room), but right in the lowest part of the garage where surely the Florida rains will short circuit the machinery. The moving floor thing will slowly take you to the opposite side of the garage where a new elevator systems has been installed. Where next? No problem in deciding, there are only 2 floors to select. So now you go back up to the 4th floor to wait for the monorail. And wait, and wait. There appear to be only two trains and one was broken. Once on the train, prepare for a wild ride. First the train drops 4 floors and accelerates as it follows the access road to the main terminal. People and luggage fly about as the train dips and weaves at high speed. I'm sure injuries have already occurred due to this new system. As it approaches the main terminal, the train climbs quickly and stops abruptly at the station. If you've survived this far, you must now drag your luggage to the escalator for a trip down 3 floors. Now good luck finding your airline counter. If you're flying Southwest then you're in luck, it's the first one you find. Other airlines are scattered around and the signage isn't so good. Prepare for a lot of wandering around. Once you check-in, you now ride another escalator up and find that you are nowhere near your airside tram station. So, more walking to find the correct station and ride the tram over to your airside. In my case, the airside has been redesigned (which means less space and more expensive restaurants)."
10th March 2018,7,"""Much better before remodel""",✅ Trip Verified | Not enough places to eat. Much better before remodel. Lines are extremely long. Food and drinks expensive. $20 for a glass of house wine? This was in terminal C. Not sure what the other terminals are like. No complaints about the rest of the airport.
26th January 2018,6,"""it used to be a great experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been flying in and out of Tampa for years and it used to be a great experience. The checking in and screening process are better than at most airports I know. One of the features of the airport I always enjoyed, was the availability of good restaurants, both in the terminal, before screening, and at the gate area. Last year the airport started to ""remodel"" the terminal and all of these nice restaurants were gone. I figured they would be back after the construction was over, but not only are they still doing construction a year later, the nice restaurants are gone, even in the gate area, and all they now offer is Chinese and fast food. They destroyed the whole pre-boarding experience, especially since you have to come to the airport early for your flight. The only place you can get a decent meal now, is in the airport hotel Marriott restaurant."
11th April 2016,10,"""stress-free environment""","Best airport we have been to. Stress-free environment, easy to maneuver, people are friendly and helpful. Lots of seating, clean, quiet. Very smart of Tampa to put smoking areas after security checkpoints. Smokers can go through security early, find their gates and go for a smoke instead of waiting until the last minute to try and get through security. It also alleviates stress and irritable passengers if flights are delayed, etc. It is such a simple solution to create a win-win for smokers, non-smokers, and employees alike. It does not affect non-smokers at all, and instead creates a calmer environment. Good for you Tampa."
18th November 2015,7,"""clean and good variety of shops""","BA2166, Tampa International - London Gatwick, Monday 16 November. Been quite a few years since I last used this airport - no queues at BA check in and through security in 5 minutes. Clean and good variety of shops and eateries landside. Looked ok airside but did not shop as used the International Lounge for BA customers. This was a disappointment - comfortable seats but food selection dreadful - a few curled up sandwiches that were not replenished and a few crackers and pieces of cheese with dips. Poor choice of wine. Not acceptable, Tampa, but from what I read no different from other North American Lounges. Apart from the lounge will use Tampa again certainly better than Miami, Washington Dulles, Newark, Chicago etc."
10th October 2015,5,"""lack of any compassion""","Tampa International is a great airport and we have travel on a yearly basis from the UK. Now we have a small child we have noticed that there is a lack of any compassion when going through security to get to our gate. We were not offered a expedited queue even thought we had a lot of baggage and had a distressed child (2 years). There were three security lines two for those in economy and one for first class whilst we were waiting in line for nearly 20 minutes (not that bad I know but its different with children). Families need extra time to get all the food out ready and additionally my wife was chosen for an invasive pat down. The priority queue only saw a max of 8 passengers with staff looking around but noticing our frustrations. Hope this changes as we won't be back again unless Tampa is truly a family airport, it is not at current."
6th October 2015,8,"""well maintained and clean airport""",Well maintained and clean airport. Going thru security check and baggage claim is fast and easy. Signage is clear and easy to use. They have many in terminal rental cars companies. Restaurants are decent.
24th September 2015,10,"""a well designed airport""","Tampa Airport is a well designed airport. The circular design made it easy to pass through the TSA checks, and for an easy trip to the departure gates. After a month traveling through Reagan, Dulles, O'Hare, and MSP, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Well maintained, and signage was in abundance. The rental car areas were close, and well marked. A less stressfull airport environment."
20th March 2015,10,Tampa Airport customer review,I have flown in and out of TPA for the last 10 yrs. No questions it is a superb airport to travel through. I will continue to use it as my airport of choice with no problem. With respect to the gentleman in Feb 2015 who was looking for an easy way to pick up his wife use the car park they don't charge for the first hour!
24th February 2015,6,Tampa Airport customer review,The picking up of arriving passengers has severely degraded over the years. You'd think after years of inefficiency that they could come up with a solution. I didn't use to have to park or drive around in circles for five or ten minutes to pick up my wife. Lighting for driving in circles sucks for me also because of poor lighting for a senior and confusing outdated signs. Don't even get me started on airport security. I gave up flying years ago. Last time I went quite a while back I wore a t-shirt shorts (no belt) and sandals with no luggage or carry on and still had to endure the long lines and wait. Why does someone like that have to wait behind a women with a huge loaded purse and a carry on. Where's the express lane? I'd rather drive a car.
20th July 2014,9,Tampa Airport customer review,Not a large airport which is a good thing. Staff seem friendly and efficient. They were getting people through immigration pretty quickly although I was held for about 30-45 mins because of some problem with my fingerprints but I guess this doesn't always happen. Catch the shuttle to the terminal and the car rental offices are just a short walk away - we were soon heading south on I-275. Two things to note - not many shops airside and Club Lounge is not very big. Would thoroughly recommend as gateway airport.
18th June 2014,10,Tampa Airport customer review,After coming to the US some 30 or 40 times we decided to use Tampa as our start off point having tried Boston JFK Washington Philly and Atlanta. What a pleasant surprise the immigration staff were pleasant and even used my first name when asking how long we were staying. Being new to the airport we asked directions from the Customs staff and they were very helpful. The airport is not as overcrowded as most and works quickly and efficiently with limited waiting times. We will use Tampa as a gateway again.
27th May 2014,7,Tampa Airport customer review,Arriving at Tampa. Found the immigration polite but business like as I was one of the first of the plane no major lines waiting. Hertz rental at airport walked and picked car at car park. Out of airport in half hour at most. Departing hertz rental drop of at airport needed a trolley had to pay $5 or get a porter for same price. Previous reviewer said it was free at lounge. That is not accurate as they charge $5 through out the airport. Very disappointing. Departure very close to car park. Going to the gate have to pass through another set of security who insist you are not allowed more then two carry on bags. I always thought it was at the discretion of the airline as to how much carry on you could take. As well as paying $5 for trolley this is another first for me and I have been to many airports. At gate you have to go through another security for screening body scanner indicated I had something in my pocket. This was true as I had some $ notes. Security official response was 'when we say remove everything from your pocket we mean everything'. Initially I thought he was joking but as it turns out he was very serious. At gate there were 3-4 food outlets that were ludicrously expensive. $4 for bottle water. There were water fountains available and free internet. Both welcomed. Lounges for BA not fantastic. Overall airport easy to get into and out of clean throughout and not overcrowded. Have to say disappointed with the $5 charge for trolley as I landed at Heathrow and paid nothing. And the over zealous screening security.
5th May 2014,10,Tampa Airport customer review,Great airport. Friendly staff. Easy to navigate. Speedy immigration security and baggage reclaim. Very pleasant experience.
13th April 2014,10,Tampa Airport customer review,Travel would be enhanced if all airports were designed and operated like TPA. Excellent location bar all major highways great signage easy to navigate indoors where distances are short friendly staff frequent rail shuttles to gates. Furthermore good selection of amenities: eateries shops info. In short a model travel processing facility.
3rd January 2014,10,Tampa Airport customer review,"TPA is nearly the ideal design for an airport. Access is by freeway and freeways take you to all regional cities (Tampa St. Petersburg and Clearwater). The main building (""landside"") is in the center with four ""airside"" buildings where the gates are located connected to the center building by automated people mover. Check-in et al is convenient. Parking is free. Luggage wait times are minimal. Car rental access is a short walk from luggage facilities."
17th December 2013,10,Tampa Airport customer review,TPA totally outshines the rest in the hospitality and functionality categories. It's also bright and airy has many good choices and easy to navigate. The atmosphere is so upbeat and friendly even at security control points.
5th December 2013,10,Tampa Airport customer review,Efficiency with a capital E! I have travelled to this airport for 25 years or so and even though it has got busier and bigger it still manages to run efficiently. On arrival my flight announced that it would take 20 mins before bags would arrive on the carousel. I exited the aircraft among the first few passengers and was at the carousel in about 15 mins and the bags were already going around including my own bag. On my return to Canada on Nov 12th the airport was again very busy but I was checked in quickly and took the tram over to airside and lined up for security clearance. Line up looked long but it moved and I was through in about 10 mins. I wish I could say I had as good an airport experience in Toronto later that day. Even though Tampa airport was busy employees both airline retail staff security all were friendly and efficient. Top marks from me.
29th November 2013,10,Tampa Airport customer review,Tampa is a great airport away from the hustle and bustle of Orlando it is a much more relaxed atmosphere and is now my choice of airport for travelling to Florida. We were on the back row of a B777 and still only had to wait 45 mins at immigration. Staff were polite and friendly. Bags were waiting once we got through. Car hire is available immediately as you step outside the airport. The only downside is on the return they charge $5 per trolley (non-refundable) in the hire car drop off area. I took a walk into the terminal over the road picked up three trolleys and saved ourselves Â£15!! Check in areas are spacious and there are enough shops / restaurants to keep you entertained for a couple of hours. The gates are located in remote terminal buildings each one having it's own security screening which minimises the queue to get through security.
5th May 2013,9,Tampa Airport customer review,Very nice airport. Check in (United) in 2 minutes. Controls in 3 minutes. Nice shops and restaurants. It looks clean and well arranged. Car rental parking and return just next to airport (1 minutes walking). On of the best airport I've seen.
13th December 2012,10,Tampa Airport customer review,First time using Tampa. I have to say I really like the layout. Main terminal is 3 levels. lower baggage and transport 2nd is ticketing and 3rd is loads of shops eating establishments etc. Marriot connects via a walkway with shops. Trains take you out to 5 different terminals. Once you get to terminal each terminal has its own individual security so not very crowded and went smoothly. Also plenty in each terminal as well. Very nice airport overall.
14th October 2012,8,Tampa Airport customer review,Tampa is a gem amongst airports. Clean free Wifi not crowded and easy to transit through. Apart from the arrival procedures! US Immigration take the cake for slowness fingerprinting photographs and not enough desks manned and we were the only international flight going through. It really took the enjoyment off the arrival after a 9 hour flight. But the rest of the airport was fine security staff were pleasant everybody except for the comment above seemed to be committed to making the experience enjoyable.
22nd May 2012,9,Tampa Airport customer review,Very bright open clean and easy to find gates. Terminals are well organized and TSA does not take very long. Plenty of shops and restaurants. Easy to get to downtown or elsewhere in Tampa/St. Petersburg area.
1st July 2011,5,Tampa Airport customer review,I read another review of this airport and it said it is a hidden gem. It is. Car rentals on the first floor. Taxiing to the gate was quick. Navigating through the airport was easy as there are signs everywhere which proved to be very organized. The terminals and bathrooms were very clean. Security can be rough but once in the terminal there are loads of shops and places to grab a bite to eat. Great airport.
29th May 2011,5,Tampa Airport customer review,Taxi to gate is a short ride customs quick and friendly baggage arrived rapidly. Even the security on departure friendly and plenty of food outlets. I initially chose TPA because they did not have many international flights coming in. Hence should be a quick procedure through immigrations. It proved to be just the case. I once had a horrible experience at MIA when three international flights arrived at the same time. It took nearly four hours to pass immigration to add to that the staff were surly.
16th April 2011,5,Tampa Airport customer review,I've flown in and out of Tampa International Airport several times going to and from Ottawa Ont. and am always impressed by the organization speed and friendliness of staff. For a large busy airport it is extremely well organized and easy to move through. From parking to check in and boarding it's a lovely experience. There's a wide variety of restaurants and enough boutiques to keep one occupied during pre boarding waits.
18th September 2010,5,Tampa Airport customer review,Tampa is a lovely airport bright and spacious pleasant staff decent places to eat and drink and no fuss picking up and dropping off our bags and collecting and returning our hire car. It has to rank as probably the best airport I have used in the US. It is just a pity that you have to fly from the UK to a connecting airport in the US to get there as it only has one flight a day from Gatwick with BA which isn't always very suitable to those living outside London.
1st March 2010,5,Tampa Airport customer review,My first encounter with Tampa International was 1987 before 911. Tampa International is my home airport which I fly out of several times a year domestically and internationally since 1995. After 911 Tampa was the only airport that wasn't scrambling with the new security measures since they already had many of them in place. As a result their treatment of passengers was very even handed and fair. The airport is a lot bigger than it appears. But because it's designed on a hub system with rays branching out to the individual terminals connected by trams it's easy to get to any of the airsides within a very reasonable amount of time without running your butt off. I've been in airports where I had to run a couple miles on a 20 minute connection to skid into the gate to be the last one to get on the plane. It's difficult to get lost in this airport because of the hub system the clear large and well placed signs and the logical layout. I've been in airports where there are no signs or the signs indicate a straight path when in fact the route is on a hairpin curve up a staircase where the missing sign is hidden out of sight or there's a blank wall where the sign indicates a clear pathway. Also if you are dropped off on or have driven to the wrong side of the main terminal all you have to do is either walk across the building inside to the other side or go to the end of the building and drive around to the other side. Tampa is also a pleasant place to wait. I've done a lot of waiting for my husband to get off work after my flight gets in. Tampa did a major renovation a few years back and improved a lot of areas in the terminal. TSA have their problems no matter where you may fly. However this is one of the few airports where I've often seen the security agents try to make the situation a lot easier for us by being kind and careful with the security checks and some of them also use humor. This is also one of the few airports where the security explained to me what they were doing and why. (The other was Brussels Airport when they were using me as a training guinea pig while I becoming late for my plane.) A lot of them are pleasant and smiling. And not a one of them has ever treated me inappropriately.
8th November 2009,5,Tampa Airport customer review,My wife and I usually vacation in FLA once a year and try to use TPA as our USA gateway. We have travelled all over the world and Tampa International is leaps and bounds above other airports we have flown to. Friendly staff rapid check in great food and drink good shops and even at peak times you can find a seat.
10th March 2009,5,Tampa Airport customer review,My favorite airport. They even do a better job with getting you through security (the TSA still leaves a lot to be desired but the check points occurring airside limits the long waits). Easy to drop off rental car and then go directly to plane no bus involved. The airport is also centrally located. Downtown Tampa is close by as well as bridges to Clearwater and St. Pete.
22nd December 2008,5,Tampa Airport customer review,As a regular visitor to Florida Tampa is my favourite airport to fly in and out of only BA fly here direct from the UK and it is a shame more UK carriers dont. Clearing immigration customs and picking up luggage with minimum delay unlike Orlando or Miami airports also car rental facilities are good and exiting the airport is easy on the Interstate. Facilities are good to with first class shops restaurants and bars only one annoyance why you have to show ID to buy an alcoholic drink even though you are obviously over 21.
13th December 2008,5,Tampa Airport customer review,Tampa Airport was a hidden beauty!! Very big clean and welcoming airport. With friendly staffs and countless amount of stores restaurants and seating. We arrived from JFK and the arrival was smooth. The arrival lobby was huge! When we departed security was fast with friendly smiles. Lots of restaurants in the departure lounges. Can't believe that only 1 european flight operates in Tampa. Tampa Airport is comparable to Singapore Changi and Hong Kong Airport as well as other 5 stars airport however Tampa is not really a big city.
9th November 2008,5,Tampa Airport customer review,This has been my home airport for five years and TPA is a dream and a gem of a US airport. Very efficient friendly staff well-planned and simple to maneuver easy parking close to downtown Tampa decent non-stop access. Only small complaint are the food options in the terminals -- if you have a decent amount of time for a layover I'd suggest going to the main terminal for better options as security is (almost always) a breeze. Rarely have I spent more than 10 minutes getting through security. Why oh why wouldn't some US airline make TPA a hub or some European carrier expand here (we still only have the one BA flight for international along with some Mexican/Caribbean/Canadian flights).
8th October 2008,5,Tampa Airport customer review,Excellent airport - bright clean and well-signed. Major renovations have been done over the past few years and all of the cramped old airsides have been replaced. Security lines may get a bit long during peak periods but TSA staff is very efficient and they keep lines moving.
21st July 2008,4,Tampa Airport customer review,Would endorse the 'hidden gem' comment about this airport. Couldl not believe how nice it was especially compared to other US airports. Was just in transit so did not have to use check-in procedures but the airport was extremely pleasant during my waiting time. It looked as though there were good food options and the atmosphere of the whole place was airy bright and welcoming.
31st March 2008,5,Tampa Airport customer review,Tampa International was a pleasure. Very efficient sign-posting both inside and outside terminal building. Immigration was a breeze through in no time. In taxi with bags within 35 minutes of landing. Departure was similar. Slight queue at check-in due I think to difficulties with previous traveller. Security was swift with smiling staff! International Club Lounge very pleasant with lovely friendly staff. At the departure gate we purchased some last-minute duty free items. We paid and were advised that our items would be waiting at the gate for us. We wondered how as the gate was less than 30 yards away and we were priority boarding i.e. immediately. But true enough. I don't know how they managed it but the items were there waiting for us! Excellent service.
27th March 2008,4,Tampa Airport customer review,This is an efficient and reliable US airport I actually enjoy going back to. The atmosphere is very relaxed and laid back. People are friendly. In addition Airport management obviously cares for the details as evidenced by such new amenities as free WIFI or a parking lot with arrival displays for cars waiting to pick up passengers. The only pity is that there is only one single international flight to Europe (on BA to Gatwick with spotty transfer efficiency and choices in Gatwick). I think that this hidden gem of an US airports would deserve more international traffic to Europe and could become an alternative for those wanting to avoid the other airports on the US East Coast. How about direct flights to Zurich or Munich. Both offer many onward connections and are far less crowded and overloaded than say London Frankfurt or Paris.
19th April 2007,n/a,Tampa Airport customer review,Arrived here for an Easter break with my family on the excellent BA service from London Gatwick. While we stood in line for immigration a charming gentleman walked along the line to check passengers' visa waiver forms which seems like a good idea to avoid problems at the desk. When he spotted that both our children have microchipped passports he directed us to special (short) lines for these thereby bypassing the main wait. We were then further taken directly through the US citizens' line since there was no-one else there and processed by a very cheerful and pleasant officer. With all the bad stuff that one reads about the treatment of visitors at some US airports it's great to report that TPA manages courtesy and efficiency. I can't beat Nick Jones' time but 40 minutes from the full 777 arriving at the gate to our leaving the airport is still pretty impressive. Our return journey was equally smooth - full marks to TPA a fine airport that we will choose to use if at all possible.
3rd April 2007,n/a,Tampa Airport customer review,We flew into TPA on 6 March 2008 from UK. What a pleasant change after putting up with the horrors of MIA for many years. The immigration staff were pleasant and welcoming the luggage arrived in no time and we were driving away in our rental car within 30 minutes of landing. Our departure was equally painless with very easy check in and no delays through security. Well done to all at TPA we'll be back in 2008.
2nd August 2006,n/a,Tampa Airport customer review,Tampa used to be a great airport but it has declined rapidly in the past 10 years. Congestion in the parking areas and drop off/pick up is horrible. There are almost no international flights. The food quality near the gates is way below the standard of other airports. The bathrooms have not been updated in 20 years and are usually wet and dirty. Also because of the increased number of flights the red/blue system hardly works anymore and you usually have to walk a long long way. The tram system works fine when they have both trams running but they often don't. That causes long delays. Seems like Tampa airport managers are asleep at the wheel.
7th April 2006,n/a,Tampa Airport customer review,TPA is one of the better airports in the US but am I the only person annoyed by the blaring rock music on their PA system? I had time to kill before a recent flight and I found the noise pollution to be overwhelming. Though a non-smoker myself I tried to take refuge in an outdoor smoking area near my gate and there were loudspeakers there too! I wish they would turn down the volume or better yet turn off the music altogether.
29th December 2021,4,"""I’ve defiantly seen better""","✅ Trip Verified | The C gates shops/restaurants offered very little to no vegan food options. I always eat a fruit or veggie tray when I fly but this was not available here. The bathrooms and gate area floors were dirty, anywhere that sold food had a very long line because multiple shops/stalls were closed. Headphones I was looking to purchase were marked for $149 here when on Amazon they are selling for $89. Not my worst airport experience but I’ve defiantly seen better."
14th December 2021,3,"""I have to say it was the only time it was this bad""","✅ Trip Verified | I was stopped for ""random"" search. The palm swipes rejected and had to call woman for ""body search"" (outside of clothes search). It took 20 minutes to get a woman over there and no one was explaining anything. So you are sitting there barefooted, no sweater, purse, phone, etc. as every single person goes by you. Very degrading. It was a little odd also that 2 more women my age (behind me about 10 people in line) as well was also stopped. They must have passed the palm swipe. I have been in this airport for 20 years and I have to say it was the only time it was this bad. It was the employees I encountered."
21st September 2021,1,"""Where is the consistency?""","✅ Trip Verified | While going through TSA they took my scissors. Tiny scissors I had had for years, that I was specifically told to buy for TSA approval. I crochet on planes as a stress/anxiety relief/distraction. These scissors have literally made it through years of TSA agents. From LAX to O'Hare, from PDX to LGB, JFK to McCarran.. Every other airport and TSA has either said nothing at all, or said they were fine. But for some reason St. Louis said they were not allowed? Where is the consistency?"
18th September 2021,1,"""It seemed to be more about harassing the customers than safety anymore""","✅ Trip Verified | I checked a bag for my flight home and the guy at the counter handed me my claim ticket, no smile, no gate info, no “thank you” or “have a good flight”. So I looked at my phone to see my boarding pass with the gate #, and he angrily said “go”! I thought maybe somebody had come and was waiting, but nobody was behind me. I just said “thank you for your help”. Then I get to security. The lady who checked my boarding pass and ID was nice compared to the baggage check staff member and the grumpy one pushing bags into the X ray machine. She had something nasty to say about everyone ahead of me as she tuned to put the trays back. A man 2 people in front of me got reprimanded for not pushing his stuff through. “That is your responsibility sir, not mine”, then she muttered “idiot” as she turned to put a tray back. The lady in front of me put her backpack in a tray and she pulled it out, yelled something at her, and said “what is wrong with you people, you got a bag you put it on with no tray! Sheeesh”. I put my bag on the rollers—and she grabbed a tray to put it in to send through. Then she told me to go to the line for the X-ray (of me), where I was asked to remove my shoes, my glasses, my Fitbit, my necklace (not an easy task with arthritis, but not only would nobody help, they were really impatient with the time it took me to get it off) and my scarf. I have never been asked to remove that much before as I have TSA precheck (they have you carry a card to let TSA know, but they took it away with my shoes so I didn’t have it for every time I had to take another piece of clothing off, but it’s but it didn’t matter to them.). They complained that I didn’t get out of the way fast enough when I had to go back. It seemed to be more about harassing the customers than safety anymore. Anyway, I have more to say, but I need to get home and at least my flight is on time. Just don’t go here if you don’t have to!"
14th April 2021,1,"""She was a very intentionally mean person""","Not Verified |  TSA female employee found that an item I was hand carrying could not go through. I explained that I had just purchased the item and the box was not yet open. It was a snow globe from Cracker Barrel and the liquid was causing a problem. She told me to unpack some things and repack the box into my largest bag then check it through. As my husband and I started to do this she became very rude, telling us that her station was closed and that we had to immediately remove the bags. When I asked her where we were supposed to go, she picked up the suitcase and dropped it onto a green bench. When my husband zipped it shut she grabbed the bag and walked off. I followed and she dropped it just outside of the Security area and stormed off. I took it to baggage check and came back through Security where thank goodness she ignored me. She was a very intentionally mean person and offered no explanations. Maybe she assumed that we all check bags through but I don't and had no plans to."
25th June 2020,6,"""has anyone else had the same experience?""","Not Verified |  Recently I took a trip where we flew to Austin TX, on the return trip to St Louis our bags, which usually take a while to come out took an exceedingly long time to come out this time, over a half hour. Then, when they came out and we picked up our luggage at the bag return the pull handles on both mine and my wife's luggage had some kind of goop on them, smelled like green apple. I smelled this in the bag return area before we got our bags too, has anyone else traveled and had the same experience? It was weird and it's bothering me! Is this some sort of TSA thing?"
31st January 2020,1,"""Rude and inefficient""","✅ Trip Verified | Rude and inefficient - counter attendant with Delta told us we each needed to hand her our own ID and boarding pass so she wouldn’t get confused and sent our luggage to the wrong destination. She then proceeded to give my ID and boarding pass to another passenger. Dirty and incompetent - restaurant (Starbucks), I ordered a lower temp coffee and it was made even hotter than normal - I couldn’t hold it in my bare hand even with a cup sleeve. Toilet cleaning staff was just rude - she is standing outside bathroom - three toilets in bathroom and none had been flushed, tissue on floor. I walk in, flush toilet, take care of business and flush. When I walk out of stall she is waiting to go in. She grumbles and flushes toilet and sprays down stall and then walks out and leaves other stalls dirty."
29th October 2019,1,"""refused me to get back in line with my husband""","✅ Trip Verified | A non descriptive woman, not clearly a TSA associate was monitoring the security line. I stepped back to hug my parents goodbye and she rudely refused me to get back in line with my husband who had my bag. She was extra loud and seemed to abuse her power while I had tears in my eyes. She was overly disrespectful to me and my family. I'm looking for a way to get in touch with her supervisor. Unfortunately, she was not wearing a name tag, she was not TSA. Thank goodness for options in other airports. I don't want to be treated like that again."
20th July 2019,1,"""Very bad experience""","Not Verified |  Incredibly rude TSA agent—I went through the TSA check line, my baggage had to be checked, but was held back for items to be checked. The agent spoke to me like I was dirt under her feet, then took her time searching through my bag—taking out each piece of underwear and opening all container—being slow on purpose. Very bad experience. I was here for my dad’s funeral and she handled the items I had from his home poorly. Glad I won’t ever have to go back through this airport ever again."
14th June 2019,1,"""rude uncourteous behaviour""",✅ Trip Verified | The TSA review process is haphazard and not very kind. The agents scold the passengers and talk to them like they are cattle. Manhandling people and their luggage. Very rude uncourteous behavior.
3rd January 2019,1,"""irritate their customers with noise""",Not Verified |  This airport is extremely annoying because they blast the volume of network television through speakers constantly. Don't they know that some commuters are tired and that airports are already noisy? Don't they know that air travel is expensive? It seems that they are wasting money on electricity to irritate their customers with noise. It's part of the reason your ticket was so expensive: this blatant waste of money. I even asked a handful of employees about it. All of them agreed that the TV noise is a constant stressful nuisance and a detriment to their focus and ability to do their jobs and stay alert. Whoever off on this should be terminated. It's so obviously ridiculous and stupid as to be unforgivable.
4th October 2018,1,"""very upset and disappointed""
","✅ Trip Verified | TSA stopped me and my husband for the amount of 3 oz bottles in my husbands carry on bag. They told him he could not take the 3 oz. bottle of shampoo and conditioner (which was mine) through security, meaning it would have to be thrown away. Now, that's not what makes me most mad, I was most upset because the TSA agent snatched it out of my hand when I asked if I could put it in my bag, or whether he wanted me to throw it away. This was such a rude and ignorant gesture. The agent could've given us an alternative or been a little nicer when handling the issue. He was treating us terribly, when in fact, we are a military family traveling for leisure. I'm very upset and disappointed with St. Louis!"
2nd October 2018,6,"""lack of decent food options""
","Not Verified |    I like this airport. It's very clean and has friendly people. But it's really dragged down by the lack of decent food options in concourse C. With flights not serving meals, a traveler can come into the airport famished, with a short layover, and there's nothing. The only place to get a decent comfortable table is Chili's and the food there is simply awful. Plus the staff seem to find the back row of tables by the work station a great place to hang out and share raucous jokes. With five or six of them going at it on my last trip, you could hear them all down the concourse. Trying to pass a quiet hour with my laptop was wrecked by the noise, like being next to a tailgate party. And here's some feedback for the Chili's people. When I was there none of the shouting parties were watching the tables while we customers were craning our necks trying to get menus or drinks or whatever. I couldn't figure out why there were so many employees doing nothing except having fun in mid afternoon when there were very few customers, the cooks were making the food and the bartender was handling the bar. Just one waiter finally started handling tables and while he was very nice he forgot my silverware and water - separate trips for both - and seemed shaky on the whole process. The manager, whom I met briefly, seemed to have no clue that a restaurant, even Chili's, is supposed to serve customers, not double as a social club for staff. As a former restaurant owner, I ranked him as worthless. Anyway, we desperately need a pleasant place to sit with at least decent food that's not just tasteless Chili's fare, liquids, bready pre-made sandwiches or sugary pastries."
1st October 2018,1,"""behind the times""","Not Verified |  TSA at St Louis airport is behind the times. I have flown through many airports and TSA precheck barely applies. This used to be a great airport, but now I will only fly out when absolutley necessary. Laptops in carry ons? Seems to be at the agents discretion, and he is stuck in September 12, 2001."
11th April 2018,10,"""really appreciated her help""","✅ Trip Verified |  Alyce was working in United baggage customer service when I landed in St. Louis with the rest of the Arkansas softball group. United left 11 of our bags at Washington Dulles airport and I needed to file a claim for the missing luggage. Alyce was very patient, kind and helpful in making the claims (we had two reservations) for our group. We were able to retrieve the missing luggage later that night and she helped myself and our charter bus driver load the bags on the luggage cart. Additionally, I lost my wallet between Washington Dulles and United Flight 4749 to STL. When I told her she was willing to help me retrieve it any way possible. She called the hanger to see if it was left on the plane and even found the number for the lost and found at Washington Dulles airport. Although I have not found my wallet, I really appreciated her help."
15th February 2018,1,"""This is just ridiculous""
","❎ Not Verified |  TSA agents need additional training. I told them that I had a knee replacement and have a titanium knee. Instead of having me go through the X-ray, the agent sent me through the walk in which resulted in me being patted down and almost missing my flight to Seattle. This is just ridiculous. They took their time with the pat down and acted like they didn’t care. Just rude and insensitive. Not sure that I will visiting this place again."
8th February 2018,4,"""It feels like a money grab""","❎ Not Verified |  Every other airport offers free WiFi, providing one hour before starting to charge is very poor service. This is not customer friendly and pales considerably when compared to other airports. It feels like a money grab when everything else is already overpriced."
28th September 2017,1,"""very bad PR work""","❎ Unverified | I pulled up to pick up some passengers and did not know where to go. So I then asked security staff at the airport where I should go and the security guard started yelling at me to move the car. I asked him several times that I did not know where to go and he kept yelling at me to move my car. A Saint Louis police officer then approached and started yelling that I need to move or leave the airport. I asked the St Louis police if he could help me and show me where to park, he then yelled saying move your car or we will tow it. As I was leaving the area I noticed the security guard yelling at other people visiting the area. I will not return to this airport, very bad PR work for the Airport."
25th July 2017,2,"""time to update your fountains""","❎ Unverified |  I travelled from STL at 4.45 on Thursday, 7/20 to DTW, Gate A2. Please note that the temperature outside when we arrived at the airport was 100+. I brought a bottle to refill with water. Both drinking fountains near the gate were inoperable. I walked further down the terminal and came to 4 other drinking fountains. Nothing but a dribble came out. It was hard enough to get a sip of water but was impossible to fill up a bottle. This is ridiculous and leads me to believe you are forcing me to spend $3 on a bottle of water. It is time to update your fountains, first with ones that work and secondly with the bottle fillers that are offered in most 21st century airports. Secondly, the men's room near gate A2 had 4 soap dispensers none of which had any soap. These issues don't reflect the airport or the city of St Louis in a very good light."
16th May 2017,5,"""food options are still lacking""","St Louis has gotten better but food options are still lacking - especially for breakfast. Especially in terminal 2. Basically just dunkin doughnuts, pastries and burger king. There is a chili's if you like cafeteria quality. Starbucks line is usually over 40 people due to dearth of options. Parking is cheaper than average compared to many other airports but close to average. Security is average. Which is to say slow and inefficient. Bathrooms are a weak point at STL. Not enough facilities and typically have wait times at all men's bathrooms (if you travel during weekday mornings) Baggage claim is among slowest in the country. Facilities are fairly clean. Seating is almost adequate is call it average. Overall a little below average nationally in my opinion but better than any other airport in Missouri (admittedly a lie hurdle)."
14th March 2016,7,"""plenty of dining and shopping""","This review is for Terminal 2 at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. STL serves as a connecting center for Southwest Airlines, and serves a good number of local travelers as well. The security lines always seem long in the mornings but they do move fairly quickly, I was in line for about 15-20 minutes. No problems. The terminal post-security is decent sized although seating at some of the gates is on the light side so some people were standing. I managed to get a seat at one of the freestanding bar stool areas, but would have preferred a seat with a back. Plenty of dining and shopping options for those so inclined."
16th February 2016,5,"""personnel are friendly and helpful""","Overall I like the Lambert-St. Louis airport. Before I begin I should mention that I generally fly Southwest so this may be more directed towards that terminal. First, the positives. I've never had an unreasonable flight problem/delay during an arrival or departure from this airport. So the air traffic seems to be very efficient. The airport personnel are friendly and helpful. The layout is nice and it's easy to get to restaurants, coffee shops, and rest rooms. Security seems on par with most other airport security so while nothing special, I've not experienced an unusual problem. Second, the negatives. The only real serious negative I've found is their WiFi is simply horrible. To start, it's Boingo which I've found below par at most airports that use this provider. At Lambert, it's so weak and spotty it's essentially non-existent. Why is it serious? Because I'm usually flying on a work-related trip and not having good airport WiFi is a problem. Sure, I can use data from my Verizon account. But I can also try to fly through airports that don't have WiFi problem that this serious. The only other more moderate negative is the lack of electrical outlets at the gate seating areas. So overall, if you're traveling for pleasure, or don't rely on WiFi while in a airport, Lambert Field in St. Louis is a nice airport to fly through. On the other hand, if you count on airport WiFi, I'd avoid this one if possible."
29th December 2015,3,"""allow 3 hours+ to check a bag""",Allow 3 hours+ to check a bag and get through security. Arrived at 3.30am for a 5.55 flight. TSA did not open security till 4.30am and then it was only one line. Already 200 people in line waiting when they opened. Did not open 2nd line until 5.30am. People running through airport in their socks and holding up their pants carting their shoes and belts. Flight was 30 minutes late to take off because of TSA.
18th June 2015,8,St Louis Airport customer review,"Of the Missouri airports, STL is superior to the rest! The airport has been recently renovated, and I think the improvements have definitely created an added value. Lots of good restaurants (both local places and national chains), and terminal has definitely benefited from the increased lighting. I think the airport still struggles with the American / TWA fiasco, but is working hard to be better."
4th June 2014,7,St Louis Airport customer review,Had a 1 hour layover in Terminal 2 here. You can tell there's been a lot of upgrades as it's a lot brighter and cleaner than it used to be. Plenty of restaurants options but surprisingly no fast food options which I would have needed for a shorter layover. A number of gates are unused since American pulled back. One thing I really liked was the number of power outlets available at gates. Every 4 seats there was a power station with 3 regular outlets and 2 USB outlets to charge phones computers tablets etc.
10th May 2013,8,St Louis Airport customer review,When held in its proper context of a medium-sized Midwestern city airport Lambert meets or exceeds expectations. An F4 tornado struck the main terminal (now known as Terminal 1) two years ago and it has taken a while for the terminal to get back on its feet. The proof of the rebuilding and improvement efforts can be seen in Concourses A and C with sleek modern facilities. The TSA line moved quickly and was managed professionally. The public transportation system known as Metrolink is clean and inexpensive to use. On the whole I used St. Louis Lambert Field three times last month and have nothing bad to say at all. I highly recommend using it.
27th June 2011,1,St Louis Airport customer review,"Lambert has seen better days. Since the ""tornado"" Concourse C is closed D is practically deserted with American flights. The airport is way out of date tired dirty crowded TSA is surly and ""full of themselves"" you can't imagine the arrogance. Prices are as high as LA but the restaurant service is a joke. I wish I could have seen Lambert back in the day now it is just dusty dirty and broken down. Very sad and frustrating place to visit."
27th April 2011,4,St Louis Airport customer review,Used this airport during a day trip to St louis from Chicago. Flew in from O'Hare. Extremely good cheap and quick public transport to St Louis downtown via the Metrolink which has stations in both terminal 1 and 2. The airport has wi-fi but no computer stations so if you don't have a laptop you can't get on the internet. The telephones also seemed rather confusing for making international calls. The airport was undergoing considerable refurbishment and building work when I was there (March 2011) so there was lots of dust and scaffolding in the terminal. The terminal maps were slightly wrong which I assume was due to building work being in the middle of relocating the facilities they pointed to. Good bars and shops selling everything from coffee to TSA approved locks and hand baggage sized shampoos. Friendly staff.
2nd June 2010,4,St Louis Airport customer review,The Saint Louis airport is in the process of being updated with a modern and attractive look. Terminal 1 is an architectually significant structure and it is already looking amazing now that the ceilings are cleaned up and the colorful LED lighting in the skylights adds a beautiful and energizing light show from both inside and outside the terminal. And with new flooring ticket counters new open views to outside and a new atrium opening up to the lower level the terminal will truly be a beautiful building. Add to this a raised brightened ceiling in the lower level new wall coverings colorful LED lighting on the structural columns along with new contemporary signs and a relocated security checkpoint it will be both efficient and appealing.
8th August 2009,4,St Louis Airport customer review,Flew on Southwest so I was in the East terminal. The light rail system is convenient and inexpensive and right outside the terminal (there are 2 airport stops one for the East terminal and one for the main terminal). You do need cash for the train ticket and paying your fare with a $20 bill nets you a lot of $1 coins as change... Security is not bad but when flying WN one realizes that your fellow passengers are not the most experienced travellers and can make security a rather frustrating experience. The Chili's restaurant inside is not very good and line-ups are long at the fast food joints so I recommend arriving having eaten!
12th July 2009,4,St Louis Airport customer review,Small compact and user friendly. Flew from and back to Philly - terminal had flow and the staff was really nice.
25th January 2009,3,St Louis Airport customer review,"As both a St. Louis resident and a former flight attendant I have a unique view of our aging airport. I've walked the entire length of the terminal to pass time on airport reserve. I've been on planes when I had to inform passengers ""sorry the jetbridge is broken today."" And I've also been a passenger myself standing in those long security lines. What St. Louis needs is a new series of gates - designed for the future - with an outlook of hope. St. Louis is not the worn out city depicted by our airport. We have one of the best environments to raise a family with inexpensive housing thriving second-city-suburbs and a revitalized downtown. Crime rates are falling and St. Louis is attracting high-tech business focused in the healthcare industry. No St. Louis doesn't need to be weighed down with an outdated airport. We need to move forward with new concourses built off the existing (and historical) domed entrance. The flaws in St. Louis' airport may appear daunting to passengers but I have seen airports around the world. St. Louis' general scheme is not poor - just the final execution. It's going to take a lot of work but with the right ideas - looking to build anew rather than simply modify - St. Louis can attract passenger and cargo carriers that other cities our size only dream about. Of course my interest in St. Louis is largely personal but I believe there is an opportunity to be made. The new terminal proposal would eliminate the one-side loading capability of the existing structure. In its place would stand three buildings stretched out in front of the ticketing hall. The center concourse will be connected to the ticketing hall by a gradual ramp that eases passengers through security and into the grand entrance to the new terminals - an open space that matches the size of other grand airports such as DTW. The other concourses will be connected by underground hallways and trams to the main concourse. One will serve primarily international flights. The other will allow Southwest to move into a new home. This leaves St. Louis with a separate East Terminal - room for those charter and private flights that are best kept separate from the rest of the traveling public. These improvements sound extreme but for a city that made an Arch for a city that still offers more free activities than anywhere but DC for a city that is our home - nothing is really impossible."
4th September 2008,3,St Louis Airport customer review,Flew into East Terminal (Southwest Airlines). Baggage arrived with in 20 minutes of landing. Took train to downtown St. Louis. Had to walk outside to get train which would have been a problem during the Winter. Train station will not let you purchase 1-way fare; must purchase 2-hour fare for $3.50. Beats paying 40.00 for taxi. No agents at airport train station and could not use credit card to pay for train. Return purchased 1-way fare for 2.00 to airport. Check-in very quick and efficient probably more to terminal being used completely for Southwest Airlines.
29th June 2008,3,St Louis Airport customer review,Not a bad airport though not great either. Security can be unpredictable; it only took about 2 minutes on my trip Wednesday but it took nearly 30 minutes on a previous visit - probably because they only have one checkpoint for each set of gates (A B C etc.). There's also a noticeable lack of food choices in the terminals and the terminals have a rather old depressing look to them. On the plus side taxi times to/from the runway and gates are short since the airport is relatively compact and the light rail (MetroLink) station next door to both the main and east terminals is nice.
19th June 2007,4,St Louis Airport customer review,Lambert International Airport compares favorably with many airports. The main building and concourses are pleasant and not as congested and hectic as many other airports. Public transportation excellent. There is a need for late night information and food services.
19th January 2007,n/a,St Louis Airport customer review,Flew in to St Louis for a few days on business not the best airport in the world had the feel like others had mentioned of being stuck in a bit of a time warp but had no problems. What is great is the metro station which is attached about 4 services an hour and dirt cheap at $4.50 a day travel. Plenty of airport hotels which are good value and very close to the airport. From US outsider point of view found it very strange to see a medium sized airport with what seems only small regional jets using it
27th October 2005,n/a,St Louis Airport customer review,"I grew up transiting Lambert from the mid -70's to this day. Back in 1976 Lambert was a jewel and a great place to be moving through. American Airlines did not take advantage of an airport hub and facilities that could be improved greatly at bargain prices but dismantled the whole thing obviously thinking that DFW and ORD didn't have enough traffic and weren't quite crowded enough. C concourse is not user-friendly has an odor problem and could sure use a decent sit-down restaurant. The good news is that C concourse is now pretty much empty leaving the post-deregulation zoo-like atmosphere behind. A concourse is busier as all the ""other"" airlines gate there. Although they have good service it is crowded at peak times and still has the same odor problem as C concourse. D concourse well what can you say? I long for the days of Ozark's green tails and civil service to their customers. Now D is a ghost town. E councourse is one of the nicest I have ever seen. Southwest hit a home-run here. convenient good parking short walk to the gate short walk to the baggage claim. The only thing missing here is a decent place to eat. The security staff is a joke and an insult to customers. So with Lambert's expansion closing in on tangible results and Southwest's new terminal (which is VERY nice) the airport should be attracting some new business by lowering gate and landing fees. Hopefully this way they can begin to put some money into renovations of those terminals and possibly return to the glory days prior to deregulation."
9th July 2005,n/a,St Louis Airport customer review,"Many of the complaints about Lambert airport (run down facilities dark baggage claim area falling apart parking garage etc.) are true. In terms of facilities it is probably not among the nicest airports in the United States. There have been some recent improvements however. The American terminals have new carpet there's a few new dining options (Chili's Wolfgang Puck etc.) and even some stores (like a Brooks Brothers) that are opening soon. All of this should help! American's service reductions have reduced their gate presence to only the C concourse so making a connection in St. Louis is relatively easy; you typically don't have to deal with the constant gate changes that plague other hubs. The service reductions do mean that more service to St. Louis is done on regional jets. The D concourse is now pretty much empty so if you remember St. Louis' ""glory days"" as a bustling TWA hub you will likely find that depressing. A suggestion: if you are an originating passenger in St. Louis and you see a big security line at the C concourse entrance try going over to the B concourse. There's rarely a line at B. The B gates serve the prop planes but as soon as you enter the B gates you can take a short walkway to the C gates and avoid the security mess."
3rd February 2004,n/a,St Louis Airport customer review,I have been living in St. Louis for 4 years now and frequenting it often. The airport is probably one of the worst in the country however it has its positive notes. 1) There is a metro (light rail) train which pulls up directly to the airport and can take you to anywhere around 20 locations around St. Louis. In a matter of 30 minutes (about the same as driving) you can be in the shadow of the arch. It makes it nice for layovers. 2) The food is interesting. The Burger King both inside and outside security are not too overpriced and the California Pizza Kitchen is fantastic (although expensive)
25th August 2003,n/a,St Louis Airport customer review,Lambert always seemed run downed and depressing to me. I used it a few times with TWA but won't fly on anything that has to bother with stopping in St Louis.
30th July 2003,n/a,St Louis Airport customer review,I found the previous comments about St. Louis Airport amusing. They are true and it is an old airport. I used to transit St. Louis many years ago when we flew TWA. It was nice back then. What happened? It is old run down and not comfortable at all. The walks out to the gates take forever and the eating places are terrible unhealthy. They need to re-do the entire airport. It probably doesn't matter. American took over TWA who had bought out Ozark. AA is planning on scaling down its new St. Louis hub (having O'Hare and DFW so excessive) so there won't be much there before long save Southwest. St. Louis is actually a good location for a hub. One positive they actually do have a fair amount of airport hotels in the area.
3rd November 2002,n/a,St Louis Airport customer review,"I have practically grown-up transiting St Louis' Lambert Field. Like all other airports it was once a pleasant experience before the hub and spoke system destroyed all civility in the flying experience especially in the larger airports. As airlines disappeared after deregulation of the industry in 1978 and huge omnipresent carriers like TWA which used reign at STL took over the show STL became a nightmare and remains one to this day. STL is one of those horribly designed octopus-airports. You have a choice of walking down one of the two endlessly long gate corridors (running is usually the mode of transport unless you are lucky enough to snag a golf cart or wheelchair which isn't easy given the hoardes of the elderly travelling cheaply on Southwest airlines which hubs there) and when you finally have arrived at your gate of departure there is rarely anyplace to sit but that usually doesn't matter because boarding has already begun and one is lucky to have made it in time from the connection gate 1/2 mile away in the dusty old bus-terminal-like annex used for the commuter planes that buzz like flies in from all over the midwest! Not a pleasant experience. If you are travelling point to point on any other carrier besides American or Southwest you will not have to wear your running togs because all the other airlines are stuck in the little old terminal off to one side. The only advantage to that quaint old building is that it is next door to the restaurant which has since become an enormous McDonalds. I may be wrong but I don't think there is a proper dining facility at STL any longer. Anyway the other advantage to arriving at the old terminal on the other carriers is that you can get out of the airport very quickly which is a good thing. My point being don't join American's frequent flyer program just because you do business in St Louis alot stick to your hometown carrier. If you are strictly into ""cheap"" then STL is the place for you. Southwest is rapidly gaining strength in that market. That's good because the money you save on flying like a heifer to market is that you can then afford a hot-dog and beer at one of the grossly expensive junk food emporiums that abound there. The hot-dog stands (ubiquitous in St Louis Airport) and dirty bars are grossly over-priced unless you want a half-gallon-sized plastic beaker of Budweiser which is the most cost-effective purchase in the gate areas not to mention the fastest way to numb yourself to the chaos around you that is if you've managed to miss your flight or arrive in time to sit down and dry off for a few moments before running to your connection. I no longer transit STL when visiting ""home"". It's too degrading. Every time I have found myself in the vortex of that maelstrom in one of those endless arms to infinity I find myself meditating on Dante's Inferno and wondering which circle of hell I have landed myself in this time. I doubt very much if American Airlines can improve a bad situation that TWA didn't seem to notice. The airport staff once past the check-in counters are nasty and unhelpful and slightly threatening more often than not and clearly hate their jobs. So if you are going to the Midwest which is a nice place to go skip STL and use Chicago O'Hare. At least at ORD you will have a choice of airlines to fly meaning lower airfares if transiting on to the west coast or the southwestern US."
5th February 2022,4,"""Budget lots more time for this airport""","Not Verified |  Budget lots more time for this airport, horribly inefficient. Taking the more difficult option of public transport (rental cars, etc.) is penalized by drop-off area furthest from each terminal. Rental car center requires dragging bags across lots, through building and then long wait on huge bus, only to be dropped off on outer land furthest from check-in! Maddening. If you miss turn-off to your terminal (no sign, only colors) be prepared for long delay as you drive miles to other terminal and terminal return. Why a smallish regional airport needs to be spread out over miles of terminal is difficult to comprehend. It’s one thing to have to significant transfer between terminals at London Heathrow (giant airport in urban area) it’s quite another at small regional. How about putting terminals together and allow passengers to access them without driving all over god’s green earth. Sorry for the rant but dragging heavy bags for 20 minutes at 5am needlessly requires some decompression."
13th November 2021,2,"""Worst airport in a decade""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport in a decade. The gas station on the drive in is great, but getting out was awful. No signs! And dark red Jersey barriers in the middle of the road impossible to see which is bad cause 3 of us were driving around trying to find an exit. No signs. Then one tiny sign across the road, no lighting to direct you to the airport. Can’t see in dark and fog. Drove the wrong way, it is a two mile trip to a dead end to get back to the airport. Signs to rental cars as bad. Can’t see in fog which is common this time of year. Another 2 mile misdirection. Rental rental requires a bus. Train to terminal B ok but just be warned. Marginal food choices. Coffee stand closed at 07.00! I have been in 3rd world countries with better quality. Take extra time. Be warned!"
19th October 2021,7,"""Every time I fly from this airport I have an issue!""","✅ Trip Verified | Was easy to get to, however after I checked in my luggage, I never got them at the final destination as they never made it there! Every time I fly from this airport I have an issue! for both Domestic or International flights!"
27th September 2021,1,"""They are consistently rude and unnecessarily aggressive""","Not Verified |  I’m writing after multiple negative experiences with Sacramento Airport’s traffic operations staff (SMF Operations). They are consistently rude and unnecessarily aggressive. I understand the importance of controlling traffic relative to departures and arrivals, however, it is unacceptable and unnecessary for these employees to be as rude and aggressive as they consistently are. I am wondering if these persons are hired with afore knowledge of their inability to perform their duties without any public service etiquette at all. I would rather travel to the South Bay Area to fly than to fly out of local Sac International in order to avoid having any encounters with these employees whatsoever. I do not appreciate being verbally assaulted by these employees and this is something that definitely should be addressed and changed."
6th July 2020,8,"""Easy to Navigate airport""",✅ Trip Verified |  Easy to Navigate airport with a simple layout. Not many restaurants/food places were open due to COVID. Tons of seating available. Easy train connection between check in area and gate area. Extremely short security lines.
14th December 2019,1,"""a very trying time getting out of Sacramento""","Not Verified |  What a horrible experience. Rental car shuttle line had hundreds in line. Took forever to board. Bus driver was singing and doing hand gestures, I felt unsafe. At airport security, TSA had a hundred people in line. Meanwhile 5 agents and a dog are standing around at the front of the line. The young agent ordering us through the xray took lessons on TV from a nazi program. Overall, a very trying time getting out of Sacramento."
4th July 2016,8,"""functional, clean and serviceable""","My home airport, so I know it rather well. While not being a hub (or even a terribly important spoke) for any airline, it's quite practical and typically less stressful than other NorCal alternatives. The new terminal is nice, if a bit over-sized for itself, I'm a fan of the giant red rabbit (why not be different?), the old terminal is still quite functional, clean and serviceable. Decent selection of restaurants/coffee shops, etc. in both. A few words of caution for those who don't use the airport regularly: It's not far from the city, but it is in the middle of an empty field, so no hotels nearby, etc. If you have a very early flight, stay at a hotel and use Uber or equivalent - don't plan on staying at airport. Taxis are a total scam from SMF and usually take longer than needed: use Uber or similar, Blue vans are usually good if you have time to spare. TSA seems to be improving, but can still be a bit nightmarish, especially in the older terminal and on Monday mornings and Friday afternoons, or at holidays."
15th January 2013,10,Sacramento Airport customer review,I have been through this airport every month for over 2 years. This is the first time I have had someone raise their voice and tell me that I and all other employees are wrong. I simply requested to not go through the x- ray machine. Every where else directs me to where I am to stand and wait to be patted down and wand with a metal detector. Highly upsetting.
14th August 2012,7,Sacramento Airport customer review,Once again landed at the old terminal (United) and departed from the new (Southwest). The older terminal is not bad but nothing special. Of course landing one does not deal with check-in counters restaurants etc. We again experienced the rental car shuttle getting filled quickly even mid-day on a weekday (when the driver saw we had four bags she said she probably shouldn't have stopped but let us on). I wish the terminals had two levels of roadways so you didn't have to take an escalator or elevator up to the check-in area.
14th March 2012,8,Sacramento Airport customer review,The new terminal which houses Southwest among other airlines is a definite step up. The train required to get from the main terminal to the departure gates was fast. There was a large variety of eateries near the gates. No haute cuisine but decent enough and better than in many other airports. The other older terminal is more run of the mill. My main complaint was that there seemed to be too few shuttle buses between the terminal and the consolidated rental car facility and they could quickly be overwhelmed. At least all rental car companies are housed together.
9th November 2011,9,Sacramento Airport customer review,On our trip to Las Vegas my husband and I needed wheelchair assistance for the first time. He can not stand for long periods and can certainly not make the long distances to the gates without assistance. All the assistants were kind and accommodating. We could not have made this trip without this service. We do recommend however that your shuttle stop at all locations as needed in economy parking. We were dropped off at a lighted kiosk which required walking several rows to our car. They didn't announce our location was coming up.
30th August 2011,2,Sacramento Airport customer review,My husband and I just departed from Terminal B at the SAC airport. My husband is handicapped and needed wheelchair assistance. Securing a chair immediately was not a problem and airline agents at counter were great. My issues began at the security check. The agent at the scanning portal did not speak clearly as to where my husband was to wait for an agent to give him a pat down. He waited and waited for an agent to arrive. It made the whole security area seem disorganized. We also had a similar experience at our departure gate. Again our airline agent checking boarding passes called at least 4 times for assistance before she got confirmation that someone would eventually get there. Is this airport short handed or do they just not want to deal with the handicap.
16th July 2010,4,Sacramento Airport customer review,Airport is apparently in the process of a large expansion. Overall arrival and departure were fairly easy but the check-in area for Southwest Airlnes was very overcrowded (both the indoor check-in counter and outside curbside check-in area). The consolidated rental car facility was easy to use though there are few attendants in the lot to help you if you have any problem finding your car etc. One pleasant surprise was the low price of gas at the station on airport property; actually lower price than many in-town stations (though did not accept American Express) making it an easy choice when filling the tank before returning n your rental car. Lots of shops and restaurants in the airport once you pass through security.
6th April 2006,n/a,Sacramento Airport customer review,"It seems that several years ago it was a nicer experience to ""eat and run"". As I recall there were choices of restaurants and they were available to everyone not just to those who were flying out. It changes the portrait of reunions and/or farewells when the best choice is to go somewhere else oftentimes including wandering about lost for a bit in the process (being a stranger in a strange land) finding yet another parking place and being unsure of the surrondings and/or offerings on the menu. The ideal plan is to eat with friends and family in a comfortable environment and proceed with the rest of the itinerary. Many of us don't want to add more stops and more diversions to often already overbooked travel plans. How wonderful it would be to enjoy a meal together without going out of the way to do it. Add to that the fact that less and less is being offered or served onboard flight it's very nice to have a restaurant or two available before departing or upon arriving."
30th April 2005,n/a,Sacramento Airport customer review,A bright and spacious airport but one word of warning. We surrendered our hire car planning to stay the night at the airport hotel and eat at the airport restaurant (just beyond the massive sign on the outside of the building announcing 'Restaurant and with it's own doors at that. Beware - inside is a small pizza hut express and a vending machine selling (on the occasion we visited) two salads and I don't mean a choice of two sorts I mean a total of two. We made the best of it but found the airport at the state capital contributed poorly to the gastronomic experience.
14th November 2003,n/a,Sacramento Airport customer review,Sacramento airport is one of the nicer ones I've been in the United States. The terminals are open and bright with a nice food court area and some shops. There's not a huge selection in food or shops but it is a small airport and the selection there is is good for the size. Check in is efficient. Baggage claim is a bit crowded but that is the only complaint. Access to the airport is good and it is not far from the city.
14th March 2022,1,"""The airport is an embarrassment""","Not Verified |  Failure of an airport. Incredibly sad since this airport could have been amazing. This will be all anyone will talk about if Salt Lake Wins the winter Olympics. The airport is an embarrassment. There is zero efficiency.  Nothing about this airport works as it did efficiently before. The distances between A and B terminals is ridiculous and should have a train or people mover. I could go on and on but others have done a better job lamenting this failure. I actually now hope SLC does not get the Olympics in 2030 / 2034 because it will show the world what a joke the United States is, having the worst airport in the world.  In the future I will drive from Los Angeles rather than face this horrible airport again."
10th March 2022,1,"""incredibly and unexpectedly bad""","Not Verified |  It's been a few years since I used SLC. I was excited to experience the new $4.1 billion SLC. However, the experience has been incredibly and unexpectedly bad! First of all, humbly, jugging by my experience, I find it hard to believe that whomever designed the new SLC has ever been in an airport before. SLC is unbelievably the worst airport I've ever experienced in my over 1.5 million miles flown! A 25 minute power walk between security and the gates, really? The tunnel between A and B gates is too narrow for the passenger volume and out of the 3 escalators, 2 are for arriving passengers and 1 is for departing passengers. Here is a tip: It should be the other way around, departing passengers are more likely to have time constraints (such as getting to their gate so they don't miss their flight) than arriving ones. Then coming back it took SLC 1h 9 minutes to deliver my bags beating Madrid's 35 minutes and Paris CDG's little over 30 minutes. There are no seats by the baggage claim area, so plan to be standing for an hour while the bags travel from the gate to the baggage claim. -Finding your way out of the airport is challenging, especially if you're being picked up by a friend or family. I would say that the overall airport signage is the opposite of intuitive (just like in most European airports), but that's a far lesser issue given the other problems. At baggage claim I spoke with the airline staff, they were very nice and apologetic, but clearly frustrated with the airport design and management. They told me it's been like this since they've opened the new SLC in late 2020. Not sure if the SLC leadership reads these reviews or if they're even capable of realizing that maybe it's time to resign? Honestly, I've been in very poor countries and they have far better designed and run airports, costing far less than the $4.1 billion. Hope it gets better next time I use SLC, for now I'm going to avoid it as much as possible."
5th March 2022,8,"""Baggage wait time horrible""",Not Verified | Beautiful airport. Baggage claim wait time horrible. The wait times are just unreasonable. The airport wasn’t even that busy on my arrival date.
27th February 2022,1,"""Too bad the airport doesn't function""","Not Verified |  Brand new airports with an attractive modern theme. The restaurant selections are quite nice. Too bad the airport doesn't function. It's worse than Newark by a long shot. I have never received a bag in less than 30 min. Generally takes 45 min from plane door opening - even with priority status, 1+ hr wait lines to just drop off bags are common - there is only one cross between the terminals. A 15-20 min walk between security/baggage claim and your gate is common - the security tried to be modern and efficient. As a result it's a horrible system with automated trays that takes 2x longer than the normal security setup. Machines can't image 20% of bags through security and have to re scan"
5th February 2022,2,"""I really would take the train instead""","Not Verified |  This ""new and improved"" airport feels like a joint architectural design venture created by M. C. Escher and Hieronymus Bosch. If the Amtrak still ran between SLC and where I need to go, I really would take the train instead of having to go through this airport."
31st January 2022,1,"""the worst airport anywhere""","✅ Trip Verified | This is without any qualification the worst airport anywhere. The Delta terminal, A, is accessible from security. If you happen to fly any other airline (Southwest, United) the friendly fiends who designed the airport force you to walk at least a full mile to reach the other terminal. The cruelest joke is that even some of Delta's gates require this death march. What a shame this really is. The airport this fiasco replaced was actually one of the best airports anywhere. "
29th January 2022,1,"""such a poorly designed facility""","✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airport layout we’ve experienced in 35 years of traveling around the world! It was nearly a mile walk from Gate B19 to baggage claim and rental cars. They built a brand new airport and had a fresh slate to work from, but the architects and engineers absolutely dropped the ball, in my humble opinion! We will avoid this airport at all costs in the future. We saw so many elderly people resting against the wall during the ultra-long walk to/from the gate. We had our cold weather gear on and we’re sweating by the time we got to baggage claim! It’s extremely sad that so many millions of dollars were wasted on such a poorly designed facility!"
30th December 2021,3,"""not elderly friendly at all""","Not Verified |  I am elderly and when leaving discovered the long walk to gates. Upon arrival home I was told there are no carts to help to the baggage claim and a wheelchair is the only option. Wheelchair would be at least a 15 minute wait. I decided to go it on my own. The people movers are length ways apart, this surplus not elderly friendly at all. No trains, inadequate people movers and no carts to assist people. If I did not live in SLC would avoid this airport all the time!"
27th December 2021,2,"""avoid this airport""","Not Verified | This clearly is an airport catered to Delta airlines only and every other airlines is given 2nd or 3 priority starting with the placement of the gates and the waiting on the run ways. Terminal B for anyone with a disability is over a one mile walk, require the use of an elevator and wheel chair assistance. On the return flight my son and I had to wheel my parents from check in to terminal B-they were disorganized and understaffed. We told them we were all TSA pre checked but they sent us to the wheelchair lane where we received no priority-had to remove shoes and electronics and coats. Not easy for two 87 year olds in a wheel chair. They separated us through security so my parents had to wait for my son and I to go to the back of the line instead of keeping us all together. For a State who knows how to manage its budget, this new airport represents a lack of thoughtfulness, organization and efficiency. Will find another way to get here and to avoid this airport."
21st December 2021,1,"""This place is horrendous""","✅ Trip Verified | Last night was my third “delay” at SLC this year. This place is horrendous. Having spent two nights in hotels at SLC this year because of flight delays last night was the final straw. Flying from SLC to HLN arrived SLC from ATL. Delta 3784. B Gate Sit at gate, walk down a long ramp to a bus which has 22 people on it. Board plane. After 40 mins informed heat sensor problem. I know this is a Delta problem but bear with me. After further delay informed we will sit on the plane for another hour as it “takes too long to go back to the gate.” After the hour is up informed problem cannot be fixed. Same bus back to the airport (don’t we have COVID!) wait in the airport another hour and told get back on the bus (same scenario) Board plane. Asked the flight attendant politely why they did not bring the plane to a gate and was told “if you don’t like it you can get off this plane. So much for DELTA respecting Diamond Medallion First Class passengers. Finally depart. DELTA needs to stop sending all flights from HLN to SLC. SLC cannot handle the traffic. Everyone is stressed out."
17th December 2021,2,"""Somebody missed the mark!""",✅ Trip Verified | Worst experience for anyone with health challenges or tight connections. The walk is daunting for some. The food options are small for the amount of travelers. Somebody missed the mark!
17th December 2021,2,"""Security screening is a mess""","Not Verified |  Security screening is a mess. It took 30 minutes to get to my gate. Once I got to the gate I had to get on a bus that takes you to the plane. The restaurants are too small and there isn't many of them. People in long lines waiting to be seated at most of the restaurants. It is pretty to look at, but was designed horribly for passengers."
13th December 2021,1,"""Worst airport that I have flown""","Not Verified | You have to walk for about 1/2 an hour to get to your gate. They have moving walk ways but they are short and broken down most of the time. Nothing like Denver’s moving walkways. How can you spend this kind of money and not have a tram or something. Not to mention their restaurant selection is horrible. Don’t try getting breakfast before a 7 am flight, everything is closed. Worst airport that I have flown."
1st December 2021,1,"""you make flying into Salt Lake City a disaster""",✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airport design ever - they talk about a linear design (just a straight line) the car rental area is at the end of the terminal - I was in and out of A7 nearly the longest walk possible - even with the moving walkway it was very very long. The signage was terrible - how do you know where you are supposed to go? The car rental was at the end (of course) and the car pickup was a further walk. The old airport was far better than the new one - how could you move backwards by spending billions of dollars on a failed experiment (linear design). I will not go thru or to your airport ever again - you make flying into Salt Lake City a disaster.
28th November 2021,1,"""a truly awful and time-consuming experience and several levels""",Not Verified |  We live in Salt Lake City and so are stuck with using this abomination of an airport. If you can avoid traveling through Salt Lake Airport you should do so - it is a truly awful and time-consuming experience and several levels. Whoever designed it should be fired and sued. What a complete waste of money it was to spend $4.1 Billion on making everything worse than the old airport. 1) Entrance is big and airy but pointlessly so - a lot of utterly wasted space with very poor signage leaving you wondering where you should go. 2) Seating stations with strange stepped horizontals which are I'm guessing are supposed to mimic rock formations but are very expensive safety risks for any children. It is only a matter of time before they get sued relating to a fall from one of those silly designs. 3) Terminal A layout - you enter at one end (rather than central) to new Terminal A. This means it is a very long walk down a bland design large corridor that goes on for seemingly miles - and that is just Terminal A. Bad luck if your gate is at the far end. 4) If you are in terminal B then even worse news - you have at least a ten to fifteen minute walk underground to get there. If you are elderly or unwell then tough luck as there is no transport system. To add insult to injury the tunnel you walk through is awful and smells stale. 5) Pick-up arrangements by private car more or less just copy the inadequate old airport model and are hopelessly inadequate. Really - no-one has given this any thought out of a $4.1Billion Budget! It is hopeless chaos at most times. Cars line up beside the road on the airport approach as there are no proper convenient waiting facilities provided and this can get quite dangerous. Someone should be held accountable for this diabolical airport design.
27th October 2021,1,"""We want the old airport back""","Not Verified |  We want the old airport back. This was a waste of tax payer money and just an excuse to build a new airport. What was wrong with the original spoke and hub design that allowed passengers to circulate through only one concourse rather than walking the length of one concourse, then through a connecting tunnel to another long concourse and then walk the length of that concourse to either get to a departure gate or arrive at a gate. I arrived at night around 9.30 when most airports are quiet but found that our aircraft had to park far out on the tarmac. The passengers had to wait and leave the plane on roll up ramps to then enter shuttle buses to go to the terminal. Only it was not to the terminal - it was to enclosed unheated temporary walkways about 1/10 of a mile long leading to the terminal. Then found that we entered the terminal at the far end of the farthest concourse and then had to walk through that concourse, thru a tunnel, and through another terminal to exit the airport. Travel time from aircraft seat to my car in the parking lot - 1 hour and 20 minutes. All that time spent walking. Be prepared for long times moving thru the terminal and bring good walking shoes."
26th October 2021,1,"""It is horrible""","Not Verified |  While being attractive that is where any accolades stop. It is horrible. If you fly Southwest get on your hiking shoes and plan an extra 30 minutes to get to your gate. If you fly Sky West, besides the two mile hike, it is a third world experience of long ramps and busses and always a 30 minute delay to take off. What a multi billion dollar disaster. Pickup car lines often extend to the freeway. Short term parking exit requires a multi-point turn to get out and not scratch your car. Oh how I miss the old airport. Great job SLC."
25th October 2021,1,"""Shame on Salt Lake City""","✅ Trip Verified | Not only is this the worst designed airport I’ve ever been to in the world, it’s evil. They designed the walk to the B terminal to be just a few feet shy of the legal requirement to install a tram. Elderly people and people with disabilities should avoid this airport. In addition to that, there is one, I repeat, one Econ parking bus to take you to the long term lot. And more than once they have just randomly announced some spots are no longer available, it doesn’t matter if you parked there before. Shame on Salt Lake City for making such a horrible addition to an already iffy city."
22nd October 2021,3,"""I am appalled""","✅ Trip Verified | Like so many others who have reviewed this airport, I am appalled that they spent billions to create a completely dysfunctional and sterile environment. Making customers walk a mile or more between gates when most people are carrying luggage or laptops is inexcusable. I visit Salt Lake for work and have not been here in the last 2 years due to the pandemic. When I came through the airport this week, I was shocked. What was once a fairly easy airport to travel through has now become an airport that I will avoid at all costs. As a regular traveler, it is clearly the worst airport in the United States."
10th October 2021,6,"""The distances are absolutely insane""","✅ Trip Verified | Overall SLC is a nice-looking airport. Very clean and bright and doesn't look outdated. Even the chairs outside the gates were a sleek design that all had functioning outlets (that we found.) The restrooms were the cleanest I've ever seen in any airport. Brightly lit, not a spot of graffiti or wear on their nice, tall, stall walls, all the chrome nicely polished, and all the soap/paper towel/faucet sensors worked flawlessly. It would probably be my favorite airport I've ever visited. Except...The distances are absolutely insane. I've read other reviews that spoke about the distances from the parking lot to rental cars/airport and I can't attest to any of those. I've never been to SLC airport besides for a transfer. But I can definitely tell you the distance from A to B concourse is long. I have mobility issues and fortunately for me, they had a wheelchair provided for me and to hold my luggage. But not so great for my companion who was walking alongside us carrying her own backpack and rolling bag. I even said to her when we finally got to our gate (at the very end of the concourse) ""Did that seem like a really long ride to you?"" She confirmed what I had suspected (completely out of breath) ""That was absolutely ridiculous. I was starting to lose you guys."" The sign as you enter the main hall connecting them even says right on it ""7 minute walk."" And that's assuming you are in relatively good shape with no physical limitations not to mention not accounting from where you came from in the previous concourse and where you have to go in the next. In our case, they both happened to be at completely opposite ends because of course they did. I would not be surprised it if was a mile of walking and possibly even more. My companion definitely got her steps in that day. It really is a nice airport overall, but God help you if you have a really tight connection."
4th October 2021,3,"""You will sweat walking to your gate""",Not Verified |  Terrible T shape design means about a mile walk from rental car to B gates. No tram option. It’s as if the new “improvements” were architected by someone that’s never travelled or even studied other airports. You will sweat walking to your gate. I don’t know how mobility impaired can travel in and out of this airport.
2nd October 2021,1,"""Worst airport ever""","Not Verified | After trekking a half mile from rental car drop off to security check, we have to walk another 850 meters to our gate.

2nd October 2021,1,"""Worst airport ever!""","Not Verified |  Worst airport ever! Landed in gate B and had to walk almost 1 mile to get to Gate A then another half mile to get to the gate. This is the worst constructed airport in United States! They put some moving walkways, but they did not put any shuttles between terminals or within terminals!! This airport is a heart attack waiting to happen!"
27th September 2021,2,"""design and layout, is outrageously cumbersome and inconvenient""","Not Verified |  Although frequent flyers in/out Salt Lake City we have been m/I/a for 3+ years due to Covid-19. The extreme distinction from the former user friendly airport to the worst airport design I’ve experienced in the U.S. cannot be overstated. Although we never experienced overcrowding or significant delays (3-4 times yearly) in the past, I will give them the benefit of the doubt regarding the need for expansion. The design and layout, is outrageously cumbersome and inconvenient, the designers obviously put the traveler at the bottom of the list regarding ease of use. It will be easier to drive from Seattle and Phoenix in the future."

9th September 2021,2,"""The airport is a joke!""","Not Verified |  First, the positives: it’s nice and new, clean and spacious. The employees pushing our wheelchairs were very nice, pleasant, and strong as one person pushed two of us at once! Kudos to them! But those are the only things I can think of. The negatives: way too big and impossible for anyone in their 70s or 80s to walk! I don’t know who planned this airport without any type of tram system to get one to their gate. It is literally a mile or more walk! Baggage claim is nowhere near the gates. Not enough places to get food. We have family in Utah, but this may be our last flight there. The airport is a joke!"
4th September 2021,1,"""this is the worst airport I can think of""","✅ Trip Verified | Wow. Where to start. I have over 4 million lifetime miles. I’ve traveled to 40 countries. Aside from perhaps the Berlin airport, this is the worst airport I can think of. For starters, the signage is a complete wreck. Departure gate info is so hard to see from the car rental return that I missed it not once, but twice, wandering around. Next, they have about 25 state-of-the-art check-in lines which are usually at half capacity or less. But the real kicker is that the TSA precheck line is at the very end of the line and is the old “push your bags along the steel table” throwback from 20 years ago. If that isn’t bad enough, they allow anyone (precheck or not) through this line. So the precheck line is always the longest, because there is only one, it isn’t automated, and you always have 5 people ahead of you stripping off all their clothes because they got in the wrong line and the airport is too cowardly to redirect them to one of the 12 open lanes they should be in! Complete lack of supervisory control. Then, when you get to the terminal, there is seriously almost no places to eat or shop. I don’t know how to explain it. All that space and it’s just so poorly managed. Also it’s sterile. No character (unless you want to count a few hastily drawn murals in the basement). Ok. So I haven't even gotten to the worst of it. Here we go. The walk to B gate is unbearable. 20-25 minutes and I am not joking. And most of it is in the basement. Not a pleasant walk. But then when you get to your terminal and it’s time to board, they literally ignore all priority seating benefits and let everyone rush the podium at the same time. Then they lead you down a very long ramp to the tarmac. Then you are headed into a little tin shed that is not even weatherized. If it rains you get wet. If it snows, there is snow everywhere. Then you have to board a bus (I’m not kidding) and wait there while they cram you in. Then you drive alongside the runway for quite a distance. A plane was taking off next to us and we were literally choking on Exhaust fumes. Then finally we get to our plane and basically free-for-all boarding. This airport is a $4 billion tragedy."

30th August 2021,1,"""has become one of the most user unfriendly airports in the nation!""","✅ Trip Verified | Wow! By building a new terminal facility this airport has become one of the most user unfriendly airports in the nation! Distances are huge between check in, security and the terminal gates. Mobile walkways are few. No longer is this place worth flying out of. It's sad. This airport used to be great."
30th August 2021,2,"""Horrible long walk to and from gates""",✅ Trip Verified | Horrible long walk to and from gates. Poor signage. No place to sit on the walk. Few places to get food. Not a good airport. On the positive side. I think some one on the board of directors heard the message that the walk to gates was bad. I think they are working to fix the problem. There is construction that looks to be a shorter way to the gates.
29th August 2021,3,"""possibly the worst airport in the U.S.""",Not Verified |  The new SLC airport is possibly the worst airport in the U.S. and a disaster to navigate. I much prefer the old airport that was easy and quick to get to gates.
29th August 2021,1,"""airport is the least customer friendly I can remember""","✅ Trip Verified |  After not flying for nearly 1.5 years, I was excited to experience the “new and improved” Salt Lake City airport. I cannot tell you how disappointed, disturbed and even mad I felt after walking for what seemed like miles to finally get to my ride waiting outside. Salt Lake planners—what were you thinking? This airport is the least customer friendly I can remember. In most of the place, the vibe inside is cold, unfriendly and impersonal. I can’t rate airport staff because I didn’t see any. I am nearing 70 and although I was able to make it around the place, my dreams of traveling more now that we are retired may require some rethinking. I don’t know how much longer I will be able to handle the marathon walks from terminal to terminal, etc.. I feel extremely sorry for older travelers, for those in wheelchairs or mobility challenged, as well as parents dealing with young children and lots of luggage. There are no trams at all, no moving vehicles for those with mobility issues, and totally inadequate/unclear signage. How sad and tragic. I, frankly, felt embarrassed by this disaster. Other than the bathrooms, which were nice, everything else is a big fail! I never thought I would say this, but I really miss the old airport! Granted, it wasn’t perfect, but I would take it any day over this costly boondogle. What a shameful waste of taxpayer dollars. It makes me want to sue the architect. I wish we could raze the place and start over."
24th August 2021,1,"""Who designed this catastrophe of an airport?""","Not Verified |  I used to make fun of people who wore workout clothes on airplanes. But if I ever go through SLC airport again I'll be wearing mine for the 5K ahead of me to get to the B gates. Wow! Who designed this catastrophe of an airport? I am a Denver resident and travel frequently for business. It looks to me as if they wanted to pattern this airport after DIA, but without trains or sufficient moving walkways. On my visit two of the moving walkways were inoperable, which seems almost criminal. I personally witnessed two elderly people taking breaks against the wall red-faced and breathing heavily. I truly hope someone sues this airport authority if a heart attack or other exercise-induced medical incident occurs. The airport should come with a warning, like an aerobics class you might sign up for - ""must be physically fit and have a doctor's permission to fly through SLC airport."""
21st August 2021,2,"""very long walking times""","✅ Trip Verified |  My experience at the new Salt Lake City Airport has been mainly a negative one. The airport is huge with very long walking times to B gates which my past 3 flights have been out of. TSA takes much longer due to a weird setup of agents spaced out and requiring time after the previous person has finished, to get to them. I had to park my car to assist my 11 year old granddaughter to get on her flight and was in the airport 2 hours and 8 minutes. This cost me a grand total of $15. I'm beginning to completely hate flying. The hidden charges for everything, snacks, drinks, carry-ons, seats! Give me a road trip any day, even with high gas prices."
14th August 2021,1,"""new and improved airport is neither""","Not Verified |  This new and improved airport is neither. 14 min walk from security to mid B gates. I have a bad knee, so I'm not the fastest, but wasn't the slowest either. This is a long way from an improvement. No way will I be flying into or out of SLC or Southwest ever again. Airport has lots of big windows and some artwork, but when I go to the airport its not to look out the window or check out artwork. I want to get to my gate if I am departing, and get to wherever I am going if arriving. The designers should be required to fly in and out of this airport daily."
10th August 2021,1,"""Salt Lake City airport is an unbelievable mess!""","Not Verified |  Salt Lake City airport is an unbelievable mess! How do they expect elderly people to walk that far. I read the other reviews and it’s all true, no reason for me to repeat all of Salt Lakes terrible mistakes."
8th August 2021,2,"""anyone who thought opening the airport in this state is negligent""","Not Verified |  A couple of prefaces. I’m in decent physical shape, I’m not Prefontaine (I picked a distance runner for a reason), but do work out 5-6 days a week. Also pre-Covid, I did a lot of business travel, 200K a year, and actually tried to go through SLC if an east-west layover was required, because it was a much more pleasant experience than Denver or Dallas. SLC was a great midsize airport. What happened? I’m seriously gobsmacked how thoroughly botched this new one is. I mean it’s clean and looks nice, but it’s a functional disaster that must have been designed by a walking fetishist. I saw a different review comparing this airport to Incheon and Hong Kong, which makes me think they’ve never been to those airports, because both have trams that get you close to where you need to go, have centralized shopping, lounges and food options, and have shapes not inspired by a giant equals sign. It’s like the designers looked at Detroit and Atlanta, and said, “That, but without the trains!” My personal story, discovering that my favorite east-west hub had been brutalized, was a on this most recent connection, my first trip since Covid. The plane parked away from the terminals next to a ramp, where a bus would get us. Not ideal, but whatever, I have been to airports under construction and this happens. We deplaned, and got on the bus. On arrival to the terminal, things started to unravel. You arrive to a structure that looks like a shrine to the world’s longest ramps that's connected to the end of Terminal B. When you get on this thing and look up, it’s almost comical how long and skinny it is. It’s no joke probably two hundred yards long, and a wheelchair wide. I don’t know how this thing is legal for either fire or ADA, because getting a wheelchair up this thing would be brutal, and if there’s a fire, there’s no escape. When I finished my climb, I then did what I always do, find the lounge. I used up about 20 minutes of my 90 minute layover with the bus and ramp, but still thought I had time to grab some breakfast. This turned out to be about as naive as thinking you can win a land war in Asia. I was at one end of Terminal B, and my connection was on the other end of Terminal B. I figured the lounge would be central like they usually are. Really should have looked at a map. I saw signage, and began to walk, and walk. Got to the opening to the tunnel to Terminal A, the signage indicated the lounge was on the other side, and I figured it must be central in Terminal A near the tunnel, so still doable. Ten minutes and a broken conveyor later, I get to Terminal A, and start following signage. Walking and walking. At this point I’m angry and committed. Turns out the lounge is at the very end of Terminal A, making it effectively useless for 3/4 of connecting traffic. I arrived 25 minutes after finishing the ramp hike, and scanned in for essentially a water break before my return journey to the connection that I now knew was a mile away. I arrived to my connection sweating through my shirt and angry, with my phone congratulating me for power walking nearly three miles. I understand this airport is a work in progress, but anyone who thought opening the airport in this state is negligent. I don’t know how anyone with mobility issues or children could do it without severe distress. Considering the money involved, it’s borderline criminal."
6th August 2021,1,"""Are you kidding me, SLC?""","✅ Trip Verified | It took me 50 min briskly walking from C gate to the passenger pickup. Are you kidding me, SLC? You should hang your architect - every visitor that goes to SLC will judge you by this terrible design! Unless your arrive gate is A terminal at SLC, you should train several weeks of cardio for this airport. I arrived on C gate - the plane parks on the tarmac and a bus picks you up 3rd world nation style. Then you see dropped off at the bottom of a ADA ramp that is 200 yds long and on only 1 person wide, so forget about getting past a slow person. Then you find yourself at the very end of B terminal. Then you walk 1/2 mile to the end of B terminal. Then the 1/3 mile walk under the tarmac. Then you find yourself at the far end of A terminal. Another 1/2 mile walk and and you end up at passenger pick up and arrival- which actually was vastly improved. Note to SLC Olympic Committee - don't take the inspectors to B gate!"
4th August 2021,2,"""this new airport is a complete failure""","✅ Trip Verified |  As a life long SL resident - I can say that without a doubt this new airport is a complete failure. The old airport was better from a passenger perspective in every conceivable way. The old airport was smaller and never built to exist in the current airport climate, yet it worked, and it had character and was a pleasant space. It never felt overly crowded even on busy days and with small concourses. Now the new airport 'feels' packed and its 5x larger. Everyone is channeled into the same spaces. Nobody likes walking in tunnels - in the hold airport you had to walk distances between concourses but they were pleasant walks with views. Now you know you are walking in a basement. I could go on and on and on - but it suffices to say the design is poor, the capacity feels *reduced* versus the old one, and its as cold and sterile a design that feels unpleasant to spend time there. There is nothing 'warm' in this design, it is like spending time in a hospital, how nice! Everything that everyone else says about it is true. It is a complete bomb. Avoid traveling here or connecting through here."
27th July 2021,4,"""Arrival and departure areas much improved""","✅ Trip Verified | Uninspiring architecture inside, although blends in well to surroundings externally. Very few restaurants with long lines, which makes one wonder what purpose a Lego store is there for, for instance. The number of restaurants per given space less than any major US airport I have been. Others have commented on long walks. Although I agree there are long distances between moving walkways, those passengers have clearly never been to Minneapolis. In the lobby, the plastic white blobs are incredibly ugly. I don’t even know their purpose. Are they sculptures or seats? No one was sitting on them in any case. Arrival and departure areas much improved, and they are now up to standard of every major US airports. I saw 10 departure boards in concourses, but not one arrivals screen to see baggage claim or connecting flight arrivals."
26th July 2021,3,"""Extremely disorganized border control""","Not Verified |  Extremely disorganized border control. There's a dozen different lanes and none of them line up with the actual desks to go up to, and the person in charge of directing traffic was totally lost. Most of the global entry machines weren't working. I waited in line for 90 minutes at a brand new airport which only had a single half-full international flight arriving at that time. Once you clear customs, they don't have a dedicated security spot set up (they do but its all blocked off), so you have to exit the security area and re-enter in the main terminal with everyone else. For a brand new airport design that's completely unacceptable. Finally, the design is just an extremely long terminal building (think San Jose on steroids). There are huge gaps between the moving walkways, and the signage is really unclear if you're trying to get to B-gates. Overall it's very new/shiny but absolutely horrendous for a traveler in terms of usefulness."
25th July 2021,2,"""extremely disappointed with the new airport""","Not Verified |  We have been extremely disappointed with the new airport. Most of airport gates are a huge trek from security and also to baggage claim. They need a tram or similar system considering how spread out everything is and how crowded it is (think DFW). The lines for the food places are consistently far too long now. The LED screens for baggage claim is too small and seem to be located only in one spot. All flights funnel through one security line that can be massively long if you don’t have TSA or Clear! The lines to get on the parking lot shuttle are often very long, too. We miss the airport and it’s ease of use that existed prior to this expansion. Please improve this airport!!!"
22nd July 2021,1,"""How terribly disappointed we are""",✅ Trip Verified | When we were told Salt Lake was to get a new airport we were excited as population growth made the previous airport over-busy. How terribly disappointed we are - as are most of our fellow Utahns who fly much. Whoever designed this airport should be fired/sued for a truly awful job - it is unbelievably passenger unfriendly. 1) Ridiculous walk times and distances from Terminal B. 2) Vast areas of wasted space. 3) Terrible seating design in dangerous ladder type format. 4) Hopelessly inadequate drop-off and pick-up facilities - probably worse than the old airport. 5) Food and refreshment facilities are lacking. Those of us who live in SLC are stuck with this dreadful airport probably for the rest of our lives but to anyone who has a choice do not fly from/to/or through Salt Lake City!
17th July 2021,1,"""poor excuse for an international airport""","Not Verified |  Anything more than 1 star is a lie! Horribly planned airport. Not customer oriented or even considered in the design and planning. Traveled through large and small airports worldwide and this is the worst! Much wasted, non efficient space. Poor seating and even worse signage and direction notification. I have cut my travel flights by 80% with this poor excuse for an international airport. Will leave from Jackson or Rock Springs if possible."
15th July 2021,1,"""It’s about as traveler unfriendly as could be conceived.""","✅ Trip Verified | With 10 million miles between (and over 3 million on Delta that has SLC as a major hub) I can tell you SLC is the absolute worst airport for arrivals, departures and particularly transit/connections. I get the linear design concept what the distances are incredibly long with very poor passenger transportation, except for a few sparse and slow moving walkways. Detroit, perhaps the best example of linear design, has a tram system. SLC has nothing. Also, there is only one Delta sky club and it is located at the farthest point from all gates. Long tunnel, long concourses, 30 minute walk (no exaggeration) and then a bus to the plane. This SLC is perhaps the poorest airport design in all of my extensive travel experience and certainly not what you would expect from a “new” airport. It’s about as traveler unfriendly as could be conceived."
8th July 2021,1,"""it's laughable how poorly it is designed""","✅ Trip Verified | If it was your goal in life to make the worst airport possible, you would fail, because there is no way you could make it worse than this new multi-billion dollar airport. It's almost like they took everything good about the last airport (and there was a lot of good) and tried to do the opposite. Starting with something the old airport struggled with, pickup and drop-off. The old airport was almost always packed and difficult to deal with, so what was their solution? Make less space to pickup and drop-off...brilliant!! Off to a great start! Now let's take something the old airport did well and completely butcher it. You had very little distance to walk with the old airport because you had two terminals with separate security lines (three if you count the international terminal, it was a genius layout). This new airport has one security line and then once you're in the terminal, you start all the way at the end of a quarter mile (at least) corridor. Then if you want to get to the next terminal, you have to walk halfway down the first, then another 1/8th of a mile under the tarmac, then walk all the way down to wherever your gate is. I mean, it's laughable how poorly it is designed. Especially given that most people in Utah have a ton of kids. I only have two (very) young kids and it is a nightmare to get luggage and kids from the drop off area all the way to the gate. We were lucky enough to have another couple help us each time we've done it. The brain power and decision making that went into this new airport is embarrassing. At least look at what works at other airports and copy that if you can't come up with a better idea. I can only think of one nice thing to say about this new airport, it looks nice."
6th July 2021,2,"""Horrible selection of stores""","✅ Trip Verified | Loved the old airport. It had character. I was hoping for an exiting new airport with an experience. SLC started with a clean slate and created one of the most boring vanilla airports in the world. The development maybe had the best intentions, but not only did they miss the mark, SLC is a poorly designed airport, boring & one could not make it more vanilla if they tried. I travel a lot & I have been to tiny airports that had more character. It works, it is an airport, long walks, which is ok, but not for the elders at all. Plain strait line & not much to brag about here at all. Horrible selection of stores, boring, not enough restaurants and just so, so. Catch your flight or arrive. That is all one can say. The development team must have been a group of amateurs or a high school design class. Definitely not professional at all. One could even assume they did not visit other airports & that this was the teams first endeavor."
2nd July 2021,1,"""slowest, most inefficient, and horrendously long walking distances""","Not Verified |  Even if there were no other large and super efficient airports to go and have a look at, it's mind-blowing that this is what the designers came up with. I've been in small to mega airports all over the country and the world and SLC takes the prize for the slowest, most inefficient, and horrendously long walking distances. I can't express what a super disappointment this place is, and I know of no other passengers who've been through it, who do not feel the same way. I mean seriously! Did the designers not look at any other airports to see what's working? Dumb, dumb, dumb. You'd think that for the billions that it's costing, we would have gotten something better than this disaster."
1st July 2021,3,"""What a disaster""",Not Verified |  What a disaster. The trip from B Terminal to baggage/ground transportation on foot is a ridiculous. What were the designers and the ious approvers thinking? Someone was clearly asleep at the office or thinks only 18 year olds in track shoes frequent the SLC airport. The team responsible for this should be called out. This needs to be fixed!
30th June 2021,1,"""This is a total disaster""","✅ Trip Verified | I realize I am a little long with this but I wanted to include a few details for future travelers into Salt Lake City through the airport. This is a total disaster, I missed my first flight with seven people by 15 minutes prior to departure posted time, it was horrible we even had a pilot with us that could not make his connection. This flight was from Idaho Falls to Salt Lake City with connecting flight to Phoenix. I had to wait in the airport with the group for five hours until the next flight at 11.30pm. The pilot went on with another airline, he had to reach the airport in Phoenix to fly the same plane to its next flight. On my return flight from Arizona to Idaho I jogged from concourse to concourse almost missing the flight from Salt Lake City to Idaho. They were shutting the door on the bus transportation. The escalator from floor to floor was so crowded that each step had someone with luggage on it and it was not a safe looking environment. The walkways were extremely crowded and people were bypassing them running alongside it very un safe conditions. I wanted so bad to take a picture of this but could not stop it was so chaotic crowded. Both Concourses are extremely narrow with people running and tripping over each other. Whoever was on the planning committee of this-airport will Airport did a disservice to Salt Lake City. If you have any handicap or age related walking or traveling issues stay clear of this airport it is not conducive to getting you around in these long distances. Sorry Salt Lake but I will do everything I can to avoid layovers or connecting flights with you from now on I was so excited to see the new terminals."
27th June 2021,2,"""SLC is a train wreck of an airport""",✅ Trip Verified | SLC is a train wreck of an airport from layout and design to the TSA process and employees. Just avoid this airport unless it is a connection. After screening it took the geniuses at TSA 45 minutes to figure out that three hats will not be recognized as an approved object on the scanner. These chuckleheads will pull your contents from one bin and not tell you. Seriously watch your stuff and pay attention. If you are not on gates A1 to A20 be prepared to trek over to the B concourse and wear your hiking boots. I think the local government dropped about $4B on this disaster. The rental car area is onsite and is pretty straightforward to return a car.
23rd June 2021,4,"""unfortunately I am very disappointed with it""","Not Verified |  It looks like this is a very new wing of the airport in SLC and unfortunately I am very disappointed with it. Nothing has changed for the better. There are seats everywhere and no standing areas or places to stand and do work, charge phones, etc. We sit in cramped little seats on airplanes - why would we want more sitting time while in the airport too? I don’t ever want to sit more while in the airport - I either want to stand or to sleep. So where are the airport beds for everyone who is exhausted from not being able to sleep on planes? or the standing areas to do work? Where is the progress? Furthermore, there should be compost stations around the airport - not just trash and recycling. We should be much more progressive these days - especially in places where thousands of people visit every day. Definitely things to think about and changes to make now."
22nd June 2021,1,"""This airport doesn't make sense""","Not Verified |  This airport doesn't make sense. Check in on 3rd floor then walk down to 2nd where you wait in a security line that regularly backs up into baggage claim. The automated security can probably be fixed, but right now it doesn't work nor has it since the airport opened. Once you do get through security, there is a long walk if you are at any but the first few a gates. I fly through here regularly and don't have too much issue with domestic arrivals. I experienced my first international arrival today and have to ask who approved grabbing luggage before checking passports? All of these people could be getting processed while the baggage makes the trek across the airport, now people have to line up for baggage, then go through customs...also, there will be people lining up with oversized baggage in the tight customs line. The engineering on this project is probably the worst I've ever seen."
22nd June 2021,2,"""The new airport is a nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified |  The new airport is a nightmare. The layout is annoying at best. If you are into walking forever and have no time constraints you will do fine. Otherwise, plan on hiking great distances and spending lots of time trying to get to and from your plane. The signage is horrendous. All in all a very frustrating experience."
13th June 2021,1,"""SLC is a lesson in terrible airport planning""","✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst major airport I’ve ever experienced in terms of layout and planning. The distance required to walk to B gates is absurd, together with a departure arrival that requires you to take an escalator up and then down to check in and access gate levels. All total passengers must endure four escalators — long ones — if going to B gates. This shows that either the architects were newbies incapable of good design, or that the City did not listen and fund properly — or both. SLC is a lesson in terrible airport planning where whomever led the work should forever be banned from any large scale public project, especially any involving public transportation."
9th June 2021,1,"""Do not travel to Salt Lake City if you have mobility problems""","Not Verified |  Do not travel to Salt Lake City via its new but poorly designed airport if you have mobility problems. I have regularly traveled to SLC over 55 years but will no longer do so because there is an utter lack of assistance for those who are physically disabled. I was forced to walk well over 1 mile to baggage claim and then the vehicle rental area because of a lack of wheelchair or electric cart assistance. And I had ordered this assistance in advance. I was told to ""wait"". After 30 minutes, the wheelchair never arrived and there was no United Airlines employee at the gate to check on the status of the wheelchair while I waited. Needless to say, the walk not only caused me pain, but also exacerbated my injuries. Further, I was almost knocked down twice by people running to catch connecting flights because they were not allowed sufficient time to cover the 1 mile walk in a safe manner. In the future I will fly to Boise, St. George, Las Vegas or other locations which do not connect to SLC and then drive to SLC if I have to go there in order to avoid the airport. But otherwise, I'm now staying away from Salt Lake for vacations and will avoid it as much as I can for business purposes."
5th June 2021,1,"""poorly designed airport should never have opened""","Not Verified |  This poorly designed airport should never have ""opened"" until all key components were up and running. The poor signage has still not improved despite numerous complaints. The wheelchair transport is a joke and virtually nonexistent unless it's between 8.00-4.00, Monday through Friday (and forget it if you dare fly on a holiday!). The bottleneck at TSA is a new twist which usually wasn't a problem before. One of the most egregious hallmarks of this billion dollar monstrosity is no train and/or shuttle. The walking sidewalks (if working) move pathetically slow. The elderly, the disabled, the unconditioned are forced to walk 1+ miles to terminal B. The response to these complaints from the paying public is signage ""distracts from the beauty of the building"", ""wheelchair transport should be arranged through the airline by you"", ""TSA is being thorough"", ""we don't have a shuttle due to too many accidents"", ""there is a train scheduled to be up and running in 2024"". Well none of these lame excuses helps today. I have one more trip planned this summer and after that I am done with the SLC airport."
5th June 2021,1,"""this place makes no sense""",Not Verified |  This new multi million dollar airport absolutely sucks! Who ever approved the blueprints of this new terminal needs to be kicked in the rear end! You have to go to the third floor to check in then you have to go back down to the second floor for security. Seems like a waste of time and could be very confusing for some people. And why is it so humid in here? Somebody’s relative must of got paid well plus the kick backs some people got because this place makes no sense. The old airport was so much better than what has been built.
2nd June 2021,2,"""the worst laid out airport I've ever been to.""","Not Verified |  This is by far the worst laid out airport I've ever been to. It is legitimately >1 mile walk from getting dropped off at the curb, go through security, and make it to the middle B gates. I'm not saying they don't have carts for the elderly or disabled to be shuttled, but I didn't see one over the course of my 20 minute walk from security to my gate. There needs to be a subway/rail system set up to accommodate travelers better. They do have moving floors in the tunnel, but there are gaps that don't have the floor. Not sure why anyone would want to get off the floor midway through a tunnel that has no services or even a bench to sit on. At minimum they should have installed two floors for each direction and have them run the entire length. Restaurants and shops are sparse in the B terminal. Giving the new design a 2/10 only because it has new paint. There's not much else that was done right with this one."
2nd June 2021,3,"""What a shame""","Not Verified |  What a shame the officials at Salt Lake City let the imbeciles who never intend to use this airport design it for them. Along that line, those responsible for approving the idiotic design, must be held accountable as well. I've traveled around the world on business and pleasure for 40 years and never have I witnessed such ineptitude in moving people through an airport, especially one that was built in the 21st century, as the mishmash known as SLC. Twenty to thirty minute walks are great, except when traveling through an airport, but that is what the geniuses responsible for this design came up with. I suppose it didn't dawn on them the elderly, or those with ambulatory issues, may have to use this facility. Designing from scratch, with no restrictions of trying to fit a new facility within the confines of an existing airport, and this joke of an airport is what nearly $5B got the traveling public using Delta's hub in Salt Lake City."

31st May 2021,2,"""Beautiful airport, awful design""","Not Verified |  Beautiful airport, awful design. I would hazard if at the end of “b” gates, you’d have to walk 1/2 mile to get to baggage.

It’s time inefficient and unpleasant. The fix? Put in a train."
30th May 2021,3,"""Do not go to this airport if you can't walk well or long distances""","Not Verified |  I have never seen an airport that requires the people traveling to walk as far between terminals as well as poorly marked as for which way to go such as A to B. Our plane sat on the tarma longer than it should have before letting us disembark therefore we had limited time to get from place to place. Signs were not placed well to direct which way to go to B terminal and the walk was horrendous. The mass of people walking through the airport was unbelievable and although moving sidewalks were offered, with people not moving over to allow the folks that need to get somewhere to get there. Do not go to this airport if you can't walk well or long distances. Get some trains like Atlanta, or something. Poor design. I will find another airport to go to before I fly back thru this one. How do you pass the ADA standards for disabled folks?"
30th May 2021,2,"""I now avoid SLC at all costs""","✅ Trip Verified | I used to fly into SLC a lot since I'm living in a small town in Southern Utah who's airport only serves 2 flights a day (Delta to SLC). SLC used to be a great place to transfer with immediate access to the terminal via a short concourse upon deplaning. Now for the smaller flights you get dropped off on the tarmac where a shuttle specific to that flight awaits the plane. The worst part is that that shuttle will not leave the location until every last passenger, crew member and checked carry-on luggage has been piled into the shuttle. Expect an extra 20 minutes at least until you get to the terminal. I now avoid SLC at all costs and drive a bit to other airports that don't force an SLC stop, but unfortunately I'm captive many times and there are no other solutions. If you're picking up luggage in SLC from one of the smaller planes, it could be an hour from landing. It's a shame that what was once a great airport has been redesigned with such little concern to user experience."

The moving escalators are available but so very slow to navigate (it really just provides a place to rest while you move at a snails pace) and we walked and walked to get to the baggage claim area. It was at least 30 minutes and both of us have bad knees. What a poorly thought out airport. There should be shuttles in the terminals for people who need some assistance. Even my friends who live in SLC remark about how poorly this expansion is designed when you have to retrieve baggage. After this experience this last Wednesday we are going to cut our vacation short and come back halfway from Yellowstone to SLC so we have enough time to navigate. Beware - besides the poorly designed baggage claim area - the rental car area is even farther. If you are going to rent from an offsite company it is poorly marked about where to pick up your shuttle. I am in airports every week - poor poor design. Get those shuttles running to assist people who need it.
26th May 2021,2,"""What a disappointment!""","✅ Trip Verified | I am a business traveler, who in a normal year, travels 200,000 miles and passes through 10-20 Airports. I was looking forward to the new Salt Lake City airport after all of the publicity touting that it would be one of the most spectacular airports in the country. What a disappointment! I don’t think the passenger experience was even considered. They amount of walking involved adds an extra 20 to 30 minutes to reach the gate. Even worse than that is there are few resources to help those who have physical issues. There is no seating on the long Aulson non functioning walkways and few carts to give people a ride. The wonderful restaurants that many of us had come to appreciate at the old airport are gone. I have to fly in and out of the airport frequently and each time I’m there I am profoundly surprised and disappointed at the layout of the airport which in actuality does not offer more gates than the old airport. I have written in voice my concerns and has been told that I am in the minority and that most people are quite happy with the airport."
20th May 2021,1,"""it is the most poorly designed airport""","Not Verified |  I have issues with positive reviews on the SLC airport website in the past 2 months as last time I checked in Feb. 2021, 99% were negative. I think reviews have been altered so that the public thinks this new airport is a good thing. In reality, it is the most poorly designed airport I have traveled through anywhere (and I travel a good deal). There is no thought to customer convenience or time and ease of getting from one point to another. I had to walk over a quarter mile from my parking shuttle drop, through the parking garage across a skywalk to check my bag on a different level. Had to go to another level to get to security. 1.2 mile walk to get to Southwest terminal after going through security. No bus or train option. No seating in thoroughfare if you must stop. You have to find an open seat at a gate amidst those waiting to board a flight. No Smartcarts except in parking garage at $6 fee. When returning to SLC, baggage claim sign hardly visible as it has same size small letters as Delta lounge and ground transportation and is listed with those items even though baggage claim is the main thing people look for when getting off the plane. When you finally get to baggage claim, there are no benches or seats. The seats are in one place past baggage claim. I don't know why anyone would even use them there, makes no sense! Terrible, inconvenient, difficult to navigate airport. Every business associate and personal guest has complained to me about it. I am ashamed it is our only option."
17th May 2021,2,"""new SLC airport is a disaster""",Not Verified |  The new SLC airport is a disaster. Everything about it is awful - they’ve crammed all arrivals and departures through a single limited space - so drop off and pick up is a mess. The have 2 concourses connected by an underground corridor which you have to walk - assume an extra half hour. They demolished the old terminals and don’t have enough gates - so planes park on the tarmac and they bus you to the farthest possible point from baggage claim. I’ve been to third-world countries with better airports. And the thing is it’s brand new - spent $1b - who are the nitwits who thought of this? I’d recommend skipping SLC and vacation elsewhere until they slap some fixes on this - a real solution is years away.
16th May 2021,2,"""The new airport is a design disaster""","Not Verified |  The new airport is a design disaster. We arrived by taxi about 1.5 hours before the departure time. The first oddity is that you enter on level 1, go to level 3 to drop off baggage and get boarding passes, then go down to level 2 to access the gates. A bit strange, but not a deal breaker. On level 2 there is a single TSA check point. The line had to be at least a 1/4 mile long. We had first class tickets, but did not see the priority boarding entry until we were nearly thru the general boarding line. We had the misfortune of departing from Terminal B. It took us at least 1/2 hour to walk there. I do not think we ever had a longer walk to a departure gate."
15th May 2021,3,"""The construction is very inconvenient""","✅ Trip Verified | The construction is very inconvenient, unloaded plane into a bus onto a long hot ramp. Delivered into the wrong gate, long walk to the correct gate. Walked up to the desk, clearly marked for my destination and started to ask a question. I was rudely informed that she wasn't servicing our flight yet (it was in an hour). Then asked if it was a full flight to which they replied that it was a relative term, what did I want! You know when people are being inconvenienced anyway, would it be so difficult not to act like a jerk on top of it? Is this a Salt Lake City thing? The Delta staff in Tucson were lovely."
14th May 2021,3,"""Very poor design""",✅ Trip Verified | I’m a frequent traveler and SLC is one of the worst airport in the United States.. The entrance is very confusing and distance between terminal is ridiculous. Very poor design.
14th May 2021,1,"""Horrible is the best way to describe it""","Not Verified |  I didn't want to believe what I was hearing about the long hike through the airport from my dad who flies all the time. He doesn't want to fly anymore because of it and now after the other day when I flew out and back in on the same day, I see why. Horrible is the best way to describe it. I am glad it was just me flying and not my child. I thought the long walk was done after the security point but man was I wrong. It then starts a long walk down a hall, then down an escalator, then down a long hall, then up an escalator, then down a long hall till it breaks up into 2 halls to gates. So ridiculous. I am seriously considering never using SLC airport again. I would rather drive 12 hours to my destination then walk that ever again. Just getting to baggage claim is a nightmare and then figuring out how to get outside to get picked up, a whole new nightmare. I don't mind walking, even though medically it is hard for me right now and I did it but that was the most ridiculous thing ever. I left mad."
13th May 2021,2,"""SLC Airport Authority should be ashamed""","Not Verified |  SLC Airport Authority should be ashamed. What a terrible design. Seems similar in footprint to ATL but no tram option? How could you miss that? Insanely long walks. Minimal seating for seniors to rest. Weak/unmanageable WiFi. Very poor restaurant selection; why no food court? Seriously you blew this one, and someone needs to be held accountable, but probably won’t be."
13th May 2021,1,"""large, spacious and clean, but not designed that well""","Not Verified |  The airport is large, spacious and clean, but not designed that well. A lot of wasted space that requires a lot of unnecessary walking. The TSA priority lines are a joke. They have some agents sitting at their stations with no one to screen while other lines are overcrowded. Will not be coming through SLC airport in the future."
10th May 2021,1,"""The new SLC airport fails at all of these""","Not Verified |  How to gauge if an airport is a good airport? Average walk time to a gate from the entry? Average walk time from gate to gate? Food options? Average distance of food/drinks from a gate? The new SLC airport fails at all of these. I've listened and talked to airline personnel, strangers, and friends about how painful it is to walk such long distances and the limited food/drink options. I read a Deseret article where they talk about it a ""cathedral to transportation"". I think that might be the problem, they thought they were building a church not an airport people need to use."
9th May 2021,1,"""Laughable that anyone thought this was a good design""",Not Verified |  Worst renovation ever and will only get worse as more people travel. TSA struggled when few people there with new equipment. Can hardly imagine a busy day. The ingress and egress into the airport will lead to multiple accidents and already unsafe conditions driving into the airport. Laughable that anyone thought this was a good design.
29th April 2021,1,"""should be fired over this airport design""","✅ Trip Verified |  Someone should be fired over this airport design. It is not reasonable to expect the average person to walk this distance dragging a 30 pound suitcase. If you don’t need to fly into SLC, don’t."
27th April 2021,1,"""the least friendly airport""","Not Verified |  This airport is a disaster! This was the least friendly airport for its patrons that I have ever been in, and I have traveled a lot. I was excited to try out the new airport since I'd heard so many things about how streamlined and efficient it would be. That is absolutely not the case. When we first departed from the airport, I was very disappointed with how humongous it is, with no concessions for people to move through it easily (except a few slow moving walkways). It is so large it's difficult to get from one place to another, and it takes forever to get anywhere. It seems as if you're walking for miles before you get to your destination, and the signage is not clear, you're not sure where to go. It was a disappointing experience. However, our return experience was even worse! We are 65 and 70 years old. Although we're on the older side, we're in pretty good shape, having just returned from a dive trip. After traveling all day and being worn out from travel, we thought we were going to die of exhaustion before we got out of there. I'm sure we must have walked over two miles just to get out! I have a bad right hip which is usually manageable, but after walking and walking and walking, and walking some more, I thought I was going to die before I got out of there. There are no accommodations for those with health difficulties - how did they ever pass ADA regulations? I didn't see one vehicle that could move elderly or disabled people from one place to another. The design is horrendous - it is so spread out, it's definitely not conducive to anyone that has difficulties ambulating. There is no tram system, as is used in most other airports to move people from one section of the airport to another. Although there is a place for a future tram, it needs to be put in place immediately, not years down the road. And, the way it's laid out, I'm not sure it will decrease the walk time for the patrons. Who designed this thing, and did the city actually sign off on the design? Did they not care about whether it was doable for its patrons? Obviously, no one thought about those that cannot easily walk several miles. And, they have cast the parking shuttles into outer darkness, probably to benefit themselves and their own parking garage. After picking up baggage, you used to be able to walk out the door and pick up the parking shuttles. Now, after walking through the whole airport, you then have to walk another half mile to get to the outside rim of the parking lot to a small designated spot for the parking shuttles. It appears they're trying to drive them out of business and inconvenience their customers! It is really a travesty! The next morning I was almost lame with pain from trying to navigate the airport with my sore hip the night before. I will do everything I can to avoid this airport, I will be driving whenever possible simply to avoid this airport."
22nd April 2021,3,"""It really is a joke""","Not Verified |  Agree with the poor reviews regarding layout and design. Whoever designed this and whatever board approved said design are clueless. The tight connections that Delta was known for here are still present, yet you have to strap on your Hokas and be ready to run a marathon. It really is a joke. I’ll take extra flights to avoid this airport."
18th April 2021,1,"""they will never be able to fix the design of this airport""","✅ Trip Verified | I can not complain enough, swear enough or be so damn disappointed in this airport. I have been flying out of the old airport for more than 15 years 2 times per month or more. It was amazing, easy and efficient. My colleagues loved coming to see us in SLC and always complemented us on our easy our airport was to navigate. We went from my No. 1 most favorite airport to the absolute worst airport in the whole world. Of course it looks nice and is clean, it's new. However they will never be able to fix the design of this airport and the amount of time it adds to my regular travel plans. It will take me 30 minutes just to walk from terminal B through terminal A out of the building and all the way back around to catch the train. I used to be able to walk off the train and onto my flight in 20 minutes, that includes going through security. Anytime you have to post walk times, you failed. I seriously want the tax money back that paid for this. I just cant tell you how mad I am that this is my home airport. Airlines! Please start trying to add flights in Provo! I don't want to have to use this airport."
15th April 2021,1,"""What a shame""","Not Verified |    What a shame. This airport might look flashy, but it worse than the one it replaced in literally every other way I have experienced and can think of. It is truly a tragedy that we are stuck with this utterly horrible design for decades."
14th April 2021,3,"""We are so disgusted at the layout of our airport!""","Not Verified |  We are so disgusted at the layout of our airport! It is such a mess to find where to go! It takes forever to get from point A to point B, you could die of a heart attack! No help, no chairs! I could not take my mother on a trip, she would not survive the airport! Also the park n jet shuttles etc are cast out into outer darkness way behind the entire airport why? You can’t treat us all like this! We will try to avoid this airport, sad thing is that all of our kids and 11 grandchildren live out of state and it doesn’t make them want to visit home now. So sad!"
13th April 2021,1,"""A total and utter disaster""",Not Verified |  A total and utter disaster. The people who designed the new SLC airport should have to spend every work day walking the miles and miles of corridors to go from plane to baggage claim or from entry to gate. It’s simply too much walking. I don’t know how anyone with a disability or anyone elderly can deal with this place. Are we not wanted in Salt Lake City? How on earth did it pass ADA regulations? Not only are distances a problem but checking in on one floor then having to go to another to get to security and the gates makes absolutely no sense. It may be more efficient for the planes but it’s hellacious for the flying public. Can’t understand how such a project could be so badly botched.
12th April 2021,3,"""how is this even legal""","Not Verified |  In an age of project planning, focus groups, and ADA, how is this even legal. Appalling. When I got on the departing flight, a young guy said to the person sitting next to him, ""How many times do you think we've heard the word 'ridiculous' in the last 45 minutes?"" I like to walk, and I didn't have a bag, so my concerns are for those with heavy backpacks, small children, the aged, the unfit, and those on tight schedules. I pity anyone who has more than one of those factors. After a shocking experience departing the airport, I decided to start my pedometer on the airplane when arriving at gate B8, which is not the most distant gate. You could very easily add another .25 miles to the number I'm about to share if you had a B25 gate, or similar. I started my pedometer when I got off the plane to see how far it was to the long-term parking shuttles. It clocked in right at .75 miles. (So if you had a B25 gate, for example, it would be over a mile, I think.) A few other factors to into it to make it better and worse than it sounds. 1) I didn't use any of the moving walkways last night, one of which wasn't working, anyway (at a brand new airport - it had an out of order sign). I did that for two reasons: to measure and also because no one stays to the right on the walkways so you can pass, because they're all so tired of walking. That means that the moving walkways actually slow down the sense of progress you feel you're making on the sojourn. 2) On the escalators, no one walks them, either (for the same reason), so you just have to stand there. Standing actually tires me more, and it's a little frustrating if you're in a hurry. The escalators serve a necessary purpose, though - you probably wouldn't want to opt for the stairs (stair steps, by the way, would add to the length I tracked). You're going under the tarmac above you, and the escalators cover a pretty significant drop and climb. Again, the escalator (and moving sidewalk) could either give you a sense of rest or drive you crazy because they poke along and no one moves on them. If you're in a hurry, you're pretty stuck or you'll need to break a sweat and do the stairs twice (down and up on the other side). 3) There was not a long TSA line, but the wait was still lengthy. The tray system is now automated, but it doesn't speed things up. I think it slows it down. Back in the day, a human being could remove trays and take them back to the front, now they have to be left on the belt to be collected at the end, and the belt isn't very long and there's no place but at the belt to pull your stuff off (often to put it on again). The way they file the people through and screen the trays, the trays and people conning through aren't in the same order--not even close to it (which has always been the case to some degree, but it is way worse now). So TSA will either give you the impression of being able to take a breather or it will ultimately add to the length of your airport marathon. A few other random gripes are that even that strange, white fabric wave art installation (which didn't appear to be working) is an extension of the utter lack of practical planning this entire airport disaster represents. The airport is barely six months old, and it already looks dingy from airplane exhaust. Whoever thought that was a good idea? I remember the lack of cleanability was something observers talked about from day one. The added time makes driving to surrounding states seem better."
12th April 2021,4,"""I can only say what a disaster""","Not Verified |  As a business traveler I can only say what a disaster. The new airport was poorly designed. The construction is a problem however the larger problem is the Atomic security system at the checkpoint. Too small, too slow. The concourse widths were under designed, this airport post Covid will be a total train wreck. They need to fire the airport leadership. The taxpayers of Utah should revolt and demand a refund from the builders and design team!"
12th April 2021,2,"""Until the construction is done, I'll avoid SLC airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Who designed this new airport? I've never walked so much in my life, I feel sorry for families with small kids or anyone physically disabled cause you have to use B gates, you're screwed. Unbelievable that anyone thinks this is acceptable. Until the construction is done, I'll avoid SLC airport."
11th April 2021,5,"""Not enough signs and directions""","Not Verified |  I realize this airport is still under construction. It takes forever to get to the B Terminal. For this reason, I recommend checking in at least 2 hours ahead of flight. New seats are comfortable. Restrooms stalls are nice and roomy with lots of hooks. Not enough signs and directions, and not big enough. Queuing at check-in with my airline was a pure disaster. Over 100 people trying to use 6 kiosks (some weren't working), and the kiosks weren't spaced enough to allow for large families (a common occurrence at SLC) and oversize luggage (like skis). If I could have used a different airport, I would have."
10th April 2021,1,"""This airport is a backbreaker""","Not Verified |  This airport is a backbreaker. The hike from security to the B gates is longer than any chore you want to subject humans to. Anyone with limited mobility, carrying children, or lugging heavy bags will hate this airport. I heard some people joking about the Mormon Marathon, others swearing at SLC, and saw others lost and searching for signage. Too bad you didn't consult a human factors designer for what must be a $B airport."
1st April 2021,7,"""SLC is a sterling, world-class airport, with some wrinkles""","✅ Trip Verified | SLC is a sterling, world-class airport, with some wrinkles. To begin, I absolutely do not understand the onslaught of negative reviews for the newly-completed (and still under-construction) SLC redo. The only explanation I can think of is that those negative reviews are from people driving in from some place like Magna, West Valley, Brigham City, or Wendover who just don't like big cities and big changes. Let me start with the positives of the new SLC, and there are many: 1) TSA staff who are helpful, polite, and explanatory, who don't bark orders officiously, and who efficiently process passengers. The best TSA I've encountered in almost any airport in the USA, except possibly some small airports like Lexington. 2) Architecturally stunning, post-contemporary, and a generally relaxing, open-air design; the closest thing I've seen in the USA to a Seoul Incheon, Hong Kong, and Sydney's Kingsford Smith (though those airports are even more beautiful). 3) Countless art displays in the terminal, completed concourses, and the underground walkway connecting the concourses at present. 4) Dining and shopping options in the Delta concourse (A). 5) Ample displays and signage, from the time you leave I-80 or North Temple to the time you arrive at your gate. 6) Luggage carts prominently located at the entry to the terminal (although you have to pay for them, and I don't like that we have to do that at US airports in general when you don't always have to in other countries). 7) Accessibility by highway, TRAX light rail, or rideshare is a breeze. 8) It's close to downtown, and still a 45-minute drive from Park City, Antelope Island, etc. 9) The restrooms (men's anyway) have stalls which afford full privacy, common in western Europe and wealthier Asian countries but rare in the US. Now, there are some drawbacks that will need to be worked out: 1) There really needs to be significantly improved accessibility between the terminal, baggage claim and concourses, hopefully the new tunnel under construction will remedy that, but there is no excuse for this airport to not already have an active tram. However, despite the naysayers' reviews, it takes 15 minutes to walk across the airport, not 30 minutes. 2) The food and dining options in concourse B (Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc.) could stand to be more numerous. I'll also say that while Uinta Brewing is a great place for a locally-brewed beer, they could stand some competition, as the service frankly wasn't very attentive or friendly. 3) The Southwest personnel weren't very friendly, though at least they weren't rude or hostile like I've experienced from SWA at other airports. 4) If you want to rent a car from SLC, you'll be paying a ridiculous airport surcharge of some kind, I took an Uber to and from Millcreek to rent a car. Even considering the cost of Uber, I still saved $80-100 rather than renting at the airport. I noticed that the rental car facilities from Farmington all the way down to Sandy were almost entirely booked, but the airport still had rental cars available. This is an obvious problem. 5) The WiFI is terrible and needs to actually be accessible for passengers. So, wonderful job overall, SLC! In fact, I'm impressed. Just work out your wrinkles, always find ways to improve and execute plans of action, and you can complete with the very best in Europe and even some in east Asia!"
31st March 2021,2,"""I am thoroughly disgusted with the new SLC airport""","Not Verified |  I am thoroughly disgusted with the new SLC airport! It is an absolute joke to have to walk a mile to get from security to the Southwest gates! And to top it all off there are no transportation vehicles running along that corridor. The only option is a wheelchair! Why in the world would elderly people be expected to traverse that far? And what about families traveling with small children? Who designed this monstrosity? Another thing I am extremely bothered by is how the people on the shuttles from off site parking facilities are treated like second class citizens. Those shuttles are no longer permitted to drop passengers off at the main doors. Instead they are dropped off downstairs, outside and made to trek completely through the car rental parking lots and up escalators to check in. Hotel shuttles are permitted to drop off at the main doors so why not off site shuttles?. Let's see - could it be that airport officials are trying to force passengers to pay their outrageous rates to park in their long term lots? It almost seems like they are trying to put the off site lots out of business! Terrible, terrible experience all around! I am embarrassed that people coming to visit our great state have to be submitted to this as their first impression!"
26th March 2021,3,"""why would anyone think this monstrosity is an improvement""","✅ Trip Verified | Why, why, why would anyone think this monstrosity is an improvement. Bring your track shoes and endurance to navigate the long corridors and endless tunnel to reach your gate. Oh wait, don't forget to stop in Terminal A if you want food, Terminal B has very limited choices especially if your flight is early."
26th March 2021,9,"""Great signage""","Not Verified |  I wanted to give a positive review about new airport. I had read several complaints about long walk to gate, bad signage etc. yes, the old airport was a lot smaller, but I am 67 years old and not a fast walker, but I walked off plane Terminal B gate 10, walked underground to Terminal A, found way to ground transportation. Used the people type movers where available. Took 20 minutes. Information desk told me where to wait for the shuttle to take me to SLC Trax to leave airport. Great signage. When I departed, dropped off at curb, up elevator to security check. Lines not long, but the automated bins seemed really slow compared to other security. So drop off to gate took 35 minutes. I have been in some big airports and 35 minutes is very reasonable. I did not check a bag. Roller carryon. I did not eat or shop. But saw Cafe Rio,"
25th March 2021,1,"""Extremely Disappointed!""","✅ Trip Verified | Extremely Disappointed! I travel for a living and have been in literally a hundred airports across the country and world. I have never been this amazed at the ridiculous lack of attention to the distance a passenger must walk from the parking garage/shuttle, through the hallways and security and then to the gate! I'm not kidding, I'm fit, no disabilities no issues and simply can't believe the distance and time this experience took. Who designed this? Did they consider people or just sculptures and ambiance? Seriously terrible! I loved the old airport, this is awful!"
24th March 2021,1,"""it is terrible""",✅ Trip Verified | Wow true new airport is horrific. Not sure who designed it but it is terrible. Anybody coming should be prepared to walk for 30 minutes or more to get to your gate.
22nd March 2021,2,"""Highly disappointed in new airport""","Not Verified |  Highly disappointed in new airport. Give me back the easy to navigate old one. Left Southwest out of b19. Had to walk a mile. Took forever! Hope they expand Provo so I can avoid this place. Need a tram under the tarmac from main area to the other terminal. Need faster walkways, need carts at drop off. I came back from San Diego airport. Walked 50 yards from drop off to my gate...so much nicer."
21st March 2021,3,"""get ready to walk and walk and walk""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is awful. Unless you happen to be in terminal A in some of the first gates, get ready to walk and walk and walk. In the design they did not include enough escalators and so both arriving and departing you queue to get on the escalator. Also, if you are in terminal B, you need to traverse under the tarmac. This is an incredibly long walk for an airport of this size - they state 7 minutes. Also, they oriented the entry to the airport at the end of terminal A instead of the middle. So for 3/4ths of the gates, get ready to walk. Also, terminal B, there are few amenities vs terminal A. Finally, for baggage claim, you need to commit to walk to one side or the other to see the posted bag claims for your flight. They should have signage before you have to commit to one side or another, otherwise you have to back track. Just feels like they could have accomplished all this with half the footprint. With all of the airport experience around the works, it is impossible to believe this airport could have been this poorly designed. I would recommend a serious rehab to fix these grave inconveniences. That said, it is new and clean. The skis come out on a dedicated ski carousel. The stores that do exist in terminal A are very nice."
20th March 2021,1,"""Very inconvenient on policies for covid""",Not Verified |  Very inconvenient on policies for covid. I parked in short term parking to go inside and pickup my wife. Only to find out they wouldn't let me in the airport without a ticket. Then why did you let me pay to park short term?! I would have just used the park and wait lot.
20th March 2021,1,"""If I could avoid this airport I would!""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airport ever! I have flown in and out of SLC Airport many times over the past 30 years. The old airport was very easy to navigate, but the new airport is horrible. The miles long walk to get from the gate to baggage claim (or security to your gate) might look pretty, but takes forever! We traveled with my elderly in-laws and that walk was the most miserable experience. I can't even imagine what I would do with small children and I even enjoy walking, just not with heavy bags and time constraints! Signage is confusing and it was very difficult to figure out where to find passenger pick up. If I could avoid this airport I would!"

26th October 2021,1,"""Terrible customer service!""","✅ Trip Verified | We returned our rental car at the rental car facility located inconveniently a good distance from the airport. Then you have to take a shuttle bus to the airport with a driver that hates her job and the patrons she is supposed to be serving. Once we were on the bus another couple were running to try to catch the bus! I told the driver before she pulled away but she gave it the accelerator and said, 'Let them catch the next bus!' We had plenty of room and they were obviously in a hurry trying to catch the bus. She didn’t care! I will say the driver that picked us up was very friendly and helpful. We had a 6.15 am flight so we got to rental car return at 4.05 am. The driver dropped us all off at baggage claim! Are you kidding me! Baggage claim for people leaving the rental car station and going to the airport don’t want to go to baggage claim! Who is the genius that came up with this plan? Not anyone who cares about airport patrons! The driver gives no directions about which way to go to ticketing and there are zero signs! I turn to ask the driver for assistance and she takes off! We take the stairs closest to us. When we get to the top they tell us to go back down the stairs and go right to the next stairway! We are elderly and I am disabled from injuries while serving in the military so this was not easy for us! Why can’t you drop departing passengers off at the departure gates! Why can’t you put up signage directing passengers where to go? Why can’t your drivers help passengers with directions? Terrible customer service!"
22nd July 2021,3,"""There are no places to eat""",Not Verified |  There are no places to eat. Food staff at Qdoba were rude and closed in front of me. The airport is pretty full and they need the revenue I bet. People are wandering around to find food. Sad. Let’s get back open. Staff issues are old excuses. TSA precheck was slow and I was only one there. 6 people doing nothing but talking. They had to rescreen my bag twice as they were not able to use the new equipment. Sad.
22nd February 2021,10,"""he made my day which says a lot""","✅ Trip Verified | The bartender at the bar close to gate 26 was the best. I travel a lot and he made my day which says a lot. Super nice, personal, and went above and beyond to make stop/layover a good one. Most people never get reviews so I wanted to make sure he got some credit for being a good human and employee. Thank you!"
15th February 2020,1,"""Ridiculously crowded""","Not Verified |  Hated this airport. I will avoid Southwest connections at this airport in the future. Had to go through security again after landing to get to my connecting flight. Ridiculously crowded, minimal seating, ancient-looking, gloomy, low-ceilinged dinosaur of a terminal. This terminal (Southwest gates 3-20) and any others like it should be torn down and replaced."
14th February 2020,1,"""This is a total joke""","Not Verified |  Connecting flight had to go through entire security screening process again. This is a total joke, if the airport is going to expand Gates then they need to do a better job to about this as it is a waste of money and frustrates travelers."
31st December 2019,4,"""no sign showing the way""","Not Verified | We had an early morning flight on Alaska Airlines, leaving San Diego at 6:45 a.m. When we got off the bus from the Car Rental Center and entered Terminal Two, there was no sign showing the way to the Alaska counter. We had no idea which way to go, and there was no one to ask. We went left, up the escalator, and ended up at the Delta counter. Alaska, it turned out, was at the opposite end of the terminal. We are senior citizens, with luggage, and we had to reverse course and go all the way back to the other end. Is there some reason why the airport can't put signs at the entrance, pointing the way to the various airline counters?"
18th December 2019,2,"""Beware if planning to catch connection and need to overnight""","Not Verified |  Beware if planning to catch connection and need to overnight. So disgusted with San Diego airport. My young son and I had a late night flight and planned to rest at the airport until our early a.m. flight. Security woke us up and kicked us out at 2 am claiming they aren't a 24 hour airport. We are welcome to be on the cold, cement floor at baggage claim and have to be rechecked through security in the a.m. Are you kidding me? I've stayed overnight in airports throughout the states to catch connecting flights. They said the airlines should have told me this. Thanks for the hospitality for weary travelers. All airports should have areas where travelers can rest warmly and somewhat confortably. People can get stranded or not have the time or money to get a room and get back early, utterly ridiculous. Plus, on the other side of security you're somewhat safe, any unticketed person can sleep out here. Unless the security loudly zooming on motorized standup bikes makes things better. Can't believe how annoyed I am while they blast Christmas music and intermittent announcements bouncing off the cold tiles. (Inside the airport they didn't have the announcements)."
3rd October 2019,1,"""poor design and workflow""","✅ Trip Verified | When is the San Diego Airport going to come into the 21st century? One airline three different terminals and 3 different checkpoints. Land in terminal 1, get off the plane and have to go through security to get to the terminal 2 and or 3. This airport doesn’t even have a expedited lane for transferring or connecting passenger through security. Every transferring or connecting passenger has to do a complete TSA screen before they can get to there next flight. How inconvenient is this for families with children, the elderly in wheelchairs and walkers, and for passengers who have close connections. I am all about security, keeping us safe. But let’s be honest, this isn’t about safety, it is about poor design and workflow. I personally have missed a flight do to this set up, where in any other airport this wouldn’t of been a issue. As much as I love San Diego your airport is poorly designed and completely frustrating for travelers."
12th August 2019,2,"""the absolute worst airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  Departed from terminal 1 on August 11, 2019. There is absolutely no where to sit. It took 25 minutes standing in line to get a cup of coffee. As a frequent traveler, San Diego Lindbergh Field is the absolute worst airport I have flown in or out of. Come one San Diego, it is time to expand so people at least have somewhere to sit while waiting for their flight. What a joke."
26th June 2019,2,"""crowded, loud and no seating""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport ever, terminal 1 has 1 restaurant, terminal 2 has 2 dozen. If your stuck in terminal 2 don’t come hungry as there is not enough seats to eat! Since there is very little seating for those waiting to board everyone sits at the restaurant and stays there! It’s crowded, loud and no seating, terrible service! Why have such a huge terminal in 2 and nothing in 1, bad job on the part of the airport to not make the terminals equal."
10th April 2019,2,"""Few seats available""","✅ Trip Verified | Seating (standing) situation is terrible. Few seats available, dirty, crowded. Restaurants and bars crowded and inaccessible. If you're travelling more than two in a group you'll likely not find space together."
18th February 2019,2,"""Long queues at immigration""","✅ Trip Verified | The new international arrivals facility is terrible. Significantly more walking required, up and down escalators, huge amounts of rope barriers. You now clear immigration after collecting bags, mitigating any advantages of arriving in First or Business (at least on BA). Long queues at immigration. What used to take 30 minutes now takes 90 minutes. Such a waste of money and bad planning on the part of the airport. And for some reason you have to show an airport employee your passport to get into the immigration queue - creating another bottleneck. And after clearing immigration and customs you are then dumped out into a little arrivals annex far from the rest of the airport and normal terminal services - requiring a 10 min walk to the taxi or uber areas. SAN has gone from one of the best international arrival ports to one of the worst."
26th January 2019,3,"""terminals are far too small""
","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego International Airport is a perfect example of infrastructure which hasn’t kept up with community growth. The terminals are far too small for the volume of flyers passing through it, and it’s setup is a logistical nightmare. I arrived at Terminal 1 this afternoon and flew out of Gate 2. First problem I noticed was that one can only access certain gates through certain security checkpoints. Gates 1, 2, and 2A are located behind their own security checkpoint which doesn’t have TSA Pre-Check. I am a business flyer and carry an extensive amount of electronics in my baggage, all of which had to come out (in their own, separate bins) to go through the X-Ray. Also had to remove my liquids which took forever. The security line moved extremely slow due to the lack of separated TSA Pre-Check, so arrive early. Once through security, you are guided into an extremely overcrowded waiting area with very limited vendors (similar to MCI, you have to go outside of security to get something to eat). Seating is very limited and the room itself is very dirty, and the boarding posts have zero room to move around. Overall, a very unpleasant experience today."
29th November 2018,1,"""Zero seating for the restaurants""","Not Verified |  Worst connection in America. From Gate 2 to Gate 3 in Terminal 1, you have to exit security and re-enter to make your connection. Just had the pleasure of doing that with 3 adults, an infant and a hungry toddler. Bonus? Zero seating for the restaurants - had to eat in the terminal waiting area. There is standing counters, but they won't work with children. The terminal Wifi doesn't work, so I get to purchase in-flight Wifi to write this review. Worst designed terminal I've seen in 20 years of flying. Designed for pre-security era. Please tear the whole thing down and rebuild."
8th November 2018,1,"""completely disorganized, crowded, dirty""","Not Verified |    Super poor airport, wish I could avoid using this mess! Something like a completely disorganized, crowded, dirty market place. Over priced food stalls with poor quality food and service. However, the staff were friendly and helpful. Thanks for them."
31st October 2018,1,"""security the worst seen anywhere""","Not Verified | I travel several times a month out of Newark (which is stated to be one of the worst in the country but I've never had an issue) and the security experience at San Diego was the worst I've seen anywhere. I was 2 hours early for a domestic flight and the security line was so slow that I only made it to my gate just in time for them to finish boarding. Although the staff was pleasant they were inefficient (eg, multiple staff standing around just watching a partner do something) and slow (eg, I had to stand in the scanner for 3 min, just waiting, until they finally scanned me; the bag review process was longer than other airports; employees walked and talked slowly rather than efficiently and also they were condescending asked spoke as if the passengers were 2 year olds). They have not upgraded to the latest screening procedures or machines so that took longer as well, with people being forced to do things other airports no longer require. Also when the 1st Class or TSA Pre lines were empty they were not increasing efficiency by pulling people in from Economy as they do at other airports."
25th September 2018,1,"""act more like intimidating prison guards""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego “International” Airport’s Immigration Officers and Customs practices are, with very few exceptions, the worst, small-minded, parochial group of bullies I have ever experienced in all my years of international traveling. They have no idea (and they obviously don’t care) that passengers who enter using “Global Entry” have already gone through extensive background checks, finger-printing and biometric security clearances. The whole point of using Global Entry is to already answer such questions as “do you have anything to declare” via the automated kiosks and to confirm one is a trusted traveler. Yet without exception, San Diego Immigration Officers demand one hand over one’s passport and Global Entry receipt, they take an interrogative attitude, study the passport at their leisure and demand to know if one “bought anything or has anything to declare”! The whole point of answering the questions at the kiosk is so there is no need to be interviewed by an Immigration Officer! Every airport in America has fast track lanes where Global Entry passengers automatically walk right through, immigration and customs officials simply take the Global Entry receipt, no stopping, no demanding one hand over one’s passport, no questions asked. Clearly, San Diego immigration Officers do not want to accept the “fast track” part of Global Entry as a way to justify their existence to heavy-handedly screen passengers arriving on what is a minute number of daily international arrivals. Almost without exception, they act more like intimidating prison guards and management obviously allows them to act like this with impunity. This practice is unwarranted, unacceptable and completely defeats the entire purpose of the Global Entry vetting process. Another completely overreaching, baseless practice San Diego “International” Arrivals “Customs” requires is for passengers to queue up after they have passed through immigration and collected their luggage and have all their luggage x-rayed again before they can exit the airport! No other airport x-rays luggage after one arrives at ones destination! This is such typical San Diego small-minded, provincial mentality. As if pre-flight x-ray screening of luggage from international flights is less rigorous than pre-flight x-ray screening of luggage on domestic flights? How arrogant and uninformed. San Diego wants so badly to grow its international flight business, but it will never be an international airport with the immigration and customs practices they are using. With the above practices, it will remain a back-water, regional little airport staffed by amateurs who relish the idea that they are in positions of power and want to bully people. It is far better to fly out of LAX, SFO or Phoenix where the international immigration and customs teams understand their jobs."
18th September 2018,1,"""it was so unorganized""",✅ Trip Verified | We flew into SD airport via a connection. We got off the plane and we were forced to go though TSA again as there gates are connected. I’ve never experienced this at any other airport. They were calling our names since our plane was boarded and it took forever to get through. Southwest luckily waited for us. Because of this disaster we weren’t able to stop and use a restroom or get something to eat before our next five our flight. And to top it off we had to throw away the drinks we bought at the first airport after security since we had to go through again at SD airport. We also flew out of this airport in June and it was so unorganized and we almost missed our flight then too. I’ll avoid this airport at all costs.
1st September 2018,1,"""very few seats available""","Not Verified |  Without a doubt, this is the worst airport I have ever used. Me and my husband departed from Tampa and had to use San Diego Airport to transfer to Boise, ID. We got off our plane and immediately I noticed how crowded this very small terminal was and very few seats available. Most people had to stand in the aisles. I looked at our boarding pass for the next flight and couldn’t find the gate. They do not post any directional signs which is ridiculous. We found a TSA agent for some help and we were informed that it was in another building and would have to be screened again. Couldn’t believe it! Even though we just got off a flight, we had to empty everything on the X-ray belt, including my snacks in my purse. The TSA agents were still pretty nice though so I can’t complain about them. After that fiasco, we wanted to sit down and have something to eat before our next flight but forget about that. They have only a couple of restaurants and all of the space was taken. We will avoid this Airport in the future at all costs."
5th May 2018,1,"""Awful airport""","❎ Not Verified |  Awful airport. One bathroom for an entire terminal? There were lines out the door for both the men's and the women's rooms. One place to eat with no seating and less than 10 items on the menu. No place to sit at the gate. They ask you arrive over 2 hours early for your flight and then offer you no where to sit. I have been to over a dozen different airports and this is by far the worse I have ever been to. The only saving grace is the workers are nice, but when you have no where to sit and can barely move through the terminal, this hardly matters."
27th April 2018,1,"""Terminal one is the worst""","✅ Trip Verified | Terminal one is the worst terminal in the country! It is completely overcrowded with poor restaurants, no Starbucks and one set of bathrooms. It is terrible. I cannot believe the fire marshal can be ok with this. The line for the women's bathroom was 40 people deep! The Counter is ok but overall this terminal rates a 1 out of a scale from 1 to 10."
8th April 2018,3,"""airport is always disorganized""",❎ Not Verified |  It is absolutely ridiculous that someone transferring has to go through security a second time. This airport is always disorganized and has rude workers. And no help is offered for instructions on where to go. There is absolutely no reason to make Gates of connecting flights so far away.
27th March 2018,4,"""There needs to be regulations""","❎ Not Verified |  Dropping my daughter off this morning to go back to college after spring break, a Southwest flight back to UCLA. I pulled up to let her out of the car with her bags curbside with her father and sister to check in. I gave my daughter a hug and began to walk back to my car to go around to the parking area when 2 security guards came up the walk way staring at my car, then the second I get into my seat one security guard began to flash his lights into my car signaling me to leave, “No waiting he says"" as if my car was parked there. I drove away as my husband and daughter were walking up to the car, I had to come all the way back around to pick my husband and daughter up because I didn’t want to be harassed by them. It’s happened before. There needs to be regulations on them. If you can’t drop off your child without getting harassed by security that’s just sad."
19th March 2018,1,"""Just no customer service""","❎ Not Verified |  My son is in the military and was flying to San Francisco then to Korea. We really didn't know where to go. So we tried to check in outside, the gentleman outside was rude. Told us to go inside to the United counter but with an attitude because we didn't know. Then the lady inside told us to stand in another line. We waited there, same lady had to come and help us, but because the other lady was taking to long too check in the customer in front of us. Just no customer service. Was very sad. No smile, no nothing."
22nd January 2018,3,"""Very poor management and procedures""
","✅ Trip Verified | Security checkpoint was ridiculous. Worst I have seen in some time as a frequent traveller. One TSA officer checking ID for everyone including TSA pre. Everyone channeled into one line for x-ray and baggage, with TSA pre still needing to take everything out. What's the point? Very poor management and procedures."
13th January 2018,1,"""It was chaos""","✅ Trip Verified | The change recently to move Uber downstairs on the ISLAND vs where it used to be upstairs at departures is a horrible decision. Myself and 100, it seemed, of my closest Uber friends waited in what seemed like the worst possible location for Uber. It was chaos. The one attendant trying to tell everyone to move was useless and made things worse frankly. Move Uber back, we all know SAN gets tons of money from us/them. The current location seems like an thoughtless decision by someone who has never been to either location. Change it back!"
13th February 2017,7,"""a more pleasant airport than many""","✅ Verified Review | San Diego airport is a nice size but a short on restaurants and other amenities and can be become congested at peak times. At Terminal 1 there are two isolated gate concourses and each only has one real restaurant. You can't get from one concourse to the other without going back through TSA. It's a poor design and gives the vendors in each concourse a monopoly. Getting to the airport can get very congested at busy times as there are some severe bottlenecks for cars, taxis, shuttles, Uber, etc. But at non-peak hours and times of year it's generally pretty good. It's not the airport's fault directly, but the surface streets around the airport are crumbling, sometimes too narrow, have pot holes that could swallow a german shepard, and make getting too and from the airport unpleasant at best. Also look for the nearby Mobile station to refuel your rental car. The closer Shell is nearly a $1/gallon more (at least in Feb 2017). It's annoying all the shuttles, taxis, rental car bus, etc pick you up and drop you off on the other side of an impenetrable fence. So you're forced to go up a long slow escalator to take a sky bridge. Many airports, even much larger ones, have crosswalks across the surface traffic to get to those areas but SAN forces you to use the awkward sky bridge. On the plus side the WiFi is free, fast, and easy to access. What few food options there are tend to be fairly decent (if typically airport expensive). They also have some decent options before passing through TSA (unlike many airports) including the Breeze and Jack In The Box at Terminal 1. And the restaurants that I've been to (including Breeze) clearly display the prices for everything including adult beverages (unlike many airports). TSA lines are generally reasonable and, even at peak times, I think I've waited at most around 15 minutes. But each TSA station serves relatively few gates which helps a lot. It's nothing like the TSA nightmare in Seattle. There's also the relatively new centralized rental car center which is a big improvement over a bunch of little off-site rental locations. The shuttle service is faster and, if for some reason, something goes wrong picking up your rental you have a dozen or so other choices in the same building. Overall SAN is a more pleasant airport than many."
7th July 2016,4,"""never enough seats""","Southwest Airlines terminal has 12 womens toilets for 10 gates, there is always a 15 to 25 plus person line, not for the mens room though. There are never enough seats, the food options lines are always long and if you change planes and get gate 1, 1a, you have to go through security again and there is no TSA line. Hate flying through here."
22nd January 2016,6,"""seating is limited""","SAN is convenient to downtown San Diego, but lack of frequent public bus connection at night and on weekends is a drawback. Circulation between terminals is via shuttle bus, T1 and T2 are close enough together to walk, but the shuttle is handy for commuter terminal access. There isn't a consolidated car rental facility, but off-site locations are much closer than rental facilities at LAX or LAS. Security is quick, but T1 in particular is poorly laid out. Screening area is crowded, seating is limited, boarding areas and restrooms are small, and food options are lackluster (although improving). There is nothing of interest to occupy time while waiting for a delayed flight. Wi-Fi is free but arduous to use, plus it is capped at 30 minutes. Not very user friendly."
18th November 2015,6,"""good variety of shops""","We must have parked at the far end, though the airport is huge. Seats offer recharge facilities for mobile and laptop near boarding gates. Toilets are plenty and never too far. A good variety of shops. Wifi was disappointing. Able to move in and out of the airport quickly."
31st October 2015,7,"""didn't appear to be the case""","Arrived in San Diego Airport from Phoenix. As you land into San Diego Airport, the aircraft flies low near Downtown San Diego. You see also the ocean, as well as boats in the area. In my case, I also saw a vacation Cruise Ship, as well as US Navy vessels in the area. If you are flying into San Diego Airport, try to get window seats. It is totally worth it. While I was waiting outside the terminal to get picked up by family, I noticed that the departing passengers were also being dropped off at the same place where arriving passengers were being picked up. At most U.S airports, departing and arriving car traffic is kept separate, but that didn't appear to be the case in San Diego."
24th June 2015,10,San Diego Airport customer review,"Went through security in under 10 minutes. Many outlets to charge my phone. Variety of food to take on board. Clean, well ventilated. Plenty of seats."
17th June 2015,1,San Diego Airport customer review,I have never had an issue before but I am beyond upset. I got to the airport 2 hours early and check in took me the whole time making me miss my flight. I was in line to check in and was told to go in another line that took forever then finally got up front after finding out I missed my check in time after I kept asking to go to the front to avoid missing having the staff tell me no because I'll make but turns out I didn't make it me now on standby for a flight that's full. Their staff are not helpful one bit.
15th June 2015,5,San Diego Airport customer review,"Utilized San Diego International Airport for a connecting flight. To put it simply, the Southwest Airlines terminal at this airport is far too small to accommodate the amount of traffic that it is currently going through it. It's standing room only more often than not at many of the gates and seating is insufficient. Also, it was very confusing to hear flight information with all the announcements being made over one another. Furthermore, there is only one bathroom facility to service 10 gates. One positive thing about this terminal is the food choices one is offered. Overall, an unpleasant experience at the airport here in San Diego, and one that can be greatly improved for the future."
23rd April 2015,n/a,San Diego Airport customer review,Avoid Terminal 1 Southwest at all costs. This is the most poorly designed terminal I have ever seen. Considerable food stands zero seating. One restroom for 8 gates. Two security lanes apparently performing on- the-job training for TSA staff.
5th January 2015,8,San Diego Airport customer review,This airport has really stepped up its game in recent times with the upgrade. I have traveled through more than 300 airports and this one ranks as one of the more aesthetically appealing I have seen at least in the US. I recall on my first visits in the 90s and early 2000s when the terminal felt very cramped. The hallways were narrow and people were sitting in the aisles because there was not enough room in the gate area. That has changed drastically for the better. The airport is what I would call medium-sized and therefore is quite manageable. Upon our arrival it was late and the airport was not crowded. We were nonetheless struck by the improvements in appearance. The walk to the baggage claim was not bad at all. We did have to wait a rather long time for our luggage and that was probably the biggest negative we experienced. Otherwise everything was smooth. We found our way out to the taxi area without too much difficulty though the directions were not as well marked from our end of the terminal. There were plenty of taxis waiting and we had no problem getting one right away. Our hotel did not have a shuttle and it was about $18 with tip to get to the Hyatt about 3 miles away. There is a lack of transportation options. It would be nice if they extended a light rail line to the airport or provided some alternate means of public transport. With our departure the check-in area functioned smoothly and the security lines were fairly well managed making the wait times pretty reasonable. The facilities in the airport were quite nice. I waited with my daughter for her flight back home and there was plenty of space to sit and relax for the short time before the flight was called. In the Delta Sky Lounge the facilities there were superb. The atmosphere was relaxing and presented a great place to wait for boarding. I did not take advantage of the shops and eating options in the airport while they seemed to be a bit limited the were nice. Overall I was quite impressed with this airport. The size makes it very usable. Getting to the airport and getting away are processes that are manageable. While the facilities might not be as packed with commercial options and eateries as some larger airports it is a small price to pay. The thing that cannot be underestimated is the general atmosphere that simply allows this place to become a very pleasant part of the travel experience and not a necessary evil.
1st September 2014,10,San Diego Airport customer review,Took a flight from London to San Diego. The airport is wonderful very clean and modern and the views of palm trees the bay and skyline from the moment one steps off of the plane (new T2) is a real treat. The immigration and customs area was smaller than expected but I hear they are working on expanding this as part of the general airport expansion plans. Staff is courteous efficient and friendly. The airport is conveniently located minutes from downtown and probably has one of the nicest physical locations of an international airport I've visited - it is surrounded by water and is right across (literally walking distance) from the bay with its resort hotels manicured promenades and huge marinas filled with pleasure boats.
7th April 2014,10,San Diego Airport customer review,Recently traveled through San Diego Lindbergh Field and the newly renovated and expanded Terminal 2 West. In addition to the added gates the new restaurants bars and Sunset Cove area deserve special mention. The new security area was large and easy to traverse with almost no waiting. There's a new elevated departures drop off zone which is very convenient. Improvements to Terminal 1 are being designed. Short of a new airport they've done a nice job.
14th November 2012,3,San Diego Airport customer review,Apparently upgraded recently to international airport and just not up to it. Facilities poor but not as poor as quality and competence of check in and gate staff who appear to be let down by their systems. Not a great advert for what San Diegans call the 'Greatest City in the USA'. If we went back there would seriously consider flying into LAX and driving down.
5th June 2012,5,San Diego Airport customer review,Security was quick and the walk to the gate is very short. However the airport is poorly designed. The gates are very crowded with little or no seating areas. The gate areas are not designed to handle the capacity of today's travel capacity. The gate areas are very dirty with trash everywhere. The airport is badly in need of a redesign and expansion.
24th November 2011,6,San Diego Airport customer review,Flew into T2 on BA. Terminal very quiet and we were through immigration in about 10 mins after leaving the plane. Baggage on the carousel within a further 10 mins. Passengers are then made to stand in line and have their hand and checked bags x-rayed and themselves scanned before being allowed to leave. Big queues by then as another flight had come in. What a shabby way to treat passengers.
15th September 2011,4,San Diego Airport customer review,SAN is very easy to get to your plane whatever time it is. I'm travel through this airport few times a year. The airport practically has to stop in order for British Airways B772ER to takeoff due to very small taxiways. Never had any problems with this airport. I agree T1 should be replaced soon.
27th August 2011,3,San Diego Airport customer review,Like many airports that have expanded in fits and starts over the years SAN is broken up between 3 terminals terminals one and two and the commuter terminal for short flights to Los Angeles. Terminal one is a bit older and cramped especially if you go in the morning rush or fly on Southwest. Terminal two is a bit nicer but currently undergoing expansion construction until 2013-2014. Parking is via shuttle and you have several choices between private and operators associated with the airport. The big plus is that the airport is located 5-10 minutes from downtown.
31st December 2008,2,San Diego Airport customer review,SAN airport is the most poorly designed airport. I live here and have to use that airport weekly which gives me the right to say this airport stinks. Terminal 1 is way too small sometimes so small that when Southwest has long check in lines you can't determine what is the check-in line versus the security line. The other thing is how long it takes to get your bags. I have no idea how places like DFW JFK and even O'Hare can have bags on the baggage claim carousels within 15 minutes of getting off of the plane but at SAN it takes an average of 25-30 minutes minimum - what the heck are they doing?
14th August 2008,3,San Diego Airport customer review,As others have commented SAN is a comfortably sized airport with a somewhat irritating need to go up over a bridge and down again to get from the baggage carousels to the shuttle buses. However a special warning to international travellers. We came in on the new Zoom service from London (8 hrs late but that's another story). The immigration staff at SAN have clearly not yet learned to handle the demands of diverse international passengers. We were on J-1 (exchange visitor) visas - not uncommon you would think for a city with a major international university and numerous high-tech research institutes. The officers appeared completely unfamiliar with this - we were asked if we were students (aged 60+!) sent off for secondary questioning returned waited while a second officer sought guidance from superiors on where to stamp the form.. at least 1/2 hour to our wait time. Another young man coming in on a student visa got similar treatment. I was also struck that the flight crew who have a dedicated desk and in my experience usually walk straight through immigration were waiting in line up to 40 minutes. Next time we'll return to the madhouse of LAX where at least they know what they're doing.
2nd June 2008,4,San Diego Airport customer review,Arrived via AA. Terminal easy to negotiate but it would sure be nice if AA would advise its passengers as to which baggage carousel would be used. Because of SAN weather being pretty much VFR all the time flights are pretty much on time even though there is only one runway. Rental car shuttle vans are a bit of a walk but once you're in your car its a breeze getting into SAN downtown or onto I-5 or I-15 freeways. Great for cruise passengers as you can actually see the cruise ship (s) right outside baggage. AA has a small Admiral's Club with computer terminals and printers if needed.
22nd April 2008,1,San Diego Airport customer review,Just travelled through SAN on my way to PHX. Terminal one must have been designed by a fool who has never been through an airport and has no regard for the needs of passengers. You have to use a sky bridge to get in and out and the terminal must still have the same look and design as when originally opened. Avoid this airport - at least terminal one - at all costs.
3rd October 2007,2,San Diego Airport customer review,SAN is a hogde podge of up and down stairs evolutions. Access and egress with baggage is a pain. It has only one runway and is frequently affected by weather. The old style tunnel like concourses are cramped and the airside concessions are wedged in. Security is also wedged in forming narrow bottlenecks and is subject to frequent delays and back ups The airport authority and the city has resisted moving the airport for years and relied on a never ending series of short term fixes which make the facility ever the more dysfunctional. Not a bad connection if your destination is San Diego downtown but miserable if you are going anywhere else in the region. For one of the nations favorite tourist destinations and a tech hub to have such a poor airport is really a shame. Free wireless sound good though.
26th September 2007,5,San Diego Airport customer review,Travelled through SAN in September and contrary to the last post the airport does have Wifi and what's more it's free! A real bonus. This is a great airport and will be my preferred gateway into Southern California from now on. I previously used LAX which is dire. SAN is fairly small and clean with a good selection of shops and eateries. Parking is convenient and I found no problem using the car hire shuttles. What's more it has the bonus of being right in downtown.
9th October 2006,n/a,San Diego Airport customer review,I'm at SAN several times a year. My main issues are the fact that you have to upstairs for departures (a problem with heavy loads of luggage & the lack of elevators) or to get to any of the parking lots (doesn't make sense to go down to get luggage only to go back up to get to your car). Also the shuttle buses to the rental cars are a severe time- drain. The terminals are small enough that there should only be one pick-up point per terminal to speed things up (rather than 2 per terminal). Also for such a technologically advanced city like San Diego not having WiFi in the terminals is a major sin.
25th February 2005,n/a,San Diego Airport customer review,San Diego airport is a joy to look out the window and convenient only if you arrange for someone to pick you up. Off airport rental cars are an extreme time sink and on-airport (Hertz Avis National) not much better. Why someone would design an airport such that you have to go down the stairs to get your bags on arrival go back up the stairs and then back down the stairs to cross over to parking or shuttles is beyond me. Lindberg Field was great until redesigned. If the airport wishes international traffic I am not sure why downtown in the current spagetti configuration makes no sense. Current proposals include a tunnel to a remote runway across the bay! Why not just build a proper airport and keep Linberg local. A long runway invites noise and a hub temptation that will hopefully die with Delta and United.
25th January 2005,n/a,San Diego Airport customer review,Living in San Diego I constantly use SAN. While Terminal 2 (1998 Expansion) is beautiful and open. The more cramped Terminal 2 (1978) and Terminal 1(1967) are not a joy to go to. After the demise of TWA and the move of Continental and Aeromexico the first part of T1 is all Southwest which could use a face lift bigger areas and new lines. At the other end the virtually empty T1 is only UAL US Airways and Alaska is not to bad. The whole plan should be to make older T1 & T2 just like the new T2 with better Security Immigration and more gates. The commuter Terminal is now a desert and empty with most regional jets at the gates. The runway had a chance to be expanded but the city planners decided to put HOMES! at the end. We could of had an 1000 to 2000 feet of runway a new terminal possibly a expansion of the parking (a parking garage maybe) but we just had to have homes. We lost our only flight to Europe in October 2003 (Yup BA left taking its memories of BCAL's 747/DC-10 and the othe DC-10s744 and 777). But we have flights to Canada and Mexico even though Mexico is 20 minutes away with Tijuana's dirty crowded yet longer runway. But the idea to move it to a floating airport in Pacific Beaches or a military base of Miramar (since the Desert idea and BrownField (Dual National Mexico/US) are dumb ideas. We should just stay and renovate and revamp the area and airport.
26th July 2004,n/a,San Diego Airport customer review,Much like the city of San Diego the airport is small comfortable and intimate. I agree with the previous posts that the sights when arriving are rather unique and breathtaking- the crystal blue waters of the bay the sail boats the city park urban skyscrapers deserts and breaking surf. The airport is small which makes it very quick to get in and out of. There is no need (except for security) to arrive early you should be in and out in no time. The airport has two terminals- Terminal 1 is older and houses Southwest. Terminal 2 handles most of the international flights- there are non stops to London and other global destinations. Terminal 2 is much newer. It is beautiful. San Diego has done a great job with comfy chairs in waiting areas to dramatic public art. I especially like the sealife fountain in the dome. Dining in terminal 2 includes fabulous choices like Wolfgang Puck and Karl Straus. The old terminal has more limited options. San Diego is much nicer to fly into than crazy LAX or John Wayne. San Diego is also the perfect place for a Southern California vacation. I would recommend taking the Amtrak train from downtown or Solana Beach to Disneyland- the train runs along the beach for most of the ride.
8th July 2004,n/a,San Diego Airport customer review,I flew into and out of San Diego in the evening so I didn't see the throngs of people the previous chap mentioned. The food choices are limited and again which seems to be a habit at US airports were mostly closed at that time of the evening. It's extremely irritating to get to the airport and hope for a quick bite to eat and find everything closed. Terminal 2 is clean and comfortable but it's not that clear that you have to go upstairs for check in so navigating isn't that easy.
6th January 2004,n/a,San Diego Airport customer review,As I am at SAN about twice a year I can tell that SAN is a wonderful airport. It's not too big and you have all the shops and restaurants you have at all bibber airports. It has in my opinion the world's nicest approach as you fly almost through Downtown. By the way there are some international flights to Mexico Canada and London.
19th October 2003,n/a,San Diego Airport customer review,Unpleasant airport too crowded and poorly marked/signed nowhere near enough seating areas at gates poor food choices etc. It's great that Lindbergh is so close to downtown it makes it very convenient except that getting to the off-site rental car location also took forever somehow. I think what really did kill it was just that it was incredibly crowded and it made the airport feel hot and unpleasant. I think they'll build another airport in SAN sometime sooner or later there have been numerous discussions about it and I think that since they are basically out of land at Lindbergh they'll find a way to build an airport out in the hot desert a challenge because they have to avoid rather significant mountains.
7th October 2003,n/a,San Diego Airport customer review,San Diego Lindbergh Field is a trip to land at. The runway is not long enough for intercontinental Jumbo jets. On approach (always from the east) the plane flies right next to downtown. Sit on the left if you want to see the workers in the office buildings up close! Just before landing you fly over some houses that are way close to the beginning of the runway. The terminal itself is completely outdated but the location is so convenient to the city that you never have to spend much time there. I don't think there are any international flights from San Diego except to Mexico.
20th March 2022,8,"""extremely clean and efficient""","✅ Trip Verified | I have flown to/from RDU 4-5 times now at different times and hours during 2020-22. I must say that it is one of the best run mid-tier airports in the country. Beautiful and thoughtful design, airy and welcoming, extremely clean and efficient. The security wait times have always been under 10 mins. Decent food and shopping options too. It's hard to fault this one, just needs to step up when it comes to wifi and entertainment options. Otherwise, it's a great airport."
5th August 2021,1,"""poorly run arrival area looks like a COVID hotspot""","Not Verified |  The Terminal 2/AA/Delta etc arrival area, where most airlines come in, is the most poorly run pick up area I have ever been to. Twice this summer I had to experience the gridlock of cars attempting to pick up people at this terminal. There is no way to pull over to pick up people, even when they are right there waiting out front. The security officers yell at you to keep driving around, adding to traffic issues and do not give you a chance to pull over. My 80-year-old mother was stepping across several lanes of traffic to try and reach me and the security officer was yelling at both of us. I had already circled around 3 times! The poorly run arrival area looks like a COVID hotspot. If they would let you pick up passengers, there would be fewer problems. They should redirect rental car buses to another location or spread arrivals out so there are fewer people trying to be picked up at the same time. The security officers should get off of their Segways and try being helpful instead of yelling at elderly people and those picking them up."
18th May 2021,1,"""no free internet available""",✅ Trip Verified |  Remarkable that they speak several languages over the loud speaker but have no free internet available. A disgrace to the travel industry. I will rethink coming through RDU ever again.
17th January 2021,2,"""give yourself far more time than you think you’ll need""","Not Verified |  The airport staff, especially American, appears to be inept. You’d think in a small regional airport that you’d get through it more quickly than a major international one. If you thought that like me, you’re gravely mistaken. RDU is the worst-functioning, most difficult-to-manage airport I have been to! Be prepared to wait, and give yourself far more time than you think you’ll need."
3rd November 2019,2,"""a negative experience""","Not Verified |  TSA employees in Terminal 1 were rude and totally unnecessarily aggressive in screening/searching people. Worst I've seen. We were surprised as we never had such treatment in Terminal 2 which we normally use. Found Terminal 1 to be like a bus station. Insufficient restaurants, limited seating. Overall a negative experience."
27th September 2019,1,"""TSA agents couldn’t have been more unprofessional""","Not Verified |  I was traveling from RDU back home to Pittsburgh with my son and daughter. We had an 8.15 am flight so we arrived at RDU by 6.30 am to give us plenty of time check our luggage and pass through security. The TSA agents couldn’t have been more unprofessional and down right rude. There was no explanation of what to do they just started yelling at my son and daughter to walk in a line and telling them they were “moving to slow” and “walk at a normal pace”. My son has ADD so when no instruction is given I’m not sure how he would no what to do, especially being 9 years old and never flying before."
18th August 2019,1,"""My wife, son and I missed our flight""","Not Verified |  The TSA need to either hire more employees or find a faster way to get people through to their flights. My wife, son and I missed our flight because of the TSA line being wrapped all the way around the building. We would have made it had they done a better job moving people through with flight times leaving soon!"
20th July 2019,1,"""hour wait for security""","❎ Not Verified | Leaving Raleigh-Durham airport in the morning is a nightmare! I have never seen anything like this. An hour wait for security alone. The situation is a disgrace to the Triangle area. If Atlanta, Chicago and other massive airports can accommodate a morning crowd without a wait like this, RDU should be able to. Get your act together!"
13th April 2019,5,"""TSA person scolded me""","Not Verified |  TSA person, I felt scolded me for wearing the type of personal undergarments I was wearing. She very harshly pointed to areas that had to be verified safe. As a fuller upper body, I am accustomed to being patted down due to being of ample upper body and whatever but this time, the TSA person, in my opinion went to far. I told her I had on spandx and she said “that’s just not spanx, you have something else”. I was absolutely flabbergasted. So, after being patted down to a degree of humiliation, she said” you can go.” There were all male TSA and male employees around. I know all this is for security. It’s not pleasant but I do understand. However, some things are just common sense. All other agents that day were professional and kind. Where as I would have rated this experience a 10, the TSA episode bumped the rating to 5."
9th December 2017,3,"""had a terrible experience""",❎ Not Verified |  I had a terrible experience at the Raleigh airport TSA check in. The check-in people were extremely rude. I am pregnant traveling alone carrying my luggage and they made me go back to the end of the line for a small amount of water in my water bottle. The supervisor and check in staff were extremely rude and harsh. I ultimately had to throw away my water bottle since I was pressed for time.
2nd September 2017,5,"""wait an hour for a gate""",❎ Unverified | I am normally quite happy with Raleigh-Durham but we just arrived back from vacation this evening and the airport made us wait for an hour until a plane could leave our predetermined gate. I have been at other airports that will just reassign the plane to another gate so that passengers can continue on with their journeys without the inconvenience of the delay. I found this extremely disappointing since I expected RDU to have a better customer satisfaction operation. I blame airport operations for this blunder and feel this could be addressed as an improvement opportunity.
24th July 2017,10,"""open, clean, and inviting""","✅ Verified Review |  First time going to this airport since 2007 and since then it has completely renovated and added two new terminals to replace the old ones. Terminal 1, dominated by Southwest, is open, clean, and inviting. There were no lines at security, and I went through the TSA line within five minutes. The terminal was easy to navigate, with plenty of open space and updated arrival and departure screens for the various flights. Upon returning home, it was easy to find baggage claim and wait for my ride."
31st May 2017,2,"""every employee there was rude""",Horrible Airport. I arrived here at 8 am eastern time through mid work week with barely anybody there. Every employee there was rude as can be and was doing everything but their job. I can say I will not be flying through or from this airport ever again.
10th October 2016,1,"""a horrible experience""","✅ Verified Review | Took JetBlue Flight #985 on Oct 9,2016 from NYC to Raleigh-Durham. When we arrived in RDU, the gate was closed and passengers had to yell to be let out. I parked my car in parking lot 3 so needed to take airport bus. The bus was leaving as I got to the bus stop and I waved the lady to open the door for me and she refused. It was 2:30 AM. There was nobody else on the bus. Had to take taxi, so ended up paying more then parking at the premium parking. What a horrible experience."
28th August 2016,9,"""impressed with the facilities""","Cannot believe that no one has reviewed RDU since 2014. The airport has two terminals. One is for Southwest Airlines and has been recently renovated while the other houses most other airlines and was opened in 2011. In August 2016, I traveled through the airport 4 times and found the TSA security lines to run smoothly, especially for pre-check passengers. There are plenty of shopping and catering options inside the terminal once past TSA. The restrooms are clean in the departure gate area. The architecture is modern and spacious, but it already appears that the terminals are crowded at times, especially in the baggage area. One airline has the right to one baggage carousel and when several flights are arriving at once, it is a bit chaotic down here. There is a decent area for arriving passengers to be met by incoming passengers with public restrooms and a Starbucks. I have never arrived internationally, so I cannot attest to those facilities, but considering there are only 3-4 per day, it should be adequate. As a frequent traveler throughout the world, I can confidently say that I am impressed with the facilities of RDU and find it one of the best airports in the world."
1st June 2014,9,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,Very nice and new airport. Easy to get to and from Raleigh Durham area. Parking is easy. Security lines were short. Not a very crowed gate area. Straightforward layout. Lots of destinations considering the size of the airport. Not very good public transit but taxi costs are not high. Prices are reasonable to fly in and out.
31st March 2014,10,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,Traveled here to teach in Triangle once a week since fall of 2012 always to T2 on Delta American and JetBlue. A number of superlatives: Parking close by and easy to access. TSA screening faster than any airport I have encountered in US. New modern terminal easy to navigate with all my airlines within easy walking distance of each other. Plenty of amenities with good food good service.
20th December 2013,10,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,Pleasure to able to use this flexible and modern medium sized airport as a launching pad to the world. Never any hassles with parking security baggage or overall facilities and friendly staff always willing to oblige. Major airports visited this month including DFW (Texas) Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane (Australia) don't hold a candle to RDU is every respect.
27th August 2013,10,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,RDU is clean quiet efficient and elegant. Great experience in smooth security line at the comfortable gate area and in the diverse and high-quality shops in the terminal.
23rd December 2012,10,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,Nice airport for its size. Terminal 2 (the new one) has enough amenities even though you only have two options - turn left or right. Security area was large enough with a minimal line even on Thanksgiving. CLT has more options but RDU is more modern-looking (for what that's worth!).
25th October 2012,10,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,Have not flown out of new T2 since they opened up the entire terminal last time just half of it now both wings are open and it is immaculate. One of the top terminals in the country for an airport its size. Plenty of shops food etc. Security well organized did not take long. Comfy seating powerports etc. Great place to fly out of. They are now starting to renovate old T1 which is abysmal. Avoid it if you can only Southwest uses it now.
22nd October 2012,10,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,Left T2 for IAD on United. Our first use of this facility vast improvement over the old one. Clean bright plenty of seats most with charging points and good refreshment outlets. All staff polite.
4th September 2011,4,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,The new Terminal 2 is where all airlines except Southwest use. Terminal 2 is bright clean and pleasant. There are shops and restaurants. RDU is never really that busy given the relatively small population of the Triangle area. I've been to this airport five times in 6 months. The only issue I have is that there is no free wifi.
29th June 2011,5,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,"RDU is the perfect size and well run. Not too small not too large. It's just right. The new terminal 2 is modern clean has beautiful indirect natural lighting from large skylights and has wonderful acoustics. Even when very busy it is not loud inside at all. The atmosphere here gives the feel of ""calmness"" which is quite a feat for an airport these days. They really did a wonderful job building this terminal. Clean. Pretty. Nice bathrooms. Very good selection of restaurants. Efficiently run security and friendly staff too. Parking is very easy. My favorite place to park is Fast Park & Relax. You can't go wrong with Raleigh-Durham."
27th March 2011,5,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,The entire terminal 2 is now open and operating. It is gorgeous! I've been through quite a few airports in my life and RDU has got it right. Very modern comfortable good outlets for food and shopping spacious clean and interesting art and aesthetics. Unfortunately if you travel on Southwest JetBlue or Air Tran you will have to use the old crowded and substandard terminal 1.
12th August 2010,4,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,T2 impressive. Arrivals good however immigration could do with a few more staff especially when a full London flight arrives. Baggage delivered quickly. Staff easy to find which is always a good thing. Departures excellent with plenty of areas to sit and plenty of options for eating and shopping. Gate areas clean and I really like the seats with the charging outlets for charging ipods phones and laptops. Overall great airport which I look forward to using again.
1st February 2010,5,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,Left from the new T2 last week - nice to see such a nice new modern facility. Check in and security quick and efficient many options for food and beverage as well as shopping. Concourse is one long linear layout with moving sidewalks so very easy to navigate and get your bearings. Not much in pre security side however.
20th August 2009,5,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,My first visit in and out of the new terminal 2 and I have to say I was completely impressed! I live abroad travel rather often and feel that this terminal is one of the best I've ever traveled in and out of: open and bright design clean lots of toilets very comfortable and large chairs in all boarding gate areas a decent array of food options plasma displays all around baggage claim large and easy to navigate and a open and convenient check-in area. Terminal 1 on the other hand is really basic. Depending on your airline RDU can be a great experience or just an average one. Can't wait for the whole terminal 2 to be completed and hope I never have to go in and out of terminal 1 again. Good job RDU!
7th April 2009,4,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,"The renovation project has been finished and it looks beautiful. The terminals have been renamed ""1 and 2"" and most airlines have been moved over to terminal 2. There are multiple food options (both sit down and fast food) with several focusing on healthy eating. Security is a breeze. Hopefully terminal 1A is either renovated or torn down."
4th July 2008,2,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,RDU is my home airport. The airport is divided between terminals A and C. Terminal A houses the majority of the airlines. However the terminal was never meant to be permanent as Terminal C used to be an American and Midway Airlines hub. As a result Terminal A is adequate but nothing special. The facilities are nice except for the Southwest and US Airways baggage claim area (it is a dump). There are enough shops to keep you occupied until your flight arrives (on the concourse level that is; the baggage claim and ticketing level which is also a waiting area for those waiting for someone to arrive has virtually nothing to entertain people). The downside is that there are no moving walkways and the terminal stretches a good distance (word of advice: if you have a flight with Northwest or Continental wear comfortable shoes as the gates are at the far end of the terminal). Terminal C on the other hand has fallen behind the times and is quite drab. Half of the terminal was torn down to be rebuilt by the end of summer of 2008. The side of the terminal currently open is pretty poor with barely any shops to entertain travelers and with much of the building seeming in disrepair. With the second phase of the construction of terminal C to be completed by 2010 or 2011 the terminal will be much nicer. There is nothing terrible about RDU but when compared to other airports it is average at best.
5th March 2006,n/a,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,I have only used the new terminal C at RDU (which provides only for AA United and Air Canada). I flew on United who were terribly understaffed creating a huge queue. I had to wait in this line on two consecutive days due to my flight being cancelled because of weather. Terminal C is a terrible place to have a flight delayed - there are only two or three commercial outlets in the building (coffee alcohol newspapers). The terminal is clean and modern and would be fine if you were guaranteed to only have to stay for a small amount of time.
8th January 2006,n/a,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,"At the moment the airport is a bit crowded in terminal A and it isn't so ""pretty"" but with the new construction at terminal C the future looks to be better. At the moment terminal C is a bit quiet and uncrowded albeit plain. Terminal A is crowded but has enough shops to help kill time before a flight. I have used the long-term parking in lots 3 and 4 and found them to be fairly convenient for short trips. You have to wait for the bus but it comes pretty often. My only complaint is about the security. In terminal A the security checkpoints are so overcrowded (and they have two of them!) so it takes time to get through them. Terminal C seemed less so. After breezing through ATL and ORD’s security checks it was a shocker for an airport this size to have such long waits. Lastly on a positive note RDU has a great web site!"
27th July 2005,n/a,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,"Although the terminals are getting older it is not that bad to find where you need to be. They have parallel runways so Terminal A (actually 2 connected terminals) are on one runway and Terminal C (being torn down but still operational) is on the other runway. The new super terminal ready in 2009 will be really nice and look well with what is the nicest ""car park/garage"" in the world. This huge goliath of a car park sits between the 2 terminals. Security is OK but a little tight in Terminal A. If you fly NWA their gates are at the very end and is a ""nice"" walk. Busy airport but not super big or super large. The triangle is great place to visit and do business."
6th June 2005,n/a,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,Anyone that is coming into RDU and is not from the area should be aware that the airport has building/concourse A A C. Not A B C or A1 A2 C. The only way I describe it to people in the first A or the second A. A bit confusing. Both A's are fairly close together thankfully. Really not sure how the airport describes it but found the locals as confused as I.
19th September 2004,n/a,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,This airport is a nightmare for anyone waiting to pick up a passenger unless of course you happen to arrive in your car just as the person you are picking up comes out of the front doors. There are few if any places to eat if you wait. There are very few seats to sit in if someones flight gets delayed. Should you by chance be a visitor from another country I can only say that the counter that exchanges money has rates that might be the worst in the world. On the flip side this airport might have one of the best covered parking lots I have ever seen.
28th February 2022,1,"""airport is the lowest of the low""","Not Verified |  Philadelphia airport is the lowest of the low. Toilets are dirty and don’t work, towel dispensers/air dryers don’t work, carpet and cleanliness are disgusting, escalators or travelators don’t work, car parking open spot numbers don’t work, car park payment (even auto pay) does not work, lounges are over crowded."
7th February 2022,1,"""Rudest staff I have ever had the displeasure of talking to""","Not Verified |  Rudest staff I have ever had the displeasure of talking to. Just needed to know how to get to my terminal. Stopped one TSA lady and she was very nice just couldn’t read a ticket to see the gate so another guy came over, took the ticket from her then started walking away without even saying anything to me at this point. So as I’m trying to find out where he’s going with my ticket since I have 10 min at this point to find terminal F and the shuttle to it and he starts being very rude to me and raising his voice so I ask for my ticket back and tell him if he’s going to treat me like that then I don’t want his help. His response is to holler at me as I’m walking away still being rude and hollering that he hopes I miss my flight. Rudest, most unprofessional person I have ever had the displeasure of being around. Then I asked at the shuttle if I was in the right place to make sure that I was and the 2 ladies there just point and holler terminal F! Could have just nicely said ""yes this way"". The people working at this airport should really be taught some politeness and customer service. It’s ridiculous how they treat people who are just trying to find their gates. Management should be ashamed of their staff. Traveling is already stressful enough without their added nastiness."
31st January 2022,3,"""This airport is poor""","This airport is poor. Shameful. Pre check TSA are all closed. This doesn’t even make sense. Nothing but a shrug of the shoulders from TSA people, who have no patience. No food on any terminal legs is available. And what is open on a Sunday, closes at 8.00. Nothing like a Dunkin munchkin for a snack at the airport. Disgraceful. Who would be the person who could fix this problem? No one cares."
25th November 2021,1,"""Permanently closed economy parking!""",Not Verified |  Permanently closed economy parking! 100s of parking spaces gone! Been using Philadelphia airport from home in Delaware. Hello BWI - a lot of economy lots and free shuttles.
13th November 2021,1,"""Extremely dirty terminals""","Not Verified |    dirty terminals, walking from term B all the way to term.F, was constantly seeing people food bags, soda cups, napkins and smaller pieces of garbage on the floors. Didn't see many cleaning personnel out and it's only 9:30pm. Also don't come here hungry or planning to eat after 9pm, ALL the restaurants are closed. Pretty much I would recommend, in my opinion, to avoid this airport if you can. If you can't, hopefully this review helped you be better prepared than what my family and I are dealing with"
22nd August 2021,1,"""staff was incredibly rude""","Not Verified |  This is the rudest airport I have ever been through. I’ve gone through Minneapolis, Chicago, DC, Denver, Houston, and Charlotte, and this was the worst experience I have ever had. The staff was incredibly rude, and treated me like if I asked a question I was immediately an idiot. The staff was too impatient, too rude, and too arrogant to be of any real help. I’m not from the Philly area but this airport alone helped me realize I will never come back. The only positive of this airport is the music. They have okay music. Genuinely wish I could give the overall and staff ratings a 0."
18th August 2021,1,"""Service has been awful""","Not Verified |  Service has been awful. People standing in line for hours without the lines moving because they have only one person working. Really? People have been here in line since 4 am for a 6.30 flight. Workers outside cut all of us out early when we actually had time to make our flights, between 50 or more are having to reschedule flights for later in the day after standing in line in the same spot for 2 hours to catch our flight. Ridiculous. When it’s the airport's fault."
23rd July 2021,2,"""I have seen no cleaning staff""",Not Verified |  The terminal B bathrooms are dirty. The carpets and chairs in terminal B are dirty. I have seen no cleaning staff and have been here more than an hour.
18th July 2021,1,"""This airport is so disgusting!""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is so disgusting! It's filthy dirty. The ladies room by our arrival gate in Terminal E had toilet paper on the floor coming into and out of which was viewable from the concourse. Trash littered the gate areas and terminal walkways. The inside of the entire airport needs a complete makeover. The City of Philadelphia needs to spend some serious money and get this airport up to standards! This is definitely another embarrassment to the City of Philadelphia, in addition to their increasing murder rate!"
28th June 2021,1,"""The worst, rudest airport I have ever been to""","Not Verified |  The worst, rudest airport I have ever been to. TSA said my ticket was invalid then said it was the machine when someone else verified it was valid. Then while everyone else passed through, I was asked 3 times ""are your pockets empty"", I had my hat and belt buckle searched and that was the good part. We see an earlier flight so we get put on standby. If we get on cool, if not cool. The employees were clueless and the process was in complete disarray. ""Those without a seat assigned board on 7"". Hey we're on standby without a seat assignment. ""You need you wait over there"" ok sorry mam. ""Final call! If you're boarding flight x you need to board now"" hey mam were on standby. ""Wait over there until called"". I've been through and lived in Chicago/O'hare, Paterson/Newark airport and a few others and by far Philadelphia employees are mostly rude and clueless. I suggest using Newark or Trenton unless you want to be ripped off and treated poorly."
7th April 2021,1,"""I have never seen such a dirty airport""","Not Verified |  I’ve traveled quite a bit and been to many airports. I must say, I have never seen such a dirty airport. The women's bathrooms were disgusting, the smell was intolerable. The carpet in airport was dirty as well as the floors. I’m really hoping someone reads this review and hires a cleaning crew in order to keep travelers safe. During these times of covid safety, cleanliness should be a top priority."
6th January 2021,1,"""it increasingly gets worse""","✅ Trip Verified | I’m shocked. I’ve been flying out of Philadelphia airport for 3 years now about 3-4 times a year and it increasingly gets worse. Walking out of Terminal C to baggage claim is now home to homeless people. I’m sad they can’t get warmth outside but to be in the airport is not okay. All the bathrooms in and out of the airport are disgusting. It’s like they only clean once a day for thousands of travelers. Not to mention the lack of customer service - it’s time to start teaching hospitality! And be careful with your luggage at baggage claim. They never have the right track marked with your arriving flight. With homeless around, I’m sorry to say your bags could be stolen when you’re waiting around track F for 45 minutes to then be notified on the loud speaker your bags were at track B the entire time. Get some help Philly."
5th March 2020,1,"""Shame on the city of Philadelphia""","Not Verified |  Urine smell in filthy restrooms - men's and women’s. Dirty floors, dirty seats, did not see one single custodial person doing any cleaning. Absolute disgrace for the city of Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania. Shame on the city of Philadelphia. "
2nd March 2020,1,"""update the terminals so we can stay connected""","Not Verified |  Very frustrating that 1/2 of the seating have power connections and only 1/2 of those are plugged in or even work! No power towers either! Welcome to the 21st century, update the terminals so we can stay connected or continue to work while we wait for our next flight."
14th January 2020,10,"""the people at this airport helped me out""",Not Verified |  I have to say the people at this airport helped me out on my last travel. When I was recently here it was still pretty warm out so I was wearing my vans flip flops when I was traveling and my regular shoes were already in checked luggage. Anyway when I went to take off my flip flops in the security line I accidentally ripped the top part holding the right flip together. That meant the only way I could have walk was to walk barefoot with my right foot and carry the flip flop. Right when I was about to do that walking away from security after I got though they said they didn’t want me to have to walk through barefoot so they called someone to push me to where my flight was in a wheelchair so instead of my foot touching the ground it was on the footrest of the wheelchair.
21st November 2019,1,"""Horrible in every way""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible in every way. Only 3 officers working with 300 people waiting, unbelievable bad organizational skills there, we missed our connection flight , waited 1 hour to get thru the officer window for a transit flight. They had 27 windows and all empty but those 3 officers handling 300 people at the same time. Just hire more, make them work, we pay for their salary. The information desk was super rude and mean and not helpful. Super mean. The worst airport ever, shame."
24th October 2019,1,"""Not a pleasant airport experience""","Not Verified |  I'm really disappointed in the lack of assistance the staff of Adelaide Airport offered to me - as well as the staff of Virgin Airlines. I foolishly left a rolled up piece of native Australian Artwork on a seat outside of Gate 16 - A beautiful souvenir that I bought in Darwin and one that I was really excited to hang in my home as a memory of my trip. I was a bit flustered while getting to the gate - as many are in airports, and as a consequence I left my souvenir on the seat. I realised this on the flight and when I landed in Melbourne, I first asked The Virgin Airlines staff to help me - which they refused, telling me its not their issue and to contact Lost and found. I immediately contacted lost and found, only to be told that it will either be stolen or handed in. Even though I described to them exactly where it would be - after only an hour in transit - the women refused to send someone to check if it was there, claiming that is 'not part of their policy'. Really, how difficult is it to just check if somethings there or not? Its a darn shame that I left it there, but im also really saddened by the lack of support that Adelaide Airport and Virgin airline Staff offered me. Not a pleasant airport experience at Adelaide Airport."
16th October 2019,10,"""TSA agents were calm and respectful""","✅ Trip Verified | A fast friendly curbside baggage drop was just the beginning of this fantastic stay at the AA gates at PHL airport. After the fantastic bag drop process I was directed upstairs to the security check. I was 4th in line. How does that happen! The ticket check was efficient. The security check was calm and in control, ample signage ensured that even non-seasoned travellers knew what had to be removed from their bags. The TSA agents were calm and respectful and made the whole process significantly smoother. In fact I think repacking my toiletries and putting my shoes back on took longer than getting to the gate. The American gates at PHL has just overtaken Nashville as my #1 US airport experience."
11th October 2019,1,"""given conflicting instructions""","Not Verified | I can’t complain about the people as many have here. My issue is with the arbitrary processes especially at security lines. My companion and I were given conflicting instructions as to what needed to be removed from bags or persons in order to be scanned. I was told to remove my belt and iPad but keep my shoes on and my partner as told the complete opposite. My major issue however was again with TSA. Despite having a 3-hour layover and my bag being screened internationally twice already, TSA in Philadelphia decided to hold it for scanning so it never made my connecting flight. How long does it take to scan a bag?"
7th September 2019,1,"""no clear information or urgency""","Not Verified |  This is the worst airport experience I have ever had. Flight was two hours late and had 15 min to make connecting flight. There was no clear information or urgency to help people with issues of connecting flights. Staff were not helpful and was given incorrect information regarding where I needed to go and how to get there. Gates and buildings are far apart and again staff was not helpful. Missed connection and spent night in airport. If you have a choice, avoid this airport at all cost."
9th August 2019,1,"""airport is poorly organized""","✅ Trip Verified |   We had a layover at the Philadelphia Airport (PHL). Our flight arrived roughly two (2) hours before our connecting flight was set to depart. We had to wait in four (4) different lines, totalling almost three (3) hours. Throughout the stressful lines for customs kiosk, customs agent, agriculture and TSA, all but one TSA agent were yelling and being rude to the people waiting in line. There were no clear directions on where to line up at agriculture, yet an employee was yelling at the people to line up a certain way. She got even ruder and more upset with people when they did not understand her directions. I heard employees complain about not getting paid to load baggage on the conveyer belt and how they better get disability if they get hurt, this was all in front of the people in line. No one monitored people cutting in front of others in the lines. The airport is poorly organized and definitely does not demonstrate 'brotherly love', despite Philadelphia's motto. Luckily, our connecting flight was delayed so we were still able to make the flight. I will not be choosing flights that arrive or depart from this airport again."
1st August 2019,1,"""airport is the absolute worst""","❎ Not Verified | I have flown out this airport 4 times in the last 2 months. I travel a lot so have experience in airports and travel. This airport is the absolute worst I have ever been to. The people are so rude! They scream at you continuously from entering the check points to loading, etc. I’m so sick and tired of being treated in this manner. It’s totally uncalled for. The employees are rude, disrespectful and worthless! I will follow through with more complaints and reporting. I will not use this airport ever again."
5th July 2019,1,"""seating at gates is not sufficient""","Not Verified |  American Airlines had no working planes but made us wait 4 hrs before cancelling at 2am. All airport restaurants/stores and many restrooms closed at 10pm, making 10-2 miserable. Airline Staff were complaining, rude and uninformed. Meal vouchers were issued but the places to use them at the airport the next day were inside the security gates. TSA staff got ugly with a deaf man who couldn’t understand them rather than seeking an interpreter or using a visual communication system, seating at gates is not sufficient for number of travelers on one plane. Bring your own food, a change of clothes, a lot of patience and a plan b because this will be the worst airport experience you have ever had."
23rd June 2019,1,"""a poor experience""","❎ Not Verified | In general, airport signage is confusing, airport personnel very rude and not helpful at all, TSA staff are rude, incompetent, and have no business being in that line of work, apparently janitorial staff are non-existent and I felt I needed a shower after walking through there. All in all a poor experience and I hope I never have to pass through that airport again."
20th June 2019,1,"""Worst airport experience I have ever had""","Not Verified |  Worst airport experience I have ever had. Came off plane and waited almost 2 hrs to get through security, only to go through more security, another wait! Then onto connecting flight, more waiting to go through more security, placed baggage in connecting baggage area, guys so ignorant they wouldn’t lift a suitcase onto scales for my daughter. Then when I put them up they literally tossed them onto escalator, then off to get next flight and another 30 min wait getting through, you guessed it, more security. Just made me even more determined never to return to the states."
11th June 2019,1,"""worst airport experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airport experience ever! All staff interactions have been very unprofessional so far. They should all be trained properly in their customer customer service skills. The way that I’ve witnessed them talk to people in this airport is absolutely disrespectful, disgraceful, and disgusting."
29th May 2019,9,"""staff helpful and nice""","✅ Trip Verified | I was shocked by the facilities offered in Terminal B, as well as the connector area between all terminals. There is plentiful seating, with most seating offering clean white tables with outlets and USB plugs. The bathrooms were also brand new and no exaggeration, the cleanest and most well-manufactured airport bathrooms I've seen. Many many food options, including iPads in most gate areas, on which food and drinks can be ordered. The AT&T sponsored wifi is quite good, and the staff were overall quite helpful and nice."
19th May 2019,2,"""Employees unfriendly and miserable""
","Not Verified |  This continues to be the dirtiest, grungiest, most unattractive airport I have to deal with. Dark and dreary void of any natural light. Employees unfriendly and miserable. Lack of any outlets and minimal charging stations. I’ve been to Tampa, Dallas, Phoenix, Orange County and many more, all so much nicer than Philadelphia. For such a busy airport that continues to grow they are not keeping up with travelers demands and Needs. I would avoid stopping here if I could."
15th April 2019,2,"""endless line of  passengers""","Not Verified |  When we arrived at the airport and wanted to go through security check there was an endless line of waiting passengers. I estimate 300 feet. I never have experienced something comparable. After the check we wanted to grab a coffee at the coffee shop, and they just were not able to make it. There were too many customers and the girl at the coffee machine was too overwhelmed."
28th March 2019,2,"""Fool me twice shame on me""","✅ Trip Verified | Have only used this airport twice in my lifetime and will never fly American Airlines again. This is a hub for them as we were flying internationally to Rome and beyond. As stated they have lost my luggage twice and I have only used them twice, so enough said. We arrived in plenty of time for our connection and had something to eat. Open air restaurant good however, the temperature in the entire airport was well over 80+ degrees. It became so uncomfortable that at one point we ventured out back thru security just to get some fresh air. The airport is OK but, security is rude and sorry but if you can't get our bags on the connecting flight what's the point? Airplane boarding went fine but here is where the glitch comes in. It's March so they have to de-ice. We sat on the tarmac for over 3 hours as apparently someone forgot to put in an order for the actual supply and they ran out of de-icer fluid. The pilot was peeved and again no ventilation on the plane so temps now reaching well into the 90's. Separate review of American, sadly this is what flying comes down to now. I guess the pilot flew really fast  as we made it to Rome, a flight crew guy got us to the gate with an hour to spare but alas the bags never made it. Fool me twice shame on me."
5th February 2019,6,"""the rudest people""","Not Verified |  TSA personel were the rudest people I have ever dealt with. It wouldn’t hurt to be just a little kind. If they aren’t happy with there job, they need to move on."
14th November 2018,3,"""Shame on you Philly""",Not Verified |  The security staff were friendly. The water fountains are all out of order and the restaurants will not give you a cup of water even when requested. They all said I could buy a water which was between $2.50-4.00. Rip off! Each place was rude about it too. Other airports have filtered water fountains. Shame on you Philly!
6th October 2018,1,"""Nasty people running this place""",Not Verified | Horrible unfriendly attitude by every employee I met except the ladies at the information desk. No smiles and if you asked a question you got a glare not an answer. Nasty people running this place.
20th September 2018,2,"""Not a good experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Rude treatment when entering through customs from Europe by both Customs official and TSA. As we stood in line, an official from customs and one from TSA, at separate times in different areas shouted at both my husband and I, ""Get behind the red line""! (Our foot was over the line) and again ""Get behind the gate!"" (which was an open flap). A simple, courteous ""please stay behind the line"" would have worked to get the message across without embarrassing us. TSA also took a sealed yoghurt from me. Not a good experience and we could not wait to leave this airport."
13th September 2018,1,"""it was demanding a ticket""","Not Verified |  Skytrax cannot verify my review, as I was not a passenger, just the hapless relative who agreed to pick her daughter and fiance up after an international flight. First mistake I made was going into the short-term parking lot. I followed the directions on the self-serve kiosk, inserted my credit card. No ticket had emerged from the machine, but the gate lifted, so I went through. Areas within the parking garage are fenced-off in such a way that it cannot be exited without going the wrong direction in one-way areas. At night, there is no alternative to the ""self-serve"" exit kiosks. I was trapped behind a driver whose credit card was eaten by the machine. The entire line slowly backed their cars up, I pulled into another line, and found to my horror that it was demanding a ticket from the entry kiosk. I jumped up and down, waved my arms, and put on an embarrassing show for everyone as I called for help, which came, nice and slow, looked me in the eye, and politely told me to file a complaint. Here it is."
11th September 2018,1,"""one of the worst airports""","Not Verified |  Without a doubt, one of the worst airports we have ever traveled to/through. Recent travels to/from Glasgow had us scrambling to make our connections, but return to US on Saturday 9/8 had 1/2 of Kiosks available and terribly understaffed personnel at Customs. 1.5 hours to get from originating flight through customs, back through TSA, and then to our flight at Terminal F, which required a shuttle bus ride and then a dash to our gate. Thankful we made our flight but continue to be amazed that it took us this long. Will definitely avoid this airport going forward and will recommend the same to others. Very poor management of personnel and systems."
15th August 2018,1,"""inefficient and poorly run""","Not Verified | Philadelphia airport is the worst airport in the country! I would compare it to a third world country but that would insult the third world countries. Cancellations and delays are a constant, staff is rude, the bathrooms are a disgrace (no soap, paper towels containers are empty). I could go on and on. I used to have to travel to Philly for work and it was a nightmare and it's just as bad now or worse. I couldn't even get an internet connection in the airport. My flight was cancelled on Sunday and I was delayed hours on Monday. I couldn't find a place to sit and plug devices in so I sat in a hallway. This facility is so inefficient and poorly run. I would avoid it like the plague but my grandson lives there."
3rd July 2018,2,"""unfriendly gate staffing""","Not Verified |  The airport itself is nice, has some nice shopping areas, updated a few years ago. American has a nice Admirals club, friendly staff there. Low rating is due to very unfriendly gate staffing. Little concern for customers and not helpful. Normally fly out of Dulles airport but instead of driving 3 hours to DC, decided to try Philly for International flight. Have flown from Philly multiple times domestically and always have delays and unfriendly service."
10th June 2018,7,"""pleasantly surprised me""","✅ Trip Verified | A recent international round trip through PHL pleasantly surprised me: the terminals (and restrooms) were clean; air conditioning was generally good; signage was clear; seating space was ample and it was not overcrowded. I especially enjoyed the airside walk between Terminals A and F in order to connect between domestic and international flights: it was a healthy 15-minute walk through a suburban shopping mall with reasonable food choices along the way. But PHL is far from perfect. Many water fountains and electrical outlets do not work: this is a needless frustration. When I arrived at Customs and Border Patrol at around 4PM from an international flight, the area was overwhelmed by too many passengers, almost no help for passengers coping with cryptic passport kiosks, and seriously understaffed CBP posts. PHL shows great promise but needs to attend to simple maintenance and very inadequate CBP operations."
9th June 2018,2,"""rude and unfriendly overall""","Not Verified |  This is the #1 airport to avoid. Although they have redone some of the terminals and added many food options, they have not redone the staff. The staff at this airport are rude and unfriendly overall. I say this as a ""thick skinned"" New Yorker. Although I am sure there are exceptions, I have never found one. I have not used this airport in 6 years but was forced to connect there last week and could not believe that nothing has changed. I once again told my travel department at work that I refuse to travel through Philly."
5th June 2018,1,"""will not be using this airport again""",Not Verified |  This airport needs to be avoided at all costs by travellers from UK who need to change flights there. Unbelievably they have no electronic passport entry points so everyone is dealt with manually. We had almost 3 hours to change flights on a trip from Manchester to Miami. We made our connection with literally one minute to spare after rushing through the airport! Passport checking took an hour and a half and then full security check the same. Many in the queues are stressed as they know they are going to miss connections. The staff seem to take delight in advising that no one can go to the front of the queue because almost everyone is late for a connection. I will not be using this airport again.
19th May 2018,2,"""trash all over the place""
","❌ Not Verified |  Because of rain and lightening, there was a delay in getting off the flight upon landing, however as soon as the lightening lifted and we were allowed to get off the plane, the airport employees were nowhere to be found! They had to be sumened back to their station. Not only that I waited another hour for the luggage to arrive. There was trash all over the place, it looked like a dump! I’ve been in airports all across the US and I have to say this is the most dirtest, unprofessional, slowest airport I’ve ever been in! This airport lack leadership terribly!"
9th May 2018,4,"""no restaurants or bathrooms""","✅ Trip Verified | Ok I had a 3 hour layover, my doing, airport had no restaurants or bathrooms because of a water mains break. Now the plane is still at the gate, 40 minutes delayed and counting."
7th May 2018,4,"""no advice, no support, no help""","✅ Trip Verified | Trying to locate our car rental company, we were sent to stop No 2 for shuttle buses. After half hour in cold weather, we realised that the bus stop for rental companies due to construction work, had been moved to the other side of the building. No sign anywhere, no advice, no support, no help from anybody. After 45 minutes finally the Dollar shuttle arrived. This was a total disappointment after a flight ATH-LHR-PHL."
26th April 2018,1,"""constant delays in take off""","✅ Trip Verified | The Worst Airport in the United States! I have traveled with American Airlines all over this country and the Caribbean. I have been to Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, Tampa, Orlando, Fort Myers, San Francisco, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Aruba, St Thomas, and Nassau with American on most of these and Southwest on the others. I never have a problem in any of these Airports. Philadelphia on the other hand is a disaster, where do I begin. Let’s start with constant delays in take off, there are always 10 to 12 planes ahead of you. When pulling back into Philadelphia 10 minutes early only to have to wait 30 minutes till they find an open gate. Then you go to get your luggage and a hour later they tell you they have a maintenance issue. The signage to leave the Airport is probably the most confusing of any airport that I have been to. You leave from gate C so you park in that garage only to return at A Gate, this happens all the time. The B/C Security is far too small to handle the crowds that come to this gate, passengers are lined up down the corridor to the parking garage! If I could get the flights I need out of Allentown I would drive the additional hour just to avoid this place."
18th April 2018,1,"""Never did I see anyone cleaning""","✅ Trip Verified |  I'm a native Philadelphian, and though I currently live outside the city use Philadelphia International Airport ( PHL) a few times per year. I'm embarrassed that this is ""my airport"". Each restroom I used smelled like a barn. Stalls, toilets and floors were filthy. Never did I see anyone cleaning anything. In March, my PHL flight to Miami was cancelled due to weather, I used Baltimore (BWI). Both BWI and MIA were clean, modern and nice. Today I'm at Chicago's O'Hare- very clean and modern! In recent months I was in the Tampa airport, also very clean. Even if something is old it can be clean! The restaurant scene is also very poor at PHL compared with others. Not sure what's going on here but I know I have an option to fly out of another airport, so will be in the future."
17th April 2018,1,"""the most inefficient airport""","❎ Not Verified |  This is the worst airport I have ever experienced and the most inefficient airport I have ever witnessed. It is ridiculous that they make you collect your luggage and go through all controls, check in and security again even when you are on in transit. This is the biggest waste of time and ludicrous. They do not keep their flight departure times up to date and so we were running through the airport to get our connecting flight as it said it was on time, however 2.5 hours after the said departure time I am still waiting to leave for London. The gate number changed 5 or 6 times confusing everyone and now we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour and it appears they have lost half of the planes luggage. The pilot has had to get off of the aircraft to try and sort this out because everyone is clueless. Absolutely ridiculous airport will definitely avoid ever returning here. All connecting flights should try and do the same in future."
17th April 2018,1,"""Does no one work here?""",❎ Not Verified |  Arriving plane had to wait 45 min before we could arrive at gate. Baggage took 1:15 minutes to come out To connect to next flight had to go out of security area. Security lines were closed in all terminals so now way back into the gate area until one line night man helped us fond the one open security area. Virtually no staff to ask any questions. At 9:30 pm most food areas closed. Boarded plane and waited 1+ hour. Pilot kept updating us that the baggage handlers had left the door open and no one was answering their calls. Now they have no communication with anyone on the jetway. Does no one work here?
21st February 2018,1,"""worst airport I have ever experienced""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst airport I have ever experienced (and I’ve been to a lot). Both times my plane has sat on the runway for an hour, delaying my flight. Horrible staff, horrible organization, just down right horrible. Never again will I fly here. Save yourself the time and never go here."
13th February 2018,9,"""very pleasantly surprised""","❎ Not Verified |  I was very pleasantly surprised by Philadelphia airport. I usually fly into Boston, where international arrivals are a zoo and can take hours. In Philadelphia, passport control was quick and friendly, and the free wifi worked immediately. We were through in less than 10 minutes. Flying out, the terminal was clean, lots of seating and power stations, and fantastic free wifi. We had plenty of food choices (though a few less fast food and more healthy options would be great) and well organized lounges. But the shining crown was the response of lost and found, after my son left his Nintendo in the waiting lounge. We filled out the online form and within 2 hours had a response that the item was found. They organized having it sent to us (we pay postage, of course), and a ""disaster"" was averted seamlessly. Very impressed!"
30th January 2018,5,"""flights never depart on time""","❎ Not Verified |  I'm at Philadelphia airport at least once a year and I'd like to think I know it pretty well by now. I can't say Philadelphia airport is the worst airport I've ever been to as it's clean, has a lot of places to get food and shop, there are a few places to charge your phone, and most of the staff I have encountered are friendly. My only problems with this airport are that flights never depart on time because boarding almost always starts when the flight was supposed to originally take off, it's impossible to get a wifi connection and some of the staff can be quite careless. I was recently in a position where I had a connecting flight and was put on standby and left to sit around the gate even after the plane had taken off just to be informed I would not be put on the flight, and if I managed to get on the next one I would be stranded in Arizona overnight for possibly 3 whole days. I had only ever agreed to originally being on standby as the person who booked my ticket had assured me I'd be on the plane, so I can understand what the other reviewers are talking about when they comment on confusion among staff. I had to talk to 3 people before having to cancel my flight and pay for a new ticket, but the situation left me stuck in Philadelphia, as I had come from New Jersey. I wish Philadelphia airport had more options when it comes to getting from there to Jersey and vice versa as Philadelphia airport is the only airport near Jersey besides New York (Atlantic City doesn't count). Other than those flaws it is an airport and it does get the job done - maybe not in the best way possible, but good enough to still go to."
14th January 2018,3,"""I always have to wait an hour""",❎ Not Verified |  This airport does not know how to route baggage properly. I always have to wait an hour and they switch baggage claim bays without telling you. They said it was due to the cold weather tonight. Ok. What’s your excuse the other 364 days? The guy who is in charge of baggage claim should be fired. But we all know that will never happen.
12th January 2018,2,"""I nearly missed my connecting flight""","✅ Trip Verified | I see absolutely no purpose for automated passport control at this airport. You have to queue to use the terminals, you then have to queue again to be questioned by a CBP agent. On this trip the queue time for the agent review was in excess of 40 minutes and I nearly missed my connecting flight. It is unacceptable that when two or three wide bodied international planes arrive in short order there are only eight of 30+ CBP desks open. Also, even when you're in transit, you have to pass through security screening again. I cannot recommend this airport if you have a tight schedule for a connecting flight."
1st January 2018,1,"""There obviously is no supervision""","❎ Not Verified |  Worst airport ever. The employees will not look you in the eye and aren’t at all friendly. I sat in three different places in the airport and heard loud, foul language (very offensive). There obviously is no supervision. As a guest traveler, I felt very uncomfortable. I’ll try to find another spot to sit to avoid these offensive crowds of workers."
29th December 2017,1,"""sad miserable place""","✅ Trip Verified | I was in Jacksonville flew to Philadelphia and then flew back out of Philadelphia to Jacksonville. The difference in the way the staff at the airport treat you in unbelievable!!! In Jacksonville everybody is helpful and friendly. In Philadelphia they don’t even look you in the eye, they act like you are a complete nuisance and are not friendly when checking in, when going through security - really never! I could not believe how I overheard other people complaining about how mean security was . I really suggest you give them some training in manners, because it’s a sad miserable place!!"
30th November 2017,1,"""wasn't just me who missed the flight""","❎ Not Verified |  This airport is the worst. Inefficiency meets power trips. I had over an hour to make my flight and get to the security check line. It was about a 1/2 mile long because they would not open three of the lines due to giving TSA precheck priority. Once I finally got through the checkpoint, I had 30 minutes to catch my flight. Security decided they would pull me aside to check my bags. This wouldn't have been a problem had I not been behind four other people, one of which had about one hundred bite size snickers in her bag. They checked each stupid snicker four times. This took forever. I asked if I could just leave my food behind so they didn't have to check it, and I would just bring my keys, wallet, and cellphone. They wouldn't budge at all. Once they finally checked my food bag, I ran like a fool as fast as I could to make it to my flight. Once I got to my gate, they had already boarded. Surprisingly, it wasn't just me who missed the flight. There were 6 other people (just for my flight) that had missed the flight. Spare yourself and don't go to Philadelphia airport."
25th November 2017,3,"""lack of good customer service""
","✅ Trip Verified | This was definitely my worst experience at an airport. It's been years since I have last traveled by plane so a little direction from the employees would have helped but barely any was given throughout the whole process, and the only time they did was either with an attitude or by harassing you. The woman who weighed and took my luggage was an absolute joke. I asked her multiple times what I had to do first, since it's been a while, to make both her and my job easier but she insisted on giving me a hard time and actually asked me why I didn't know what to do? Maybe because she couldn't do the only job she had and tell me. It would have taken 2 seconds to understand and get that process over with but she obviously had some personal issues or horrible customer service skills. There is no comparison with this airport and the airports in Florida where I traveled to. Philadelphia already has a bad reputation and a lot of the employees there definitely make it worse, it's embarrassing. I will try my very best to stay away from this airport in the future due to the lack of good customer service."
31st October 2017,1,"""Massive delays due to rain""","❎ Unverified |  Massive delays due to rain. Yes, rain. What century is this? Pathetic. Is this extreme risk aversion or is the infrastructure that antiquated that the airport can’t handle ‘weather’. Makes it easy for the big airlines customer no service as well to say there is nothing they can do. I should have known better! Too bad I can’t rate air traffic control a big fat Zero!"
23rd July 2017,2,"""More delays than anywhere else""",❎ Unverified |  Worst airport in the country. I travel all over and Philadelphia is consistently the worst experience. I have stopped checking bags due to the horrendous wait times for bags. More delays than anywhere else. Sucks it is my home airport. They could invest in the infrastructure but choose not to.
18th June 2017,1,"""Horrendous place to be stuck""","❎ Unverified |  Changing airport code from ""PHL"" to ""FPA"" for Filthy Philadelphia Airport. In addition to almost all areas being nasty, 80% of oulets for traveler convenience do not work. Door security alarms go off so often that no one cares or pays attention. Seven times so far in the span of 2 hours. Horrendous place to be stuck for more than 30 minutes. American airline employee apathy ca be cut with a knife it's so thick. From gate agents all the way up to the Admiral club counter. Welcome to FPA."
27th May 2017,3,"""I have never seen such incompetence""",✅ Verified Review | This airport is completely ineptly run. I have to fly in and out of here roughly 10 times a year. More often than not there are gate delays when I arrive. One time I arrived and we had to sit at the gate itself while we waited 20 minutes before gate crew to emerge. I am now sitting on the runway moving nowhere waiting to get into a gate behind six other planes in front of us. I have never seen such incompetence. I hate to say it but the staff that manage this airport do a really poor job. And this is my home City. I am ashamed.
26th May 2017,1,"""customs and security weren't ready""","This is the worst airport experience I have had. For some reason customs and security ""weren't ready"" for the 4 international airlines landing at the same time. The 2+ hours between our connecting flights were spent in lines for customs and security, and we still missed our flight. The worst part is, our airplane was sitting still at our gate for an hour due to incliment weather, we were 2 minutes late to our flight and were still refused on the still sitting train. Never coming back ever again and I would not recommend anyone comes here unless they want to be stuck in lines due to their ""short staff."" Get it together."
15th May 2017,1,"""this airport is awful""","This is the worst airport experience I have ever had. The flight out of Philadelphia to pick us up in Montego Bay this morning delayed, which I understand, but that was just the start of the awful day we had with Philadelphia. The customs agents has absolutely no idea what they were doing. They were re-arranging the lines repeatedly in such a manner that after we had waited twenty minutes, we watched people who had just arrived walk past us. Moreover, once we got through customs there were two extremely long lines at baggage claim, each moving a different direction, but both going to the exact same place. This wouldn't have been so bad if there was a single airport employee providing directions. After another 30+ minute wait, which ended with someone taking our customs slip and nothing else, we advanced to security where we had to witness the same ridiculous line rearranging, with equally frustrating results. Another 30+ minute wait and we were pretty strung out. Fast-forward to our boarding process, where the gate agent forced me to check my bag in spite of the fact that it fit the guidelines perfectly. There was seemingly no logical reasoning behind why she chose my bag, which had glass in it. After boarding our flight, I had the pleasure of watching the gentlemen loading our bags toss mine onto the conveyor belt. If I wanted the glass tossed, I'd have checked it in the first place. This airport is awful. There is no organiation and every single person who works here is rude."
10th January 2017,1,"""customs line was extremely slow""","✅ Verified Review | My first American Airlines flight into Philadelphia Airport was 20 min late. After that I spent more than an hour in line for customs because the line I was put into was extremely slow. For each one that passed customs in my line, ten were already done in any other line. Then, I had to walk outside to reach the next terminal. At the TSA control I showed the boarding pass that the connection flight was already boarding; the answer I got was to wait them to check my bag while they were teaching the new hired guy. The TSA guy told me not to ""make everyone aware that I was missing the flight"". I rushed to the gate and there was still few people boarding. American Airlines told me that they gave my seat to someone else. I left two hours and half later to get to my destination where nobody could pick me up because too late. Never again I will stop in this airport."
30th December 2016,1,"""TSA is typically extremely rude here""","American Airlines has the worst staff here, particularly for check in and bag check. There is no organization and the only person running the self check machines was clueless what to do when the machine ran out of self check stickers. She pointed me to a line that was a hour long (only 3 employees working B/C check in at 6.45am, and four other employees behind the counter joking with one another). After explaining my dilemma, and mentioning that I had been in line for over an hour and now at risk of missing my flight, I was told that was my problem. Luckily (based on prior experiences) I gave myself 100 minutes to catch my flight. Other people crying in line weren't quite as lucky. When I asked why more stations weren't open and why agents were just standing around, I was simply told to ""stop talking"". TSA is typically extremely rude here, but this time was slightly less rude. The gate agents look like they're tortured. I hate to admit this is my home airport (I promise you that there are many nice and friendly philadelphians). This airport needs an overhaul, starting with the terrible employees employed here. Whoever is in charge of American Airlines Phl staff operations clearly has given up and should be replaced first."
28th November 2016,2,"""the worst in terms of waiting on luggage""",I travel weekly all over the country - this is absolutely the worst in terms of waiting on luggage. I always have to wait a minimum 45 minutes and in more than one trip over an hour. The airport management should assess their processes and come up with a solution. This issue detracts from an otherwise nice airport.
17th November 2016,1,"""the worst airport I use""","Landed at 9:41 PM in Philadelphia from Charlotte NC and it's 10:52 PM and we are standing here still waiting for baggage claim. I travel every week and this is typical of the baggage claim here. All the other airports can get the baggage out on time, why can't Philadelphia? I'm from Philadelphia and this is by far the worst airport I use."
2nd November 2016,3,"""the passport control is hideous""","The airport is huge and not at all conducive for a connecting flight Took 30 mins at the baggage reclaim. The passport control is hideous, the queuing time is at least 30 mins, followed by another ridiculous queuing system at customs. This took another 30 mins. Thankfully my return journey is via Charlotte."
19th October 2016,8,"""clean, simple and efficient""","This is the 2nd time travelling through this airport. We travel here from Singapore and back out again. In fact, we like this airport so much more than NY-JFK. Everything is just simpler and faster. It is true that in terms of eateries and shopping, there really isn't anything significant but we're not really into eating/shopping at airports anyway. We just want clean, simple and efficient. And this place checks all those boxes. We only have one big upset which is with the T-Mobile counter that sells prepaid SIM cards to inbound tourists. You cannot help seeing it as you exit the International Arrivals. This is a scam. We bought a couple of 7+2 day plans but on the 7th day, the account was locked by T-Mobile. When we approached the T-Mobile shop downtown, they told us that this happens all the time with tourists who buy from this counter. The strange thing is the mobile numbers we were assigned were all business mobile lines. The shop assistant suspects that this operator is buying bulk business lines and reselling them individually as prepaid SIM plans for individuals. The customer is none the wiser - after all, who would know that the number was a business line? However, the T-Mobile system detects this abuse after a week and terminates the account. This is a scam and Philadelphia airport should shut this operator down."
23rd September 2016,7,"""airport was very spacious""","✅ Verified Review |  The airport was very spacious, short lines, clean, easy to navigate, nice staff. However, there was no place to eat - which can be very important, especially after a long flight. Also, it is very easy to get to the train from the airport, which is great."
12th September 2016,2,"""departure lounge for American Airlines is awful""","✅ Verified Review |  I hope this is the last time I ever have to go through this airport. What a disappointing end to my trip to Spain. My 4 hour layover here on Sept 7/16 was awful. Being tired and hungry all I wanted to do was grab food and sleep. Well I got some cold food. Sleep - good luck, the departure lounge for American Airlines is awful. It was hot, humid, dirty and cramped. B1 should not be a departure lounge. I hope to never have to use Philadelphia Airport again."
9th August 2016,3,"""dirty and overcrowded""","Philadelphia is a dirty airport, and overcrowded. Staff are kind and friendly. Good selection of shops in connectors but not in the concourse. Poor waiting area. Bathrooms are they only thing that are clean, except concourse A, which we took a nice walk to see. If you don't have to fly here don't try it."
6th August 2016,3,"""my last time flying through Philadelphia""","The shops are nice, a decent choice for food. My biggest complaint is how rude the security was, I have a hard time hearing and she said something about my bag, I didn't understand so she came over to my stuff threw it around, rolled her eyes, and said a remark to her friends about how we (the paying customers) become stupider everyday. Constant employees just talking and sitting with their friends. This will be my last time flying through Philadelphia."
25th July 2016,2,"""no help from Airport Personnel""","I was recently in the US for a vacation travelling through New York, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Los Angeles airports. Philadelphia is no doubt a record breaker in terms of Airport Security rudeness. I have never experienced, neither in the US nor in Europe for that matter, having to load my bags on the conveyer belt myself with no help from Airport Personnel. What are they paid for?"
20th July 2016,6,"""security is a breeze""",I travel through Philadelphia Airport 2 or 3 times a year - normally flying British Airways using Terminal A West. Check-in is usually quick - they know me so I get greeted by name. Security is a breeze. The lounge is quiet and the flight normally on time. I would recommend PHL because if its convenient location and it is not busy in the evenings.
15th July 2016,6,"""staff seem friendly and helpful""","I have no complaints about the cleanliness of Philadelphia airport, and the staff seem friendly and helpful. Glad to see there is now free WiFi. My main issue (and always has been) is the management of planes departing and arriving. When your captain announces that you are getting ready to land, that means 20+ minutes of descending in an over-crowded pattern. Once on the ground, you can taxi quickly to your gate. However, once we got to the gate we had to wait for a truck to tow us in the last few feet. Then we had to wait another few minutes for another person to inch the jetway close enough so we could use it. No explanation was given for those delays. As for departing the airport, I had a short flight to Pittsburgh. My ticket listed it as a 90 minute flight. The first 40 minutes was spent taxiing on the runway and waiting for other jets to get a turn (again, over-crowded pattern / departure times). My flight was in the air only 5 minutes longer than we taxied on the ground at PHL for take off."
25th April 2016,1,"""signage is sparse""",Worst airport in 30 years of traveling. Absolutely no restaurants or cafes outside of security checkpoints and bathrooms are extremely limited and very dirty. Customer service exists as a bunch of airline and airport-badges personnel hanging out and talking while customers are waiting. Signage is sparse and monitors are inaccurate. I've never seen so much hassle of customers over a carry-on that will ostensibly fit in the overhead. I sat in front of the offending ticket counter watching the debacle for too long.
10th April 2016,5,"""this is unfortunately common""","Got in on a 5pm flight from Denver on American Airlines. Have been waiting for my luggage for 50 minutes, they just made an announcement that there is a delay and will let us know when the baggage is coming. We have a driver waiting. This is unfortunately common. Why can I get my luggage right away in other airports? Ok here comes some of our luggage now. It is 5.56 pm. An hour later. Someone next to us complained to an airport employee and her reply was that they are Union and have up to 45 minutes to deliver the bags - great attitude"
7th April 2016,7,"""lack of viable electrical outlets""",Every time time I fly through Philadelphia Airport I find that the standard of customer service during the check-in process continues to degrade. Not only am I tagging my own bags now but I am also putting my bags on the conveyor belt as well. I'm expecting to have to put it on the plane myself eventually. Once through security my biggest complaint is the lack of viable electrical outlets available and of the few that are functional it is not uncommon to see airport employees utilizing them. As a frequent flyer it is the norm to be on a computer or phone during a layover/delay and the inability to plug in and recharge these items is troublesome. My home airport has just put in new seating which has usb and standard plugs on each chair. Fabulous improvement and would love to see that done at PHL.
27th January 2016,3,"""limited seating and no facilities""","We, along with many others were disappointed when we arrived early for our flight the day after Storm Jonas. We were too early to do the bag drop and had to wait in an uncomfortable hall with limited seating and no facilities until the check in opened. No staff were there to help us find the concession in the arrival hall as I have experienced in other airports and any staff we asked were very unhelpful. Furthermore, there was not even signage for restrooms or elevators, which surely should be standard in any public building. The travel conditions were such that it was advisable to arrive in good time, but the airport made no provision to make this wait comfortable. Also, the departure boards only listed US and Canadian flights, so it was impossible to find out anything about the status of the flight until the check in opened. Again, this is the first time I have ever been at an airport where information was not provided about all of its departures. Once we passed through security, the overall standard was much hire, but first impressions are difficult to forget, especially whe experienced for a number of hours."
3rd January 2016,10,"""has shown vast improvement""","Philadelphia International is an airport which has shown vast improvement over the past several years. Terminals are clean and bright. It's layout has become much more user friendly and both the quality and number of amenities offered has been greatly enhanced. Public transportation (SEPTA's Airport Line of its regional rail system) provides quick and easy access to Center City Philadelphia and Amtrak. It is also located near I-95, I-76 and 474 (the Blue Route). For international travel, customs is a breeze. My biggest complaint is with the airline industry which charges hundreds of dollars more for the convenience of flying out of Philadelphia. They are practically forcing leisure travelers on a budget to hike north to Newark and JFK. Given that those airports are in no danger of going out of business, I fail to understand why Philadelphia travelers are treated so shabbily."
14th December 2015,10,"""we had no problems whatsoever""","I liked Philadelphia Airport. It is easily accessed from the SEPTA train, we had no problems whatsoever. Clean restrooms, comfortable seating while waiting for our Southwest flight to Los Angeles. The restaurants were good, and staff friendly. For some reason, though, it is quite a bit more expensive to fly internationally from Philadelphia as opposed to JFK. Why, I wonder?"
28th October 2015,1,"""the airport staff move at a snails pace""","If you are returning to the U.S. on an International flight that requires you to get your connecting flight home through Philadelphia, make sure you have about a 3 hour layover. Airport is a nightmare! I have flown internationally several times and have never experienced upon re-entering the U.S, an airport that is as ill equipped in handling this process. From beginning to end, it took 2.5 hours. You are required to be processed through multiple stages where you stand in one horrific line after another. The airport staff you encounter through the entire process are completely apathetic about their jobs and move at a snails pace. Luckily my flight was delayed but even then I barely made it. I literally had to run full speed through the airport to catch my connecting flight and the plane door closed right behind me. Avoid this airport if at all possible when needing to connect from an International flight - it is a nightmare."
26th October 2015,6,"""bright and sunny, ample seating ""","I am thrilled that the new Commuter Terminal is finally completed. For years, literally, years, they have been working on that terminal, seemingly without end. It is finally done and it is a Universe away from where they started. It is bright and sunny, ample seating and electrical outlets and has lots of food options at the new Food Court. Gone is the "" Prison Riot just ended"" look that plagued the place for years and made me cry every time I had to connect through PHL. There is still construction ongoing and you have to slough a mile to get your luggage, all the while dodging sketchy men approaching you to see if you want a taxi. They are older men in suits, clearly not licensed Taxi company employees. The Airport Authority need to keep these shady characters out of the baggage claim/ground transport. I recommend it reservedly because I have to chose one. I would still rather fly through Charlotte, all day, everyday."
16th August 2015,10,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"I was departing from PHL on a flight to Atlanta, onward to Dallas. When I arrived we checked in at a kiosk which was, I admit, nice. So it printed our boarding passes. We went to security which was not long. So after the security we went to the gate. On the way, we got Auntie Anne's. Then we went to the gate and simply waited for boarding. The airport in my opinion was very good."
14th August 2015,6,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"It was torture to sit in the terminal that was so over air conditioned that everyone around me who didn't check their bags was adding sweatshirts and scarves. One shouldn't need coats to be comfortable indoors in the summer. The rest of the aspects of the airport were fine, I just wish I wasn't shivering for two hours."
11th August 2015,1,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"I'm a frequent traveller and I know that things happen, but never before have I had to go through so much to simply catch a connecting flight. Dozens and dozens of passengers ended up missing their connections. My luggage was just tossed off the carousel and left on the floor out in the open. Luggage that I had to go find after spending 2 hours waiting to declare any goods. Afterwards checking in with my airline and having my flight rescheduled, I checked my baggage and then waited in another line for 40 minutes. This line was to screen all carry on luggage and passengers again. Also, everybody's drinks (that came off the U.S. Airways flight) had to be discarded. My sealed duty free bag was cut open, the seal on the package inside opened, and the sealed bottle was removed then swabbed. Again, this was to be a quick layover before catching my connecting flight. Another highlight was the airport employee yelling to the other airport employee in the middle of the souvenir shop about bad she had to go to the bathroom. Classy. I'd recommend that this airport be avoided whenever possible."
8th August 2015,1,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"Philadelphia airport is the worst I have experienced in my many opportunities to travel. From unusual pattern holding efforts while arriving for a connection, extraordinary taxi and delay efforts, delays in opening the cabin door to a need to travel half way to New York through the concourse and a bus trip to find my gate. To top it off, a 30 minute delay on the runway waiting to take off due to heavy volume. Thank goodness the weather was good. All through the concourse I could see monitors with pretty people promoting the airport with claims of greatness. Now, if they could only translate their self promotion into actionable change then the experience would improve."
1st August 2015,1,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"We arrived at Philadelphia Airport from Paris, France. As we approached customs, there was one person yelling for Americans to line up on the left and non Americans on the right. No signs were posted. It then took us almost two hours to stand in long lines to reach three different stages for re-entry into the U.S. After being in line for 45 minutes, we showed our passports to a machine that printed out our pictures and answers to the ""declarations"" form we had completed with paper/pen on our flight. Then we had to show our passports and declarations form to a live person after lining up for another 20-30 minutes. We were then released to the baggage area and then had to stand in another 10-15 minute line to show our form again before getting out to the street or other terminals. The airport was understaffed and the staff were uniformly rude or simply disinterested. As we tried to make our connecting flight to Dayton, OH, we were directed to get the shuttle bus to terminal F. The staff member pointed us down the hallway. We soon discovered he had pointed the wrong way and we had to return and go another direction to get to the street. At terminal F, the TSA folks who checked our liquids and carry ons, etc. could not have been ruder or more indifferent. Fortunately our connecting flight was 45 minutes late. We stood in lines for about 2 hrs, 15 minutes to reenter the US and make a connecting flight. The Philadelphia Airport staff were amazingly unhelpful and as a group - surly!"
28th July 2015,1,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"Their ""Check In Kiosks"" were not working properly, so, boarding passes had to be obtained by going to the US Airways counter. But not before standing in a very long and slow line. The reps seemed apathetic about their entire job. Security had lengthy and ultra slow lines. If you're picking up a rental car, you have to walk to the other side of the airport and wait for a shuttle bus to take you to another terminal several blocks away. Unlike Pittsburgh, which has a more flyer friendly approach to travel, Philadelphia's airport is a disgrace."
27th July 2015,2,Philadelphia Airport customer review,I took a day trip to Philadelphia to spend time with my girlfriend who had a 10 hour layover. I also wanted to use the opportunity to see my brother who moved up there about 9 months ago. We were planning on having lunch at the airport but there were no restaurants or shops outside of the security area. Nothing! Very stupid for people who want to arrive early at the airport and spend time with friends and family until they need to proceed to the gate.
22nd July 2015,1,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"I have never been so outraged by an airport experience! The airport personnel, the security personnel and even the Delta staff at the airport were all ineffectual, sometimes outright rude and totally unconcerned about helping the traveling public. I came in to Philadelphia airport after almost 18 hours of travel that was long, but for the most part pleasant, to encounter a system and personnel that was totally unacceptable. The lines were long, the procedures instituted by this airport cumbersome, the signage unintelligible, even to an educated English speaking person, the Personnel unhelpful and rude, the facilities dingy and dirty."
21st July 2015,1,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"Add us to the list of folks dismayed to experience this rude, dirty place with inefficient and ineffective processes. We arrived from St. Petersburg, Russia via Paris. The Moscow and St. Petersburg airports and Customs processes were understandable and efficient, though we don't understand Russian. Paris was also easy. Then we arrive back to the USA and Philadelphia Airport, where despite being literate in English, we can't figure out what to do and the personnel seem more interested in barking at us than helping. The long snaking queues of people being treated like cattle in depressing. I couldn't understand why we had redundant security checks, and talked to the TSA fellow. He said he'd been trying to get it changed for 12 years, and that Philly is the only airport where when you arrive in the international terminal, it is then treated as if you have left the airport and re-entered when you go to the domestic terminal, so they need to repeat the security process. Our bags got lost and it took over two hours  for security and Customs. Disgusting women's rest rooms with long lines. I could go on and on, but will stop with saying I'll try to avoid Philly in the future."
24th March 2015,2,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"Philadelphia please overhaul your gate waiting areas. I tried to find a measly outlet in the C terminal to charge a dying cellphone. Not only couldn't I find an outlet that worked but the one that did work - apparently used for vacuum cleaners was nowhere near a seating area and people were lined up to use it. Get some of those ""work station"" columns and out them at the end of every seat aisle! Every other airport has managed to retrofit waiting areas for business AND leisure travelers!"
19th January 2015,n/a,Philadelphia Airport customer review,We were flying in from London with US Airways / BA. Flight was late and arrived around 9.30 pm on 9th January 2015. Had a connecting flight in terminal F. Once we arrived custom clearance was quick but now the joke and disaster starts. Our luggage came out quickly and we picked it up only to find out that luggage re check and security to get back in the terminal had gone home! How can the airport manager let this happen knowing there is a flight coming in with connecting passengers. I think this airport is unorganised people absolutely useless and irresponsible. We paid a lot of money for those flights and our 4 year old was unpleased with all the stress and time difference. I will avoid this airport from now on.
5th November 2014,5,Philadelphia Airport customer review,This airport is notoriously understaffed at security checkpoints. I fly out of PHL at least 2 to 3 times a year. Every time I feel like I'm struggling to get through security to make my plane. This last time I waited in line for an hour and a half. No pep in the TSA agents step. Lines backed up to the top of the escalator. Nobody moving any faster to avoid inconveniencing their customers. I can see if you don't arrive within the required time but come on. They have to know how many flights they have booked and approximately how many people they have to get through. The whole line of people were stressing about missing their flight.
13th October 2014,5,Philadelphia Airport customer review,Airport wise it is completely functional and better than the NYC airports for the most part. Access is easy just off I95 plenty of parking and curbside check-in is easy. Security is hit and miss. If you arrive at the wrong time it can take forever to get through. Early mornings on a weekend - no problem took less than 10 mins. Security staff were ok no real issues. Biggest complaint is it is a really bland airport just not appealing to be in. Long way to baggage and just a really strange layout.
5th October 2014,n/a,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"We landed in Philly Sept 30 after an 8-hour flight from Europe. The good: nothing - not one thing. The bad: Everything about this airport from the poorly kept waiting areas (torn seats food and trash on the floor and seats overflowing trash cans etc) to the rude lazy employees at the restaurants information booths customs and gates. The food court employees (Wendy's is where we went.) were rude and acted like they were doing us a favor. The ugly: Customs was the worst experience I have ever had in my more than 20 years of flying overseas. The new automated system was a joke. They have 20 or so machines but they would only let 5 people in at a time because it would overtax the system if they allowed more. The system did go down and we (and many other passengers) tried more than 10 times to get our ""pass"" to go through a human being. All of us had connecting flights and the nine workers stood around and laughed. ""You all have connections ma'am."" One guy laughed. We asked what the alternative was since it was at that point more than 30 minutes and they had none. I refuse to fly through that place again."
30th September 2014,2,Philadelphia Airport customer review,"Very confusing airport. Landed at C and then had to take the ""shuttle"" to F which was a terrible experience. Got over to F only to find out that F32 had been changed to F37. Not a big deal but just a hassle that wasn't needed. Not after 12 hours of airport flying already. The people tending the line for the F shuttle were rude. The F terminal was small cramped dirty and uncomfortable."
28th September 2014,n/a,Philadelphia Airport customer review,Unbelievable wait in line to get through customs and immigration. They have a new system that's automated. You answer about 10 questions and then the machine spits out a piece of paper. Heaven help you if you get a large X on your ticket. You then have to go and wait in line (and I mean wait) for an indeterminable amount of time. There were easily 500 hundred people in line and only 2 agents on. This is a disgrace. Philadelphia customs and immigration has always had a bad attitude - it's like why would you want to travel when you can sit on your south Philly stoop instead but this takes it to a whole new level.
22nd March 2022,2,"""I feel service can be improved""","Not Verified |  So first time in a while that I've been to this airport. I got a little turned around and looked everywhere for someone to help, unfortunately everyone ignored me. Finally I went up to a desk and asked the lady attending the Hawaii desk and asked my question. She treated me rather rudely and cold. Don't usually leave reviews unless I feel service can be improved and I think it should be. Also have an anonymous tip line, it makes it easier."
17th January 2022,2,"""My experience was frustrating""","✅ Trip Verified |  I was dismayed to see that a few years ago, this airport received high ratings. My experience was frustrating. I went through Phoenix in transit. Flights were on time in my case. However I had a hankering for a smoothie since I ate some food brought onto the airplane. Since I had lots of time, I went to every set of gates. You can't even buy a smoothie in this airport. Panera Bread had some on the menu but were all sold out. Every flavor. No wonder! Many restaurants were not even open. I travel a lot, and this airport is now near the bottom.  Covid is no excuse because I have traveled much during the pandemic. A few other things.  The charging stations are all on little block tables that are always very crowded. Some of the outlets are so worn out that your adapter falls out or you have to shake it to connect. But usually you can find one that will work There are no outlets in lounge seats at all. Some signs do not show gates in both directions. Went towards the C-Gates and had to look backwards to see that I had to turn left for C1 to C9. I surmised that because I have airport experience but woe to the person who does not. I know to have very low expectations when coming through here. Hopefully I will not have to use this airport for anything in the near future."
30th November 2021,1,"""the worst international airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  Do not travel through Phoenix Sky Harbor. Long lines, over zealous security having every other bag extra checked, the airport is dirty, they have everyone crammed into a small area and no restaurants are open. Hundreds of international passengers arriving from 10+ hour flights to this pathetic excuse for an airport. Travel through anywhere else. This is the worst international airport I have ever experienced."
28th November 2021,1,"""the worst traveling experience we’ve ever had""","✅ Trip Verified | For the last 3 years, I know there’s a pandemic, Sky Harbor has been the worst traveling experience we’ve ever had. Twice, we have reserved a rental car and showed up to no cars available. We make other arrangements now. The food and service options have taken a nose dive. The ‘we don’t care less feeling' is palpable from people working everywhere throughout food service options, which I might add is almost null. Maybe this is showing businesses that they need to pay people a living wage. We will be making other arrangements so we don’t have to eat in this pathetic excuse for an airport."
25th November 2021,2,"""barely any restaurants open""","Not Verified |  There’s barely any restaurants open, half of gate A they are all closed and the other half of gate A is so packed you have to wait super long for a table which makes no sense. Opposite of covid safe and pretty ridiculous for people who have a long stressful day of traveling. Do better."
15th November 2021,1,"""No restaurants open""","✅ Trip Verified | If you have a red-eye flight or anything from 7pm onwards, you're absolutely screwed on food choices. No restaurants open, no staff to help, and extremely overpriced sandwich/chip options. Since it's silly to eat dinner at 6pm, we wanted to sit at the airport at a bar/restaurant like every other airport in the world, not Phoenix airport. After arriving at 8, everything was closed which is absurd and unheard of in the travel industry. After looking through every single gate for over an hour, we had to settle on a self-serve kiosk. Give a guess how much 2 sandwiches, 2 fruit juice, 1 bag of chips, and some pathetic soggy veggies was? If you guessed anything lower than $47, then you're wrong. Absolute abomination and the management needs to learn how to get a grasp with their pathetic excuse for an airport. Just quit your jobs now and give it to someone that will actually look after the customer. FYI, whilst eating our ""dinner"" there were many other travellers in the same boat desperately looking for food and stressing to find something for their flight. This wasn't just an issue that we experienced ourselves."
9th November 2021,3,"""don’t book a flight through Phoenix""","Not Verified |  Good evening peasants! Please don’t come to Phoenix Sky Harbor after about 8 pm and expect to be treated like a human. I mean, if you are hungry, don’t expect to have an open restaurant or bar. We may allow you to buy some food that is covered in plastic, but for sure no alcohol. You should have planned better. First, you should have booked your flight with a carrier that did not re-route and re-book you. Better yet, don’t book a flight through Phoenix. Even better yet, don’t be such a looser and charter a jet that takes you directly to your destination. Didn’t become a rock star or a movie star as a kid and you worked for a living? Bad planning. Served in the armed forces? Gosh, thanks so much for your service, no human food for you either. It’s just business, I’m sure. Stop whining, we left the lights on! The news stand is open, and they sell candy. How ungrateful. Well, that is what you get when you sell things to peasants. No gratitude."
6th November 2021,2,"""nothing was open""",✅ Trip Verified |  Had a red eye departing 1130pm straight shot to Newark - I got here at 830 to have dinner and a glass of wine in terminal 3 - nothing was open. How disappointing and sad to sit for 2½ hours with no hospitality or libation. Disgraceful
17th October 2021,2,"""the place is full of closed restaurants and bars""",✅ Trip Verified | Saturday afternoon and the place is full of closed restaurants and bars. We had several hours to wait and everything was closed. 
2nd October 2021,1,"""Avoid this airport at all costs""","Not Verified |  This airport is just gross. It is so crowded that you can barely walk. The trash cans are overflowing, there was water all over the bathroom floor, and trash all over the ground. Avoid this airport at all costs.  If you have a layover here and you are considering a different flight- go with the different flight."
13th September 2021,1,"""Wake up Sky Harbor""","✅ Trip Verified | I travel with 3-4 large 70 lb tool boxes for my business. I had to search for a luggage cart as they have been removed. I found one in the corner of the departure lounge. Today when I arrived back to the airport, no luggage carts. I asked a Delta agent where the carts were and I was told the contract with the company that supplied them ended and the new company was supposed to be set up August 1, but has not yet done anything. How are you supposed to carry 4, 70 pound tool boxes to the parking garage. No skycaps, no luggage carts. Whoever runs the airport and makes these decisions without thinking of the inconvenience to passengers who I am sure have had to deal with the same issue is an idiot. I was told by one of the purple help personnel to use a wheelchair. Really. Wake up Sky Harbor. August 1st has come and gone more than 70 days ago."
12th September 2021,1,"""not even McDonald's is open""","Not Verified |  8:00 on a Saturday night and not even McDonald's is open let alone getting a lousy beer. Terrible, Starbucks closed, pizza joint closed - no pizza at 8 o'clock on Saturday night. I will definitely reconsider Phoenix airport next time I go thru here."
3rd September 2021,2,"""most restaurants closed""","Not Verified |  Very limited in dining choices - most restaurants closed. Went to different terminals and only choices are Mexican food or sandwiches. Sat for 15 minutes in one restaurant and finally left since no one even came over. Bought a sandwich and then nowhere to sit and eat . Kept delaying my flight and since the seats are limited unless you want to sit right next to someone, I have been standing for hours while they continually delay the flight. Only outlets are on a counter which has been in use at all times."
28th August 2021,1,"""stores and restaurants are closed at 7pm""","Not Verified |  It is a Friday night, plenty of flights coming in and going out, stores and restaurants are closed at 7pm. Absolutely ridiculous. Can't even get a cup of coffee. Just horrible."
23rd August 2021,2,"""Dining options here are very poor""",Not Verified |  Dining options here are very poor. Lines for what few options exist tend to be very long. I have been to this airport several times and it is always the same. Seating is very limited too. Renting a car is a hassle with the shuttle back and forth and adds another line to wait through before you can leave the airport.
14th August 2021,1,"""airport has the worst layout""",✅ Trip Verified |  This airport has the worst layout. After getting off the plane there was long wait to get luggage. Once received there were No instructions as to how to find rental car company (Sixt) was mine. I had to board a bus to “rental car“ several miles away and even longer due to slow Bus. Once at the rental place there were more lines as everyone gets dumped at one spot. Return was worse as there are NO clear directions to return. once at the right place after car drop off another rotten bus ride to the airport. 2 hrs to return car and get to the airline. English is not the language there either.
13th August 2021,3,"""The floor was dirty""","Not Verified |  Waited in concourse D. The floor was dirty. Looks like it hasn’t been vacuumed in who knows how long. There is trash under the seats and across the floor. There are not enough charging stations/plugs. People park it and refuse to move once they are charged up. Disorganized, I don’t know if it’s due to staffing or the airline (Southwest). Tired and I want to go home. Plus side, they do have a place to take your pet to the restroom."
7th August 2021,10,"""America's friendliest airport, indeed!""","Not Verified |  I arrived and departed in the early morning hours. It was busy but not overcrowded. No long lines and TSA was pleasant enough. Easy to find your way around. America's friendliest airport, indeed!"
27th July 2021,1,"""there are zero luggage carts available""","✅ Trip Verified | There are no luggage carts in Terminal 3 for people with special needs, seniors, people traveling with small children, and international travelers. This was confirmed at the information desk within Terminal 3 that there are zero luggage carts available. With Sky Harbor being an international airport within a large metropolitan city, this is truly disgraceful. My wife arrived last night from abroad with our 2 small children, 3 large suitcases, 3 carry on bags, and a large back pack. I recently had back surgery and could offer no assistance to my spouse with moving luggage due to lifting restrictions. After a 24 hour international trip and consoling our four year old daughter along the route by picking her up, she was already complaining of a sore back when they arrived. After all that, my wife had to make three separate trips lugging large suitcases clear across the airport to the parking garage while I helplessly watched our children. At no time did anyone at the airport volunteer to offer any help or assistance. This is fundamentally wrong, irresponsible, and shows complete lack of planning and foresight by airport management in every possible way. People traveling into and out of Sky Harbor will need to bring along additional hands and resources since the airport is unable to provide the very basic necessities or help all airports, regardless of size should possess."
15th June 2021,1,"""the absolute worst airport I have ever encountered""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the absolute worst airport I have ever encountered. The visit started with TSA when I proceeded to remove my laptop from my backpack due to the fact that I am an avid flyer and understood that was a standard precaution. I got my bag slammed in my face and was told to not touch anything. After this experience we arrived to the terminal at 3:00 expecting for restaurants to be open for dinner, this is a invalid thought as the restaurants decide when they can open and close. The google and/or Apple Maps isn’t even accurate to the time they will close. We arrived at the Panera two minutes after closing and they wouldn’t even serve us, resulting in forcing us to eat at a quick store for a $20 sandwich. Nothing within the airport is connected and the airport TSA/Staff laugh at you when you ask where you can get dinner."
8th June 2021,1,"""worst TSA staff I've ever encountered""","Not Verified |  Absolute worst TSA staff I've ever encountered! They were rude, unhelpful, & down right miserable. After we loaded our bags, shoes, etc onto the security belt we were told to wait in line at the metal detector. However there was nobody over there to assist us and the Closed sign was set up. Meanwhile all our items had gone through and were on the other side unattended. I asked if someone could please assist us so we could get to our luggage and I was told to wait and eventually someone would help us. We continued to wait for approximately 10 more minutes. Meanwhile listening to the TSA officer cuss under his breath. When we finally were let through we grabbed our luggage (which was fortunately all there) we started to leave to get out of the way and was yelled at by the female TSA officer to remove our bins off the belt. I will never come back to this airport!"
8th May 2021,1,"""rudest, most miserable TSA agents""","✅ Trip Verified |  Travel all over the country often airports large and small. PHX by far has the worst, rudest, most miserable TSA agents we have ever encountered! Not just 2 us but everyone around us. I have never seen such behavior it was unreal! The icing on the cake is the rental car/airport shuttle system. Never experienced anything so slow and dysfunctional even at airports twice the size, it is a complete failure"
13th April 2021,3,"""The line for the rental car bus was incredible""",Not Verified |  The line for the rental car bus was incredible. Waited 45 min in line for a bus. No urgency and no attempts to increase number of buses. I don’t understand and I am sure many people will miss their flights.
10th April 2021,3,"""Was quite disappointed with the cleanliness""","✅ Trip Verified | Was quite disappointed with the cleanliness and overall conditions of the gate that we were at. There was hand sanitizer, but none of them worked. The seats had crumbs and dirt all over them. Lastly, the bathrooms were dirty and only half of the containers had soap or towels in them. We had bottles on the floor around our gate. As for the gate, we couldn’t hear the flight attendant telling us about our flight because there was a TV show playing in the speakers above us, when we told them they said there was nothing they could do and just to come closer, there are over 70 people on this aircraft and you want all of us around the gate? So much for the 6 ft social distance rules I guess, but then again the airlines pack us in like sardines so what’s the point of the social distance rule anyways."
28th February 2020,6,"""restaurant choices are limited and very noisy""",Not Verified |  Once you go through security restaurant choices are limited and very noisy. If you have dietary limitations or are vegetarian there are not many offerings. Assistance with immigration was the bright spot. Ladies at Global Entry were excellent.
23rd February 2020,7,"""Consistently frustrating""","Not Verified |  The return baggage system speed is the worst of any airport that I frequent and I fly a lot. Consistently frustrating, I dread having to check a bag."
26th December 2019,3,"""has the slowest baggage claim""",Not Verified |  I fly a lot out of many airports and Sky Harbor has the slowest baggage claim I've ever experienced. It is the best reason I moved away from Phoenix. I always dread the return to visit family.
20th December 2019,8,"""some of the nicest and friendliest people""",Not Verified |  I think the TSA agents at Sky Harbor are some of the nicest and friendliest people I've experienced. The only thing I didn't like about the airport was the extra hour it took to get to the car rentals. All of the volunteers at the airport are super nice.
14th November 2019,2,"""One of the worst designed airports""","✅ Trip Verified | I’ve traveled all over the country and internationally. One of the worst designed airports and even without the design my service experience was terrible. Flight sat on the runway for 30 min. Bags took forever to come out. Had to wait in line for a bus to the car rental place. Car rental place was 15 minutes away. It’s a desert, are you telling me you couldn’t build one closer? How valuable is your sand? Signage was bad at the rental car place. Lines were bad because a bus load of people got there at the same time. Phoenix airport mentions that they will be getting a train connection to the car rental in a couple years. First of all, that means they know they suck even if they want to claim and trademark that they are the friendliest airport. It also doesn’t make the long drive to the rental any better. Instead of a bus now I’m gonna be on a tram. Great job Phoenix. The day service is determined within the first 20 minutes of the experience. Mine was spent on the runway and the remaining hour was spent getting my bags and car. Thanks. I hope my negative word of mouth affects your business like you affected mine. I’ll make sure to let every person I know. Enjoy your terrible NPS."
30th August 2019,10,"""incredibly kind and helpful""","Not Verified |  We recently traveled from Phoenix to Seattle with my son's ashes, I was expecting a hassle going through TSA but the officers were incredibly kind and helpful. I just want to say how thankful I am for the respect given my son's remains."
28th June 2019,8,"""fast and easy for domestic travel""","Not Verified |  Everyone is honestly being far too harsh. Phoenix Sky Harbor is really not bad, the lines are usually short, getting through security is pretty fast, tons of great stores and restaurants open. However, there is basically no international flights which really sucks but LAX is a 1 hour flight away so it’s not really that big of an issue. As for domestic flights, they have one to basically every large city and often. Bathrooms are clean, WiFi is fantastic, not a lot of gate seating though. Basically, it’s not bad at all, fast and easy for domestic travel."
5th June 2019,10,"""polite and helpful service""","✅ Trip Verified |  I encountered polite and helpful service by the employees at checkin and in the restaurants of the Phoenix International Airport. It is an easy airport to navigate. Overall the airport was very clean and I was particularly impressed with the restrooms. The ladies restrooms had plenty of paper towels and toilet tissue, the sinks were freshly cleaned, the mirrors were shiny without marks, the floors were clean and shiny, and each stall was quite large, which I really liked! I was quite impressed with this airport and will gladly recommend it to others."
22nd April 2019,1,"""not the friendliest airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Definitely not the friendliest airport, lots of unfriendly treatment of passengers including: - having to walk, yes walk outside in the heat or cold between two of the terminals, no train, no buses like there used to be, I’ve never seen anything like it. They say there is a golf cart to help transport but I’ve only seen it once in twenty times and it was full. So you just have to walk with your luggage. Good luck. If you land past 9:30pm they close several of the exits in Terminal 4 so you have to walk twice as far just to get out of the terminal, then you have to walk back to baggage claim or your car. They make hundreds and hundreds of passengers walk late at night so they can close two exits and save on one security guard’s wages—not friendly, annoying after a long day of travel. There are 8 gates at the end of the B concourse that are squeezed into the space that one or two gates would be. It’s crazy, people pushing each other, literally lines crossing each other to get onto the plane and no seating, everyone has to stand or sit on the floor. Why crush 8 gates into such a small space? Not friendly. Creates angry passengers. Honestly I’m trying to find what is friendly about PHX."
17th April 2019,1,"""No car rental shuttle buses""","✅ Trip Verified | On arrival last week April 11, I took the earliest flight from DCA getting to Reagan airport at 4:30 AM to arrive at Phoenix at 9:20 AM. No car rental shuttle buses. The line was hundreds of passengers long. Inexcusable. Tonight on my return flight, fearing the car return bus fiasco, I arrived at the airport 5 hours before my flight. At check in the said Gate A 6 An hour later they switched to gate A 20 (another pier). An hour later the sent me back to A 11. Then after that 1.5 hours before departure they switched me to gate B 13. As I passed AA passenger assistance counter in The B Gate pier, one of the two AA employees pulled the ribbon closed in front of me and said “Closed!” At 9:45. I just wanted to ask her if they were going to change us again. She stepped out passed the ribbon she closed and pointed 100 feet back up the B gate pier for me to go look at the overhead flight boards. Never an apology. And for this so am paying for First Class. A decent company would offer a refund. The airport food service facilities are wholly inadequate with passengers waiting in long lines to be seated. (Half hour wait at an airport)"
21st March 2019,3,"""consistently bad service""
",✅ Trip Verified | Disabled. Waited almost an hour for someone to push wheelchair from counter to gate. No pusher available at boarding so I had to hobble down the jetway. Fly every week out of PHX. Pretty consistently bad service for disabled travellers.
20th March 2019,3,"""always wheelchair issues at PHX""
","✅ Trip Verified | Disabled. Waited alomost an hour to get a pusher for a wheelchair to take to gate. At gate, no pushers available, had to hobble down to gate. Travel every week, always wheelchair issues at PHX."
24th January 2019,1,"""unable to communicate basic information""","✅ Trip Verified | I am relatively new to the area. I just had to go on a 3 day trip. I got to Terminal 4 at 6am on Monday and I see a sign to Terminal 4 South car park. No other information was given. Was it short term I wondered? No, I thought, if it was short term, they would tell you this like every other car park in the USA, or indeed the planet, and also tell you the rates. When I came back just 3 days later the car park attendant hit me with an $81 dollar bill. I am absolutely disgusted with the service. You are apparently unable to communicate simple basic information to new comers. Next time I will take a luxury taxi instead and save myself a bundle. Thanks a lot."
11th December 2018,6,"""lack of international flights""","✅ Trip Verified |   Phoenix is overall a great airport besides the lounge situation deteriorating and the lack of international flights. The Pros: - Ease of access - Good food options - Good Internet - Fast Security (unless they do the dog screening as they take some time to get setup and while they do the security checkpoint is closed) The Cons: - Major discrepancy in quality of services between terminals that are not connected - Lost it’s only Priority Pass lounge access in the afternoon - No Asia flights and maybe 1.2 flights a day to Europe (and I am generous) - If the flight to Frankfurt and London are at the terminal together it gets messy, there is no real room for international expansion - Rental car are on the other side of the planet."
26th November 2018,1,"""Worst TSA experience ever""",✅ Trip Verified | Worst TSA experience ever in over 40 years of flying! The airport check-in and curbside is terrible. Would rather drive 6 hours to LAX than go thru this again. They claim it is the “friendliest airport in the USA”! No way!
16th June 2018,2,"""wouldn’t recommend to anyone""",Not Verified | Check baggage services horrible. No help or limited staff. Also staff serving very unfriendly. Can’t even explain how impersonal they were. I had also assumed that the gate number printed on my ticket was correct (my fault). They could at least post at the gate that the gate had changed. So much technology and all. Security check in was super unfriendly as well. No one had even had a slight smile - aren’t they getting paid? If I could choose another airport definitely would do that. I wouldn’t recommend this airport to anyone.
27th April 2018,1,"""crowded, cranky service""","✅ Trip Verified | I travel weekly and frequent Sky Harbor several times a month. Since I fly SW I’m usually out of Terminal 4. First off, the departure and arrival boards are not anywhere that makes sense. After arriving from the car rental you have to proceed to any of the four gates (a,b, d,d). AB one side, CD on the other. So if you walk up to the gate at A and you’re on C, you have to walk all the way across the terminal. Not enough characters to complain about everything wrong but the other peeve of mine is a complete lack of seating, one bar per gate. Clearly the “Best Airport” in my opinion is outscored by almost all others that I travel to. Cancun even beats this place. Crowded, cranky service and old. Tear it down."
9th April 2018,3,"""It is a nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified | Locating Terminal 4 parking area is almost impossible. If you have to meet someone from an international flight at Phoenix Sky Harbor Terminal 4, allow at least 30 extra minutes to locate the parking area. It is a nightmare! Whoever put up the signs to different parts of the airport must have been drunk when they came to point drivers towards the T4 parking area ramp. The lane the sign points to is not the right access lane, it is on a slight bend, there are numerous other signs and you end up sailing past on the constant flow of traffic. I have to pick people up regularly from T4 and it beats me every time. I have complained many times at the airport, but nothing changes. If you find it in three circumnavigations of the airport, you win a prize! Is anybody at Sky Harbor listening?"
25th March 2018,2,"""Dirty floors. Torn seats""","❎ Not Verified |  Dirty floors. Torn seats. A foul and mysterious odor. Antiquated baggage claim. Jetblue only mans a desk from 8-12 pm. TSA is a joke. If you didn’t know better, you’d think you were in a third world airport. But actually, those places try to have higher standards. It is as if the airport leveraged the beautiful weather so as to compensate for the substandard conditions of Sky Harbor. Embarrassing and disappointing for such an amazing state."
7th March 2018,2,"""Poor signage""","❎ Not Verified |  Picking up a handicapped friend from the airport. I have only been here one other time and had the same experience. Poor signage. Either not enough or even helpful. Trying to pick up someone here is a challenge. No information on where to park. Short term parking is not labelled until you are unable to access the lane. Miss a parking garage because the signage is so poor, you are out of luck. Exit the airport and start all over with tons of traffic. Dealing with this airport, I’m surprised more people do not miss their flights. Very poor layout and design. New York is easier to deal with. Not the best, but better than Phoenix, at least in NY, there are friendly people guiding you in the right direction. Good luck Phoenix, your growing pains are showing."
6th March 2018,2,"""TSA is a joke""","✅ Trip Verified | TSA is a joke. They hand checked almost everyone’s bag since their machines were malfunctioning so this made a ton of people late and on top of it, they were so rude! So much for calling themselves “the friendliest airport.” Ridiculous. Everyone was furious but of course had to comply."
26th February 2018,1,"""Horrible experience overall""","❎ Not Verified |  We were traveling with my autistic kid. I told the TSA agents that he needed assistance, they still asked him all kinds of questions, he had to go through the screening booth. He couldn’t understand what was asked of him. I kept telling them he doesn’t understand but they still insisted he should go through the whole process, dismissing my suggestion that they just do a pat down or find an alternative. I had to kneel to put each of his feet on the yellow markings and show him how to get his hands up and he kept putting them down. Horrible experience overall. I talked to the supervisor and she seemed to think that the lack of sensitivity towards a disabled child is all OK! Lots of training seems to be needed for that team."
13th February 2018,1,"""Delays have the entire airport behind""",❎ Not Verified |  Delays have the entire airport behind with counter attendants giving half answers in order to get you to leave them alone so they can to the same to the next person. No compensation given for when their construction delays cause me to miss my connecting flight resulting in an 18 hour layover and expensive last minute sleeping arrangements as well as missed earning potential.
30th December 2017,2,"""was deliberately misdirected""",✅ Trip Verified | “Everyone is TSA Pre Check Today”. Was travelling with two children and was deliberately misdirected by two male airport security employees when asked to be directed to the TSA Pre-check despite being an TSA approved traveller. No good reason for doing this except to harass a female parent travelling alone with two children. What a shame. I saw other passenger behind me being directed to TSA without hitch so I went back and entered the line without seeing their “assistance”.
23rd November 2017,2,"""Most poorly laid out airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Cannot for the life of me figure out why someone designed an airport where to connect between the terminals you have to exit a terminal and go through security again. I was traveling with a friend who was in a different terminal so I went to the friend’s terminal to have breakfast. No one bothered to tell me I was in the wrong terminal or warn me I couldn’t get to my terminal from where I was. I had to go outside, walked a lot, and re-enter security. Most poorly laid out airport I’ve ever been in."
16th November 2017,5,"""poorly managed Duty Free""","✅ Verified Review |  I travel to/from Phoenix at least twice a year and this is an ongoing issue: Out of all the airports I have ever visited Sky Harbor wins for most unreliable, ill-prepared, poorly managed Duty Free ever. For this most recent flight Nov 15th 2017? Just the littlest kiosk was open in the B gates. No alcohol and no cigarettes. Sad."
8th September 2017,1,"""one of the worst airports I have been to""","✅ Verified Review |  This airport is the one of the worst airports I have been to. It was September 5th at 4.30 am, and I was heading to Screening zone before heading to the gate. There was a huge line up at that time and they opened 3 lanes for screening. 1 for express and 2 for general boarding. Apparently a screening-machine was malfunctioning in one of the 2 general boarding lanes. Instead of opening another lane to deal with the congested line, staffs merged two lanes into one. That resulted in adding extra 10~20 minutes of everyone's waiting time and limited space for people pick up their belongings after passing the screening line. While I was picking up my belongings after passing the screening-machine, staff said ""you are taking up too much space and not letting others having the space for picking up their belongings"". This was very upsetting because all this happened due to their malfunctioning machine and merging two lanes into one. I had never problem with this kind of situation because I pick up my belongings pretty fast. Lots of people were complaining at that time but staffs did nothing about it and did not want to open another lane to deal with this situation, that was very lazy of them and stupid. There really needs to be procedures to deal with this kind of situation. Otherwise it will happen again and that would be just silly, because this is an easy fix. Hopefully whoever works in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport see this review and bring it up in their meeting and come up with better procedure for this kind of situation. Plus, the wifi is horrible too. This is 2017 and there is still issue with weak signal. Come on."
4th August 2017,2,"""Very disappointing""","❎ Unverified |  Very disappointing. The guy at the information desk gave me misinformation - not once, but twice. Wrong information about baggage claim and about airport shuttles. Seemed very bored and disinterested in helping anyone. The American Airlines baggage claim was a mess. Signs giving the baggage claim area for my flight were all wrong. What a mess."
7th July 2017,2,"""Baggage Claim area was abysmal""","❎ Unverified |  Baggage Claim area was abysmal. Frontier Airlines from COS arrived with info that bags would be on 4. No signs were at Carousel 4, but they were switched to 5. Bags came from 5, but stopped before the last bags came out. Someone noticed a flashing yellow light. No one was in the area to assist. Delta said the problem was Frontier's not theirs and we'd have to go to the ticket counter. The info counter person said she didn't have a phone and couldn't call. She has a phone. Frontier ticket counter said it's not their problem, the carousels belong to the City of Phoenix. City of Phoenix said that the carousel doesn't stop unless there's a jam and that's Frontier's problem. After about 45 minutes of this a Frontier ticket agent went into an elevator and got someone to finally react. Some mysterious guy apparently pushed on the flashing yellow light and the belts started moving. This shouldn't happen at what is claimed to be a Friendly Airport. Someone should be available to assure the carousels are working properly, regardless of which airline is using them. Bad experience."
9th April 2017,2,"""one of the worst airports in the US""","✅ Verified Review |  This is one of the worst airports in the US. The terminals are spread out all over the place, making connections a chore. If you have a connecting flight in a different terminal than you've arrived, be prepared to walk a lot. It also seems that this airport is unable to accommodate the number of airlines/flights arriving and departing. I've taken several departing flights that have left the gate early or on time, only to end up delayed 45-60 minutes because of taxiing and other tarmac traffic delays. Avoid this airport if you can!"
20th December 2016,6,"""direct route back to the main lobby is blocked""","Occasionally, when my flight is delayed and arrives at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport after about 10.00pm, the direct route back to the main lobby is blocked after deplaning at Terminal D. Subsequently, hundreds of passengers from various gates at the terminal and myself are re-directed to Terminal C, that adds about 750 feet (that's about 2 1/2 football fields long) to our tired trek home. It's rather disheartening and seems the City is too cheap to provide the needed security guard to watch us exiting Terminal D."
18th November 2016,2,"""unnecessary and badly organised""","I have no problem with security checks - keeps us safe but after a 10 hour flight - the equivalent of 3 am for us we waited at passport control for over an hour, with, at times, only 1 booth dealing with the non American, non special assistance passengers. It was unnecessary and badly organised. Experience certainly didn't feel like ""Welcome to America""."
26th April 2016,2,"""not enough space""","What a mess this place is. TSA is in chaos. Rude and inefficient. Body scanners are missing. Metal detectors used are apparently not set with proper sensitivity. One of us cruised through with one artificial hip. The other of us lit it up because of two artificial knees. Thus, an invasive pat down ensued. Ridiculous waste of time for the agent and the traveler. Not enough lines. Not enough space. Signage inadequate. Unorganized and sloppy. Then there is the terminal. Dirty and uncomfortable. Not enough seating for a plane full of passengers. Public address system poor. Boarding instructions confusing because you could not tell what gate was making the announcements. Nothing in the terminal says welcome to Phoenix. Nothing lets you know you are in the southwest. If we could, we would definitely avoid this airport in the future."
18th February 2016,2,"""unorganized mess""","I arrived almost two hrs before my next connecting flight. To only stand in line for three hours. TSA by the masses yet just three lines opened. More than three flights missed by about 100 people. When I finally got to TSA I was told I had to leave the liquor I purchased In Mexico (sealed legally). I stated I would check it in (he never suggested that option). AA stated they have nothing to do with TSA delay, I paid $150 for next flight because yes, way before the ""I would have to relinquish liquor"" while in the 2nd hr of waiting on line I missed my flight. Lots of employees at this airport as I went to customer service to complain stated that the airport has been a mess since Dec 2015. Avoid this unorganized mess of an airport. Lastly it's very sad how AA nickle and dime its customers."
15th January 2016,8,"""a really bad baggage experience""","Overall, it is a great airport, however a really bad baggage experience has left a bad taste for checking baggage. My bags took 1 hour to arrive and were not on the carousel advertised on the electronic board. As I was leaving with much luggage that showed up on carousel 5, the airport board was still showing that my bags were still being waited for on carousel 1. At the tail end of a long, overnight trip, this was not a good experience to end my trip."
17th December 2015,2,"""avoid this airport""","We were on a flight from Cancun Mexico to San Francisco with a stop in Phoenix. We purchased a few items from the Cancun transit shops wrapped and sealed in the special security cleared bag. Upon arrival at PHX, we cleared immigration and customs and were on our way to catch the domestic flight to SFO, which included going through TSA. The TSA agents confiscated our sealed purchased items stating that they were not in the right TSA approved bags. It is totally unacceptable to require all the countries in the world use the same type of security clearance bags used in the US. We ended up losing everything we bought to the TSA agents who supposedly ""confiscated"" them. The agents had a terrible attitude and did not even try to listen to the explanations. Very unhappy with how out of touch the TSA agents were in this airport. Try to avoid this airport as much as you can, especially if transferring from an international flight to a domestic."
13th December 2015,1,"""signage is non-existent""","Avoid for transit travel - informational signage and help is non-existent. After walking in circles for 15 minutes my wife and I finally asked a pilot what terminal our airline was in and then learned we needed to exit security to get to our terminal. Needless to say that meant we needed to clear security again. We had cleared thru Pre-TSA at our originating airport but our transit boarding passes did not have our pre TSA-clearance authorization printed so we had to go to our airline ticketing area to reprint. The lines were long and the staff working TSA were less than cordial. We asked if there was work in process to connect the terminals and they said no why would they? We explained that we had come in on Alaska (a major airline) and that we were departing on American (another major airline) and that going through security twice was a waste of resources and they pretty much they said too bad, that's just normal."
2nd December 2015,1,"""worst security screening queues ever""","Worst security screening queues ever. Arrived 2 hours early, but TSA only had 2 lines open, forcing more than a one hour wait just to get past ID screening, then still had to go through luggage screening lines. TSA personnel are rude, condescending, and could care less. Southwest Airlines was forced to delay departures as more than a dozen passengers were late due to TSA screwups with far too few people working the first Tuesday in December at prime time 6 p.m. departure. What an incomprehensiblly incompetent TSA staff at this airport, has to be the worst in the U.S."
15th November 2015,3,"""line was ridiculously long""","After a lovely weekend in Scottsdale, the departure almost didn't happen. We had time to kill and arrived at the airport 2 hours early. Thank goodness, because the security line almost resulted in a missed flight. The line was ridiculously long and there were only 3 regular lines open. TSA pre-check was practically empty. Passengers were missing their flights as we navigated the security line. I arrived at the gate with only 5 minutes to spare. TSA staff could not care less about the situation - why would they have 1 TSA person checking identification and IDs and not accommodate what was clearly an exceptionally long line of passengers to get through the security process? I will remember this experience and that planning to navigate this airport may require closer to 3 hours for a simple domestic flight."
12th November 2015,5,"""out of date and touch""","TSA rude, sarcastic. Most of stores closed. Out of date and touch."
9th November 2015,7,"""I have seen better""","This airport will do, although I have seen better. Restrooms and terminal were clean although not 100% spotless. It's a considerable distance to the gate. There are electric buggies roaming about, to help the elderly and infirm. Queue times and staff performance were reasonable, as I expected."
3rd November 2015,9,"""completely packed and chaotic""","Phoenix airport is easy to navigate, get in, get out and be on your way. It's a good medium size - not too overwhelming nor will you have to walk miles and miles to get to your gate. The only negatives are that as of October 2015, they are still not allowing ride sharing service like Uber and Lyft to operate at the airport. You have to take a cab when leaving the airport which means surcharges and extra fees. There is also limited seating and food options at Southwest gates. Everywhere we tried to grab a seat or a beer was completely packed and chaotic."
31st October 2015,9,"""very easy to navigate""","Transited in Phoenix en route to San Diego on Southwest Airlines. This airport is very easy to navigate and you can access areas of the airport where different airlines are operating. For example, while searching for McDonalds, I ended up in the area for American Airlines, and enjoyed breakfast there. Once I was done eating at McDonalds, I walked back to the area for Southwest Airlines. The free wifi at the airport also worked like a charm. The airport also boasts pretty views of surrounding mountains."
12th October 2015,4,"""little choice of where to spend my waiting time""","I transfered between Southwest flights in the new Terminal 4 and found it to be both spacious and attractive. But there's only so much that can make up for a poor airport design. Each concourse is a self-contained unit and the walk between them is extraordinarily long, making it impractical to use any of the restaurants or facilities other than those of your flight's concourse. And with only a handful of shops and restaurants in my departing concourse, I felt as if I had very little choice of where to spend my waiting time. (My meal was great, however). With the long distances, this wouldn't be a good place to have a short layover, and switching terminals would be even worse. Finally, the wi-fi, while free, had a weak signal wherever I used it and frequently disconnected."
18th September 2015,1,"""I was rudely addressed""",Worst security check-in at Phoenix Airport. Newly pregnant I had a simple concern about going through the scanner. I was rudely addressed and basically felt like a cow being pushed through and forced to use the x-ray machine. I hope I never have to come here again. The city was a fantastic friendly city and the airport security does not reflect that at all. Very disappointed.
21st August 2015,1,Phoenix Airport customer review,Worst security checkpoint I have ever experienced. The TSA pre is never available. Poorly run.
6th April 2015,3,Phoenix Airport customer review,Awful start by adding 45 minutes at minimum to your pre-flight schedule if you rent a car. Rental facilities are nice but not user friendly. Pack a lunch distance and obstacles traffic lights etc will chew up minutes. Work up a sweat getting from car to curb only to wait for a heated bus. Bus driver was friendly though. Check in area at terminal 3 are very small and any line at Jetblue or Delta will block the door. TSA personnel are disinterested and moved at a snails pace. TSA area very small and jammed up. Terminal was strewn with bits of paper and the place looks dated carpet dingy. Tried to board with my cell phone but gate did not have capabilities sent me over to next gate to get confirmation. Overall disappointed in the user friendliness of sky harbor.
6th July 2014,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,Flight from UK arrived leaving 2+ hours to make a connecting flight. It was the only plane coming in. About 10 booths for passport check varied between 2-3 in use. Then security. 3 people checking boarding passes for 1st class/priority passengers 1 for the rest. Then 2 of 4-6 lines of scanners open. I missed my flight and sat for 5 extra hours after a 10 hour flight. Pointlessly stupid and uncaring people from immigration and TSA. They should not have jobs or more to the point their supervisor should not have a job. Read the other reviews it is not coincidence.
3rd July 2014,2,Phoenix Airport customer review,I would do anything to avoid this airport. In my opinion it is one of the worst in the U.S. The food vendors are inefficient and just don't care. Check in lines are very long and agents don't assist or direct incoming passengers. The TSA areas and agents are crowded and rude. It is poorly organized with an inefficient very off- site rental car site. If you are going to Phoenix you are stuck. If you want to use Phoenix for connections don't.
7th April 2014,2,Phoenix Airport customer review,My wife and I recently returned from a trip to Mexico and entered the U.S. in Phoenix. Our arrival just so happened to be at the same time 4 other planes landed from other countries so we were not allowed to depart the plane until customs cleared out the other planes. My wife and I expected to sit on the plane for at least an hour considering how many planes were before us but Customs was able to get us off the plane in less than 30 minutes which was at least in my opinion exemplary. The reason we gave Phoenix Sky Harbor such low ratings is what happened after we cleared customs. We had to go to our next flight which didn't leave for 2 hours. But we once again had to go through security to get to our domestic flight. We stood in line at security for nearly an hour! Because of this combined with the long walk to the other concourse we barely made it to our next flight and weren't able to eat anything for dinner. The security checkpoint was poorly run. The people working the checkpoint weren't pleasant at all. And out of the 6 security lines there only two of them were open! I doubt that there were more than 50 people ahead of us but it still took us an hour to get through the security line. From now on my wife and I will do everything we can to avoid any connecting flights through Phoenix. If you have to change from an international flight to a domestic flight be prepared to take a full 2 hours to get to your domestic flight! I've worked for the federal government all my adult life but even for me the management of the security checkpoints is inept.
22nd March 2014,2,Phoenix Airport customer review,Be forewarned: Allow 2-3 hours before your flight departure time to check in at Phoenix SkyHarbor Airport. And do not assume that will leave you with time for such things as catching a bite to eat before you board your plane. Airline check-in goes fairly efficiently but it's the TSA that will slow you down. Expect to wait an hour or more to pass through screening watching as everyone passes through one or two inspection stations while 5 other stations stand empty/closed. Next time I might prefer to drive 16 hours (from Denver) than to fly through Skyharbor.
29th January 2014,8,Phoenix Airport customer review,I would suggest any reviews of dining experiences or facilities written prior to 2013 be modified since Sky Harbor T4 is going through a full restoration/modernization. A total makeover of eateries and services throughout. They are showcasing local favorite restaurants which has added some great choices pre and post security. Cowboy Ciao Humble Pie Four Peaks Brewery Sauce Barrio Cafe to name a few. T2 and T3 have not been given this same makeover but have some decent choices nonetheless. I actually look forward to getting to PHX early to grab a bite to eat and a decent glass of wine. On return they even have a brand new full service Starbucks in the Baggage Claim area. They also have added the light rail running between Economy parking and T4 which is another great improvement. TSA agents are friendly yet professional. I am grateful for my TSA Pre Check status too which allows me to breeze through security with little or no line.
21st March 2013,5,Phoenix Airport customer review,Terminal 4 has several hallways or spurs serving the gates - when our gate was changed to one in a different spur it was a very long walk but they had moving walkways. An employee pushing two wheelchairs at once had to do the same turn-around and didn't use the walkways. The spur that included our new gate had only three food services (the other one had more) all run by the same company with no cooked food except one was making breakfast egg sandwiches. I asked for one without meat and was told it wasn't possible. They seemed to be making them from scratch! I settled for a very good yoghurt parfait but would have preferred something more substantial. Most staff were incredibly helpful but one needed additional training. None of the food services on our spur had a vegetarian sandwich of any kind. We've had easy food choices at many airports and while traveling throughout Arizona for two weeks so Phoenix's attitude seemed very obtuse. Many people have dietary needs or preferences for a variety of reasons. The airport itself is close to downtown Phoenix easy to reach. The free wifi worked fine. The announcements were clear and the restrooms were clean. Check in and security (at 7.30 a.m.) were friendly and well-organized.
9th August 2012,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,"Being from Europe I'm very disappointed with Sky Harbor's facilities. I flew PHX-LHR from terminal 4. Firstly the ""duty-free section"" was very poor. Secondly the lack of eateries really surprised me especially since this were the gates with the international departures. I was forced to head to another section of the airport to get a slice of pizza. There were nowhere to sit and eat. I was lucky though to force myself to a table where it was possible to stand and eat. Finally the store with newspapers candy drinks etc was closed at my terminal (apparently it isn't allowed at this airport to have more than three stores open at the same gates a store clerk told me this). After all these flaws are quite understandable considering Sky Harbor almost exclusively serve domestic flights."
31st May 2012,9,Phoenix Airport customer review,I flew out of this airport while attending college in Phoenix. The airport was easily accessible by bus from campus and the check-in and security lines were almost always quick and efficient. Terminal 4 has an excellent central waiting area (outside security) with seating/shops/food everywhere with an overall very nice atmosphere. Having separate security checkpoints for each section of gates (all the gates are connected behind security) is a very smart feature which cut down on wait times at security considerably.
29th April 2012,9,Phoenix Airport customer review,B Diener's comment [27 September 2010] is incomprehensible in that it twice describes PHX as 'a small airport'. It is actually huge spreading over a large area with long distances to cover in terminals. However it does provide a fairly pleasant experience. T4 has some of those long distances but passing through TSA was almost pleasant. The centralised Rental Car Centre like that at Las Vegas is actually a good idea and the associated shuttles are frequent.
22nd March 2012,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,GDL to SFO on US Air and had a short layover of 1 hr 20 mins at Phoenix Sky Harbor. This airport is a nightmare. It is so far from one gate to another that 1 hr 20 mins is not sufficient to make the connection. I missed my connection and had to stay in Phoenix for one night and get a flight the next day. The facilities were very nice; yet the problem was the distances. In the future I will avoid this airport if at all possible.
6th February 2012,5,Phoenix Airport customer review,Waiting time for luggage is poor for such a small airport. Rental car companies are all centralised in one location with just one well served shuttle route which is a great idea. Queuing times for security are OK. Food choices in the departure area (after security) are limited to fast food only and generally rather poor.
25th June 2011,2,Phoenix Airport customer review,Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is not as friendly as it says. Your typical unfriendly experience at Sky Harbor begins at check-in. The TSA machines block 3 exits which can be a safety hazard if there was a fire. The TSA agents are the meanest I have come across and I fly a lot. Sky Harbor Airport has very few eateries and restaurants compared to most airports and the selection is very unhealthy. The airport has been undergoing a constant phase of construction for at least 3 years with no end in sight. A sky train is supposed to connect the airport with city transit but it wont be ready until around 2020.
15th May 2011,1,Phoenix Airport customer review,By far the worst airport security experience I've had with a 45+ minute wait time and the lineup snaking far out into the terminal. All because the TSA officers were checking re- checking re-re-checking (ad nauseum) people for the slightest infractions; for things like going through their machine with (gasp) a $5 bill in their pocket. No coins just a slip of paper. There was an elderly couple in front of me who got re-checked by the scanner three times because they had little bits of paper in various pockets. This was going on in every single lineup not just mine and it wasn't because something unusual had happened on the worldwide scene that day. Near as I could tell the TSA was just doing it for kicks. I rarely get angry at service personnel because most people are just doing their jobs as best they can but especially the way an elderly couple got treated really had me seething by the time I finally got through that agonizingly long lineup.
26th September 2010,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,It's a small airport that is very efficient. The check-in was quick with hardly any line up's. I can say the same for the security check. Once you are in the secure area you have the choice of checking out a few gift shops or some bars and smaller restaurants. Personally I liked the large panorama window overlooking one of the runways with nice scenery in the background. As it is a small airport traffic delays aren't common.
23rd October 2009,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,PHX is my primary airport so here about 2-3 times a month. Easy to use good signage but distances can be long to get from one area to another. Shuttle to parking lots have gotten more crowded (less buses running?). They are adding a people mover system so construction is everywhere.
2nd August 2009,2,Phoenix Airport customer review,"I travel through PHX about 25 times a year and perhaps familiarity breeds contempt but their slogan ""the Friendliest Airport in America"" is completely ridiculous given that I can usually get through the entire travel process there without so much as a kind word or a smile from anybody dealing with the public. It's become a personal challenge to see how friendly and polite I can be and still get a surly response! This last trip I flew on Delta through Terminal Three which is showing its age with filthy worn carpet broken seats at the gates and broken fixtures in the bathrooms. The ticket counter agents were surly the TSA personnel were yelling at passengers the bartender at the Taverna restaurant was carding everybody including a surprised white haired old man in his seventies who proceeded to drop all his stuff on the floor while trying to find his ID and all the time the bartender was loudly slagging her managers. Wendy's had a long line that didn't seem to be moving the Delta/Sky West gate agent was curt to the point of rudeness and the flight was almost an hour late with no announcements. I should mention that in both Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 most of the shops and eateries close very early sometimes as early as 4:30 PM well before the evening flights leave. I can't count the number of times I've been stuck behind security with literally more than a thousand passengers who have no place to eat or drink. Sorry while all of that may be typical of the pathetic state of air travel in the USA these days none of it says ""friendly"" to me. To top it off the drunken-sounding automated announcer mangles names to the point of unintelligibility. On the return it is common to wait forty-five minutes or more for a checked bag. On the good side the free Internet usually works the taxi stands are very convenient to the baggage claim and economy parking is cheap at $8 a day. Sky Harbor tip; park on the roof of the Terminal 2 parking garage. It's as cheap as the outlying economy lots but is directly adjacent to Terminal 2 and is just a short walk or bus ride from Terminal 3."
20th May 2009,5,Phoenix Airport customer review,Efficient transportation. Check-in activities vary by airline and terminal but with the exception of the Spring Break week all of them move along quickly. The only hitch is the TSA bag checking procedures where after checking in passengers with checked luggage must submit them to the TSA for security checks and pilfering. All of the terminals have several options for dining and T4 has numerous very good opportunities to eat for an airport. The TSA Security Theater lines for passenger entry to the secure area move quickly and in T4 if you see that the TSA has decided to go crazy at one checkpoint you can just walk across or over to another line that is actually permitting travel to occur. Checked in luggage usually arrives in a reasonable amount of time. The restrooms are plentiful and clean. PHX employs sufficient numbers of airport employees and volunteers to give help and guidance to all the visitors. The rental car facility is off site but the rental car shuttle bus system works smoothly. The airport has a free wifi system in all terminals. The freeways and surface roads to the airport are all well marked and the PHX highway system is well-designed and flows smoothly.
6th November 2008,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,Well run and busy. Phoenix surprised me on a few counts. It is pretty big very busy and handles volumes astonishingly well. It is not an international destination really so is mostly all about domestic and as no-one wants to drive to Phoenix it's domestic travel is large. Good airport pretty well figured out
2nd June 2008,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,PHX has undergone extensive improvements as of late. Curiously I noticed a rather dramatic increase in the cost of car rentals. When I arrived I was taken by shuttle to a brand new common rental car facility built atop the garage where the rentals are kept. Apparently the drastic increase in rental rates (before gas price increases) is due to an outrageous assessment levied against the rental companies those fees are then charged through to arriving passengers renting vehicles. Weather is seldom a problem in PHX and the signage and traffic patterns of the airport roads make navigating around fairly easy. The terminals are equipped with moving walkways making it easy to get from one part of the terminal to another if needed.
22nd April 2008,3,Phoenix Airport customer review,Terminal 4 at PHX is aesthetically pleasing once past the scrums at the check in counters (signage is poor but that may be the fault of a certain airline rather than the airport itself). It's a shame the aesthetics don't carry over into the airside areas as seating at the gates is crowded with uncomfortable chairs. Baggage delivery from plane to belt always very slow taking at least 15 minutes after arrival for the first bags to appear. Worryingly some over-attention to details: there was a fellow at the stop for buses to the hire car centre to remind pax of the 'rules for riding the buses' for a five minute journey. The man told me bags had to be placed on the buses in a certain way 'to comply with federal regulations' - a bit overly judicious in my view. Too many irritants and not enough pluses during the Sky Harbor experience to give PHX more than two and a half stars which I will grudgingly change to three.
24th December 2007,4,Phoenix Airport customer review,"Pretty decent airport overall. Check-in lines were practically nonexistent security took only a few minutes to get through and the ground staff from the airline agents to security to the baggage handlers were all remarkably friendly efficient and helpful. I also liked the ""simulated desert"" decorations while moving between the check-in/baggage claim area and the security area on the second level. Unlike ORD expected delays were well-publicized and the monitors were constantly kept up-to-date. The baggage claim area is a bit drab though at least this time my bags didn't take too long to come through."
17th September 2007,5,Phoenix Airport customer review,PHX is an excellent airport on many fronts with just a few negative aspects. If you plan to transfer at PHX and want to switch airlines you will need to change terminals. This is not obvious but this is because very few people would want to do this since both Southwest and America West/USAirways have their hubs in T4. If you check luggage do not expect to find it waiting for you when you get down to baggage claim. Since PHX is a hub the volume of bags they process is enormous and the speed that passengers can make from the plane to the carousel will always result in a wait for bags. (Hint: Do not check bags!). T2 is very old and it is not attractive to look at. T2 is fast; from the car park to the airplane in fifteen minutes on some occasions including ticketing security and the walk. The T2 parking garage is right next to the terminal and the terminal is an older one full of airlines like TED so you can move right through it. And you will want to as there is no real reason to linger. T3 is fast; from the car park to the aircraft is again quick and easy. T3 is a vintage 1980's terminal but it has some very attractive artwork on the departures level and because of the hub in T4 for Southwest and America West/USAirways the remaining mainline airlines are usually on time and heading for their own hubs. T3 is also clean with plenty of seating although most of the airline clubs are now closed since 9/11. T4 is new clean and efficient. Lines in the ticketing level can be enormous but they move quickly. Security is usually pretty fast in T4 and the lines on the departures level move quickly there also exept on Spring Break. T4 has numerous dining options shoeshine and even art galleries. Passengers can walk from the Southwest side to the America West side without leaving the secure area. The travelators make a transit in T4 fairly painless. Sky Harbor has moved all the rental cars to an off-site condo facility to the southwest of the airport. The busses run very efficiently and they are not operated by the self-important Transit Police like at SJC but rather by helpful folks who want to transport you. The facility itself is huge but easy to navigate. Roads and Signage: The traffic flow around the three terminals is complex but the signs are very clear and accurate. Drivers new to Sky Harbor should be aware that the Rental Car facility is not AT the airport and that the traffic flow at T2 is different from T3 and T4 because it has a different orientation to the runways.
3rd January 2007,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,I had the chance to see the Phoenix Airport during a very long layover and found the experience to be quite positive. The Southwest Airlines concourses tended to be a bit crowded but I found the terminal to be admirably well maintained overall - clean shiny and refreshing. All airports should do as well as Phoenix does on basic upkeep. Signage was good inside the Southwest concourses and the shops and eateries were plentiful. Overall it was very pleasant.
15th November 2006,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,I recently flew through PHX airport for the first time. I flew in on America West and was connecting to a United flght. Overall I really enjoyed this airport. Terminal 4 which is where most of America West/US airways flight arrive and depart is spacious lots of shops and easy to navigate. However the major flaw with this airport is transfering to a non America West flight. There were no signs anywhere. I had no idea which terminal to go to or how to get to the other terminals. I asked several airport personnel and simply got a shrug indicating that they had no idea. The screens only show american west flights so that didn't help at all. Finally I found a TSA person who told me which terminal United flies out of and how to get there. Once this was solved the transfer of terminals is pretty easy and efficient. Overall great airport but needs better signage for people transfering to other airlines.
20th January 2006,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,Fly to Phoenix once or twice a year. Baggage always takes forever no matter which terminal you fly into. Recently flew United to SFO and waited at check-in for almost half an hour which wouldn't have been bad if I wasn't the second person in line. When the passenger in front of me thought he had an open agent she closed her station and left even though there was only one other agent that was only checking in first class passengers. She didn't care that no one was checking in the rest of us. The check in area is unbelievably small - I think they expect that planes holding hundreds of passengers don't actually fly out of their airport. Security took almost an hour - we were wound out down the ramp and around the corner towards the baggage carousels. The security agent checked our passports and insisted on additional ID for my husband because his passport had expired but let me right through even though mine was expired too.
27th April 2005,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,"I mostly use Term 4 (for America West) though I've done a few out of Term 2 and 3. Though not remarkable PHX is actually a pretty good airport - maybe even great by US standards because of it's overall efficiency. I've seen many long lines at check-in's which are usually a function of how many agents an airline wants to make available. Even at peak holiday times I don't think the Am. West lineup has ever taken longer than 30 - 40 minutes and if you arrive early (or just luck out perhaps) you often walk right up to the counter without wait...I'd say this happens about half the time I travel. Other airlines may not be quite so fast judging by their lines. Security lines appear very long at times but in fact they move quickly. A lineup stretching 300 feet can actually clear through in only 15 minutes. Even better (at least for Terminal 4) you can go through security at either of the two A gate entrances or the B gate (3 total) whichever is shortest and use post-security moving walkways to go back to your assigned gate. Many people don't know this or even when told are afraid to thinking they'll be going from one long line to another. After 20 or so trips in the last few years I've never seen all 3 security points busy -- you can almost literally walk right through if you're willing to move the least busy. Land-side and air-side restaurant shops are generally good in both areas although the last year construction is closing off several land-side stores. There is a severe shortage of chairs/tables in the land-side of Term. 4 which is too bad as the Oaxaca (sp?) restaurant there is a must for me but I have often had to stand and eat or kindly ask others if I may share their table something I'd rather not have to do. The T3 & 4 shops are typical ""airport"" but decent and there's lots of coffee bars sit-down licensed restaurants and the aforementioned moving walkway lets you explore the rather large Terminal 4 relatively quickly even when lugging your carry-on around. I often leave extra time on trips just so I can do this. Knock-on-wood I've never had a baggage error checked-in through PHX so in fact I almost never carry-on anymore. The T4 B gate is international but it's stores aren't remarkable - the duty free is nothing amazing. Fortunately you are a people-mover ride away from all the A gate stores without having to go through security again. PHX doesn't have the ambiance of other airports I've been to like Honolulu nor the clean look of Vancouver but it is not unattractive and does quite well at what's important...getting you checked in accurately and quickly. Restrooms are always clean. Airline employees roam the floor just to be there for people asking questions - they are actually partly responsible for why security moves so quickly too as they work with the TSA.. When looking at efficiencies and amenities combined I certainly prefer it over Las Vegas McCarran or SeaTAC. Read about Wash. Dulles and LAX Terminal 4 just to see frustrating an airport can be and you'll have some idea of what a good one is like."
10th April 2005,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,"The worst part of PHX is the baggage system on arrivial. It takes very very long for bags to arrive from aircraft -- even lightly loaded aircraft. This is true at each of the three terminals (2 3 4) and does not depend on which airline one travels. If you have the misfortune of arriving at terminal 4 then be prepared to also be harrassed by poorly trained staff who insist on checking bag tags -- but when asked they have no idea why they check bag tags other ""than its my job."" Apparently it is not a security factor; if it was one would think that the checkers would know that that is the reason they do it. But they don't and they are rude besides. But the wait for the bags to come of the flight is even more disturbing."
7th March 2005,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,PHX is a decent enough airport although signage could be improved. The TSA baggage screeners were kind enough to put locks on my cases after they'd screened them which impressed me. The tiny Duty Free store for international flights is astonishing too - not every airport can be like LHR but it could be quite a source of revenue for the airport operators and/or City of Phoenix to sell more duty free goods.
15th December 2004,n/a,Phoenix Airport customer review,Travelled thru PHX twice now. Both times were arrival and return to LHR. Very quick (for USA) immigration and everything well signed. At hire car within 35 minss of landing on a full 747-400. Airport is clean and tidy and all staff friendly. Security was unobtrusive other than when proceeding to gate and then thorough. Only downside was the lack of any decent Duty Free and catering was limited (and expensive).
23rd February 2022,2,"""I turned in a complaint to the airport and was basically told tough luck""",Not Verified |  I fly frequently in and out of Nashville Airport and don't really have ever any problems until today. My kids were in town and I had to take them to the airport for the return flight home. They are Minors so I went in with them to make sure they got on board the plane ok. I parked in the parking garage for less than 2 hours and was charged a full 1 day rate of 26 dollars. That rate kicks in at 45 minutes. I believe that is absurd. I don't have a problem paying to park but don't feel like I should have had to pay the full day rate. Don't get me wrong it isn't that I don't have the funds but it really the principle of it. I usually park off site because the rates are better and the shuttle service is better as well. I feel the full day rate shouldn't kick it until about 3 or 4 hours in the garage. I mean if you parked and took a flight somewhere it would take 3 to 4 hours to get there and back without really getting off a plane. So I turned in a complaint to the airport and was basically told tough luck. So my sentiment is Nashville Airport your customer service sucks. Do better. Not to mention the entire airport is a construction site inside and out.
30th December 2021,3,"""Very disappointed and very disrespectful""","Not Verified |  I just dropped my Aunt off at the airport to catch her flight. I was parked for 5 min max with my Caution lights on in the terminal. As soon as I unloaded the car and told her goodbye, I got back in the vehicle and the traffic guy (about 60yr old) is yelling at me to move. I said I’m about to move I’m just starting my GPS, which takes 1 min. He then proceeded to come up to my window and yell and tell me “I don’t care what your doing, you can put your GPS on somewhere else. You need to move.” By this point I could’ve been done and gone if he wasn’t causing an issue over me dropping off my relative and only being there for 5 min. I know his job is important. I know it is important to try and keep traffic going so it doesn’t back up. What I don’t agree with is being rude while doing it. Everyone is there to do the same thing. It isn’t going to make things better, or traffic go any faster, by being rude and inconsiderate of others. Very disappointed and very disrespectful. He needs to be written up for this."
7th November 2021,2,"""Seriously BNA get your act together""","Not Verified |  I have flown many times out of BNA never that much of a problem until this last flight, I would have driven to my destination had I known what a mess it is, now don't think I want to fly out of Nashville ever again. I was over 2 hrs early and only made it to the gate with 1 hr to wait. What happened to all the quick places to grab some food? Seriously BNA get your act together."
3rd November 2021,5,"""on track to reinvent our outdated BNA airport""","Not Verified |  In the heart of the South, on track to reinvent our outdated BNA airport. I have a question. Why is there no where to buy a Mountain Dew, Sun Drop, or Mello Yellow? I mean this is the South correct?"
3rd August 2021,1,"""No employees enforced the mask rule""",Not Verified |  A lot of people not wearing masks. No employees enforced the mask rule. The food employees were yelling at each other not wearing masks. The employees are rude. The airport is so dirty. I will never come here again.
13th July 2021,2,"""there were so many people not wearing masks""",Not Verified |  Although there were motivations in place and visible—there were so many people not wearing masks and the airport authority did not seem to care. I brought my own Lysol wipes and glad I did. I tried to sit in a chair but when I wiped it down the cloth showed so much grime and dirt that I ended up standing while I waited to board and I was pretty early. Cleaning crew were standing around talking on their phones while germs are having a field day on every surface of this airport. I live in Nashville and used to fly frequently. However now I’ll be seriously thinking twice about travel!
6th May 2021,1,"""I thought I was in a 1970’s low budget film""","Not Verified |  I thought I was in a 1970’s low budget film. This place has outdated, smelly, nasty carpet, broken seat and 2 1/2 restaurants. I may be stretching it on the 2 1/2 restaurants but what few restaurants they do have are very poor."
5th April 2021,1,"""Lack of places to eat""",Not Verified |  Infrastructure is poor. Lack of places to eat. Long lines at the few open food vendors. High priced and low quality food. Ugly terminal. No staff available for directions/questions.
16th February 2021,1,"""the airport is supposed to be prepared for planes to fly!""","✅ Trip Verified | We came to Nashville to visit. There was bad weather when we left, so I can understand that these may be special circumstances. That being said, all flights were cancelled little by little. They kept you in the airport for as long as possible. 1 restaurant that sits probably 30 people, 2 stores that were poorly stocked with disgusting sandwiches, 1 small bar. Al this to serve hundreds of people that are waiting to see if their flights will be cancelled or not. Finally, after 24hrs of being moved around from gate to gate and delayed, they got us on a plane. The pilot explained what led to all the delays and why we are still delayed. The Airport has only 1 Defreezer truck. It can de freeze 1-2 planes then has to go refuel, which takes 2 hrs. So, we were waiting for our turn to be defreezed. After about 20 min, the pilot gave us an update saying that the defreezer has a malfunction and the tech is coming to fix it. A little later, we got an update that said: well, I can see that there is only 1 person loading the luggage’s, so this may take a little while before we can even move the plane. In the meantime, we are still waiting on the update for the defreezer. A few minutes later, the pilot says we just found out that the mechanic is on his way and should be there in about 30 min. Damn. I’m not sure what is going on, but the airport is supposed to be prepared for planes to fly!"
25th November 2020,4,"""The cell phone parking lot is a disaster""",Not Verified |  The cell phone parking lot is a disaster. Like a bad game of Tetris. I won’t use it again until it’s redone. Alarmist saw two wrecks. It’s necessary to be able to back in to park or you’re out of luck.
30th January 2020,3,"""it has never been a good experience""","Not Verified |  Lived here over 15 years and this is our home airport traveling at least every 3-4 weeks. We’ve been using this airport for years and it has never been a good experience. Security and parking is fine, even with the construction - no problems other than if you have an early flight give yourself time to park if you need the bus. As far as food options... it’s terrible. The Berry Bistro is the only option on the Southwest terminal side to get any sort of coffee that’s to go other than Starbucks. Starbucks takes over 20 minutes because they are the only ones with reliable options. The Berry Bistro two weeks ago was closed because no staff showed up to work in the am. Today (like 3 other times) they’ve had our order wrong, over charged us and then didn’t have the items they said they did. When we asked for a refund they couldn’t because they didn’t have a manager to approve so they had to get change out of their wallets to refund us. All the other food options in the court area have cold food, even in the warmers, the staff can’t speak English. If your going to expand this airport you need to massively step it up with a manager that can oversee these places and hire people that care to be working for the day not texting on their phones at the register. This airport is WAY behind the eight ball, compared to other similar markets around the country ie., Charlotte, Orlando, West Palm, St Louis. Your expansion plan must include better staffing and food options. Not to mention the one clothing store Fly Babies has had the same clothes for 15 years in the same spot. Update?"
18th December 2019,7,"""Step it up a notch people""","Not Verified |  Construction is taking forever and is very noisy and messy, my kids tripped on some construction material in a normal walkway but I am mainly posting this review because their toilet tissue is absolutely terrible! It’s like using printer paper and it gave me a terrible rash. Thumbs down big time for a simple commodity BNA. Lastly the security personnel could be a touch more humane, they have constantly been rude and demanding to my family over the years and other innocent parties doing nothing wrong at all. Step it up a notch people. Hope you read this for all the unspoken parties out there and get to work where you are falling short. "
12th August 2019,5,"""no paper towels are offered""","✅ Trip Verified | I live in Nashville and fly somewhere around 75 times a year. BNA is currently undergoing some significant expansion and renovations that are necessary to keep up with the demand of Nashville’s incredible population growth. What continues to be overlooked are the restroom facilities. It’s the only airport I’ve traveled to or through where no paper towels are offered, which is a major invitation to spread sickness especially when coupled with the dryers that require poor hand washers to stick their hands fully in the machine and blow around all of the bacteria and germs they didn’t wash off with soap. Additionally, multiple sinks are always out of soap or the soap dispensers are not functioning properly. BNA must have the most germ and bacteria friendly airport for any city with major commercial airlines."
13th May 2019,1,"""Employees rude and obnoxious""","Not Verified |  So....most food vendors were filthy, most closed but no reason why, just rude employees waving you away. Coolers where drinks are grabbed from completely empty and again dirty. Burger King however was open but all counters and floor were dirty and greasy. Employees rude and obnxious. Don't waste your time or your money. I would rather stop somewhere pick up something that cost less and eat it cold than eat at BNA. "
26th April 2019,10,"""happy, calm, and full of personality""","Not Verified |  TSA probably doesn’t get that many good reviews but I wanted to say a huge thank you to all the TSA folks I talked with. You were happy, calm, and full of personality. You made going through security a breeze and for that I thank you for keeping the morning happy. I wish every airport had TSA like Nashville! Well done"
10th November 2018,10,"""so thankful for everything""",Not Verified |  My parents and I were about to board a flight and my dad started feeling sick. He was having a heart attack. Everyone at the airport was so nice and helpful. They got help to him so quick! A lady (I’m not real sure who she was) got our flights changed for us and got our luggage off the plane. A security guard stayed with me the whole time and helped me with everything! They were so wonderful and I’m so thankful for everything they did for us!
6th June 2018,8,"""tremendous in doing their job""","Not Verified |  My 14 year old grand daughter flew unattended by an adult to JAX and the ladies at the check-in in the secure area were tremendous in doing their job. Answered all questions and put us at ease, got her on the plane and in a great seat without having to wrestle with the masses that were waiting to board. A big thank you to Southwest also. Now, parking was another thing, a nightmare with all the construction going on but we made it just fine."
19th November 2017,7,"""the service is super slow""",✅ Trip Verified | Nashville airport is notorious at taking forever to get the bags unloaded to the carousel. We wait an additional 20 minutes just to get a bag. This happens all the time. The staff are nice but the service is super slow.
26th April 2017,5,"""not a pleasant experience""","✅ Verified Review |  We checked into the counter to the friendliest agents we've seen in a long time. The security checkpoint was understaffed and the woman checking us in was unpleasant to say the least. No smile, crabby attitude and just not happy with her job. She asked a co-worker for some help as she had already called for help three times. I was TSA prechecked, but ended up having to take my belt off and go through again. Then my bracelets and go through again. And then once more through and a final pat down. All the agents here were friendly and just doing their job, but next time I think I'll just go through the regular line and it'll probably go smoother. Not a pleasant experience.    "
26th January 2017,8,"""Nashville you're doing it right""","✅ Verified Review |  I've traveled for years - this is the first airport I have ever reviewed. Nashville staff were amazing - the TSA in most airports are the worst part of traveling! Most agents have an entitlement attitude, Nashville Airport TSA was excellent, something I've never experienced in an US airport. The staff were nice, the airport to was clean, and they had live music to ease you. Nashville you're doing it right, everyone seems to be happy - as a traveler I left as content as I arrived.  "
12th November 2014,9,Nashville Airport customer review,I have been flying from Nashville Int'l since 2009. The airport is clean the staff are friendly and helpful. Security staff are polite and efficient waiting areas are good and food/drink facilities are all right. All in all I have no complaints.
22nd October 2012,10,Nashville Airport customer review,Arrived from CLT on US Air left on Delta to ATL. No problems very short queuing at check in and security. Car hire facility could not be closer it is a muti-story garage across from exit doors.
21st March 2009,4,Nashville Airport customer review,This airport has made huge improvements over the past few years with shops and dining. My trips have always been trouble free with a short line in security. But unless your flying with Southwest you are probably going to have to change planes.
19th November 2007,4,Nashville Airport customer review,One of the most convenient airports if you're renting a car. Car return is immediately adjacent to the terminal. You'll be at the ticket counter within 5 minutes walk after dropping off your rental car. Security line a bit long on most recent trip but it was the Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving. Airside is excellent - no long taxi or ground waits due to traffic (unless its a hold due to the destination) at BNA. Just wish there were more nonstop flights to west coast.
15th September 2006,n/a,Nashville Airport customer review,A midsized US airport that unfortunately doesn't have much to offer. Pleasant staff aside restaurants/food options and the essential shopping distractions are rather inadequate.
30th June 2006,n/a,Nashville Airport customer review,Nashville is my home airport and while I must stifle a slight laugh about us being an 'international' airport I must say that my only 'bad' experience has been the slightly undermanned security line (or two). But in all my times flying out of Nashville I've only encountered bad security queues maybe twice. I find the parking to be easy - go Economy instead of long term (cheaper closer) and all the check in staff to be friendly. I've been flying international of late (BNA-ORD-LHR) and encounter almost no hassles. My only wish is for some sort of duty free shop and a currency exchange place with longer hours. If your flight leaves past 4 pm good luck getting any foreign currency.
8th August 2021,1,"""The Rudest Airport in the USA""","✅ Trip Verified | The winner for The Rudest Airport in the USA goes to New Orleans! From the security check point to the drink preparer at Starbucks - they all share a bad attitude. Must be in the employee handbook - be rude to all, no need to show grace or patience, just be rude!"
27th June 2021,1,"""no urgency at all or care for the customers and flight times""","Not Verified |  This was by far the worst experience I have ever had in all my years of traveling. My boyfriend and I came to New Orleans for our anniversary. We enjoyed our trip until we arrived at the New Orleans airport to depart. We arrived 1 hour and 45 mins before our flight was scheduled to leave. We checked in out bags in 15 mins and headed to the TSA check in area. We waited 1 hour and 20 mins in line just to get through airport security. We finally made it to the lady to get our id and boarding pass checked 20 mins before the plane was scheduled to leave (5 mins before boarding was over). The worst part was we still had to place our items on the scanner and be scanned through as well. By the time we finished it was 12 mins before the plane was scheduled to leave (3 mins after boarding was over). We ran and made it at 5.50 am for our 6.00 am flight. The gate was closed. Although the plane was there they were not allowing anyone else to board the plane. We missed our flight. And could not get another flight for the rest of the day. This airport is low staff, low resources, no urgency at all or care for the customers and flight times. It’s unorganized and ruined the entire experience of New Orleans. We were not accommodated nor were arrangements made for us. This is very poor customer service and we will not be returning again."
3rd June 2021,4,"""Why is there no recycling available""","Not Verified |  Why is there no recycling available in the New Orleans airport? In a city that consumes more than most, we must step it up and provide throughout the airport! We need to act like an environmental friendly, progressive city to move forward! We need a glass recycling company above all in Nola! Please act responsible and get it done!"
27th April 2020,1,"""I miss the old terminal so much""","✅ Trip Verified | New terminal is the worst case of the ""emperor has no clothes"" ever. Uncomfortable. Poor design. Passengers huddle behind the few available walls to shield themselves from the blinding sunlight flowing in unfiltered through voluminous windows. There is no place to hide. Inadequate seating. I miss the old terminal so much. What a waste of money! And the news media seems to be complicit in this boondoggle. This is not a Mercedes with four flat tyres, this is a Pinto with no tires that has been stripped for parts no one wants."
4th March 2020,4,"""did you recycle the toilet seats""","Not Verified | I travel a lot and all over the world. I was happy that New Orleans upgraded to a newer facility. However, did you recycle the toilet seats from the old airport? The disgusting plastic that you have to click the green button? Well, the one in my stall was jammed! I have to say that I am embarrassed that an airport as new as this one is not as clean as most airports I fly in & out of. I'm proud of my city and wish that it would take care of itself."
23rd February 2020,3,"""they failed to transfer our luggage""","Not Verified |  New Orleans airport (MSY) seems completely average compared to other airports, except for one thing: they failed to transfer our luggage as we changed flights to Kansas City. This was a huge problem since I had checked on a laptop and a lot of our children's clothing from a lengthy stay in Florida. They had to send my luggage through a different flight and I wasted a lot of time returning to pick up the luggage at a later date."
22nd February 2020,2,"""this airport's cleanliness is below standards""","Not Verified |  Please have your cleaning staff clean on a more regular basis. The bathroom toilet fixture was broken, dusty and the trash bin was full with a dirty bandaid on top. The floors were dirty. It was very apparent they had not really cleaned the floors. For a new airport, I was disappointed on the conditions of the airport cleanliness. The white columns are dirty around the floor base as well and the hook on the door to the bathroom was broken. As someone who was excited about the new airport, lack of care was disappointing. In comparison to ATL, DFW, JAX, DEN, PDX, FLL, TOA, MCO, this airport's cleanliness is below standards."
20th February 2020,3,"""the TSA set up was a giant fail""","Not Verified |  Poor design in passenger drop off and pick up areas. Absolutely a mess and people were so frustrated that no one could move that it became dangerous. The ticketing area was fine but the TSA set up was a giant fail as well. The agents could check people faster than the lines could clear through the scanners so the agents sat idle much of the time and the entire line just was in a dead lock. Once inside I noticed there were only a few restrooms (2 per terminal), all with very long lines (on a Tuesday mid-morning). Gate seating areas were ridiculously undersized for number of passengers on a plane. There was seating for about 50 with the gates directly next to us both filled with their own passengers so people just sat on the floor in the walkways. Not safe! If they intended for overflow to go into next gate they have to plan for that in staggering schedules. Overall I really don't understand why they built this. It is undersized for current needs with no room for growth in the industry. The trend is more people traveling and they seem to be expecting the opposite. Pretty much frustrated with poor scaling the entire morning. We are told to get there with much time to spare (by TSA) but there is no where to go. I will avoid this airport whenever possible. Yes it was pretty."
24th January 2020,1,"""it is filthy""","Not Verified |  The new airport in New Orleans is a beautiful structure - the architect Cesar Pelli did a wonderful job. Everything else was designed by hacks and engineers no doubt selected for their political patronage - because they obviously have no design talent. The garages and drives and signage are not any better than third world airports. Think Orlando, Chicago and Miami airport landscaping and signage - all beautifully designed and maintained- not New Orleans - no design talent anywhere outside of the terminal - a waste of a billion dollars! The biggest problem with this 10 week old terminal is that it is filthy - I have been through the airport 4 times since it opened in November and I can attest that the floors have not ben cleaned once since opening. The same stains and dirt piles are on the floors. They have been swept clean by the lazy airport staff, but never washed clean. What a shame after the efforts put into the design and great layout. Atlanta and Detroit airports are all run by similar politically connected vendors- but they are spotlessly clean and beautiful. The New Orleans folks just don’t care about being clean - what a shame. Maybe the mayor is a slob and doesn’t know what clean is - because if she ever traveled anywhere else - she would understand that you need to clean floors every door when millions walk in them. Slobs - all slobs. Wake up New Orleans and clean this building!"
16th January 2020,1,"""new airport is a real mess""","✅ Trip Verified | This new airport is a real mess. Baggage takes 45 minutes to come out, then on wrong belt. No signs in airport to direct you to where food might be if you don't want an expensive sit down restaurant. People in and out of airport are rude. Taxi cab people were screaming at tourists yesterday, 1/14/20. Lines are long for taxi. Uber and Lyft had at least 100 people in it. Only one lane for taxi and arrivals to depart. When my ride picked us up it took 24 minutes to get out of airport area and headed to interstate. The one lone security officer directing the gridlock blew his whistle constantly at people trying to pick up their passengers. There were several people arguing in rideshare line because of long lines and no line organization. I flew on southwest 561 from LGA."
11th January 2020,1,"""Doubt if I'll ever come to New Orleans again""","Not Verified |  This is the worst airport design and customer service I have ever experienced. Take the rental car signs off the airport parking direction signs! I drove around the airport parking lot 3 times following the rental car signs before I finally saw an employee sitting off in the cut and asked how to get to the rental car lot. She got annoyed when I didn’t understand her lackluster directions (take a right at the light and then another right?) and said “I don’t know” and turned away from me. Finally found a >10in. sign with no lighting by it that said rental car return. Horrible. Doubt if I'll ever come to New Orleans again and if I have to, I’ll drive."

This place needs to be reviewed by some federal aviation commission."
21st December 2019,2,"""new airport is a nightmare""","Not Verified |  The new airport in New Orleans is a nightmare! The traffic in and out of the airport is horrible. During rush hour add an extra hour or two to your trip. There is only one way in and one way out and it’s bumper to bumper. Also, long lines to go through security. No seats at baggage claim. Loud live music playing in the background while passengers are calling family members to tell them they have arrived. The old airport was a dream, new airport is a nightmare!"
20th December 2019,1,"""Worst engineering design for a modern airport""","Not Verified |  Who builds a new, modern airport and fails to include computer stations and general sitting areas to eat? New Orleans is who. Worst engineering design for a modern airport. Very poor food selection in concourses. Most food places are kiosks where you must take your food with you. But wait, they don't have any table seating for a person to eat their food."
20th December 2019,1,"""Rudest people I have ever seen""","Not Verified |  Worst airport security screening. People on duty behave like they are there to pass the time and do not care how they are impacting people queued up. When I arrived in the queue, there were about 7 people ahead of me. It took me 45-60 minutes to get through that. Rudest people I have ever seen. I talked to few people to understand if this is one odd day or it is like this everytime. I was told that it is worst at night because there is no supervisor at night time."
3rd December 2019,1,"""a waste of $1.3 billion""","Not Verified | What a waste of $1.3 billion. This new airport is literally the worst I've been in a long time, and I travel all the time throughout the year! The signs are a complete joke, and they're incorrectly placed/marked from the time you begin pulling into the driveway! Literally terminal and parking signs, departure and arrival signs, and even the arrows on the signs for the exits are incorrectly marked and/or posted directionally! The old MSY was laid out much more efficiently and effectively than the new one! We were disappointed the time we arrived and then again 5 days later when we departed as well! We should've known with this state and city what to expect, and it was no surprise the lack of concern the staff showed either! Thank God for the kiosks at the ticket counters because hopefully these will replace some of the atrocious, rude, lazy staff that you currently have in place! That'll be a huge improvement for you guys, so I can't wait for this continued transition! We also waited 40 minutes from the time we deplaned for our luggage! I've had bags miss flights I was on make it on the plane behind us arrive more quickly than this! Terrible customer service! Your employees legitimately don't seem to care. Overall, I'd honestly give this airport experience a D-. We will be flying from BTR going forward! At least they're courteous and seem to care more than MSY! Plus, the signs are correct and the airport is obviously easier to navigate than whatever you guys call that setup/system at MSY!"

21st November 2019,3,"""such a mediocre standard""","Not Verified | Somewhat astonishing that a brand new airport would be build to such a mediocre standard. Signage, security, and staff were unhelpful and didn’t seem to want to be at work. The security design is particularly poor. It is not like you need to invent this.

14th November 2019,2,"""Security are rude and uncaring""","Not Verified |  This is the new airport and it is woeful. Security are rude and uncaring if items are separated from passengers. Laptop spills onto rollers because they push the buckets through with total disregard for value. Worst security experience ever for me. I think they needed more space, tables. This is new? What will holiday travel be like? The food stalls are not well stocked. Not enough staff to help customers. Lines are too long for the low volume of travelers. Signage is not well considered."
8th November 2019,5,"""a brand new airport was built so small""","✅ Trip Verified |   Finally the new airport opens, nearly a year late. It is unfortunate a brand new airport was built so small. Holdrooms are no where near big enough and the bag system was undersized from the beginning. Is it too late to tear it down and start over?"

Given the importance of New Orleans we were shocked by how poor the whole airport experience was: Extremely poor signage, Dirty floors, the carpeted areas were particularly filthy. Toilets were disgraceful, loose fixings, unpleasant smells, inadequate drying facilities. Food outlets were shameful, unreasonably expensive, restricted choices, staff had a totally 'couldn't care less' attitude. The whole airport had an atmosphere of neglect, scruffiness and disregard of travellers. Having greatly enjoyed the experience of the city it was a crying shame for that experience to be soured by this abysmal apology for an international airport."
26th October 2019,2,"""most outdated airport""","✅ Trip Verified | By far the dirtiest, most outdated airport I have ever been too. I have travelled a great deal and never have I encountered such disgusting toilet facilities. No locks on the doors, taps not working, no paper towel. The staff at the airport are more interested in talking about their social life very loudly than serving Customers. The whole experience has left me never wanting to go back to New Orleans again, which is very unfortunate because we had such a great time and the staff at our hotel were amazing."
15th October 2019,1,"""48 minutes to get luggage""","Not Verified |  Not much to look forward to at this airport but I still have to use it when the family and/or friends decide to air travel. Departure, waiting in line, is the usual waste of life. The thing that turns me sideways is the baggage handling on arrivals, it is almost as if they do it on purpose, seems the handlers get together and discuss just how they can annoy the passengers. I traveled with three other couples on a trip here and there. This trip back from the national parks in Utah was the worst yet when it came to getting our baggage. Walked off the plane at 9.52 pm and 48 minutes later the planes luggage started in on the wrong belt, it came in on a different one that was labeled for the flight. 48 minutes to get luggage from the plane to the belt. The flight took 160 minutes to move one thousand five hundred and ten miles, it took the baggage handlers 48 minutes to move luggage just hundreds of feet. I do not understand what can be the problem, other than incompetence and lack of concern by the airport/airlines. Oh! If you do not pay attention to what the bottom of you luggage looks like, I would recommend that you learn what it looks like from the bottom, because each and every time your luggage comes down the moving belt it will be upside down. Do you take time to consider how you pack your bag, you know, the stuff you don't mind getting mashed you put on the bottom, well your bag will travel upside down anyway so it doesn't matter how you pack it. The baggage handlers suck at what they do. I hold the airport and the airline responsible. Southwest needs to straighten up. In this review, I have given the individual review categories all one star, having to wait on your luggage for way to long of a period takes away from the experience as a whole."
12th October 2019,3,"""unpleasant personnel for the most part""","✅ Trip Verified | Let's just cut to the chase: New Orleans as a metropolis is, if nothing else, consistent. Consistently poorly operated, poorly signed, filthy, mismanaged, disorganized, and unkempt. These values are reflected quite adequately in the airport. Add to that long lines even for TSA Pre-Check (TSA seem to want to take their precious times), unpleasant personnel for the most part, and the feeling the airport hasn't been renovated or even cleaned since circa 1986, and, well, I think you can envision this airport if you've never been there. Get it together, New Orleans and Louisiana by first ""un-corrupting"" your governments. On the bright side, with the exception of St. Tammany Parish way off in the North Shore, the airport is probably the safest part of the metropolis."
8th October 2019,3,"""Really disappointed with this airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Really disappointed with this airport (concourse C). Considering it’s such a destination location you would have thought they would have put more work into the comfort and care of passengers. The seats are uncomfortable, the food court has patio furniture, no water stations for water bottles (the water fountain tastes horrible), bathrooms were dirty, and everything just felt old and dirty."
18th June 2019,6,New Orleans Airport customer review,"✅ Trip Verified | I was TSA pre check with wheelchair assistance. I have metal in my body which I told the TSA, once I was cleared they went through the full body detector, the airport's wheelchair went thru and beeped. Instead of checking the wheelchair, which they claimed they did but I didn't see it, I was patted down. Really! I asked if this is the way they treat pre check, she looked surprised and said, you're pre check? Then she said the wheelchair beeped which belongs to the Airport, I have to pat you down. Help me to understand this concept."
2nd June 2019,1,"""Unbelievably terrible experience""","Not Verified |  Unbelievably terrible experience. Completely disorganized, TSA was unnecessarily rude and everything in total disarray. The building is grotesquely outdated and nothing runs properly. Missed my flight because of the total incompetence of the airport, and specific airline (American Airlines) utter failure to warn customers of the condition, i.e. slow security check, despite acknowledging they were familiar with the situation. Arrived over an hour and a half early for a flight I missed due to the total incompetence of the airport and airline staff. New Orleans needs to get it together."
15th May 2019,3,"""Everything is dated""","Not Verified | The worse airport ever! The staff at the restaurants are rude and disrespectful, and they seem unorganized. Not only is there not a sufficient number of restrooms, but the restrooms that are available are nasty and dirty and smell like urine. Everything is dated and the airport smells lie mildew. This airport is in dire need of renovations."
28th April 2019,1,"""TSA are absolutely rude!""","Not Verified |  TSA are absolutely rude! Checking in at 9:30am I opted out of going through the body scanner and they left me standing without my luggage or my travel documents for 20 mins! When I asked one of the TSA agents how much longer the wait would be when I observed them putting someone ahead of me, she told me “not on your time”. With her multi coloured hair and unprofessional attitude. I don’t know how some of these unprofessional people were hired at an airport to be amongst mass population. I asked for the supervisor and can you believe as I’m leaving the same girl called me stupid! This kind doesn’t deserve to be employed and definitely not as a lead TSA agent."
12th January 2019,1,"""in complete shock at our experience""",Not Verified |  I never take the time to write a review but our experience in MSY was the worst I have ever encountered. We are seasonal travelers and fly in and out if many airports frequently each year. The TSA agent was a large lady that yelled at the people in the line then came up behind me and my husband and small children and screamed directly in my ear to move faster. My kids were terrified and were moving so fast as it was that they were frantically picking up their suitcase to put on the belt for screening. My youngest went through in tears she was so terrified. When I told the agent that we were moving quickly to be patient with us she threatened to hold me in a cell and not let me Board an airplane for talking back to her. I was in complete shock at our experience. I have never been treated so poorly in all our hundreds of travels across the world. We will never fly through this airport again. Our experience was the worst! And continued on to the other agents working there. Customer service must not be taught here.
8th November 2018,1,"""A chaotic experience""","Not Verified |  A chaotic experience from check in to boarding. Check in desks poorly signed manned by rude and unhelpful staff. As a regular world traveller the check in process was the slowest I have ever experienced. Security was further struggle. No attention paid to orderly lines, and manned by by shouting bullying staff. The experience deteriorated further airside. Limited outlets for food and drink, with long lines to purchase. Tannoy announcements were barely audible. All in all, a very poor experience, and definitely an airport to avoid."
12th July 2018,1,"""old, run down and disorganized""","Not Verified |  The airport is old, run down and disorganized. For lack of better terms, MSY airport is a disgrace. Parking is a nightmare, the airline staff we have personally dealt with have not been friendly or very helpful and TSA is incredibly rude at this particular airport. I would advise eating anywhere else as the food choices are both minimal and not well made. I am very much looking forward to the renovations being done for this airport as it desperately needs it!"
11th April 2018,3,"""leaves such a bad impression""","✅ Trip Verified |  This airport leaves such a bad impression of New Orleans. The staff at the restaurants are slow or rude. My friend waited forever at subway. I saw a bunch of people waiting in line at a cheesecake place, and the worker was sitting down at a table on her phone (it’s 7:00 am, and opening wasn’t long ago). The bathrooms in the D concourse smell like cigarette smoke. The carpets are filthy. For security, each concourse is separate. So you have to go through twice to go to B and wait, and then to D. It’s really inconvenient, even with pre-check. I’ve never felt disgusted at an airport in the United States ... until now. I hope they finish the new terminal soon, so people aren’t left (or greeted) with the absolute worst impression of this great city."
13th February 2017,2,"""slowest airport for luggage""","✅ Verified Review |  New Orleans Airport is the slowest airport for luggage carousel. Takes forever. Please do something about this. I am from here and travel at least once/month. Slowest for luggage to come out. In the time I'm waiting for my luggage, I've written this review. "
22nd December 2016,1,"""travelers were a burden on their day""","This was the worst airport I've experienced. I have never seen security treat people so terribly. They sincerely acted as if the travelers were a burden on their day. One awful person was literally screaming at people because she didn't want to say ""next"". She wanted us to count out five at a time to pass through and if passengers took too long she started screaming at them and threatening no ride. I would seriously avoid this airport if you can."
26th June 2015,2,New Orleans Airport customer review,"Torn seats, tables that look like they have not been wiped for weeks. Carpet stained and water damaged. Check your flight before heading here, you do not want to be stuck here for a long period of time."
17th March 2015,3,New Orleans Airport customer review,The airport terminal and facilities are absolutely disgusting. I didn't want to sit in any of the seats because of the filth and grime. The gate area smelled and the bathrooms were hideous and unclean. I didn't see a single facilities attendant the entire 2.5 hours waiting for my plane. The trash by the restaurants was over filled and garbage stacked all around it.
22nd March 2013,5,New Orleans Airport customer review,The airport is now cleaner brighter and more pleasant to navigate than in the past. However food offerings post-security are somewhat limited particularly since there is no airside access between concourses. The security areas are not large enough to process peak-time crowds leading to potentially lengthy waits. Finally there is a curious shortage of seating in certain gate areas (such as the US Airways gates) leading lots of people to sit or lie on the floor. The new consolidated rental car centre has been completed which is within walking distance from the terminal and very convenient compared with off-airport facilities.
23rd December 2012,5,New Orleans Airport customer review,This place is in need of a steam cleaning. Beyond that the food choices past security are pretty limited. Actually they're limited before security as well. For a city that depends so much on tourists they need to the gateway for visitors in better shape than it is.
24th June 2012,4,New Orleans Airport customer review,Check in was pretty painless and quick however the only options for food and drink in the United gate area were vendors and one cafe with pre packaged food and hot dogs/sausage on a roller grill like you get at the gas station. We opted to go early to the airport and get lunch/drinks - wrong choice. Make sure you ready before you get here!
1st April 2012,7,New Orleans Airport customer review,The D concourse expansion is now complete so there is now a new coffee shop and another sundry shop available. An additional security lane for D looks like it is almost ready as well. In the next year the D and C concourses will be connected past security so that will improve the food and shopping options and allow everyone to access the sky club in the D concourse. Baggage claim is still a dungeon due to the low ceilings and separate areas. A new on-site rental car hub is under construction which will be a huge improvement over the current take-a-shuttle-to-someplace-in-the-neighbourhood approach.
1st May 2011,4,New Orleans Airport customer review,Departed from the D gates the queue for security looked very long but was processed speedily. The facilities were very limited but we ate at Jester's restaurant which was surprisingly good.
27th March 2011,3,New Orleans Airport customer review,Check-in adequate but the terminals especially Delta's are void of options for eating or shopping. Thankfully there was a Sky Club in that wing. Seemed old and a bit dark.
2nd June 2010,4,New Orleans Airport customer review,The airport terminals were renovated post-Katrina and the design is much improved with wider corridors better lighting and more open spaces. Security queues moved quickly during a busy holiday weekend. Food beverage and concession options are bare minimum limited to overpriced snack and sandwich shops and nothing reflecting New Orleans' rich culinary traditions. Road access to/from the terminal was also much improved post-Katrina. The rental car facility was moved off-airport but is only a 2-minute shuttle ride away.
7th June 2009,4,New Orleans Airport customer review,Went through MSY twice last weekend. Arriving is a breeze. Ground transportation was easy to find. We had a long wait before departure. Check-in by kiosk was easy and there is a decent selection of shops and food landside. Security was fast with a two minute wait at maximum. The amenities on the D Concourse (Delta) were very limited. Food kiosks (expensive selections). But there are enough power outlets to make do with a laptop and some of the gates not in use had nice panoramic views of the active runways.
8th October 2008,3,New Orleans Airport customer review,Old drab and somewhat run-down. Long walk from concourses thru baggage claim to rental car counters then another lengthy walk outside across pickup area to catch a bus to get to the rental car lots. The one plus-short security lines & pleasant TSA staff.
7th February 2008,2,New Orleans Airport customer review,I had a 0645 departure for Chicago which was one of many at that time. There was only one restaurant open and it was serving only hot food--not a great option for carry-on-board. If concessions are granted to suppliers they need to be open and functioning when the passengers are there - especially those that deal in food and other on-board needs. Poor marks for this.
25th August 2003,n/a,New Orleans Airport customer review,Small airport rarely crowded. Good selection of restaurants. Baggage claim and passenger pick up area outside baggage is poorly lit at night and dirty. Taxis that pickup at the airport are usually dirty. Can carry and drink alcoholic beverages anywhere in the airport.
18th February 2022,5,"""ill equipped to handle the volume of passengers""","Not Verified |  Busiest I have ever seen the airport. TSA, with a huge line of people, closed 3 lanes creating a major backlog and then no agent directing people about the policy of the day - laptops in or out, etc. Only one scan machine so even once your bags went through security you were stuck behind 15 people waiting on the scanner. Walking through Concourse D they removed all water fountains and replaced with vending machines. One water fountain in the entire concourse. Couldn’t find anyone who works there to help find a water fountain. Busy weekday late afternoon/early evening and more than half of the vendors are closed so everyone goes to the same few, causing service lines out onto the concourse and subsequent traffic jams. Essentially they were ill equipped to handle the volume of passengers."
2nd November 2020,10,"""cannot say enough positive things about the staff""","✅ Trip Verified | I cannot say enough positive things about the staff at the Delta part of this airport. I had badly hurt my knee at Logan and I was to have a wheelchair to take me up the ramp to the luggage return. When I got to the walkway there was no wheelchair. The flight attendant called to the desk who apologized and said they would get one to me asap. Within a minute, literally, the manager on duty was there beside me. He was absolutely wonderful! He was on the walkie talkie, tried to help me get up the ramp some and we both gave up. The flight attendants and even the pilot were attempting to help me get to the terminal. Finally biting the bullet, the manager got me up there just in time for another young man to arrive with the wheelchair. He was sweet, friendly and so very helpful. We had an Uber coming and he got our luggage and took us to wait for the Uber. These men and women are to be commended for their kindness and dedication to the passengers! Kudos to all!"
14th December 2016,9,"""great airport to spend a couple of hours""","Milwaukee is a great airport to spend a couple of hours in. Decent food selection, a great in-terminal aviation museum and the most incredible airport (used) bookstore I've experienced. Wish I had brought another carry-on bag as I could have filled the thing with all the great books at reasonable prices I wanted to buy."
5th October 2015,10,"""clean, friendly well-run airport""","BOS-MKE. I have flown to and from Mitchell countless times. I grew up in Milwaukee and moved back here in June. I agree with other reviewers that it is a clean, friendly well-run airport. What stuck in my mind was how swiftly and well the baggage is handled. I flew Southwest and sat fairly far forward in the cabin, walked directly to the baggage claim area, and by the time I arrived, my baggage was already on the carousel. This is something of a record in all of the flights I have experienced over the past few years (at the other end is Copenhagen Kastrup in July, where I waited close to 45 minutes for the baggage to arrive, with my own valise arriving some 10 minutes later). There is also a rapid bus to downtown, with the stop now just outside the baggage claim area, now that renovations of that area are completed. There are also a couple of good Bartolotta restaurants on the concourses (Piccolo Pizzeria and Nonna Bartolotta's), which I have enjoyed on previous departures. All in all, Mitchell is an excellent airport. Now, all they need is more non-stop flights."
26th July 2015,9,Milwaukee Airport customer review,"Big enough to serve all of your needs yet small enough and easy enough to get in and out of. What a contrast when compared to Kansas City and Atlanta where my journey originated. They have a children's play area, great local restaurants, beers, coffee etc.  It is about the same airfare to fly into Milwaukee often times as it is to fly into Chicago with a lot less hassle. "
5th February 2014,10,Milwaukee Airport customer review,Loved flying into Milwaukee. We flew in from DC with AirTran to attend our daughters naval bootcamp graduation and what an excellent airport. It was a short 40 minute drive to North Chicago. We even loved the enterprise rental car pick-up/drop-off. I highly recommend this airport.
27th November 2013,9,Milwaukee Airport customer review,General Mitchell is a breath of a fresh air. It's clean friendly and efficient. There's actually a classy little used book store and a museum full of model planes and blimps and whatnot. If you get lost it is your fault my friend. The whole place is like one of the models in the museum - accurate well labeled and miniature. Everything is right in front of you. There's an Amtrak station a block away - 90 minutes and $24 to get to Union Station in Chicago is hard to beat. This airport is tiny but it's the easiest one I've ever dealt with.
13th February 2012,10,Milwaukee Airport customer review,This is possibly one of the nicest airports I've flown through. Staff were amiable the terminals were clean and well-maintained and everything was well-marked. Security was a breeze and the baggage claim system is both swift and efficient compared to other airports.
29th December 2011,10,Milwaukee Airport customer review,One of my favorite airports to make a connection through. I've flown through MKE maybe 30 times or so and never have had to wait in a line to go through security. There is also a very nice bookstore decent food options nice play areas for kids and an aviation museum. The airport is also fairly stress free for making connections.
7th January 2011,5,Milwaukee Airport customer review,I had a 3-hour connection here I thought I'd be bored to death-- but a great used bookstore and air museum within the terminal. There was someone playing Christmas music on a piano good ambiance. All three of these are very unique and made the stay pleasant. Certainly a hell of a lot better than connecting through say O'Hare! Concourses have a higher-than-average amount of waiting space and I found them quieter than the normal airport.
30th October 2010,4,Milwaukee Airport customer review,Milwaukee is a great airport - unfortunately I won't be flying through it anymore since Republic/Frontier purchased Midwest and I refuse to fly with Republic/Frontier. That said MKE is compact but all the corridors and seating areas are spacious. A good choice of restaurants and shops; the used bookstore is great! Enjoy a Usinger's sausage if you're hungry. I don't like the ubiquitous loud TVs that you can't escape from. No peace!
19th February 2010,5,Milwaukee Airport customer review,I’ve flown through a few times and found it works very well. Baggage has always arrived very quickly and rental cars are close to the terminal. On one occasion I was able to get off the plane get my baggage rent a car and get checked in at an airport hotel all within thirty minutes. Outbound Milwaukee is similarly straightforward - I experienced minimal line-ups to check in and only a few minutes wait for security. The departure areas are nothing special but there's plenty of comfortable seating while you wait and reasonable concessions to purchase food drinks or reading material. MKE gains some points in my book by also including a small museum that deals with the history of the airport and aviation in Milwaukee a nice touch that other airports should consider. MKE is further proof that it's far less stressful and time consuming to fly in and out of medium sized airports than mega airports.
29th July 2006,n/a,Milwaukee Airport customer review,Very modern. The Midwest concourse was going under renovations when I was there. The walk from the check-in desk to the gate was a little long. Lots of stores though.
16th March 2022,2,"""I travel frequently and have never been so disrespected""","Not Verified |  I’m the first to admit that TSA is not a desirable position but I’m also a strong believer in being kind and I’m not sure these TSA agents are capable of being kind. There’s no instructions for what to do when you get up to security, yet they got extremely angry when people weren’t able to read their minds regarding their expectations. I travel frequently and have never been so disrespected as I was by these TSA agents. Otherwise, terminal 2 is clean and the bathrooms are nice."
16th December 2021,5,"""decent, clean, modern airport""","Not Verified | This airport has two Terminals. Be very aware which terminal you need to be in: 1 or 2. Find out what terminal you are landing in and renting your car and what terminal you will be leaving from - ask for the address of where to drop your car off. Otherwise, your GPS may lead you unknowingly to the wrong terminal. Trying to figure out the public subway system to move between terminals was not easy or fast. The signs are somewhat confusing and, as a result of COVID, some of the Information Desks are closed. I found an open Information Desk, but the staff member was so mean I chose to figure out things on my own rather than be belittled by him for getting lost. I found a very friendly staff member in the hallway and he was able to clearly explain how to get to my destination. Otherwise this is a decent, clean, modern airport with an ok selection of shops and restaurants. It is what I expect for a city or cities this size."
18th October 2021,2,"""Not a single restaurant or store open""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at the airport at 8.30pm on a Sunday. Not a single restaurant or store open. No food, no drink, no amenities. Vending machines filled with just candy. Bad form."
17th September 2021,6,"""Nice airport to transit through""","✅ Trip Verified | Nice airport to transit through. There was a woman playing piano in between the E and C concourses. There were many volunteers around to give directions and advice. There were also lots of places to sit, eat, and charge your device as well. The seats would get high marks from the people at 'Sleeping In Airports'. My only complaint is getting around the concourses is by foot only. There is tram but it is outside security."
29th August 2021,3,"""Needless to say no one impressed!""",Not Verified |  Airline (Sun Country) did a excellent job of getting us in before bad weather hit. Unfortunately the ramp manager decided that the workers shouldn't have to unload the plane in the rain. We arrived at 12.00am (midnight) and very light rain starting. Had to wait for over a hour for our baggage. Remember this is now after 1.00 am. and there were multiple small children on the flight. Needless to say no one impressed!
10th August 2021,1,"""All but 1 food service option was closed at 6pm""",Not Verified |  All but 1 food service option was closed at 6pm and that location had closed about half their tables - leaving a lot of people unable to find food. Major city airports don’t close at 6pm on a Monday. All but one store closed and they were mostly bare shelves. Staff at airport very unhelpful on offering options. Will schedule around this airport for all future travel - clearly don’t want to service the travelers.
13th October 2020,4,"""automatic machines are a mess""","✅ Trip Verified | Those automatic machines are a mess: - long wait before the security porch - long wait after, gets your stuff completely disorganized. Watch the standard manual line for much faster. No cleaning of the bins, not safe! Stop wasting money and our time for non sense machine please!"
29th September 2020,1,"""Absolutely the worst""","✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely the worst. Got lost in construction, then lost in the building, as there were no people working on that floor. Got to check-in late and American Airlines check in staff were so incredibly slow, the entire line was freaking out! Had to take a later flight, this was not ok. Worst airport."
6th June 2020,10,"""It's how airports should be!""","Not Verified |  Great airport. It's clean and fast to transit through. The CBP staff were great as were the TSA staff. There are loads of shops, food outlets and seating. It's how airports should be!"
11th March 2020,1,"""rude and dismissive""","✅ Trip Verified | The airport itself was fine. Clean and easy to get where I needed to go. My problem was with the security agents. Every one of the four TSA agents I encountered were rude and dismissive. I also heard an older women state - “there is no need to be that rude!” So I was not the exception. I had no issues or anything with my screening. There was absolutely no reason for their attitude. And, it makes no sense to ask if I recommend this airport - it’s all about location, not quality."
7th March 2020,1,"""nearly all vegan options were gone""","Not Verified |  I have been flying out of the Minneapolis airport for years. I tell people often it is a great airport to be vegan. Well, that was until today. I traveled up and down the whole G concourse only to find that nearly all vegan options that I have come to appreciate were gone. In addition, I could not even buy a bag of nuts, unless they were covered in chocolate/candy."
6th March 2020,6,"""Not a traveler friendly airport""","✅ Trip Verified | This is a very large airport and it is very congested. When I first arrived and disembarked the aircraft, people were all standing around for the next flight. I had to squeeze my way through. It was a very long walk from the gate to baggage claim and getting to the Uber pickup from baggage claim was just as confusing. Not a traveler friendly airport."
24th February 2020,5,"""would avoid making a connection at this airport""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport sprawls. It could be a long distance to traverse between your arrival and departure gates. There is a tram connecting parts of the half dozen concourses but you need to be at the correct place to board it. In any case, be prepared to give quite a bit of time to make to your connecting gate. The food outlets are not evenly spaced out which also means quite a bit of going to and fro in search of a bite. However, directional signs are very clear. I would avoid making a connection at this airport which is a Delta hub."
5th February 2020,1,"""employees were rude, condescending, dismissive""","Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible customer service. My daughter left her purse on a handicap golf cart, and the driver (who we later ran into) turned it in immediately to lost and found. When we came back 4 days later (after writing a report and calling - and being dismissed at every turn) we were told it wasn't there. Now we are being asked to pay to send it to us, when it was there from Friday on (we checked Monday and were rudely treated/turned away). Our entire experience, aside from three people total - in both coming and going - employees were rude, condescending, dismissive. I have never had such a terrible experience with any travel/airport entity. Will truly avoid at all costs from here on out."
4th January 2020,4,"""it is totally inadequate""","Not Verified |  If concourse G is strictly for international departure, it is totally inadequate. Departing for Incheon and not enough space to seat waiting passengers or queue lines."
20th December 2019,2,"""lack of consideration for travellers""",Not Verified |  G gate area nice seating but music from the bars is so loud its deafening. After a long day of travel I need something quieter. Poor design and lack of consideration for travellers.
9th December 2019,3,"""lines at this airport are the worst I’ve experienced""",Not Verified |  This is my second time here in 3 months and I have to say the security lines at this airport are the worst I’ve experienced in years. How can you only have two lines and then only one person checking people on a Sunday?
9th November 2019,2,"""one of the worst airports""","Not Verified |  This is one of the worst airports I have ever been to. There is not enough seating at the gates, a limited number of outlets to charge devices. Security Line is an absolute nightmare, it is like they let a 2-year-old organize it. Baggage Claim is a joke. Never trust that your luggage is on the belt they say it is."
9th November 2019,1,"""No management of lines""","✅ Trip Verified | Shambles. Big queues at bag drops, even bigger at security landside to airside. No management of lines so those whose flights are due to leave can move to the front. If I had a choice I’d avoid. Take a look at some of the big European hubs if you want to understand how to work check in and security."
3rd August 2019,4,"""Extremely chaotic TSA screening""","✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely chaotic TSA screening. An agent rushing through the queue ran over my ankle with a wheel chair. After passing through scanner. My Carry on was flagged, along with several others - suddenly there was a back log of 4 passengers waiting for an agent to go through our carry on bags and no agents  around. Passengers were scrambling, looking for lost items. It felt like a surreal B movie. Next time I fly, I will choose a different time of day. Ps, my blueberry jam in a sealed jar was confiscated and thrown away. Wasteful, shameful, and worse, the TSA canine unit was making us walk like a military rank. I am speechless at the hypocrisy of this country.."
29th July 2019,1,"""disappointing traveling experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  I was returning from vacation with my husband and 2 kids from Cancún. When we arrived at 7:21pm at the airport and registered at the kiosk Delta agent told us to go to the left line where the line was very long and foreigners with non-us passport were standing. We were last in the line and the line was not moving. I saw everyone else from our plane were on the other line and were already checked out and got their luggage and we were still standing at the end of the line with about 40 people in front of us. When I asked one of the Delta agents and told her there must be some kind of a mistake cause we’ve been waiting for more than an hour and everyone else from our flight is on the other line she told me it’s because my husband has a foreign passport and because it has an x written on it so we have to stay in that line. I told her we’re family of 4 and my 2 kids and i have us passports but she said we have to stay in that line and wait. I was so upset because of the long wait, I was sick, and the fact we had to drive back home to Fargo which is 4 hours away from Minneapolis but no one seemed to care even when I physically walked over to the security guard and told him about our situation he told me rudely to go back to my family and wait. When everyone finally left and we came to check out the agent was so rude to me and told me to complain to his boss who was by the way a nice gentleman and when i explained to him that we live in States and my two kids and I have passports and my husband has his Bosnian passport and a green card he then asked if we have shown the Delta agent his green card. I said we didn’t because we were never asked for it. He then said that Delta agent should’ve sent us to the faster line because my husband had sufficient docs. He aldo said that I can complain to Delta supervisor at the front with the red suit on. I saw the lady and when asked if she’s a delta supervisor and she said yes I explained what had happened and why I’m upset. She very calmly said sorry but that her agents are fully trained. It wad pretty clear to me then that she wasn’t interested in my story or that she cared, let alone admit the fault. This was by far the most humiliating and disappointing traveling experience ever!!!"
25th June 2019,4,"""So unorganized""",Not Verified |  Poor signage everywhere. The highways under construction made finding rental car return impossible. 2 Hertz car locations? Who knew? Escalators and elevators taped off for repair and no signage to redirect traffic flow. So unorganized!
23rd June 2019,4,"""no carts for luggage anywhere""","Not Verified |  Had to walk a mile to gate and no carts for luggage anywhere, until I reached my gate. Oh and then you stick people and drain them for money. I travel the world and all airports have carts and I've never paid. I think this is tacky and low class. And no shuttle and if there are shuttles they told us to walk and I'm not happy!"
22nd June 2019,8,"""spacious, has shops and restaurants""","✅ Trip Verified | The airport is spacious, has shops and restaurants (although I could only find a tiny money exchange stall after being pointed to it by the Information Desk, which sits hidden behind a wall!), security is the same as in any other US airport (queues, people that take their jewelry box around their necks, etc)."
5th June 2019,5,"""so grateful for the help""","✅ Trip Verified |  I don't often write reviews but I would be ungrateful if I didn't thank one of the wonderful employees who helped us yesterday, Tuesday, May 21, 2019. We flew out of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport yesterday morning. We had a 6:50 am flight and arrived to return our rental car at 5:20. When we entered Terminal 1 we were shocked to see the security lines running both directions down the center of the terminal. One line had even doubled back on itself. I have never seen such long lines at any airport! (I hope it was due to bad weather the past few days and the need to reschedule people who missed flights but the security line would have taken at least 1 1/2 hours to get through) My husband and I have pre-check but my elderly parents ( early to late 80's) did not so he went through to our gate to make sure he could catch the flight for work while I stayed in the security line to help them. The line was moving very slowly and I became concerned that we might be in the wrong line. I asked a security officer near me if indeed I was headed in the right direction and expressed my concern that we would miss our flight. He said I was in the correct line and asked if I possibly had pre-check. I explained that I did but my parents didn't and that I needed to stay to help them through security and on the flight. He kindly had us follow him to another line where we were able to get through security as our flight was continuing the boarding process. We were able to grab a courtesy cart, as our gate was a long walk from the security checkpoint. We arrived at our gate just as boarding was finishing. I am so grateful for the help."
5th June 2019,1,"""disgustingly dirty ladies restroom""","✅ Trip Verified |  I flew into and out of the Minneapolis airport traveling between Phoenix, Arizona and Madison, Wisconsin. I was appalled to experience such a disgustingly dirty ladies restroom in Minneapolis! The stalls had either no toilet tissue or barely any, with only the last remains of a role in a few. There were no hand towels in the dispensers and just one paper towel role setting on the wet sink counter. Plus, there was a good amount of water on the floor. Such a contrast to the beautiful, pristine bathrooms of the Phoenix airport! Management needs to seriously look at this problem. Left me with a poor impression of this airport."
31st May 2019,4,"""little to nothing I could eat""","❎ Not Verified | I can usually count on being able to eat something at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport; however, the two restaurants that serve vegan dishes or will accommodate to make a vegan dish were not offering vegan dishes. Therefore, there was little to nothing I could eat. I was left spending $10 for a dried bagel that was clearly made a week ago."
6th April 2019,1,"""careless personnel at this airport""",✅ Trip Verified | My entire check-in baggage was lost at this airport! I was flying next to Rochester from this airport and had no luggage with me! Such careless personnel at this airport! Would try my best to avoid this airport now on.
3rd November 2018,8,"""love this terminal""","✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis St Paul Terminal 2. I love this terminal, it is simple, easy and although it does not have the space of Terminal 1 or all of the amenities, it is a breeze. At MSP, Terminal 2 was added as an expansion and it has since been expanded to 14 gates and it is essentially a large hallway with very simple parking and a few restaurants. The terminal is small but that is also it's best appeal, it is so easy to navigate and spend time in. I have been through domestic and international departures and arrivals and it has just been easy, the way it should be. Parking is simple, one of two ramps, Orange or Purple, park your vehicle, walk across the skyway and you are in. If you are on the side with security open, you just walk into security if you do not need to check a bag and you already have your ticket. Once you are through security, find your gate (not that hard, there are only 14 of them) and go get something to eat. The food is good and mostly local to Minneapolis but be aware that the airport's amenities do not open until 5am, the restaurants open later than that. I ran into this problem with an early Sun Country flight to Cancun. Arrival is pretty much just as easy, you'll be in the airport just long enough to get your bags and a cup of coffee and then walk across the skyway and get in your car. Sun Country and Southwest are the primary carriers out of Terminal 2 and there are a few others as well. I do wish Delta would have a few flights out of this terminal, it would make things much easier for some passengers."
31st October 2018,8,"""the experience was good""","Not Verified | Minneapolis St Paul is one of the best airports I have used over the past decade. Baggage check-in is pretty efficient, security lines move quickly, (and there is plenty of room both before and after the scanners), and there are a lot of varied options for eating and shopping in the terminals. My only real complaint on this trip was a lack of clear signage to get to the rental car area from the main terminal. There were signs for ""ground transportation"", but nothing that said ""rental cars"" until you were practically there. It took a couple of wrong turns before I got to the tram and got the car. Getting back to the arrivals pick-up area where my wife and bag were waiting took a good 15 minutes due to lane closures from construction. Other than that, the experience was good, as usual. A far cry from our home airport in Newark, NJ."
24th October 2018,10,"""Seriously impressed""","Not Verified | This was the first time I've been to this airport. Was here for a layover. I am impressed by the friendliness of the staff, the quality of shops and eateries, the cleanliness of the bathroom. Seriously impressed. I would be happy with an all day layover here!"
13th October 2018,2,"""immigration process took nearly 2 hours""","✅ Trip Verified | For transitting from international flight to a domestic flight, the immigration process took nearly 2 hours. Moreover, it was terrible for transitting here overnight. Since my connecting flight was the next day, I could not check-in. There were a few seats opposite the check-in counters. I did not sleep well in these seats. However, after checked-in and cleared customs, I could go to the sleeping area which provide many mats for free."
3rd October 2018,2,"""Never saw a smiling face""","✅ Trip Verified | Very poor wheelchair support to and from rental car facility. Surly and unfriendly personnel. Extremely unhelpful and poorly staffed auto rental facility! Building design not wheelchair friendly. Long distances to get anywhere. Gate area vending machines and snack shops extremely bad condition, either not working or poorly maintained and totally inadequate. Never saw a smiling face. anywhere in the airport!"
22nd February 2018,1,"""understaffed and inefficient""","❎ Not Verified |  This airport is like a third world country. Endless walking, moving sidewalks and trams that are out of service. There are minimal food choices in Concourse B and those few that are available are grossly understaffed and inefficient. I am a frequent business traveler and all I can say is that if you have any choice at all, avoid MSP airport at all costs!"
15th February 2018,4,"""restricted restaurant and bar ordering""","❎ Not Verified |  I feel compelled to lodge a critique about the way the airport has restricted restaurant and bar ordering to the iPads permanently located on the table tops. They have a beautiful full bar and restaurant at the gate we were waiting for hours. I went up to ask for a pint and was directed to order via the iPad. I asked if I could just pay cash and was denied. I think MSP needs to be careful not to get so technologically full of themselves as to restrict business. The iPads on all the tables photograph really well as high-tech, but make the assumption that all people want to go through the tedious process of online ordering. I went to another vendor and purchased a packaged drink for cash in 30 seconds and brought it back with me."
4th December 2017,4,"""it is absolutely abysmal""",✅ Trip Verified | I don’t know who designed the layout of this airport but it is absolutely abysmal! There is little to nothing about it’s design that makes navigating this place convenient at all. That being said the airport was much cleaner than others I’ve been to and the restraunts were all very nice. I’m surprised with such a large remodel and billions of dollars invested that this is all they came up with.
26th November 2017,3,"""lack of humanity experienced""","❎ Not Verified | While technology and design are key components of current air travel, the lack of humanity experienced across the board-from baggage check to restaurant / vending has left me frustrated. Staff on their phones, poor food, and no one to speak with. No descript pricing. Not good."
14th September 2017,4,"""shame passenger pick up is not non-smoking""",❎ Unverified | It is a complete shame that baggage claim and passenger pick up is not non-smoking. Everybody comes out and lights their cigarette up right outside the doors which makes all non-smokers have to breathe in the smoke. It's terrible. Non-smokers should not be forced to breathe in the smoke.
4th January 2017,8,"""huge sprawling, spacious airport""","Huge sprawling, spacious airport with a train to connect the terminals and long stretches that have moving sidewalks. The eating and shopping options are extensive and varied. The wi-fi service is good. Although we had to spend several hours in transit because of airplane problems, we found the place engaging. If the arrival gate and departure gate are not close together then you are in for a long hike - so give ample time for connecting. If you are new to the airport, it takes a bit to figure out the layout of the place - may be too big for ease of use. Airport personnel were friendly and helpful."
18th December 2016,1,"""contrary to website everything closed""","Left Las Vegas at 410 pm and arrive in Minneapolis after a 2.5hr flight. Not one place to eat, drink or get a newspaper open after 9pm. Contrary to website everything closed. Absolutely not acceptable when there are hundreds of passengers waiting to board for flights. Agent at gate sent me in 3 different direction and areas but everything closed? Gate agent had no idea of food service or times of operations."
30th September 2016,10,"""very modern and clean""","Very neat, very well kept. I have been to Orlando, Cincinnati, La Guardia, St Louis, and Chicago Midway recently and this is by far the best and the nicest (although many parts of Orlando are very nice). Very modern and clean. Not hard to get around. Can be a long walk between gates, but not too bad."
13th August 2016,1,"""appalled at the attitude""","The TSA staff and organization of this airport is horrible. I walked in on the side nearest the terminal I would be going to (South Checkpoint). After winding through about 3 rows of people, a security agent came over and redirected about 30 people to walk to the other side of the airport (North Checkpoint) because there was 'no wait' for security there. My husband was traveling with his service dog and was one of the passengers redirected to the other security line. The staff member tried to close the opening for redirected passengers behind my husband and in front of me. I said, ""Wait, that's my husband with the service dog that you just redirected."" She replied (with a condescending tone), ""Well then you better go keep up with him."" After waiting in line just as long at the North Checkpoint, the TSA staff checked my husband's ticket and license and sent him through to the metal detector staff. Then, a passenger in a wheelchair appeared in the lane next to me. The TSA staff in front of me indicated that I should wait while the first person in the wheelchair lane was serviced. I waited. After that wheelchair passenger was through, another one came up in the lane next to me. The TSA staff waved that wheelchair passenger to come forward. Then, the TSA staff asked the person standing behind that wheelchair passenger if they were together. This person responded, ""Yes"" and also went forward. I finally walked up to the TSA staff. When he indicated that I should have waited for his signal to walk up, I said, ""My husband is the man with the service dog who is already all the way through security and waiting on the other side. I'm not waiting any longer."" I got a dirty look from both him and the next wheelchair passenger in the other lane. I was absolutely appalled at the attitude and disregard for courtesy that these TSA agents had for it's Minneapolis passengers. After getting through security, I encountered a passenger who had entered through security at the South Checkpoint and was walking across to the other end because they were leaving through terminal C. Whereas my husband, service dog, and I were walking from the North Checkpoint to the other end at terminal G. The absolute disorganization of this airport, security checkpoints and it's staff make it the worst airport I have had to travel through."
26th July 2016,2,"""he became very agitated""","I was traveling with my husband and sister, both have had knee replacements, and my husband needs additional surgery. I also have bad knees. This is the first airport that we have encountered an airport that does not have a special services lane for wheelchairs. One of the staff members pushing our chairs was complaining that he needed to get off work. We noticed an older lady sitting in a wheelchair that needed to be pushed onto the plane. The airline agent asked a young man pushing an empty chair if he would do it and he became very agitated and did not want to do it. I was shocked. We probably will not be coming through the Minneapolis again if we can help it."
11th July 2016,2,"""a terrible design""","In the last 3 months I have used this airport several times. Each time is not an ideal travel experience. However, this morning was the worst. I'm not sure if it is the responsibility of the airport or TSA, but there is no reason to have people waiting to get through security for an hour or more, especially when all of the scanners aren't operational. Sure that equipment was very expensive, but if it's not staffed there is no reason to have it. It's sad when getting to the airport more than the recommended 90 minutes early leaves one running through the terminal hoping they hold the door. Also there are seemingly no restrooms between the E terminal and the security checkpoint, which seems like a terrible design."
6th June 2016,8,"""well-organized but sprawling""","The Lindbergh terminal at Minneapolis St Paul airport is well-organized but sprawling. Distances between gates can be considerable, so be sure to allow at least 60 minutes between flights if you're connecting. Arrivals and departures are handled pretty well, although the terminal's sprawl can lead to some confusion. Check-in is pretty easy, but TSA lines can be very long unless you have TSA Pre-Check. Once inside the main concourse, there is a very good selection of shops and decent restaurants and even a live pianist or harpist at peak hours. A train service runs along gates in Concourse C, but you'll be walking long distances anywhere else. Baggage claim is pretty straightforward and easy, but distances to the garage and rental car center involve a short train ride and some walking."
19th February 2016,2,"""rude and very unfriendly""",We arrived 90 minutes late and had a connecting flight to catch with a very short connection time. Our flight was international so we needed to go through customs first. No attempt was made to let the people with connections go first off plane as I have witnessed before. Once we made it through customs the women in the security line checking carry on bags back in to for our connection were extremely rude and very unfriendly.
20th January 2016,10,"""friendly, clean, spacious""","My favorite airport. It's friendly, clean, spacious, and efficient. The distances can be long but there are golf carts readily available if you want / need them. If you have the time, it's a lovely walk through spacious corridors (and you won't be dodging people and getting elbowed). There is a 'cut-across' corridor between the High G gates and the middle C gates. All the commuter flights use jet bridges so you won’t be exposed to the elements. There is great dining and shopping in the mall area and free wifi throughout. Charging stations, work areas, and upholstered chairs are generously sprinkled throughout the terminal. It is accommodating and comfortable and friendly."
15th August 2015,9,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,"I was quite impressed with the number of shops and restaurants in the airport where we went. We had a connection from domestic to international flights and I felt very comfortable and welcomed at the airport. Though it may be a long walk and tiring due to a lack of walkways, the airport mall actually made me thought I was in an actual mall, and felt quite nice. at the international gate for Delta, they give you free usage of their iPads to use and it feels as if you are in a lounge. Great experience throughout the transit. But off course, things were a little pricey when it comes to food. "
14th January 2015,9,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,What a friendly airport! Due to a missed connection I was delayed here but I found the staff more than helpful and friendly the free use of ipads handy and on the whole easy to find my way about. I found it a clean and pleasant place and would certainly use again.
10th September 2013,3,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,As mentioned earlier this is a poor airport to arrive from an international location and try to make a domestic connection. We had 2.5 hours and barely made our connection. Problems are long queues at immigration (common at many airports nowadays) only one security checkpoint open for departures long waits for rail connecting the terminals etc. The domestic airport looks quite nice but had no time to check it out as we were running. Figure at least 3-3.5 hours for a connecting flight from this airport (int'l to domestic).
29th August 2013,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Connecting domestically to an international flight on Delta as it is a major for them. Not impressed! As I exited my gate I entered directly into a restaurant which is very disorienting and seems to be their design strategy now. Many of the gates are not just gates with waiting areas rather restaurants shops and other facilities. When departing the gate area for the international flights around gate G4 were packed with people and rather claustrophobic and there was nowhere to sit unless you wanted to be in one of the restaurants. This particular day the outside temperatures were close to 100 F and it was hot in the terminal. Also the distance between gates can be quite far. There are some good concessions as there are plenty of them but the airport has low ceilings feels old and tatty and could use a big makeover. As I can choose many Delta hubs in the US to get to and from Narita I will not choose this one again.
20th June 2013,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,The best airport I have experienced. Many places to charge a cell phone or use a laptop. Many pay phones reasonably quiet beautifully furnished. Carpeting is new and helps keep terminals quiet. Has a salad bar and fresh fruit. Free Wifi. Only point of improvement would be the restrooms. I was in Terminal C. The women's room had very cramped stalls that were difficult to get in and out of with baggage. They may be upgrading restrooms in other terminals but I am not sure of this.
20th June 2013,6,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Overall very acceptable on food and shop amenities. Layout and signage pretty easy. Feels a bit cramped with low ceilings but nothing too oppressive. Security lines were the longest lines I have ever seen for screening. Condition of most of the restrooms I have seen in the concourses were either disgusting or beyond disgusting. The newly renovated restrooms are nice but could use more stalls and sinks. With regards to the conditions of the restrooms in the concourses it's either not cleaned enough or perhaps not monitored at all. Did not ruin my first impression of MSP but it didn't help either.
25th July 2012,5,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,The airport itself is good trying to find the place if you are not a city resident is another story. I fly into the Twin Cities about 4 times a year to go north. I get out easily enough but coming back into the city is almost always a nightmare; even with GPS. Every major city I know has airport signage about 15 or 20 miles out of the city - giving you both directions and some peace of mind that you are on the right track. The only airport sign I ever find in MSP is about a mile from the airport - while we're busy doing detours. Last week I was driven to the airport from the Range and we were following GPS. We gave ourselves an extra hour. Missed the flight partially because of very nice but insanely thorough security guards who made my daughter-in-law open all of her baby food confiscated the ice pack in her cold container for the baby's milk and basically held up everyone for about an extra 20 minutes.
9th May 2012,2,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,"I would love to tell you about my experience in the airport but we never got to see it. We arrived from overseas with 2 hours + to make our connecting domestic flight. We spent the entire time waiting in the passport control line where 4 officers one by one checked the entry documents for over 400 people from varying airlines. And we were in the ""US passport holders"" line! We finally cleared passport control then customs and ran across the airport only to miss our flight by five minutes. What I can't believe is why they seemed so overwhelmed with the number of passengers. It's not like these planes are showing up without notice or anything. In my lone experience I would not enter the US or make connecting international flights through Minneapolis St. Paul until the US Border Patrol there changes their service."
19th November 2011,5,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Parking at Terminal 2 is unacceptable and poorly communicated. Arriving at Lindbergh only to find out you need to go nearly two miles away park take the escalator take the light rail take the tram just makes the hassle of air travel worse. The parking seems to be more about the convenience of maintenance for MSP than for the convenience of the traveler. Lots of holiday decorations and heaven knows lots of advertisements but give me moving walkways that work reasonable queues and most important - on-time departures and arrivals!
24th July 2011,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,"I have been to MSP a couple of times and departing has never been a problem the service is very efficient and security has never been an issue. On arrival I was disappointed with how I was treated. I come to Minneapolis to visit a friend twice a year and stay for no more than 3 weeks. I was treated as if I intended to stay illegally and was made to feel guilty for something I had no intention of doing. I know these people are only doing their jobs but when I connected through Chicago I was never subjected to such interrogation. I was welcomed with a smile and a very friendly ""welcome to America"". I have to admit it puts me off wanting to fly direct to Minneapolis again."
6th June 2010,1,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,We arrived late for a connection flight. We had 20 minutes to get to the next gate all the way on the other side of the airport. I would recommend that you have more than 2 hours for connection time. The airport is messed up and very hard to get around. We never made it to our destination.
16th February 2010,1,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,In a nutshell never take a connection flight to this airport without leaving at least 2 hours in between connections or else you will have to due a little workout in the airport just to get from one terminal to the other while looking at the watch and crossing fingers. And if you miss your flight you will have to beg Delta airlines to rebook you that's of course if you find someone in the terminal to rebook you. Just imagine a large gym with people sprinting all over and there you have it Minneapolis airport.
2nd February 2010,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,I have been quite satisfied with my experiences at MSP. I must agree that some of the concourses (C especially) seem quite long but it never hurt anyone to walk a little bit (there are moving sidewalks for a good part of the C concourse anyway if walking isn't your thing). The signage within the airport is quite good and it is a very clean airport. Can't say much about the retail options as I've never understood shopping at airports. I feel the food options are rather good. Others have pointed out the fact that it can be a bit pricey to fly out of MSP but I have found there to be much fewer delays at MSP than at O'Hare. It's nice to have the non-stop options that Delta provides. The three daily non-stops to Amsterdam are wonderful for connecting to many cities in Europe.
16th December 2009,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,The size of MSP and the length of some concourses (especially G and C) are rightly (in)famous; there is however a little-known way for departing passengers to deal with this. There is a pedestrian bridge between Concourses G and C over the access road; the middle of this bridge can be accessed directly from the Red and Blue parking ramps. Security and check-in can be done here but baggage check cannot be. NOTE: Only Northwest/Delta passengers can check in here. It would be possible for arriving passengers to leave security here and then take the tram from the parking ramps to the main terminal to pick up baggage but whether this would be faster than walking the concourses I cannot say.
13th October 2009,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Checked in around midday for a late afternoon NWA flight. No crowds fast simple kiosk check in and very helpful bag drop lady. Only one place to eat landside so decided to go thru security (quick easy and pleasant) and find a restaurant/fast food outlet. Plenty of places to eat and drink airside. It is a deceptively big airport and some gates involve a long walk. But there are plenty of moving footways and an electric cart pick up service at specific points around the concourses. Signage was clear departure info everywhere toilets clean plenty of empty gate lounges to 'get away' from the throng for a while. Some gates become quite crowded just before departures. Pleasant experience overall.
17th April 2009,3,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,"The airport is aesthetically beautiful but it is not set up for easy access to other concourses/gates and baggage this is especially true for those on small commuter planes that use the B and C concourses. After flying packed like sardines in planes not designed to accomodate anyone over 5'5"" and 150""s you then have to walk from what feels like downtown St. Paul to get to the main concourse. If you need to go to another concourse you are hopeful that you have the time or are phsyically able to do so. The main point of this is don't ever count on the Tram on Concourse C to be working. In the last 4 months the times I have flown which is often I have been able to use the tram 3 times. Landing yesterday 4-16-2009 at gate B 13 I found out that it will be down for at least 10 days to replace the cable sytem. Which is wonderful if it was well used and several years old but it is less than 5 years old I believe! Again if you are training for a marathon you will love the airport. If not be prepared to walk or if late run!"
18th February 2009,3,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,What makes MSP not bad is security always moves fast no matter how crowded. All the check in counters are within one roof and the concourse are connected which means no need to take any trams (although that option is still there if you dont want to walk a whole lot). It is spacious than most of the airport I have been to like Phoenix Vegas LAX etc. Shops are decent. Baggage are is not all that posh but not dirty either. You can pick up your bag without much hassel and be on your way. The best part is the ground transportation. You have light rail that you can take.
31st October 2008,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Travelling from Canada to Europe via Minneapolis/St. Paul was less trouble than experienced. Outbound most Canadian passengers can take advantage of U.S. Customs and Immigration pre-clearance which is a fairly painless experience at smaller airports such as Winnipeg and go straight to their connecting flight on arrival. Clearing U.S. Customs and Immigration on the way back to Canada was a breeze at MSP thanks to short lineups and affable staff. There's a good selection of airside stores and restaurants too. Ubiquitous TVs tuned in to CNN are a mixed blessing: they just add to the din at a crowded gate but if you can find an empty gate you can stretch out relax and watch the news while waiting for your connecting flight.
6th July 2008,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,This has been my home airport for several years. Downsides: size (I suggest at least 60 minutes between flights) price (Northwest's fault not the airport) lack of airside transportation between terminals and not enough shops/food landside. Also the baggage claims are old and can easily back up (I heard recently that they will be replaced in the near future). Now for the good parts. Plenty of diverse reasonably priced shopping and food airside and clear signage throughout. The Customs/Immigration staff while not overly friendly were very professional and reasonably quick. Also I have never seen security or (Northwest) bag check lines longer than 10-15 minutes). There is an easy fast light-rail connection to/from downtown Minneapolis. There is also a separate underground tram from the parking ramps to the terminal eliminating the need to carry your bags outside. The entire facility is clean and well-lit. For those with a 2-3 hour layover there is a little-known observation tower in Concourse D (go to the block in the center of the concourse and all the way up the stairs) which is usually uncrowded and a very nice place to relax. Overall it can be large and expensive but it is otherwise redeemed by atmosphere and ease of use.
4th July 2008,2,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,I had a connection flight through MSP to Mason City IA a city served with only three daily flights. Even though I had arrived some 15 minutes late inbound from Newark I still assumed I had enough time to make my connection flight. That was until MSP came into play. I had originally had approximately 45 minutes to connect flights and even with the 15 minute inbound delay it still left me (and my older aunt who was traveling with me) 30 minutes to go from one gate to the other. I took off in a rather fast-pace walking from one gate to another following the overhead signs to my connection terminal. Following the directional signs it took me nearly 20 minutes to walk between my two gates mind you walking at the pace of a 20-some year old sprinting at times once I kept looking at my watch. In the end I arrived at my connection-departure gate 5 minutes prior to departure the departure door had already been closed and I missed my connection flight. In a nutshell MSP is a much much too spread out airport which makes a connection of less than 90 minutes nearly impossible. As a result of this I will never be booking a flight that offers a connection though MSP again. I will happily pay extra to avoid this airport.
15th April 2008,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,A clean and friendly airport with lots of shops for all your needs and plenty of seating area. Plenty of nearby gates for eating while you hang around. There is a family room here too for resting up where there are children travelling. If they had seating without arms that you could lay out on as they do at Gatwick they would warrant a 5 star. Distances between gates sometimes are extensive but there are carts floating around for your help too.
25th February 2008,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,After disembarking from my NWA flight it was so easy to find my way to the tram that would take me to my next terminal. Even though I had a 3 hour stop over I felt that there was plenty to keep me entertained especially when my flight to LAX was delayed 45 minutes. The shops were different and had variety - when I stopped in at a convenience store to get a magazine and a Coke lady at the checkout was personable and keen to converse beyond how much my purchases came to. The gate lounge was clean and seats were confortable. One thing that struck me as particularly odd though was the amount of dogs that were allowed to walk around on a lead with their owners. Never seen that before at an airport!
17th February 2008,1,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,I have traveled internationally for many years. This year was the first time in the US that we were treated very rudely by Customs at the MSP Airport. They were not at all kind or respectful and treated us as if were trying to be dishonest on our declarations. I have never been so frustrated as I was by them.
12th November 2007,1,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,I have used Lindbergh terminal for several years and have always been impressed with it's ease of use and the shopping - I usually have a 7 hour layover and find plenty to do during that time. My last trip was less than memorable as I was flying Northwest from Minot ND to Minneapolis and Icelandair from Minneapolis to Glasgow. This time Icelandair had moved to Humphry terminal so I had to transfer from one terminal to the other. My impression is that Lindbergh and Humphry terminals have an ongoing war of some kind and really don't give a damn about their customers. There is no transfer for baggage so I had to drag my bags with me - on the outward journey I had to take a bus from just outside Lindbergh to just outside Humphry (signs and directions were practically non existant). On the return journey I found that after already traveling for 16 hours I had to drag my bags through the entire parking garage to reach the mass transit train this took me about 20 minutes. I am a person who is not easily scared by anything but I have never felt so unsafe walking through the parking garage on my own at 7:00 pm - no airport staff or security anywhere in sight I really wondered where on earth I was going and if I was going in the right direction. Once I got on the train (absolutely exhausted) I found that there were a couple of young men about 20 feet away from me starting a fight! What a wonderful impression this gives to any travellers coming to this country for the first time. Unfortunately I have very few choices of transport between North Dakota and Scotland and will probably have to take the same route again (I usually make two trips a year). Minneapolis needs to have a dedicated means of transport for airline passengers between the two terminals and more security. I would add that I am 64 years old and in reasonable shape when I finally reached Lindbergh terminal I was absolutely exhausted frustrated and upset by the whole experience I still had another 7 hours travel time before I would be home. I am writing letters to everyone I can think of regarding this incident I would encourage anyone else who has had the same experience to do the same.
16th October 2007,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport seems optimum in the sense that it is large enough to offer passengers multiple shopping and dining venues and yet it still maintains a very clean and modern environment despite its size - something I have to appreciate after having been to more rustic monstrosities such as Chicago O'Hare. It is true that Northwest Airlines dominates the airport and its passengers may have to walk long distances to and from its many dispersed concourses but this actually seems to translate into an advantage for passengers flying other airlines because most of them seem to have their operations concentrated on one concourse that is quite close to check-in baggage claim and the Northstar Crossing dining/shopping. So if you are traveling say American Continental Delta etc. you may not even realize the immense size of the airport because you are not likely to contend with it. My one complaint about MSP is that there are very few shops and restaurants open during the early hours of the morning which is an inconvenience for persons such as myself who normally arrive at the terminal quite early for flights departing at 6 or 7 a.m. with international connections and would like to eat or shop before boarding. However in all fairness I doubt that many airports have much to offer at that hour.
26th September 2007,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,There is a good mix of shops and eating places but most important of all the signeage is clear.We were coming in from Europe and needing to catch another flight connection after clearing customs. I was SO pleased that after we'd done that there was a sign indicating where the luggage needed to go for onward flights. Last year we went through Dulles and we hadn't a clue where the bags had to go and the staff didn't help. One sign at MSP saved an awful lot of upset and resulting delayed baggage that we had at Dulles. Give me MSP anyday.
14th August 2007,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,"I use MSP 5-6 times a year and find it ""serviceable"". Its too big and distances between connections can be long and tiring even with the escalators and trams. Food tends to be mediocre and expensive and in general I find the whole MSP experience dispiriting. One good thing: the NWA lounges are top- notch or very close to it. Also you can pay a daily fee and get in. Very worthwhile if you have a 5-6 hour (or more) layover. International arrival there is OK no long delays but customs takes themselves very seriously and seems to operate on the premise if they're not inspecting someone's bags they're not doing their jobs. You can get to the Mall of America pretty easily if you do find yourself with a 6 hour layover. At least you could before I-45 collapsed."
5th June 2007,4,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,One of the nicest US airports I've visited which made an enforced further 24 hour stay that much more bearable. Nicely spaced out nothing is too far away and even getting to/from Downtown Minneapolis and the MoA is a lot easier than (say) Heathrow. If you fly NW and use hotel drop-off the self check-in where you're dropped off makes things less hassle. Only minor quibble was that if you have a lot of people queuing up for a non NW flight (in my case UAL) it gets crowded. But then it was the time when my own flight got delayed so it was probably a bad day.
22nd August 2006,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,The layout at MSP is excellent. The walk is never too long and you don't need to leave security to change concourses unlike SFO LAX etc. Also all the check-in counters are in the same hall which is great if different people in your group are flying different airlines and you want to say goodbye. Short security lines due to multiple multi lane checkpoints. On-site rental car and parking makes travel into town easy.
2nd August 2006,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Just transferred twice through MSP on NW a few weeks ago. I liked the airport a lot but it fails in comparison to DTW. The Lindbergh Terminal is quite a hike especially if you are coming in on Northwest Airlink. The G and C terminals are very long but there is a walkway where you can transfer from one side to the other. I really enjoyed the observation deck at the D concourse and the view was excellent. The C concourse tram is very helpful especially for the elderly. Waiting areas tend to be crowded in the C concourse but D E F and G were just fine. Great restaurants also. All and all I was quite happy with MSP. Expect a bit of a walk and familiarize yourself with the terminal layout in the NW magazine. If you do that you should be just fine.
22nd August 2005,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,At first glance you may wonder why MSP received the award for best North American Airport. Let's face it the terminals aren't brand new like DEN or SAN and nobody likes paying high air fares because of its n torious fortress status. However there are many factors that make MSP stand out like the quick and easy immigration/customs area tram to Concourse C excellent restaurant choices (try the Itasca Grill) and its close proximity to the downtown area. I think the terminal dedicated to low cost carriers (Humphrey terminal) is a great aspect of MSP - it's cozy and a breeze to get through and you don't have to wade through the thousands of connecting passengers on NWA to get to your gate. The Lindbergh terminal (main terminal) has a nice clean shopping area in the middle with an even cleaner food court but the concourses themselves are dotted with decent restaurants as well. The layout makes sense and you never have to walk very far unless you're at the very end of a concourse or you forget to take the tram. There's also train service to the Mall of America (currently the biggest mall in the US great for a long layover) and the downtown area. The airport could use a facelift as some of the ceilings are a bit low and the baggage area is becoming slightly dilapidated. It would be a blessing if Southwest came here - it would drive down some of the high fares associated with the Northwest monopoly but I suppose every fortress airport could use some Southwest relief.
8th August 2005,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,"I have always liked connecting though MSP. I agree with people when they say that if you're coming in on an RJ or Prop that you had better wear hiking shoes but the abundance of moving walkways is definately a plus. Anyway the airport has always been clean and the staff has the friendly ""Midwest Hospitality"" feel about them. Being from Wisconsin myself it was mostly overlooked outbound and only noticed on my way back home after missing this while at my destination."
24th July 2005,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Décor is a very staid; it didn't feel like the most modern of airports. Unlike Mr Kuhlmann I did not find much trouble navigating from Humphrey to the Hertz pick-up but I was disappointed at the distance I still had to walk especially as I had an extraordinary amount of luggage. However I was impressed with the friendliness of all staff especially at United.
28th June 2005,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,To answer the question about the trams with no people they were undergoing testing and before certification for use they had to run 30 days without needing matinence. I personally have ridden them since then and they are without any staff aboard. Also much less known to travelers here is the Humphrey terminal which has been built in the last five years. This terminal features six gates none of which are / can be owned by any single airline. Also the new light-rail system is a plus for travelers who have a layover because not only does it connect to the mall of america but the MOA terminal is within walking distance of a new indoor waterpark once construction has finished this waterpark will be the largest indoor waterpartk in the US.
31st January 2005,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Overall I like MSP yes it is a pain to get to some concourses but it is an older airport. My question is why have the train (light rail) connecting Minneapolis Fort Snelling the airport and the Mall of America if I cannot park at any of those locations and ride the train to the airport without getting my car towed? Maybe a few people like to go to the Mall but I doubt many fly into MSP and ride the train elsewhere without additional transportation. Seems like a huge waste to me.
8th September 2004,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,MSP Airport is truly a modern airport and one of the best to visit. However this is not an airport that is favorable to those who seek low fares or affordable travel. Northwest strives and vigilently fights to keep the airfares at this airport excessively high. The competition is uneager to fight high fares (even the low fare airlines that serve this airport). Without new airlines (Southwest or the like) this airport is only going to be affordable to those business travelers. Also why does the connection train at the airport operates but has nobody riding it? This would make the airport less of a pain to walk through and provide relief to those that have to navigate the long journey to concourse B. The airport has severe problems that need to be corrected sometime in the near future however the amenities at this airport are some of the best.
29th August 2004,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,MSP is generally a great airport as either a destination or a connecting spot. It's too bad that it's a fortress hub for Northwest and flying there costs an arm and a leg. I like the availability of shops and the generally well-lighted interior. There are lots of pleasant distractions for long layovers. And the barber shop is great - if you know where to find it! My one complaint about MSP however is the sheer enormity of it made worse by the lack of speedier ways to get around. The airport needs a functioning tram system to zip around the concourses (apparently there is a tram that goes from the A-B gates to the D gates but it has never worked). Connecting from a NW commuter flight in the A concourse to a flight out of the F concourse is nearly impossible without at least 30 minutes of breathless scurrying along moving sidewalks and muscling through flight-bank throngs. This is the one thing that keeps MSP from being a truly world-class airport.
20th June 2004,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,"St. Pauls airport gives me a feeling that I'm at a enormous airport. Allhough it's quite easy to navigate it's clean and friendly staff. For aviation fanatics there's a nice small ""room"" where you have a nice overview of the platform full with Northwest aircrafts. As a KLM platinum card holder we share the lounge with partner Northwest. The lounge was quite crowded compared the size of the lounge. I prefer more spacious lounges with less noise. The service and drinks are ok and there's also a small separated area for smokers which I did appreciate."
4th December 2003,n/a,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,I found MSP to be a bright clean airport with good shopping facilities airside. The check in area is also very good with great overhead signage. My only complaint with the airport is that if you are not flying Northwest then the information screens for other airlines are almost non existent making you feel slightly unwanted. The foot of snow which fell while I was in Minneapolis had no adverse effect on the operations.
26th February 2022,10,"""people were so helpful and caring""","✅ Trip Verified |  Needed a wheel chair because of an injury, people were so helpful and caring. A special thank you to Damian who pushed my wheel chair. So grateful! Thank you"
21st January 2017,7,"""airport did not disappoint me""","✅ Verified Review |  For a small beachside city developed as a getaway destination for North Americans, this little modern airport did not disappoint me. Getting through security was a breeze (very friendly TSA), and compared to other airports I've been to, navigating is easy enough. If you are someone who goes to the airport not just to fly but to shop mountains of stuff this airport might not be for you, granted it has somewhere between 15 and 20 gates total, and there is no gargantuan walkway of duty-free shops to be found. The terminal is very modern and clean. For some reason, despite being first in line for takeoff, it did take us about 15 min to get off of the ground. Lots of general aviation, so this might be a regular thing. Bottom line, would I fly here? Absolutely. This airport is all about convenience and efficiency."
9th July 2015,n/a,Myrtle Beach Airport customer review,"So upon the approach of my gate for my first departure, (5 minutes after boarding time), none of the flight details in the entire airport had been updated to inform me that my flight was delayed. This is Spirit Airlines that I'm referring to. My flight had been delayed over 2 hours due to the lack of crew. I know this is a small  airport, but it is not hard to update your information in the airport, the terminal, the gate, or online in order to inform your passengers before potentially going through security. On top of all of the inconvenient change of plans, the lady at my gate attempting to inform us of all that changed was quite possibly the most incoherent person I spoke to on my 4 day stay here in South Carolina. I will never connect here or fly Spirit again. The only bit of accommodations or considerations I received was a free upgrade to vacant exit row seats. I didn't receive a voucher for breakfast, no help trying to find another airline that could get me there sooner, or a voucher for a future flight for satisfaction. Had it not have been for the pilots coaxing all of us passengers and explaining what she apparently was incapable of, there would have been an outrage in Gate A."
2nd February 2022,1,"""Absolutely pathetic""","Not Verified | What a complete joke - this is not a terminal, but a completely messed up construction zone. You will have to walk through mud, rain, snow and ice to get in and out of that terminal. There is not even a drop off without having to walk for 5-10 minutes through the complete mess. Once you made it to the ""terminal"", don't expect seating anywhere near the ""gate"". Also, don't expect the plane to be anywhere close to the construction zone that you have to enter to catch a flight. For that, you leave the building and walk and walk through the same weather, mud and rain that you experienced getting into that building. I have no idea why any airline in the world would assume that this was anywhere close to acceptable. Over the last 40 years, I have been flying with poor airlines into poor airports, but this is absolutely the worst and most unbelievable experience. For sure the last time that I flew with Delta Airlines, which is the only airline expecting their customers to accept walking through a muddy construction zone to use their ""service"". Absolutely pathetic."
13th November 2021,6,"""the design of the Terminal D is dreadful""","Not Verified |  While pretty, the design of the Terminal D is dreadful if you are a human who has to walk the half mile to the last gate. And if you forget, or need to use a restroom after you get to the gate, be prepared to hike back that half mile! Further sadness is the design flaw of the expansive windows. Pretty views, but no overhang and poor window tinting means I left the airport sunburned and sweating from the greenhouse-effect heat! Sunburned from sitting inside an airport? Crazy, but true. Lastly, LaGuardia is now the most expensive airport in the world to get a snack, try the $6 bottle of orange juice (that costs $0.50 wholesale, and $4 at other airports). Shame on NYC and Skanska Design."
17th September 2021,5,"""is still very much a work in progress""",✅ Trip Verified | It was the last leg of a long day traveling from JAC. The airport is undergoing a multi billion dollar renovation and is still very much a work in progress. Eating and shopping options are somewhat limited compared to other airports I was at on this trip. I was too tired and hungry to go exploring. There was only one monitor to check for departing flights at the far end of the C concourse. This was frustrating as my departure gate changed twice. The departing flight was stuck on the tarmac for about 45 minutes due to Air Traffic. Who knew that a late night departure from LaGuardia could get delayed waiting to take off?
19th April 2021,4,"""I was totally disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | I realize the renovation is not complete - but I am so disappointed that the layout doesn't seem to consider people who are not 20-30 somethings or athletes. The corridors going to the gates are excessively long and I see no plans for moving sidewalks. I am a ""normal"" 50 something with no disabilities and still found it to be a trek. If you're going to do something, why not do it right? I was totally disappointed. Nice advertising, nice fountain but really, I like convenience most."
27th September 2020,8,"""TV’s are deafening""","✅ Trip Verified | TV’s are deafening. Not all of us need to anesthetized by useless news. Make some quiet sections. Other then that, the terminal has improved immensely."
14th November 2019,3,"""Worst shuttle service I have ever seen""","Not Verified |  Worst shuttle service I have ever seen, out of many, and I want to stress up front that there was zero hustle in the the service people involved with the unacceptably-long shuttle time. My wife and I arrived at a high-numbered (no letter) gate and saw that we needed to get to gate 'D2'. After looking around in confusion and almost following a sign for D gate departures OUT of the airport, we figured out there was a shuttle between terminals (no signs for it that I saw). After a short walk, we got to a waiting line of shuttle passengers, some of which it sounded like they were waiting many minutes more. Another ten minutes later we were finally got on the shuttle, which took another ten plus minutes to get to our gate. Fortunately we had a reasonably-long layover to work with so we made our flight, another shuttle passenger was not so lucky. Also, at our gate the seating was very poorly laid out and cramped, yay. At least the staff at that gate showed some hustle to get us on the plane which was appreciated, my heart goes out to them."
20th October 2019,1,"""will gladly pay more money to not stop at LGA""","Not Verified |  The worst airport experience I have had. Every flight to and from were delayed. They are clearly overbooking flights and can't handle the traffic. I missed my connection and have to pay for the hotel out of pocket because it was ""air traffic control"" issues and not weather related. They should't take in more flights than they're capable of handling. It took 45 mins to take a shuttle to go 2 terminals over because theres no traffic control for cars/buses. There so signs or info for which bus to take. The ""bus stops"" were overflowed with people waiting. And no help directing people. I will gladly pay more money to not stop at LGA."
24th September 2019,1,"""easily the worst of them all""",Not Verified |    I would say it is a third world experience but that is unfair to underdeveloped countries. I have been to plenty of airports around the world and LGA is easily the worst of them all. The traffic situation is a disaster and only gets worse. It never improves. This airport should be avoided if at all possible.
18th September 2019,2,"""disgustingly filthy""","Not Verified | Absolutely disgustingly filthy. Food and wrappers on floors and seats. Sticky armrests. Badly stained carpets. The concourse of arrival Monday, September 16, for flt 5469 Delta from YUL and departure # 3300 Delta to GRR were awfully uncared for. Several ""cleaners"" were there but not doing their jobs anything more than chatting. It was very disappointing as Delta has certainly lowered the bar for service/customer care. Also, the wheelchair was stained. You are asking for health problems with such inattention to hygiene. Is it incorrect to expect workers to work? Look presentable? Attend to expectations of cleanliness? Or am I just too old school?"
29th August 2019,1,"""food options were pathetic""","✅ Trip Verified | This is by far the worst airport that I have ever had the displeasure of “visiting.” No one could tell us which gate our plane would be arriving at. It took over an hour of us walking around, asking every Delta employee to eventually know where we were to go. The food options were pathetic: almost every stand had the same pre-made sandwiches sitting around for purchase. But the worst of all was the hot serve-your-self options that were placed under heating lamps in the middle of walkways. Passing travelers were free to touch and stir the food trays, but most did not even buy! All I could think about was the massive amount of global germs that would be deposited in each dish! To make matters even more depressing was the pan handle-like atmosphere where airport employees were harassing travelers to sign up for American Express credit cards. Some became indignant when we refused due to time restraints. One told me, “Ahh, come on, you got time, your plane isn’t leaving until 2.00!” Sadly, however, he or no one else, would help us locate our gate. My husband and I had to be detectives and do our own footwork to locate our plane’s eventual arrival gate. Finally, the “icing on the cake” would be the rock-hard stale doughnuts I purchased out of desperation after throwing away my pricey, cold, bland ham and cheese sandwich encased in a soggy roll, layered with smooshed tomatoes and wilted lettuce! Imagine eating that mess of a meal while looking at the horribly stained and filthy grey carpet and praying that you are hopefully at the right gate of departure. I say throw the whole airport away and start again. We, the customers, deserve a whole lot better."
18th August 2019,3,"""avoid LGA no matter""",Not Verified |  We arrived 1.5 hours before our flight. We spent 30 minutes in line to check in with United and the next 40 minutes getting through TSA. It was 4:45am on a Sunday morning. We barely made the gate before they closed it. I am not sure how an airport can operate so inefficiently. Lesson learned. It is worth an extra amount of money to avoid United at all costs and to fly JFK and avoid LGA no matter how good a deal it may be.
12th August 2019,2,"""never go to this airport again""","✅ Trip Verified |  My 18 year old son and two 17 year old friends were at Lagardia this morning over three hours before flight. The security check-in line was very long. After over 1 hour they got to the metal detectors and were told the phone or phone scanners were down and told the boys they would need to go get a paper ticket printed. They did this and of course by then the flight had departed. The airline would not help our boys and they are right now stranded in New York. We have scrambled to get them a hotel. This is shameful, and would never go to this airport again."
3rd August 2019,1,"""they were confrontational and hostile""","✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling through La Guardia, my wife is 17 weeks pregnant and both of us are serving military. Only scanners were being used at security screening, my wife and I were concerned with harm to our baby, so she tried to opt-out of the scanner to do a pat-down instead. Security staff were immediately demeaning towards her, pushed her to the side of the scanner without offering direction. I had to stand on the other side of security watching helplessly while my pregnant wife was forced to stand in the open, without shoes, for almost 10 minutes until I questioned staff on my side. Employees never gave a clear explanation, and the employee she had initially spoken to just walked off without communicating the opt-out to her co-workers. Any time I questioned staff, they were confrontational and hostile towards me. When my wife finally got a pat down the employee verbally demeaned her, chastised her for not following directions, even though directions were not given. TSA guidelines clearly state that an opt-out of scanners is not meant to punish people, but my pregnant wife was embarrassed and felt like she was being punished. Shame on the security staff for being so ignorant and unprofessional. We will never ever visit this airport again if we can help it."
31st July 2019,1,"""still continues to be the worst airport""",❎ Not Verified | La Guardia still can’t get one simple thing right. One has to wait 30mins to go from Term B to C or D. The most minimal amount of common sense would be to allow people to walk from C to B but instead you have to wait 30-40mins which means a missed flight for sure. Ridiculous and is why still continues to be the worst airport - 3rd world airport is an understatement.
11th June 2019,2,"""departure is a mess""","Not Verified |  Arrival was uneventful, but departure is a mess. Going through security, the clear company was putting 10 and 12 people at a time at the front of the line, the TSA agent had to take his word for who was clear, they had two lines going to the same bin line instead of opening up another one. No one knew if they were supposed to go through metal detector for the scanner so they were getting mad at those in the wrong line, after getting through people were grabbing the wrong bins with the security guard standing there watching and not helping another passenger who had her laptop taken. Really miss managed. Then you pay $17 at bar brace for a sandwich that is the nastiest thing you ever will eat. I'll try Newark next time."
6th June 2019,1,"""inconvenience and mismanagement""","✅ Trip Verified | My experience at La Guardia was beyond the most horrific I have ever experienced in an impoverished third world country. I have been through airport construction projects in numerous airports and none remotely approached the inconvenience and mismanagement at La Guardia. None, nowhere. Communication was nonexistent or worse, incomprehensible. I will select a few examples from this nightmare just to illustrate. We landed hours late because of weather (to be fair, no fault of the airport). It was almost midnight. We followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs until, finally, at the end of the terminal, far from the usual curbside, we at last found the taxi stand. Or so we thought. The long line waiting for taxi was actually not waiting for taxis at all, but for the bus, to take us to the taxis. Taxis were not allowed at the terminal. So we waited in torrential rain for the bus, which eventually took us to another place where we waited in the rain for a taxi. For our return, I had rented a car and had to drop it off. Unlike any other airport, there were no signs directing you to the rental car return. Fortunately or so I thought I knew my way around. I headed through a maze of construction to the place car dropoffs had been for decades . All but 2 had to move because of the construction. There were no signs or any communications informing you where to go. I asked a police officer, who kindly sent me in the wrong direction. GPS didn’t work. Finally, we found the virtually unmarked dropoff. I asked why there were no signs anywhere directing people to the new dropoffs. He responded, incredibly, that “we are not allowed to have signs off the airport”. We waited for the shuttle bus only to find out that the shuttle bus had to take us to another shuttle bus. During construction, car rental companies, who could not have signs off the airport, were not allowed to have shuttles on the airport. I know construction creates inconvenience, but the experience was a horrific nightmare not an inconvenience and I place full 100% blame on management, customer disregard, and complete incompetence in planning. As the saying goes, only in NY. “"

Rushing up to the security, a few kind New Yorkers working at security helped me ping my iPhone with my Apple Watch, called it, helped me look on the ‘find my phone’ app and even ran my bags through the closed line to see if they could see it on X-ray just to be sure. Just about then the tears starting coming, thinking I couldn’t board my plane and get home. Home sounded pretty darn good about now. All of a sudden the New York hero swoops in holding an I-phone, that suspiciously looks like mine, and proclaims “someone found an I-phone”. I took the phone, uttered a million thank yous. That didn’t seem quite enough and I hugged Mr Hero. Still overcome with gratitude, I threw my hands up in the air and shouted “ I love New Yorkers”. The security guard confirmed it “New Yorkers are really nice people”. With that, I walked away with my happy ending thanks to the heart of New York... it’s people. "
24th February 2019,1,"""This place is a nightmare""","Not Verified |  Please, please, please, when you upgrade this airport, be sure to eliminate all off the euro Cibo garbage and bring back normal restaurants and shops that everyone much prefers. Also, we all have smartphones in our hands so please also get rid of all the little used iPads cluttering up every single surface of the terminal. This place is a nightmare."
23rd January 2019,1,"""Do yourselves a favor and avoid""","Not Verified | Do yourselves a favor and avoid having to fly through LaGuardia at almost any cost. First off, I have been to much better run airport in most 3rd world countries. They have made somewhat of an attempt to ""modernize"" some terminals, but it still requires catching a shuttle from one terminal to the other, where the transfer station signage is almost as bad as the attitude and organization of the staff who are responsible for running and coordinating the shuttles. I literally missed a connection because of the inefficiency of having to go from one terminal, to the other, and I had 45min to do so. Also gates are often switched at the last minute due to staffing and scheduling issues which forces you onto the archaic shuttle system between terminals. Oh, and also while I was here, a water pipe burst at the entrance to one terminal, which facilitated the need to again bus everyone on said shuttle system to another terminal, just so they can exit the airport."
8th December 2018,1,"""incompetence and customer disregard""","✅ Trip Verified | It took 45 min from the time I entered my uber ride in the designated passenger pickup area in the parking garage to the time the car left the garage on to the streets. Even with the effects of construction, this experience/agony (and it is not the first time) is a result of incompetence and customer disregard by whoever designed this traffic organization. The traffic wardens inside the garage appear lost, disoriented and overwhelmed. I can only wish NYC mayor and the CEO of Port Authority were with me in the car to see with their own eyes what mess their incompetent lazy underlings have created with the traffic situation at the terminal as well as with car pickup protocol."
4th December 2018,1,"""excruciatingly hot""",✅ Trip Verified | I am sitting in Terminal B at Gate D6 as I write this review. It is excruciatingly hot. I mean everyone is complaining and the American Airline gate employee says nothing to be done just deal with it it the entire terminal. I love AA and write great reviews and letters about its staff all the time but this AA employee needs more training or termination. And if LaGuardia doesn’t realize that people are getting sick because of this heat then they need new facilities employees. I wish I could add a picture of the airline employees in tank tops. This is crazy. People are also sitting in the floor and standing also because of too few seats. LaGuardia please get it together.
27th November 2018,1,"""Should be shut down""",Not Verified |    Just a lost cause. Should be shut down. Can’t handle any part of travel experience. This is a place beyond redemption or repair. Can’t handle incoming flights never gates like they didnt know we where coming. Departures always delayed with no information. Place is filthy and other services are the worst. Time to make this a hotel or housing development or Parking lot. Wait it is a parking lot.
13th November 2018,1,"""Whatever happened to communication""","✅ Trip Verified | Whoever thought the iPads to order at the terminal was a good idea. For a start they were not charged. Had to wait to get served and the service was appalling. Whatever happened to communication “Have a nice day”, “can l help you sir”? It is so impersonal and takes longer to work out than it would to actually serve a person. If l ever see the iPads on a bench I will walk, no, run to where I can actually get served get a receipt and tip someone."
12th November 2018,8,"""A great convenience""","✅ Trip Verified | The terminals at La Guardia are undergoing a massive makeover - hence the immediate approaches look daunting; it is also outdated in terms of decor and available services. However, this airport, given that it serves the needs of New Yorkers travelling to points east of the Mississippi, and Canada, is extremely convenient. A short taxi ride brings you to the airport. The distance from the entrance to the gates is very, very short. Thus, you save a lot of time. From being dropped off at the entrance gate of the terminal to the TSA check area, it is less than a one minute walk - if you have your boarding pass with you. The gates are immediately thereafter. I am sure once the new terminals are constructed, the walks will be long and I will have to trudge long distances to my gate. I used Terminal B for a United flight from Gate C9. C9 is at the end of the terminal pier. So this is a very convenient, straight forward, quick terminal to use. In less than 5 minutes, including TSA inspection I was at my gate! I did not check any bags. Ample seating and quite a few electric connections to charge your phones all around. At this end, with the large glass windows, not only is the waiting areas bright, thanks to natural light streaming in, you can see flights landing and taking off. I was given TSA pre-check and going through the security inspection was a quick walk in the park. I did not have to pull out my laptop or liquids or even shed my coat or remove my footwear; I had put the phone in my bag. Food stalls after TSA are few but basic snacks and sandwiches are available. A little bit of research before coming to the airport can help travelers prepare for the services available and thus manage expectations. While the airport currently handles more traffic and passengers than it was built for, this is the airport where you can be at your gate from arriving at the terminal in just a few short minutes. A great convenience to busy, on the go New Yorkers!"
8th November 2018,1,"""airport is extremely mismanaged""
","✅ Trip Verified | La Guardia is the worst airport I have ever flown into and out of. The airport is extremely mismanaged and lacks quality customer experience. We witnessed an elderly woman who was being assisted by one airport associate drop her 3 bags at the bottom of the escalator and told that she needed to go upstairs but lacked the ability to get all of her bags up the escalator herself. She then had to flag down a police officer to ask another associate to assist her who then loaded her bags and brought them up on the elevator for her as the first associate should have done. The signs throughout the airport contradict each other offering opposite directions for where the public transportation and the uber/Lyft pick up is located. Multiple water fountains aren’t even functioning, among other things. The traffic flow is confusing and disorganized causing massive arrival and departure delays. Truly an overall disappointing and poor experience."
18th September 2018,1,"""Absolutely atrocious airport""","Not Verified | Absolutely atrocious airport. How people are able to get through TSA without wanting to stop and get into an altercation with an agent is beyond me. The rudest and most disrespectful employees I’ve ever come across in any airport; and I’ve traveled to 4 continents and 35+ countries. LaGuardia, please get your personnel in order and under control. Side note, I did meet 3 awesome employees at Hudson News, 5 Guys, and 1 security worker at Terminal B. Aside from that - nah, I will pay immensely to avoid this place at all costs moving forward."
3rd September 2018,1,"""Absolutely horrendous airport""
","Not Verified |  Absolutely horrendous airport. Poor or no options for eating, TSA closes esrly, its dirty, and very small for the airline and passenger traffic. The worst part, extremely long taxiing time and the worst air traffic control ever."
14th July 2018,10,"""such a pleasant experience""",✅ Trip Verified | I’ve read so many bad reviews on this airport and was terrified to go. But it was such a pleasant experience! The staff here were very nice compared to usual airport staff. The food court is modern and has great and healthy choices. There’s an airport link that is super convenient. I’m actually excited to fly to and from La Guardia again!
9th June 2018,1,"""unwilling to assist the passengers""","Not Verified |  The departing gate is not big enough to accommodate the passengers. It is dirty and the Spirit staff are rude, obnoxious and unwilling to assist the passengers. Mostly interested in how they could catch passengers trying to board with larger carry on bags than allowed. Instead of being trained to offer customer service, they are trained to generate extra income for Spirit Airlines. Spirit Airlines is all about the money!"
1st June 2018,1,"""dropped off at the wrong end""",✅ Trip Verified | We had to ride there from JFK and were dropped off at the wrong end of the terminal and were not guided to the disabled handicap area to catch our flight. We had asked four different people before someone finally told us and by the way that was another customer not even one of the staff members at LaGuardia. As we were going through the airport the gentleman that was taking my mothers wheelchair pushed her into an object and in to me which was absolutely unacceptable.
18th May 2018,1,"""an embarrassment to NYC""","❌ Not Verified |  This airport is an embarrassment to NYC on so many levels. Conditions are significantly worse than many/most airports in the developing world. In addition to the poor conditions, it is now necessary to take an airport bus to get a cab into the City. Ridiculous."
5th May 2018,1,"""Horrible experience""","No TSA pre check. The agent manning the check was horrible, he couldn’t figure out how to give us the paper to allow us to keep shoes on etc. Made us take out everything even though we had our paper. Separated all of our belongings into different bins after we put it in bins. I left behind my entire makeup bag as I am not used to having to remove it from my carry-on. Horrible experience and we travel a lot!"
8th March 2018,1,"""This airport is awful""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is awful. Where are the signs for long-term parking? There are no signs for long-term parking. Security was a huge wait. Arrived at airport two hours before my flight and made it with minutes to spare. It's like a horrible maze designed to make you miss your flight. I have no idea how much I'll have to pay for parking, and I parked outside with the winter storm today, I have no idea if my car will even be there when I get back."
18th February 2018,1,"""poorly staffed, disorganized""","❎ Not Verified | This airport is poorly staffed, slow, disorganized, confusing, dirty, old, and expensive. In the words of a previous review, “a total disaster”. Worst airport I’ve ever been in and  I’ve been to Kathmandu, Nepal, which more resembled a shed than an airport."
29th January 2018,1,"""food at this airport is a total scam""","❎ Not Verified |  My review is for the food at this airport. Why would an airport ever have one vendor for the entire airport. That is absolutely outrageous. There is absolutely zero competition and horrible selections for full blown gouging prices. Can you believe a food court with different places, all owned by the same company, ridiculous. $6 for a slice of pizza. $7 for a bag of candy and a drink. $12 for a small sandwich. Absolutely outrageous. This company should be completely fired and removed from this airport immediately. The food at this airport is a total scam."
29th January 2018,4,"""airport feels very old and outdated""",✅ Trip Verified | How is it possible that the Greatest City on Earth has this joke of an airport for domestic flights? The airport feels very old and outdated. Food court available only before the security. Once you pass security - there’s not much choice at all! Restrooms are not cleaned regularly. It’s time to modernize LGA - New Yorkers deserve better!
5th January 2018,1,"""the worst I have ever been to""",❎ Not Verified |  This airport is the worst I have ever been to. I have flown all over the world and have never experienced anything this bad. On top of the poor conditions the staff are rude and in no way helpful. I swore many years ago I would never use La Guardia again and after trying one more time I am comfortable never using this terrible airport again.
4th January 2018,1,"""No good facilities""","❎ Not Verified |  I have travelled many airports throughout the world. Terminal 1 in La Guardia is by far the worse! Free WiFi for 30 minutes, are you in the Stone Age? If your flight gets delayed, you do not have much to do. No good facilities to talk about. I do not think we will use this airport again."
29th December 2017,2,"""a disgrace to this thing we call airports""
","❎ Not Verified |  La Guardia is a disgrace to this thing we call airports. Advertised $4 hot dog? Useless iPads will clear that up for you! $12 for a hot dog. Over $20 for a full meal. No restaurants for people who want something quick and cheap, and even the stores that sell fast snacks had terrible selection (they don't even sell Doritos). Literally every flight was delayed: we were misinformed multiple times about the extent of our delay, about whether or not we were waiting on another aircraft to arrive or if they were going to use a different aircraft. The WiFi is ridiculously expensive, hence the urge to write a terrible review during your free complimentary 30 minutes of wifi before you are kicked off and forced to pay! But, if wasting your own hard earned money and valuable time doesn't bother you, then you'll absolutely love this airport!"
15th December 2017,1,"""This is a terrible airport""","✅ Trip Verified | What moron thought up the airport bus system to rental cars. Two transfers, miss marked buses, inaccurate directions. Biden was mistaken, LaGuardia is not a third world country, it’s a failed country. This is a terrible airport. NYC should shut it down, tear it down, and start all over."
5th December 2017,4,"""everything falling apart""","❎ Not Verified | La Guardia airport is a total zoo. When I flew back in 2014 it was a disaster, 3 years later nothing has changed. When AA took over US Airways they got Terminal C which is where the legacy US Airways routes including flights to Charlotte depart. Terminal C is awful, very small, limited food options and very little seating, the AA side of the terminal is bland while the Delta side is a lot nicer with iPads (with almost no apps) set up. Airport is very very old and very dirty and everything seems to be falling apart. Expect your flight to be delayed out of LGA flight rarely leave LaGuardia on time. Our flight ended up leaving 45 minutes late, check-in was super slow and so was security, most of the staff are completely clueless and have no idea what is going on. When arriving in LaGuardia they gave us the wrong carousel for our bags and after waiting 30 minute we finally found them at a different carousel on the other side of arrivals and the airport staff had absolutely no idea! While JFK and Newark can also have quite a bit of problems LaGuardia seems to be one of the worst, so avoid!"
2nd December 2017,1,"""extremely disappointed with my experience""","❎ Not Verified |  I have been flying 3+ times a year for the last 10 years. I'm extremely disappointed with my experience at La Guardia both the arrival and departure. When I arrived I felt as though I was boarding he subway, the smell was horrendous. When I was going through security for the departure I have never met ruder people."
3rd November 2017,6,"""food was extremely over priced""","❎ Unverified |  When I departed the airport on a Saturday morning, security lines were really short but I was hungry for breakfast so I went to a restaurant. The food was extremely over priced. $4 for toast and $5 for water. Very upsetting but the good thing was that my flight departed on time. When I got back on Monday, I had a much better experience. The moment I got to the taxi line, the dispatcher got me a taxi and I was on my way."
10th August 2017,4,"""This airport is a total disaster""","❎ Unverified |  This airport is a total disaster. They are under construction so go figure. There is a lot of traffic due to the exterior color metrication. The TSA pre-check was fast. Once in the terminal there are a few restaurants and a couple of stores. Food and beverage prices are a little high, your typical airport prices. The airport crew can be a little nasty and not helpful. They didn't allow me to start inside the terminal as my flights kept on being canceled and got stranded there for 3 days. The construction means that some areas are closed, and everything feels right."

Their Spirit flight from Chicago is arriving at least one hour late. I am told the only place to wait for arriving passengers is near baggage claim. There is a woman there, apparently doing nothing, in a kind of uniform wearing a badge reading something like ""passenger assistant"". I ask her where to find an arrivals monitor. She laughs and says: ""there are no such monitors here"". I ask where to find them elsewhere, she says ""there are only departures monitors"". I express my surprise, she keeps laughing and she says ""this is how this airport is right now"". Then I ask her to please find information about Spirit 630, she laughs again and says ""it's impossible"". Then I wander about the airport, finally spotting, on the floor above, an arrivals monitor. The arrival appears to be imminent, so I go downstairs not to miss my daughter. Of course I still don't know whether the plane has landed. The woman is still there doing nothing."
27th June 2017,8,"""through security in less than 10 minutes""","❎ Unverified | 7.30am departure on Air Canada in La Guardia Terminal B on a Monday morning could have been an anxious experience but it was shockingly smooth. We were through security in less than 10 minutes. The A gate area is small, but there was seating for all and food options available with short queues at 6.30am. There was even a tiny duty free shop open. 30min of free wifi is available and worked fine."
17th March 2017,7,"""staff friendly and helpful""","We arrived at La Guardia Airport because our flight out of JFK was cancelled and we were re-routed. Staff at the ticket counter (Delta) were courteous and helpful (at 5:00 a.m.). We were booked on a flight that didn't leave until 14 hours later, but staff suggested we go on the stand-by list, and we were in the air within an hour. The gate seating was very adequate. There were iPads to use free, and were able to charge our phone. Staff at the gate were also very friendly and helpful."
16th March 2017,1,"""extremely poorly maintained facility""","✅ Verified Review |    Our 5-hour layover at La Guardia Airport was very unpleasant. We were in the B Terminal for the entire layover. The women's restroom had only 1 stall, the wait was long, & the only sink was clogged & already half-filled with ""used"" water. We were subjected to a dirty terminal, as well as having to breathe plane fumes in what was already a stuffy & poorly ventilated waiting area/corridor. Until such time as we receive confirmed evidence that this airport has been upgraded & cleaned up, we will not be choosing flights that either arrive or depart from this extremely poorly maintained facility."
6th December 2016,1,"""nowhere to sit""",✅ Verified Review |    I arrived at La Guardia airport in American / Delta terminal and had to wait 50 minutes to meet my colleague flying in on a separate flight. There is nowhere to sit - period. When I enquired I was told by an airport employee that all seating was taken out due to the homeless population. As a traveler who has paid for a flight into NY that should not become my burden. I am saddened by the homeless population but I am a senior citizen north of 60 and to not have a place to sit seems unhealthy and unreasonable.
30th September 2016,5,"""parking buses are inconsistent and sporadic""","✅ Verified Review | I understand that the parking is difficult and you have to leave at least another hour plus. The buses are so inconsistent and sporadic at La Guardia that the system is in disarray. Upon our arrival for our first flight the bus we needed was no where to be found. Another bus radioed the correct bus and no answer. He was nice enough to bring us close to our terminal since we waited over 40 minutes. If this driver didn't help us we probably would have missed our flight. Upon our return the same senerio happened- no directions and every employee we asked hadn't a clue. We waited 40 minutes and the driver stops and talked to everyone he knows bringing the trip to retrieve our car close to a hour and 10 min. The airport should institute and educate directions to their employees and have signs for where to go. Airport staff as far as TSA, American Airlines staff and the Hudson news staff were excellent. This isn't our first time parking since construction. Once the parking issue is complete it will be seamless like prior to the construction."
28th September 2016,1,"""signage is confusing""","Just a short visit to La Guardia airport but one I will never forget. Staff are 50/50 between ok and horrible. Signage is confusing. Nice doesn't feature and helpfulness was swapped some time ago with disdain, apathy and hatred for mankind. I don't want to come through here ever again."
20th September 2016,3,"""finally getting an upgrade""","I fly American Airlines now into LaGuardia so I can use C terminal. Yes, this airport is horrible. But if you fly Delta or American you will have a great chance of getting C terminal and not the the main terminals which are run down and dirty but glad this airport is finally getting an upgrade."
18th August 2016,1,"""impossible to talk to anyone""","Worst airport I have ever been to. Flight was canceled and could not get any answers. They had 2 girls working at the information desk and almost half of the flights were canceled. Needless to say it was impossible to talk to anyone. Some people said it was the weather, which was clear, other said it was an electrical problem and still some said it was the other airports mistake. People were rude and not informative Never again.."
7th August 2016,1,"""dysfunctional, disorganized, dirty""","I have traveled through more than 30 airports worldwide over the last 35 years. La Guardia is the most dysfunctional, disorganized, dirty and disgusting airport I have ever dealt with, which unfortunately only seems to get worse with every time I am forced to travel through it due to flight or airline choice. It is so disappointing that an airport in a hub city like NY is worse than any third world airport I've been through. I cannot emphasize enough how much I loathe this airport."
28th July 2016,3,"""unorganized sloppy run facility""","Had to connect through here and after my last experience here 5 years ago I swore this never again. Spent 4 hours in line for take off to the point it got hotter through the day and we had to return to the gate, supposedly for fuel. After another thirty minutes the flight was cancelled. At this point I have to guess there were forty to fifty planes waiting to take off. It is an unorganized sloppy run facility where the employees carry an entitlement attitude vs a service attitude. I will cancel a trip rather than travel through this place again."
8th July 2016,2,"""getting to La Guardia was a nightmare""","Getting to La Guardia was a nightmare. They are doing construction and don't know how to properly divert traffic. I was flying Delta and I was pleasantly surprised to find the terminal was not bad. My prior experiences at LGA were not good. The other terminals are beyond horrible. I was expecting long lines at the security check point, but luckily they were not bad. It took less than 10 minutes to get through. The usual hassles, but not worse than other places. They herded us onto the plane and we got seated and we were all smiles when the plane left the gate on time. But that is when things got bad. We spent just under an hour waiting on line to take off. This added substantially to our travel time. Worst part is that when we flew back, the same thing happened. We landed early but ended up waiting close to an hour to get to our gate. The incompetence shown by the Port Authority of NY and NJ is incredible. I would recommend that you avoid this airport as much as possible. A week after this trip I took another out of Newark and that was a much more pleasant experience. It's hard to believe these two airports are run the by same agency."
8th April 2016,1,"""nothing short of horrible""","My experience at La Guardia was nothing short of horrible. It's nasty, disorganized, and the airport staff are rude. Expect to be met with a scowl upon your arrival, and know that any and all questions/complaints will fall on deaf ears. New York is a great city with hospitable people, but this mockery of an establishment does not reflect that greatness. I didn't have an issue with the fact that our flight was delayed five hours, but I did have a problem with the attitudes of the employees, the frustratingly slow service, and the general lack of information that is provided regarding airport procedures. I traveled from New York to Atlanta, and there is a stark difference between the two airports. La Guardia needs to figure out what Hartsfield-Jackson airport is doing right and get their act together."
1st April 2016,1,"""not enough seats""","Not enough seats at the gates, or enough bathrooms. Bathrooms had no paper towels and the soap dispensers look just like the faucets. They are not marked as soap, so most women in there were wandering around looking for soap. The most annoying aspect of this airport is the inability to pay with cash for anything. I am sure they think they are being progressive by insisting orders be placed via IPads, but it isn't progressive. It is a slap in the face for customer service. Nothing like having three employees standing around doing nothing while you have to stand there and maneuver a ridiculous amount of screens and menus to order a cup of tea. Apparently a person without a credit card is not welcome to eat or drink at la Guardia airport."
28th March 2016,2,"""really poorly organised""",La Guardia is possibly the worst airport I have experienced. The line to get through security is really poorly organised and moves at a snails pace. Once through to the other side there is very little in the way of shops of food offerings. Terrible. One toilet that I found and none of the hand dryers were working.
27th January 2016,1,"""thousands of us were stranded""","In the days following the major snowstorm on January 23/24, 2016, all United flights into Newark Airport were cancelled, including my return flight on Sunday Jan 24. The best I could do was a flight to La Guardia, arriving Monday night Jan 24 at around 10pm. Apparently I was not the only person in that situation. Apparently the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that manages the airports in NY were not prepared. So many people arrived at around the same time, many of whom really wanted to get to Newark Airport, all of whom were being picked up by friends, family, taxis or car services, that the traffic in and around the airport was so bad that the good folks at the Port Authority were overwhelmed. Their solution was to shut down every access road into the airport. Bad idea. There were literally thousands of people waiting for cars that never arrived. My driver called me asking if I can meet him in the neighborhood on the other side of the highway. Not possible with the snow, no sidewalks, a suitcase. There were no alternatives. NYC public buses that service the airport were completely full by the time they arrived at my location. The line for the first bus stop on the airport property was ridiculously long. There is no subway or other train service nearby. Thousands of us were stranded. After about an hour waiting for my car service driver to make it on the airport property he called me to meet him at the Departure level, which was empty of people and cars. Almost any other way of dealing with this would have been better than how La Guardia Airport management dealt with it. The best way would have been to utilize both departure and arrival levels for passenger pick up, splitting the traffic load to several locations, actively direct and manage vehicle flow to minimize pick up time and maximize capacity. Not to completely shut access to the airport, stranding thousands of people and creating gridlock outside the airport."
1st January 2016,3,"""worst airport in the US""","Definitely the worst airport in the US. It's way too crowded and is way beyond it's time. Check in for business class was a zoo. Security takes extremely long since the number of stations aren't enough to handle this much passengers. The gate areas are run down and look quite old. The airline lounges are slightly better but are starting to show their age. There aren't enough boarding gates and we had to be bundled up with another flight during boarding. An extremely chaotic experience, much worse than San Francisco or Denver."
18th November 2015,1,"""a disgrace to all of NY""","Ultra-long security lines and surly guards (even by US standards). Grungy concourses, lack of bars (not one single bar in concourse C), suburban mall fast food options spewing their yeasty fumes and an egregious lack of seating - this airport is beyond redemption. I cannot imagine how it doesn't embarrass the chairman of PANYNJ. It is a disgrace to all of NY."
3rd November 2015,3,"""does need a lot of upgrading""","I use LaGuardia airport for one reason only. Because it is closest to Manhattan. No good places to eat, limited seating at gates, know WiFi, and outdated and junky. No airtrain to terminals D and C which is Delta and US Airways. You have a van to pick you up to take you about 2 miles on the other side of the airport. However those guys do do a great job. This airport does need a lot of upgrading. Still my number one airport in New York City over JFK because of access."
11th October 2015,3,"""outdated and lacks consistent cleanliness""",Majority of the airport staff are here just to earn a paycheck. Several areas of the airport are outdated and lacks consistent cleanliness. There's hardly any known fast food restaurants such as McDonald's or Burger King.
30th September 2015,1,"""only has one security line open""","Flying American Airlines out of Gate D and TBA only has one security line open for all passengers going through this gate. When the gentleman behind me complained to one of the agents, the agents response was to tell the customer to complain to the government so that they could schedule more agents. I have flown out of Midway and Hobby at least 50 times each and they always have every security line open and more TSA agents and both are much smaller airports. Finally got through security only to hear and see a tsa agent tell a passenger that she could not take an item on a plane and that it wasn't her problem and that she didn't work for the airlines. I never witnessed so much neglect going through one airport in one day."
29th September 2015,1,"""very limited seating""","Absolutely the worst setup for a waiting area. I don't want to sit at a counter with (sticky) Ipads. There are a total of 5 lounge chairs at this gate and counters with high, backless chairs. Very limited seating. Epic fail."
27th September 2015,1,"""disinterested personnel""","As an American citizen, I am appalled at the condition of this airport, its inefficiencies, lack of capacity to handle passengers and their needs. I am here on 9/26/15. Long, long lines to get through security, disinterested personnel, lines (20-deep) for Women's restroom, not enough seating at gates. Plus the airport terminal itself looks like the 50's. This is shameful."
23rd August 2015,4,La Guardia Airport customer review,"Literally felt like -30 degrees in the morning and TSA had a big fan blowing right in your face making it feel ever colder in the airport! TSA line are super long. Early morning flights are the worst here - no one around for help, everything is still closed, employees and staff show horrible service and attitudes. My flights were only at 7am."
6th August 2015,2,La Guardia Airport customer review,"LGA must be one of the worst airports. Took off from Terminal C today. There is no space to move around people. There is not enough seating in the gate area. Have an early flight? Good luck finding a cup of coffee or someone to help you at the food courts or quick stop places. Employee attitudes in these locations is horrendous, discourteous and rude. The only thing going for this out of date run down airport is proximity to the city"
17th June 2015,1,La Guardia Airport customer review,"I don't know who this CIBO entity is. But, I do know if your looking forward to any recognizable name brand opportunities for food, forget it! The options were definitely pedestrian cafeteria fair at one end, and 7-11 style yogurt and cold pastries at the other. Everything looked bland and tasteless. My wife had chicken from a buffet style service that was in the middle of the concourse between C and D terminals. I mean literally in the middle, with lots of people pushing past with bags and sweaters flying. I'm not sure how it passes any kind of food sanitation inspection. The line for the burger grill was long and not moving at all. I decided to skip it all together. I wound up with a cup of coffee and a cold cinnamon bun for lunch. The D terminal gates have some nice looking booths with an iPad at each seat. But, not really functional. I broke out the Macbook and paired with my cellphone because theres no open Wifi connection that I could link to. So much space is devoted to these booths that there is very little seating. There were far more people standing than sitting and all the D gates were very crowded."
1st June 2015,n/a,La Guardia Airport customer review,Arrived and departed from the central terminal at LGA recently and was blown away by the terminal. The central terminal is simply put horrible. On arrival we followed steps that lead us to exit the airport with what looked like we were entering the NYC subway to exit the airport. On departing the security line wraps around terminal inside if one is taking a Monday morning flight at 7am. Once past security and at the gate you are again taken back to a building where the roof is leaking in many places other airlines have installed their own AC units as the ones provided in the terminal do not work. As I finish this review a terminal building is coming but we will not see it for at least four years. If one mainly flies Delta or US Airways one will fly out of new terminal buildings so this will not be an issue.
30th April 2015,3,La Guardia Airport customer review,Just about the only thing LaGuardia has going for it is its proximity to Manhattan versus other NYC-area airports and even then you are at the mercy of traffic since there is no direct rail connection. I flew into and out of the Central Terminal Building (Terminal B) which I found to be cramped and dated. With construction going on a number of vehicles live-parking at curbside and no traffic control officers to speak of it took forever for my bus to make the loop of the airport to drop me off at Terminal B. Once inside there was not enough room for passengers to queue up at ticket counters in the landside area and the queues for the security checkpoints were spilling into the main terminal. Once past security your only food and beverage options were a coffee shop and two newsstands. Then once the flight boarded and pushed back we had to wait over an hour for our turn to take off - there were 20-25 planes ahead of us on a Friday late afternoon with otherwise good weather. The only redeeming factor was the striking view of New York and its environs upon departure.
19th January 2015,5,La Guardia Airport customer review,Disorganized crowded busy. Use the airport as it is closest to family in the city. Otherwise would not recommend.
28th October 2014,10,La Guardia Airport customer review,I used to be a hater like most people but the newly redesigned Delta Terminals offer lots of comfortable and clean individual seating most with free ipads to use and plenty of outlets. The food options are great and tasty - from a salad bar and hot food bar to incredibly delicious gelato. I have traveled to 6 continents and more than 30 countries and I'd rate the new LaGuardia my favorite airport terminal or perhaps second only to Seoul South Korea.
13th October 2014,2,La Guardia Airport customer review,La Guardia manages to combine all the disadvantages of a large airport with the amenities of a tiny airport. From entry to embarkation or from disembarkation to exit it is a thoroughly unpleasant place to be. In our experience last week check-in (JetBlue at terminal B) was swift and efficient but that's the only positive part of the experience. Security was slow even though the line itself seemed manageable and amenities post-security were practically non-existent and the bathrooms not particularly clean. On our return our exit involved a half hour wait for a cab (though JFK can be worse on this count). I've been to many airports in the developing world in particular in Africa but have encountered few that are as unpleasant as La Guardia.
19th September 2014,4,La Guardia Airport customer review,"Unintentionally retro decor as in ""we haven't updated since the 70's"" and that includes repairs. This sets the tone for your entire New York experience of dilapidation on a grand scale. The Security experience however was fast and far less hostile than JFK and there are plenty of places to recharge. Since I am a budgeting hound there's not much choice of airport when you locate a nice cheap airfare (sites like skyscanner or skypicker for this) but this is the least awful airport for those going in and out of NYC. The area is not good and its better to get a park and fly so your car will have the hotel security rather than leave your car at the airport. The wifi is pay-only and if there are any flights cancelled you will wish you were in hell instead of here. Forget trying to get here on the subway although you can take the buses. Taxis are plentiful and easy to get. So to sum up if nothing goes wrong and all the planets are just right you won't mind La Guardia too much."
27th July 2014,6,La Guardia Airport customer review,Using LGA is like a trip back to the Seventies in some respects right down to the historic American and United Airlines logos still visible on building exteriors. The Air Canada United and JetBlue gates in Terminal B appear to have changed little since the Nixon presidency aside from the signage and the absence of smoking. Plastic coverings on the ceilings presumably due to leaks also suggest a facility badly in need of repair. Food and time-passing options in Terminal B are limited to three small food outlets a convenience store and a duty-free shop for Canada-bound passengers Wi-Fi is pay-to-use only. On the positive side security screening took only a few minutes at midday and I was at the gate within 60 minutes of leaving my Midtown hotel room. Recommended conditionally as the best of a bad lot for those staying in Manhattan.
20th June 2014,n/a,La Guardia Airport customer review,This airport is simply shocking and a real embarrassment to NYC and America. Describing it as a third-world airport would be an understatement. Facilities and decor are outdated and very limited. I frequently travel in and out on Air Canada and the 4 departure gates assigned to this airline is in an area that offers very limited seating is stuffy and overcrowded. The experience one must endure to transit through this airport completely negates the convenience it offers due to its proximity to Manhattan. Security queues are ridiculous and being barked at by agents during the process is degrading. It is time NY Port Authority took a long hard look at this seriously sub-standard establishment.
29th November 2013,7,La Guardia Airport customer review,We flew from La Guardia to Denver. We were on an early flight 7am so took a 4 am taxi from our hotel near Penn Station. The airport looks like it hasn't been decorated since the late 1960s it's like being in a time warp! A lot of the eating establishments were not open as we were there so early but one did open up so we could grab a coffee. Check in was easy but we were there very early so I'm not sure what it's like during the day.
22nd October 2013,8,La Guardia Airport customer review,Only arrived through here so can't talk much about it but had a good experience. Employees seemed friendly. Terminal seemed clean and thorough. They also had electrical outlets all over the place which is very convenient. No complaints. Getting a taxi out front was fairly painless although the attendant got frustrated when I knew the address of my hotel but wasn't sure if that was in Queens or not.
1st September 2013,3,La Guardia Airport customer review,What an experience flying into this airport. Yes it's close to Manhattan and there are numerous flights to places all around the nation but the facilities are just horrendous. I arrived on an American Eagle flight with a bus gate. The gate area was noisy and chaotic as one would expect. When we got to the terminal we entered a beat up door and walked up 2 flights of stairs to the terminal. Inside the place is cramped dirty and claustrophobic. Perhaps if I had used a proper gate my review would be better.
12th May 2013,7,La Guardia Airport customer review,I used LaGuardia as my arrival-only airport last month and am so happy with the decision. No it does not have free wifi and some of the other up-to-the-minute amenities of competing airports of its size but it is positioned in an ideal location for those staying in Manhattan. With its relatively small size and its frequent bus service I was in my Manhattan accommodation within 50 minutes of my plane touching down and that is after catching a bus and the subway. (The bus stop is literally just outside the door of baggage claim.) I did not find baggage claim to be any more chaotic than my last trip to McCarran-Las Vegas and I did not encounter any real facility uncleanliness either. In light of many of the negative LaGuardia reviews on here I know I am being rebellious in recommending it as an airport. I am not a perfect passenger nor do I expect any airline or airport to be completely flawless either. I would definitely use it again.
2nd April 2013,2,La Guardia Airport customer review,We used this airport for the first time to take an American eagle flight from New York to Toronto. We didn't have a choice of airport as our company arranged the flights for us. As we arrived at the airport we noticed how old looking and how rusty it looked. Upon entering the entrance for AA it was apparent that this airport is not maintained. Check in with AA was typical. Left our checked luggage at the X-ray station and decided to go through security check point into the AA terminal C. Line was long like most US airports. Now walking into the AA terminal was utterly disgusting. The floors and walls were dirty. The carpets in the seating area should have been ripped out years ago. The men's bathrooms were something to be desired. The duty free and choices of food and drinks are nothing to be desired as well.
6th March 2013,2,La Guardia Airport customer review,Flown in and out of LGA domestically. Used terminal B (the main terminal) when both arriving in and departing out of LGA. Absolutely limited space with insufficient seating let alone totally miserable number and variety of shops with limited things to buy yet with high prices. Even walking to the baggage claim without bumping into other people is a challenge. No free wifi and only a few power ports can't even be a major concern in this airport as so many other things are just miserable. Total chaos continues landside where signage is insufficient and no one seems welcoming. Public transportation limited and reliable systems like rail links non-existent. Bus services seem to be there but with no information posted anywhere. Departure also a total pain. Passed check-in as web check-in was already done but security check took 15 minutes even at 6am. Then on to the same concourse with appalling state of amenities for passengers. Apparently sleeping is the best thing to do in this airport but good luck finding a spot to do so. Probably one of the worst airports ever been to. Cannot be an airport in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. But then as JFK and EWR are not much better.
8th April 2012,5,La Guardia Airport customer review,There are separate security lines for the separate concourses so if your connection is in a different concourse you must exit one secure area and pass through security for the other concourse. If you are lucky this adds 15 min to your time to get to the other gate. If you are unlucky adds an hour or more. Bottom line: if you have a connection in La Guardia - good luck! Even if you do not have a connection the line is longer than necessary because of travellers making connections. Why would this obvious design flaw persist when it guarantees continuing expense crowding and delays?
20th August 2011,1,La Guardia Airport customer review,Total chaos at the ticketing counters security lines take forever and once pass security the place is dirty. No food stalls and once a few flights cancel the place becomes a mad zoo. There is nowhere to sit people are sleeping on the floor and the carpets are dirty. I would never recommend anyone to travel via LGA.
6th July 2011,2,La Guardia Airport customer review,This is about the Delta Terminal. This airport needs to get on the ball. If you have a layover here it is horrible. There is no room for everyone and the food is overpriced. There are no plugs and you have to pay for wi-fi. The bathrooms aren't clean and there is not enough seating areas in the airport.
3rd July 2011,4,La Guardia Airport customer review,I'm a New Yorker and I've always preferred JFK since it's accessible via the AirTrain and it's closer to our house. I had to fly last minute and Delta my carrier of choice didn't have any JFK flights available so LGA was the only choice as EWR would be way too far. I arrived at Terminal D at 5AM and the lines on the check-in area were insane! I had already printed my boarding pass at home and had no check-in luggage so I wasn't worried. There were numerous self check-in kiosks and the queue to security was rather short. The agents were friendly and it took less than 5 mins. The gate area was rather cozy far better than DL's JFK Terminals. There were decent amount of shops and restaurants. I returned the same day with US at 8PM the US Terminal was far better. The departure gates looked more cozier and it was cleaner. My only complaint is that it's not accessible by public transportation although numerous buses go to LGA it takes forever to get to the subway stations! It would be nice if the AirTrain comes to LGA. Overall a good experience.
18th May 2011,2,La Guardia Airport customer review,In anD out of LGA May 2011. Coming in no problems baggage claim was fine no problems. Only complaint is the place is really dirty. On the way out had the worst check in experience ever. Arrived at 4:30 am for a 6 am flight. Thought it would be plenty of time due to the early hour. Wrong. The place was slammed. There were people everywhere. Every check in had only two agents and the electronic check in was down to help slow the whole thing up. Once that was over security was a nightmare. The agents were rude. It started to inspire the people to start fighting back and the whole scene became more and more unpleasant. This is a small airport which could be much better with smoother planning and cleanliness.
28th September 2010,4,La Guardia Airport customer review,I appreciate Delta's effort to spruce up the restaurant offerings at LaGuardia but I am not pleased with the changes. Taking Starbucks out was a huge mistake as it was very popular with fliers and did outstanding business. The new coffee option is virtually unknown and it was nearly empty all three times I passed through there in recent weeks (no more pre-flight frappuccinos!). I never dined at Nathan's or Chili's Too while they were there before but they seemed to draw decent crowds. In their place are expensive sit-down options ($32 steak frites anyone? Or maybe $26 duck confit?) In addition there is an endless wall of grab'n'go snacks as well as numerous kiosks - all selling the same grab'n'go snacks. One company--Cibo Express--runs everything. Each dining option is called A Taste of ______ (Prime Grill World Bean etc.) and they all require you to form one single line to pay (aside from a couple of the kiosks that have their own checkouts). While the grab'n'go stuff is spread out all throughout the terminal what you have is 10 locations offering the same products. The fancy dining choices may appeal to the business traveler but I just can't imagine that an average family of four is going to sit down for a $150 meal before their flight to Orlando. If you want to have one or two high-priced places at least balance them out with a mid-range option and a couple of places that people have actually heard of. The bookstores remain and thankfully they are not owned by Cibo Express at least for now.
26th August 2010,5,La Guardia Airport customer review,Arrived at 22.30 on a Wednesday night with Air Canada. Airport was simple and bags were out fast. Taxi service was great. Return on a monday morning. Taxi from Manhattan was fast no traffic. Check in fast and terminal was quiet. Security was only 2 lanes but they moved it quickly and staff were actually quite pleasant. The airside area was busy because of 2 delayed flights. Bathrooms were clean. Overall its nothing special but it's used well.
26th August 2010,3,La Guardia Airport customer review,New Terminal D concessions are pretty bad. They just switched over this past weekend. In place of Nathan's famous hot dogs there is grab and go. In place of the Fox Sky Box restaurant with all the TVs is some french cuisine place that is overpriced. In place of Chili's another very popular and safe choice is some other very high end restaurant that again is overpriced. Forget dining for fun on the run and grabbing a reasonably priced burger chicken or salad. Now you have salmon and steak as your choices. That is the most screwed up decision I have ever seen in airport retail. Starbucks before security - gone. Starbucks after security - gone. In place is some other new coffee that will not attract all the same traffic other than the fact that it is the only coffee joint there. And finally there are so many bags of chips and grab and go items everywhere that it literally looks like a supermarket. There are only restrooms in Terminal D before security on the baggage claim level. The airport apparently lets the cabbies come in and use that single restroom and it is literally a cesspool.
2nd June 2010,2,La Guardia Airport customer review,Most chaotic check-in experience ever. I was travelling from New York to Minneapolis and thankfully we arrived early as getting through that mess took time. Overcrowding led to the passengers having to make their own check-in queues. The staff were unfriendly and uninterested in properly organizing this mess. Getting through security was hopeless as well and I had to walk through the security scanner and then be manually searched by some clearly annoyed security staff because apparently holding your ticket in your hand while walking through was forbidden. To be fair it's a decent airport once you get past the mess that is check-in and security. A fairly nice design on the terminal and quite a few shops to look around in as well as enough places to sit down whether to eat or just relax. But seriously the La Guardia entrance and check-in system needs and overhaul: from my experience it was disastrous.
16th February 2010,3,La Guardia Airport customer review,A nice little regional airport close to home. If you are flying early in the morning you most likely won't experience any delays. If it's after mid day there will always be a delay at LGA. There are not enough seats at the gates and you may get restless and loud at time. Check in at home and you won't experience much difficulty.
28th December 2009,3,La Guardia Airport customer review,Check-in and security are mostly pretty efficient (I've flown Northwest Air Canada and Midwest in the last year so two terminals and three different gate areas) but as noted there's not much in the way of concessions especially once you're through security. Do expect delays especially later in the day: more flights are scheduled in and out of New York than actually fit especially if there's any kind of weather or other problem (Air Canad will not let you book a flight online into or out of LGA JFK or EWR without showing a warning that there are likely to be delays due to weather and New York air traffic control). Not a big deal if you're doing a nonstop but worth keeping in mind if you're going to be making a connection. Getting into Manhattan by mass transit works okay but if you're not a local or have a lot of luggage it's probably worth your while to pay for a cab or airport bus to midtown.
5th December 2009,4,La Guardia Airport customer review,In and out from Washington. The wait for our begs on arrival was very quick we got off the plane and the bags were waiting on the baggage belt. On our departure we arrived with over 2 hours to spare before our flight we had checked in on-line and there was no queue for the bag drop we were through security in minutes. There was a lack of choice of shops / restaurants through security but it was not a surprise bearing in mind it is a regional airport. occupied.
22nd December 2021,2,"""rude, obnoxious and angry at Passengers""","✅ Trip Verified | TSA was extremely rude, obnoxious and angry at Passengers. They order people around and throw their personal items like they are Nazi's at a Concentration Camp. This ""Agency"" should be disbanded. They are a useless waste of my hard earned money that I pay to these rude morons to do nothing but harass citizens."
9th November 2021,1,"""Where do these people come from""","✅ Trip Verified |  The TSA Agents were absolutely awful and down right ugly. There is absolutely no reason to treat any person they way the lady treated my son and I at the initial check in. She was wearing ""2"" masks and I could not hear a word she said and my 17 year old son could not understand a word she said either. We are not frequent travelers and this was our fist time at this airport and the lady should have been fired. She was ugly to every person I heard her dealing with. She yelled at all the line telling us there was a ""glare"" in her little box so we need to stand in a certain spot so she could see our face. Just wrong all the way around and customer service was zero, then we go to the line where you take off your shoes and go through that machine. Where do these people come from. I cannot believe TSA thinks it is fine to speak to people the way they do. It is down right awful."
15th October 2021,1,"""the worst airport I have been in and I travel weekly""","Not Verified |  This is without a doubt the worst airport I have been in and I travel weekly. There is nothing here but chairs (with no outlets to charge electronics), seating is located next to security so it is noisy with bins and alarms, no lounges or restaurants just a fast food grab and go thing (Delta gates). People are crammed in like sardines in a can. This place is very old and has not been updated in decades from the look of it. If you have an option to fly into somewhere (anywhere) else you should take it!"
12th August 2021,1,"""bad for use of Economy Parking Lot""","✅ Trip Verified |  I understand MCI is undergoing construction but this airport has always been bad for use of Economy Parking Lot. Too few buses and one driver in particular is very rude. I refused to ride with her this morning, and she kept antagonizing me like she wanted to pick a fight. I waited 5 minutes for next bus and had a very pleasant ride. I have seen this bus driver act this way before so the airport must tolerate her behavior. This is just how Kansas City is, I guess."
21st June 2021,1,"""Terrible place""","Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible place. They have signs for social distancing but pile people on top of each other. No soap, paper towels or functioning water faucet in the Ladies room. Filthy seats, nothing wiped down, food and garbage in seats. No maintenance people around and the airline ticket counter agents could care less. I will pay more to avoid a layover here next time. City of Kansas City you owe everyone who travels through here a big amends if we don't fall prey to the coronavirus here. Terrible place. Try to avoid especially if you have kids."
9th January 2021,1,"""an embarrassment to the entire city""","Not Verified |  This airport is an embarrassment to the entire city. Inadequate equipment, incompetent staff, visually a joke. Worst airport I've seen in all my travels."
5th June 2020,4,"""needs major improvement""","Not Verified |  Flown through MCI multiple times, airport was dark and dingy, all the shops and restaurants were on the wrong side of security and the staff are rude. Overall needs major improvement."
11th March 2020,1,"""horrible depressing place"" ","✅ Trip Verified | Filthy, nasty carpet, dirty, dark, drab building with unclear confusing signs that will lead you to where you don't want to go. Tattered seats. Small tight dirty bathrooms that can only accommodate 4 women at a time. I refused to eat here despite being hungry due to the filth. Seriously who designed and maintains this horrible depressing place? I hope to never fly through here again. They need to tear the whole airport down and start over again."
20th February 2020,1,"""worst airport for a layover""","✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airport for a layover in a developed country! Where to start with a list of what's wrong? First, instead of having access to the entire terminal building as all other airports, travelers are crammed into about 6 gate areas and you cannot leave it without going through security again to get back in. That means you are stuck with limited services unless you want to go through the TSA line again. And what great services are available! Small one-holer bathrooms with 1970s designs that are dirty and smell, too few to accommodate everyone which causes long lines even in the mensroom. Restaurants that close at 7PM when my connecting flight does not depart until 8:25pm. Not enough chairs for everyone to sit. Ancient airline displays with plastic cards vs. modern terminals. I've been to third world countries with airports that are much better! I'll never layover here on a trip again. Southwest, you should be both ashamed & embarrassed that you call this airport a hub! I'll fly other airlines instead of flying through KC. You've lost my business."
29th December 2019,1,"""this was my worst airport experience""","Not Verified |  The staff at this airport made the decision to not honor passengers with TSA precheck during a very busy holiday weekend. There was no communication indicating this was happening so we got into a very long security line with little time to spare. Then the TSA agent scanned and took both my luggage and backpack aside for an internal inspection of all contents. All of my luggage contents were removed then shoved back into my bags without any findings. Approximately 75% of all passenger bags were inspected without any findings. The security line was so confusing with bags being removed and belongings being removed that people were walking away and leaving their personal belongings at security. In a span of 5 minutes, 3 different TSA agents brought over laptops to the gate agent that people left behind. I also walked away without my laptop then quickly returned to retrieve it. The TSA agents were also very rude and not doing anything to resolve the long lines or chaotic situation! Once we got through the gate I was shocked to see how absolutely dirty the gate areas were, with trash on the ground everywhere and overflowing trash cans! We’ve traveled to this airport for many years and I’ve traveled to many airports in and outside of the US and this was my worst airport experience and I will never return."
10th December 2019,1,"""a poor reflection of her position""","✅ Trip Verified | I have always had pleasant experiences with the Kansas City airport until I was leaving the airport in my Uber. My Uber driver was cussed out by an older woman who was airport security with quite explicit language for trying to merge into the exiting lane. There were no signs and she was not directing traffic, but rather sitting in her car blocking the lane we were in. No biggie, due to us needing to scoot over into the left exiting lane. Just as we were merging, she jumped out of her car and began to profusely scream and swear, demanding we stop. She proceeded to allow every other car pass us and then walked to the back of my Uber drivers car to take his license. She did not come to the car nor give a ticket, so I am not quite sure why the explosive language and looking at the license plate. Her level of professionalism was pitiful and completely uncalled for. It was a poor reflection of her position. The rest of the experience at the Kansas City airport was super friendly and pleasant, as usual. My rating is solely based off of the explosive security woman. I reccomend this airport, but strongly believe someone should address the exiting lanes with class and clarity."
3rd December 2019,1,"""Staff are rude""","Not Verified | Staff are rude, car rental staff are even worse, no help loading our baby or luggage from shuttle to airport, and forced to cross dangerous roads in the process. One disgusting, uncleaned restroom for the women serving no less than 8 gates and a restaurant. They can't tear this place down fast enough. Flying into Tulsa from now on."
15th August 2019,1,"""Worst airport ever""",Not Verified | Worst airport ever. You are dropped out by ticketing then ensues an hour plus of hell. You check in then walk what feels like a mile to security entrance then retrace your steps inside secured area for another mile to get to the gate to find out you are trapped with no restrooms or amenities. Everyone waiting was moaning about the setup.
24th June 2019,1,"""This place should be demolished""",Not Verified |  This place should be demolished at the earliest opportunity. Kansas City should be embarrassed to have this representing the city. All of the awful things people have said on this site about this Airport are true. I have a two hour layover here and I am counting the minutes until I can get out of this wretched place.
2nd February 2019,2,"""Absolutely horrible experience""","Not Verified |  I am in a lot of airports and always find Kansas City security to be rude, disrespectful, humiliating. They will paw through your personal belongings and dump them all over the counter. Absolutely horrible experience."
17th December 2018,1,"""This is the peak of stupidity""","Not Verified |  Arrival was no big deal. I left this morning. Walked through security. Was randomly selected as usual, then once allowed through I discovered that the gates don't connect. So I had to leave, go through security once again, where I was randomly selected, once again, the ladies ahead of me had to deal with the same thing and were annoyed. The workers there couldn't answer any of the questions they or anyone else had. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the day before, and the part that made me furious is that they threw out my toothpaste saying it wasn't allowed since they don't let you take in liquids over a certain amount, but one of the gate TSA people let a pilot carrying four cups of Starbucks coffee through the security door without hesitation. This is the peak of stupidity. All this about how they're making things safe for us when everyone knows the TSA is staffed by people who wouldn't make it at McDonalds."
17th December 2018,1,"""Dark, dismal, no conveniences""","Not Verified |  What an embarrassment to Kansas City. Dark, dismal, no conveniences. The old state pen in Jefferson City is more inviting. Kansas City is a beautiful city with plenty to offer, but this gulag of an airport sure doesn’t reflect that. Step up your game, MCI."
13th July 2018,1,"""Bathrooms are filthy""","Not Verified |  The grossest airport I’ve ever been to. Bathrooms are filthy, food selection is poor, there’s probably half as much seating as there needs to be. I wanted to hold my breath the whole time I was there. I would legitimately consider routing my travel to a different airport next time. Additionally, upon my arrival, they could not locate my bag. Not necessarily MCI’s fault, but could have been handled better."
20th June 2018,1,"""an absolutely wretched airport""",✅ Trip Verified | This is an absolutely wretched airport. Design is a nightmare. Food is worse than the convention center downtown - and that’s saying something. I ordered breakfast and it was honestly a pre-made/pre-cooked plastic-tray goopy mess. Bathrooms are wholly inadequate — and poorly serviced. Pre-packaged food in gate waiting area picked over and poor quality. Gate areas sardine-can crowded. I remember being in NYC’s Port Authority bus terminal in the late 1970s — this was worse. The city is lovely. The airport is a deterrent to wanting to ever come back to the city.
21st May 2018,1,"""worst airport for a lay-over""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst airport for a lay-over I've ever been in! Limited bathroom facilities, dirty, small area to wait, a necessary trip outside of security if you want to look for gifts or food beyond a Pizza Hut and kiosks. An upstairs eatery and bar with no restrooms. I'll never layover here on a trip again. I'll change my destination before I'd go through this airport again. I've been to 3rd world and developing countries' airports with cleaner more available facilities!"
20th May 2018,1,"""home town airport is disgraceful""","❌ Not Verified |  My home town airport is disgraceful! My first complaint is that my family member and I were separated going through security. As of last Dec. 2017, they now send TSA Pre to a totally different gate for security check. Huh? When I asked one of the agents to explain, he was nasty and said it was easier for employees. I mentioned I didn’t like it. Oddly enough a few minutes later I was patted down for my Apple Watch and a nylon zipper on my pant leg pocket. What? I’ve worn the same pants through security before-no issues. My son was not patted down for his Apple Watch. The bathrooms at the gates are terrible. No soap or paper towels-gross. MCI-do something!"
1st January 2018,3,"""basic customer service ignored""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived 2 hrs early in frigid temps with a carry on. People checking bags at SW lined up outside! After killing time for 30 min I happily moved to a side line so Seattle passengers only would get routed through the slow security check. It feels good to cooperate. Finally 30 min later Seattle customers done and all in line are feeling good. Our line was split in 2 and those who had been waiting the longest were in the TSA pre check, which I paid to have too. Then I watched as not only was our line ignored as the pre check, but also as the customers who had been waiting in line the longest. The agent who had asked us all to move aside, suddenly was making no eye contact and didn't say a word to the agents checking our tickets. I'm tired of being polite and helpful and then basic customer service ignored. People in line longest are next customer served."
21st November 2017,1,"""need to carry out huge changes""","❎ Not Verified |  I am surprised this airport has one star. Not sure where to start, small, get full even with a small number of passengers. It smells and the worst part is? There is only one bathroom in the entire 50s gates area, don't know which line is longer, the TSA security or the bathroom lines. Officials need to carry out huge changes to this airport. Look at the picture I added for bathroom line."
9th October 2017,1,"""Long overdue for replacement""","✅ Verified Review |  Long overdue for replacement. If you have carry-on only, you can skip the long lines at the ticket counter in hopes of getting into the security line sooner. TSA Pre only recently became an option for AA travelers, and the newly renovated gate area for AA now links all their gates, but it still suffers the same problems that Southwest’s gate area in B does - lack of seating, no clear and direct paths between gates, sparse charging ports (and finding one that actually works is even harder). Food options airside are minimal and horribly overpriced, usually consisting of day-old factory made sandwiches, wilted salads, and $8 bottles of juice."
17th July 2017,1,"""the worst major airport in America""","✅ Verified Review | If you like having zero options for food (or paying $10 for a cold and stale sandwich), having to go through security to use the bathroom, and being in extremely close proximity to people going through security checks as you connect to your next flight, Kansas City Airport is the place for you. This is easily the worst major airport I've ever been to. There are only two restaurants, and both somehow seemed like 1 and 1A for the title of ""Saddest Place on Earth"". When your best food option is a microwaved sandwich from Starbucks, you know you're in a whole new level of suck. Also, for some odd reason, half of the airport is walled off and is inaccessible to the general populous. Why? Good question. This isn't Westeros. I have heard from locals that the airport provides easy in and out access, which could possibly be true. But the fact that this place hasn't been updated since the 70's is incredible, and the shocking lack of restaurants and cleanly bathrooms make Kansas City International seem like the worst major airport in America."
22nd June 2017,3,"""gate seating area is inadequate""","✅ Verified Review |  I'm sitting in the B gates area now waiting out a 3 hour weather delay. The women's restroom for all B gates only has 3 stalls. There was no soap, paper towels, or toilet paper. Southwest has put in charging stations, but the actual airport offers few, if any. To get to nicer food or restroom options, be prepared to leave security and be re screened in order to get to your flight. The gate seating area is inadequate for a full flight of passengers. Be prepared to camp out on the floor."
21st May 2017,1,"""transfer procedure totally outdated and unacceptable""","✅ Verified Review | I arrived American Eagle terminal C at Kansas City Airport, and had a departure connection with Alaska Airlines (SkyWest) terminal B. I had to exit the airport, take a shuttle bus and go back through TSA security. The airport was crowded and very confusing. I travel a minimum of 4 times a year and at age 77 I am quite capable of getting around with ease and understand directions. All airport employees, bus drivers, and airline agents were very friendly and helpful in a difficult situation as I had a short connection time. Once I arrived at terminal B, I immediately went to the Alaska Airline customer counter. The agent printed up a new boarding pass with TSA pre-check printed and marked with yellow highlighter. The agent then escorted myself and several others to the TSA check point, and explained to the TSA agent that the plane was in boarding process. The TSA check line was backed up. The agent explained they were not equipped for TSA Precheck and we would go through the routine boarding process. I followed instructions removing my CPAP machine from the original case, before placing it on the screening belt. Removed my shoes, and proceeded through the screen machine. I set it off and explained I was wearing suspenders, I was told to go back, another agent came up saw my suspenders, and politely explained to her co-worker I was wearing suspenders. I was told to go back through the screen machine, of course I set it off again. After lifting my shirt and showing the agent once again the suspenders the agent said put your shirt down (I was wearing a t-shirt under the suspenders) so no skin was showing. Another agent than began the long process of explaining the pat down all the while the plane was boarding. The agent commenced with the pat down process. His pat down was humiliating. Once I boarded the plane several passangers remarked ""they sure gave you tough time"". The work load on TSA would be greatly reduced if MCI Airport could make it so it is not necessary to go through security when changing terminals from one airline to another. The current transfer procedure is totally outdated and unacceptable."
14th May 2017,2,"""departure gates are crowded and noisy""","✅ Verified Review |  This airport reminded me of other woefully inadequate facilities like LaGuardia. The circular terminal building was never meant to have the secure area splitting the length of the entire concourse. Travelers in transit have to exit the sterile area for the larger bathrooms and better food choices. The departure gates are crowded and noisy. This place is awful, and I'll avoid connections here in the future."
13th March 2017,3,"""my hometown airport has deteriorated""",✅ Verified Review |  I am a Kansas City resident who travels frequently for my job so am very familiar with other airports around the country. I am appalled at how far my hometown airport has deteriorated. The bathrooms are despicable! Filthy and in disrepair every single time I travel which is 2 to 3 times per month. The food choices are sparse and extremely expensive as compared to other airports. It's time KC woke up and does something about the airport.
1st March 2017,1,"""this place is awful""","✅ Verified Review |  This place is awful. I feel as though I am in a cattle yard. Having to go through security just to use the restroom is ridiculous. Talk about deterring people from flying. 1 bathroom ""inside"" the wall to service passengers is bogus. I will never fly through this aiport again. Avoid this place, even if it means paying more for a non-stop ticket. Lesson learned."
3rd December 2016,1,"""a terrible place to get stuck""","Kansas City is easily the worst major airport I have seen. What a disgrace. Uncomfortable, poorly lit, horrible food options (a little snack vendor once clear of TSA). Just a terrible place to get stuck waiting for an hour or so."
29th November 2016,1,"""poor lighting, poor food option, depressing""","Very poor design. I got maneuvered out of the gates area and had to go through security again. Poor lighting, poor food option, depressing. The food was outrageously expensive. I saw a woman try to buy a sandwich for $10.00, she was so shocked she returned it."
29th September 2016,1,"""crowded, with inadequate, old seating""","We could hardly believe how awkward and confusing it was to arrive and transfer to another plane. We almost mistakenly left the secure area as we disembarked. The airport was crowded, with inadequate, old seating. The one bathroom available in terminal B had too long of a line. What a choice:. Do we use the bathroom or miss our flight? Very little food was available. We will avoid this airport in the future!"
26th September 2016,4,"""little after the security""","✅ Verified Review |  There is some debate around this airport. There is TSA prechecked, other reviews said none, at the Delta gates for 56-60 and there was a longer queue there than I have seen at any other airport. There is very little after the security except a bottle of water less than a liter for more than $5 and I could not find any water fountain. Small and narrow in a rainbow shape. Even the check in for Sky priority was slower than everyone else."
21st August 2016,4,"""an airport we will avoid""","Kansas City airport is stuck in the 70's. There is no flow to it. Restaurants are few and far between. There is a security checkpoint every 5-6 gates, so no long lines, but if you need to change planes here, you likely will have to leave the secure area and go through security again. There is no place to connect laptops, phones, etc. They do not have TSA pre-check, so you have to take out your electronics and liquids. Actually, they don't have TSA, they use a private company that dresses almost identically to TSA, except for the badging. The security person who checked our identification was very rude. For us, this is an airport we will avoid, We had our choice of KC, Omaha or Des Moines for this trip, and chose KC because it was less expensive. Next time, we will pay more and avoid KC airport."
6th July 2016,1,"""I'm ashamed of this airport""","I am from Kansas City and I'm ashamed of this airport. It hasn't changed since it was designed in the 70s. The terminals are corridors with too few seats, charging stations, bathrooms and food and shopping options. I have to make sure my phone has a full charge before I arrive. I hate having to spend anytime in the airport when I come home. As the first impression visitors get of Kansas City, the tourist board and Better Buisness Bureau and Governing bodies of Kansas City need to wake up."
4th July 2016,2,"""ambience sorely lacking""","I love Kansas City and have family there so fly in and out frequently, often combining the visit with trips to other cities. When will it get an upgrade? 1) When making a connection at MCI it is necessary to exit security go into the main airport and then re-enter security (unless you depart from the same gate as arrival). Once in my seat and settled, items from my 3oz liquids bag (lotions, lipcreams and other toiletries) are removed, water bottle is filled, and generally I know that even when there is a connection I can disembark, zoom over to my next flight without repacking and not worry about going through security again. 2) No TSA precheck available at any security entry. 3) Have visited every restaurant. Food selection is pretty miserable everywhere. Try finding a restaurant that has a salad with green lettuce - not iceberg - lettuce or any vegetables. Or anything that isn't fried. AC settings keep you frigid. Ambience sorely lacking. Service friendly and efficient. MCI is an international airport. Uncertain how efficient arrivals in that area are."
24th June 2016,2,"""deserve much better""","Of all the major hubs, this is the worst. No TSA Pre, inadequate cramped waiting and seating. Obvious they don't want to improve or expand. Tiny airports around the country are nicer than this. Too bad for the nice people who live and work here. They deserve much better."
14th June 2016,3,"""ugly, and tired""","Kansas City. The only thing good about this airport is you can get in and out very fast. Security lines are usually quick and if you don't check in any luggage, you can go from your seat to the curb in 3 minutes, which is un-heard of anywhere else for an airport this size. I will say though the staff here are always kind, professional, and helpful. This includes, security, airline staff, to the custodians. That's where all of the good stops. If you have a layover here, you will want to drink yourself to oblivion. But here's the catch, no alcohol in the terminal area unless you leave the secure area, and then re-enter the secure area by enduring a wait through the security line. Which depending on the day can mean 3 minutes, or an hour+. Food options in the terminal are pathetic. There are food kiosks that charge the most expensive prices on food and water I have ever seen in the U.S. Since you have no options, they know you are trapped. And as a result, you have to pay $4 to $5 for a bottle of water. Don't try to use a restroom after you go through security. Use the restrooms before going through security. You may not be able to relieve yourself in time if you try to use the one stall within the security area. The airport itself appears to be a fallout shelter with glass all around. It's ugly, and tired. The terrazzo floors are cool looking (if you are into that sort of thing) however the carpeting areas and seats look and feel tired. This airport is vintage and in need of a re-do."
27th April 2016,1,"""has nothing to offer travellers""","The Kansas City International Airport is one of the worst airports I've been to in recent years. It has nothing to offer travelers. There are almost no food options once you arrive for your departing flight. If you happen to fly after 8pm there is absolutely nothing open. No vending, no magazines, no fast food is open or close. The staff at the counter told us we were too early with our bags to check and to come back 1 hour before the flight takes off. Her reason was she didn't want to get our luggage on the wrong flight. Isn't that what tags are for? We came back and stood in line for 20 min and almost missed checked bags. There were people who needed help with damaged bags and found no other place to get help than the check in line! We then had to get our bags tagged then carry them over to a scanner to have them checked. Once you go through security you are corralled in a small area with one vendor. They have water, soda, and sometimes cold food items. There is one bathroom once in this area and no space to walk around. This area is also the exit for arriving planes. The people arriving can't even figure out how to get out of there. Overall Kansas City International Airport was a terrible experience. I will be driving to St Louis next time I want to fly anywhere."
13th April 2016,1,"""no charging for electric devices""","Beware - if you are flying through Kansas City you may have to change terminals. You have to leave one terminal, catch a bus, and go through security in the the next terminal. If you bought any duty free liquids or gifts in the secure area of your departure airport, they will be confiscated. There is no means to ship anything home if you can't check the items. Once in the secure area of your gate, there is only an over-priced snack stand and no charging stations for electric devices. This is the worst airport I have had the misfortune of passing through."
8th April 2016,1,"""signage is scarce""","I fly through airports across the country every week so where do I start in my views of Kansas City Airport? This airport would be better suited to serving a small town with one gate and two departures a day rather than a major U.S. city. If you have to encounter KCI, hope that it is a flight stop and you don't have to leave the plane. Signage is scarce as are bathrooms. The airport is dirty, mouldy and smelly. Places to eat and shop are almost non-existent so a layover is unpleasant. Seating in the gate areas is cramped and often you feel ""boxed"" into small rooms. To get from gate to gate you often walk through seating in the gates. The worst part is the people working at the airport whether they work at a ticket counter, restaurant, TSA security, or a gate they range from lazy, rude or indifferent. I understand that this airport is a pre 9/11 design and that creates space issues. However, there is no excuse for filthy, dirty, and smelly facilities, poor and inadequate signage, bad lighting, and rude, lazy and indifferent people. Avoid this airport if possible. It is by far the worst airport in the country."
21st February 2016,2,"""all of the issues remain""","Just to validate the indifference of whoever runs this airport, in 2016 all of the issues remain as, once you cross security, you can't buy a book and you are pretty much locked into a dark, dank crowded mass of humanity with the main men's bathroom having one stall and the further indignation of the cleaning crew closing it on a Friday night at 5pm to clean. They just don't care here and companies thinking of locating should consider that as I stare at the ceiling at lights either so dirty they don't illuminate anything. This place is awful and just to ""enhance"" the experience, the wifi is terrible too."
24th January 2016,9,"""fantastically quick security lines""","I was marooned in Kansas City for 7.5 hours recently. The delays were due to east coast weather and a mechanical issue. Frustrating, but something that just happens in my line of work. Here are my thoughts: MCI is a unique design that works if folks are willing to keep an open mind. This airport is clearly a pre 9/11 design because all of the terminals are within sight of the curb. That is the gift and the curse. First, the curse. Instead of having 1 security line per terminal like a modern terminal, they have a security line for every 4-6 gates. This is a gift (see below) but also a curse because it means that the food/drink/shopping options have to be spread out, especially the ones beyond security. Stated another way, there ain't a whole lot to do once you get past security, or even before security for that matter. The gift part was watching the locals get dropped off and walk 1 minute to the ticketing or baggage drop off, the fantastically quick security lines were comical compared to some airports, and the curb to traveler ratio was fantastic for those trying to catch a shuttle, cab, etc. At the end of the day, being marooned sucks. No amount of shopping, restaurants, or gimmicks is going to change that. You're somewhere you didn't plan on being instead of where you planned on being. You could give me 5 star dining at a 3 star price and I'd still wish I was home."
31st October 2015,1,"""process seemed very primitive""","Flew into Kansas City Airport on Southwest Airlines from LAX. I really love the views of lush green countryside as you land into Kansas City. The signs for going to Baggage Claim weren't very good. We struggled to figure out how to get there. Then we asked a security personnel, who opened a door for us (the kind that would ordinarily sound an emergency alarm). The baggage claim area is one of the smallest I have seen of any airport in US. While checking in for our return flight, the airline associate tagged our bags, gave our boarding passes, and then asked us to take our bags to another area for screening. This process seemed very primitive. We were also given a very hard time at this airport during security screening. Since we were travelling with a baby, we had baby food, milk etc, and the TSA person asked us to open sealed bottle. We refused, since once the Pediasure bottle is opened, it must be consumed. So, we had to go through a very thorough pat-down for TSA's peace of mind. I have flown through Kansas City twice, and the security at this airport make it a challenging experience for families travelling with little kids."
21st October 2015,1,"""the worst airport experience I've had""","I've traveled extensively since 1978 and this is the worst airport experience I've had by far. Please someone bring this place into the 21st century or at the very least the post 9-11era. I admit I am spoiled by the Indianapolis airport, but airline travel should be much better than this. No aisles? No bathrooms in the restaurants? A BBQ Mecca deserves much better."
24th August 2015,3,Kansas City Airport customer review,"Shockingly long wait for immigration - over 2.5 hours. Landed at 6.20 pm and did not get through until after 9 pm. This is similar to what others have reported from their recent travel. The lines for Japanese citizens were much shorter. I have never seen lines like this at Narita (or really, anywhere else). The airport is otherwise pleasant and efficient (no problems on departure), but the immigration delays are really beyond the pale."
1st August 2015,6,Kansas City Airport customer review,"Departing from gate 83 in terminal C. Airport is small and quiet. TSA line was short, although they do not have a precheck lane and still have to remove electronics from bags. Once past TSA you feel like a captive with about 3 hidden power outlets shared between 5 gates. Only one small kiosk for snacks and drinks. Nowhere to work on a laptop. Not a good place to be stuck with a delay."
25th July 2015,1,Kansas City Airport customer review,"Dirtiest and most crowded airport I have been in in a long time. Changed planes at Southwest terminal. Hurried off plane to find a long line out the bathroom door. Walked all the way to other end of terminal to find another bathroom. There was a line there as well, but it was shorter. Terminal smelt mouldy and mustey. Carpet was soiled and patchy. I cannot believe that KC politicians and business leaders stand for this. Business travellers know what a dump this place is."
9th March 2015,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,Worst airport I have been in for a while. We travel often especially in the last year. I understand TSA needs to keep us safe but the people at this airport are lazy. At the beginning of the line there should have been a sign telling us what to do and everyone in that line should follow the same rules. I have not had to take my shoes off in any airport in the last year. No sign indicated shoes or boots needed to be removed. The people in front of me and behind me were allowed to wear their shoes. I have a Cpac. I have not been asked for years to take it out of the bag. Sometimes they ask me to open the bag which I am happy to do. I was traveling holding a five month old and my daughter with her three year. They decide I have to take the Cpac out while trying to hold the baby right when I get to the x-ray machine so I have to get another tub. Then he decides I and my daughter must take off our boots holding the baby. Not at the beginning of the line where the tubs are but right at the x-ray machine. I go through the machine and now he wants to test my fingers and makes me hold onto to the baby. The agents are all around talking among themselves and it takes several minutes to get someone over to test my hands while holding the baby! In addition we found a ladies purse and were kind enough to try to turn it in and security made us walk all over the place trying to give it to someone. It would have been easier to leave it where it was and I don't understand security would not take it from us. Lastly there is no place for a mother to nurse her baby in private. My daughter needed to nurse her baby and had to wait to exit the airport to do so.
7th August 2014,2,Kansas City Airport customer review,I travel for my job and KCI has to be one of the worst airports I have been through. Directional signage throughout the airport is difficult to find and not clear. When I departed my plane upon arriving in Kansas City I was unable to find my way out of the gate area. There was no sign directing me where to go. When arriving at the airport at the end of my trip the security signs directed passengers to choose the right or left line; however the agent was partial to taking people from the right line rather than alternating lines. The gate areas have very little seating unless you want to walk and sit at another gate. The corridors in the entire airport are narrow and make it difficult to move around as you are always in someone's way. The bathrooms are lacking all around and they are filthy. There is a very slim selection of food options so the lines are extremely long and the staff rude. I saw unattended bags in the seating area at the gate while three men who appeared to be TSA agents stood about 10 feet away. I will avoid flying through this airport.
6th July 2014,2,Kansas City Airport customer review,This airport needs to be refurbished all around. I'm handicapped and in a wheelchair. I had to use the restroom. I was traveling by myself. They have no way for disabled people to first even get the door open then when you get in there the stall is not big enough to get the wheelchair in the stall. It was not fun and ended up taking me three times the length of time it should of. In this day and age with Ada regulations this airport should not even be open. The skycap who got me through the airport with my wheelchair was rude and nasty. If you are that kind of person get a different job and stop working with the public.
3rd July 2014,5,Kansas City Airport customer review,There are good things and bad things about the set up of this airport. The biggest plus is the small size which makes it easy to get to where you need to go without having to walk through long sections of stores restaurants lounges etc. However that's because they don't have those amenities except for a couple so if you are a seasoned traveler who expects those you're out of luck. There isn't any real connection to public transportation here (only buses in KC) so you have to take a taxi use a shuttle to your hotel or pay to park in the lot and take a shuttle to and from the lot to the airport. The bathrooms are generally clean and not busy. The waiting areas are small but I've never seen it too crowded either. Security is right there at the waiting area so there's little walking you need to do between entering the airport and getting to your gate. The airline availability here is not ideal but it's adequate to get by. Basically if you aren't expecting to spend much time at the airport it can be quite nice to breeze in run through security and sit down ready to board your flight. If you are used to the amenities of bigger airports expect to be disappointed. Although there is talk of a huge billion dollar plus expansion to be done at the airport but that all depends on whether the people here want their tax dollars to pay for it and so far the attitude has not been positive.
23rd June 2014,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,"This is the single worst American airport I have ever in 19 years of business travel flown in and out of. Seriously such major hubs as Kalamazoo Grand Rapids MI and Columbus OH have far more amenities than this run- down place. To have to walk outside to get to a bus stop to ride 10 minutes to rental car lot reminds me of Harare Zimbabwe. The rental car building is a gleaming beacon of modernity compared to ""Terminal B"". Whatever airport authority and elected reps have a hand in the place are really doing a major metro area a shameful disservice."
16th June 2014,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,MCI is a throwback to the mid-20th century in the worst possible way. No thought has been given to the comfort and convenience of passengers. If future plans force me to visit K.C. I plan to fly into St. Louis and drive across Missouri.
10th February 2014,5,Kansas City Airport customer review,Kansas City MCI has the unfortunate distinction of being built as a 'next generation' airport in the early 1970's. Back then travelers hopped out of a car and walked to straight to the gate in 50 steps or less. Times have changed. We now have security to deal with and MCI is not equipped to deal with the new realities. Once you clear security you are trapped in a very confined crowded low ceiling bad ventilation waiting area with almost non existent food or drink choices. I've seen bus waiting rooms with more amenities. The Airport authority is truly in a bind. What do they do? Re-design the airport and spend $ they do not have? It is an unfortunate position for all concerned.
28th January 2014,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,Worst airport for security lines. No TSA pre-check. No priority access. 30 plus minutes to get through security on consecutive Monday mornings. Upgrades can't come fast enough.
13th October 2013,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,Lines were very long. There was not enough staff to help people. Poor signage throughout check in areas. Disorganized lines. Every time a first-class passenger arrived in their line they were ushered in front of a whole line of people who had been waiting 40 minutes or more. Very elitist behavior. Staff were obviously told to do this. This also occurred at the security line as well where first-class passengers arrived and immediately were ushered in front of everyone else. Unacceptable. Very poor set up once past security. There is nothing to do and very little in the way of food and very small restrooms.
24th September 2013,2,Kansas City Airport customer review,Dumpy airport for such a large city. Easy to get bags easy check in easy security. Literally almost nothing in the airport old pretty dingy but only place to fly into KC.
26th June 2013,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,First and hopefully last time I use this airport. It is the worst airport I've ever been at. Essentially once you clear security you are corralled in an area of five gates. If you leave the area you have to go back through security. If the airport isn't busy maybe not a problem but if flights get backed up watch out. There are very few food choices and exactly one lavatory each for men and women-with the line out the door for both men and women. Avoid this place if at all possible.
26th May 2013,2,Kansas City Airport customer review,Not enough restroom stalls in the secure area near the gates. Long lines for the women's room and dirty facility.
22nd April 2012,4,Kansas City Airport customer review,This airport is very pre-9/11. There are no food options past security other than a small food kiosk. I have heard a plan to build a new terminal. It is not very busy and flights are spaced out. I would have to not recommend the airport but there is no other option to travel to KC.
6th March 2012,3,Kansas City Airport customer review,The airport lacks enough restrooms. Passengers have to leave terminals to get food and come back in through security and wait in line to get rechecked. The airport need to be remodelled to give passengers comforts that other airports have.
8th August 2009,3,Kansas City Airport customer review,Used Kansas City as a base for a quick vacation - flew in on Continental out on Air Canada and had a return flight on Southwest in between. MCI is terrific for arrivals as the unique design allows one to be off the plane and on the street quicker than a small town airfield. Rental cars are centralized but shuttles are frequent and the rental car building is bright and pleasant. On the other hand it is an pain to get from one terminal to another (give yourself at least 20 minutes). There are slim pickings at the gate and if you are on an early morning flight (ie 06:20) don't expect the cafe in the secure area to have coffee... Long story short: I have been to worse and I have been to better.
17th May 2009,5,Kansas City Airport customer review,KCI is my home airport and for short trips I can park in short term parking and literally walk across the street and be thru security and at my gate in 5-10 mins after shutting my car door! The security points at each gate save time; no trains to ride or fighting several hundred other people at central security points People are friendly and helpful.
7th April 2009,1,Kansas City Airport customer review,While probably a good airport for passengers flying into or out of the area it is one of the worse for passengers making connections. I nearly missed making a connection because of the need to be rescreened even though the gates were in the same terminal and only four gates apart. The airport's archaic design requires separate screening when going from one gate to another unless they are literally next to each other. Accessing the restaurants also requires rescreening. To make matters worse they have a private firm doing the screening that is much less efficient than TSA. I'll never book another flight that requires connecting in Kansas City!
4th March 2009,3,Kansas City Airport customer review,On the plus side for a 6.00am departure on AA it was 16 minutes from leaving a nearby hotel and we were through security. This airport has incredibly short walks for arriving and departing passengers. On the negative side although there was a Starbucks outside of security (how convenient for arrivals or airport employees) the little bar kiosk was not open at 5.00am so there was no place to buy a coffee or water or doughnut after security. I couldn't even find a drinking fountain. As long as all you want to do is board a plane this airport is great. If you have time to kill it's a hassle.
5th September 2007,3,Kansas City Airport customer review,KCI seems to be a nice airport if you are not connecting though it. If you are connecting through it you may have to go through security again and that means you will have to get rid of that water bottle. Only one small bathroom per gate area with each gate area having 5 gates. Food choice in gate areas is just bad with Wolfgang Puck. Not worth the price.
30th June 2006,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,True for connecting passengers MCI is not the best place to fly. but if it is your destination or departing point by far the best airport in the USA (this is out of the 30+ airports I flown in or out of) I hate feeling rushed when I am close to missing a plane every airport makes me feel like that. When I land at KCI (and I have no luggage checked) it is so awesome to walk off the plane into your car - like you just stopped at the local gas station.
21st January 2006,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,I don't think David has been to KCI (known by locals) in a while. Restrooms are located within the gates. You don't have to go through security again to use a restroom.
2nd January 2006,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,MCI was designed in a pre-security era. The terminals are semi- circular with each group of 4-5 gates having its own security checkpoint. All of the shops restaurants and restrooms are outside the secured area. If Kansas City is your destination terrific. If it is your connection you'll loathe it. Per previous comments Kansas City's TSA staff might be the biggest buffoons of the lot. The last time I flew through there those jokers made me throw away a just-opened 20 oz. bottle of soda because they couldn't run it through the x-ray machine without a cap.
28th August 2005,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,Thoughtful comments here - they capture what's good and bad about the airport. In short if you begin or end your trip in KC it's probably the single best airport in the country. Curbside to gate in 25 feet - an amazing and efficient design. However this is accomplished by every gate area being in it's own sterile security area just off curbside which poses the aforementioned headache for connecting passengers. KC for whatever reasons has never been good as a hub for airlines (recall back to Braniff 1 and 2 Eastern US Airways and the lowly and now defunct Vanguard Airlines) so most likely you're just an origin/destination passenger. The renovation has made it more up-to-date better services and better aesthestic design. It still suffers from no services even restrooms in the gate areas though. Security can be odd - I was once told that I could wear my tennis shoes through the detector but then pulled aside for complete pat-down because I did wear my tennis shoes (by the same guy who told me I could wear them an then pulled me aside for the same reason)- where's the logic? Good airport nevertheless.
28th June 2005,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,I had a connecting flight in Kansas City yesterday from St. Louis. This was the first time I had been to MCI and was not aware of the layout and ended up outside of the secure area. The security lady was not very nice in the way she explained the situation. We went back through security (with a child) and then realized that all bathrooms and food were located outside the secure area. We changed the baby diaper in full view of other passengers sitting around and when everyone got on the plane there was a long line to use the restroom. This is the most ridiculous airport layout I have ever seen. Additionally there were birds flying around in the airport unsecure and secure areas. This is not too sanitary.
23rd November 2004,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,Kansas City International is an example of an airport that has the passenger in mind. This airport is the easiest to navigate out of any major airport in the country. With the recent renovations now done passengers will be greeted to a more friendly atmosphere and amenities that we have come to expect. The airport has virtually no wait times at security checkpoints and the drive to the gate feature is still truly remarkable. You can be dropped at the curb and be about 30 feet from your gate area. This is something that other airports fail to do. The biggest downside (to many) is the lack of amenities beyond security checkpoints. In most gate holding areas there are no restaurants gift shops and restrooms. To use any of these you must exit the sterile area and go through security once again after visiting them. This makes most passengers connecting at this airport angry. However the city has announced that restrooms will be built in the gate holding areas apparently this is the biggest complaint they have seen in recent years. To tell the truth I prefer the gift shops and restaurants outside the sterile area. Those living in KC have come to expect the lowest airfares in the nation. To have these inside the gate areas would create the opportunity for a airline to create a hub here and drive prices northward. This is why this airport is truly remarkable. It continues to attempt to discourage hubs and drive prices down with low-fare airlines offerings. Kansas City 's mix currently suits its passengers tremendously and one that should be quickly adopted at other major airports.
29th August 2004,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,"I like the relatively cheap fares in and out of MCI and I am used to the inconveniences of the airport's layout. I actually think they've done a great job with the airport despite the fact that it wasn't designed with today's security and amenities in mind. I must complain about one thing however. MCI is one of the few airports allowed to keep its private security screening force after the TSA took over most everywhere else. While these folks do a great job in keeping us safe they could do better in communicating with passengers. Case in point: I wear a pair of slip-on loafers whenever I fly which is at least 25 trips per year. In every other airport in the world I can keep my shoes on through the security checkpoint. At some places they have asked me if my shoes have been through before and since they don't set off the magnetometer I'm fine. At MCI they never ask me to remove my shoes but they always take me out and do the spread-eagle search on me. In the past they have never told me why I'm singled out for individual screening but on my last trip (4th this year) they told me that ""my shoes fit a profile"" for additional checks. ""Can I just take off my shoes and send them through the X-Ray?"" I asked very politely. And with rather brusque treatment I was made to undergo an embarrassing search that involved unbuckling of my belt unbuttoning of my pants untucking of my shirt removal of my shoes etc. And for the fourth time this year the ordeal is capped off with the scanning of my wallet through the x-ray machine which after scanning is left for anyone to swipe while I undergo this extensive search. I know we have to be safe post-9/11 and I'm all for enhanced security procedures. But why is MCI the only airport in the world where I go through this? And why have they never just told me to take my shoes off before walking through security? I think the private security staff at MCI needs a refresher course in courtesy. And adopting screening procedures more consistent with those at other airports would help a lot too."
27th June 2004,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,Minimal walk from gate to baggage curb to ticket counter for most airlines seems to be a couple hundred feet at most.. The close-in parking garage is ideal for late runners with just a short walk across the street to the counters making Kansas City one of the easiest airports I have ever encountered. Recent terminal renewal has provided more concessions a brighter appearance and everyone that works in the airport seems to be helpful with none of that LGA attitude. On the down side all gates are inside their own sterile area and a trip to the bathroom means having to leave the sterile area to be rescreened. Fortunately most airlines screening lines are quick moving.
23rd May 2004,n/a,Kansas City Airport customer review,This month I flew from Baltimore to Salt Lake City on Southwest with a stop in Kansas City. MCI needs to be updated - you have to go through security at each set of gates because MCI was designed so that you can drive right up to the gate. This is inconvenient for passengers like me who were connecting and there's no concessions or restrooms when you get to the gates which can be quite a bummer especially if your flight is delayed after you get to the gate. Also the lighting was dim and the terminal looked old and I wasn't impressed with the variety of concessions. If a new redesigned terminal were built MCI would be a great place for an airline hub as it's within 2-3 flying hours of anywhere in the continental U.S.
8th November 2021,3,"""the proper social distancing is not happening""",Not Verified |  The problem here is that there are several people who are not wearing masks. There is no security at the 'check in' level and the proper social distancing is not happening either. This is a setup for an outbreak to happen anytime. Its like people don't even believe there is a pandemic going on. What do they believe is happening I wonder and why isn't there someone to enforce the mask rule. My wife is in the 'vulnerable group'as she has just gone through Cancer treatments recently and there is nothing we can do about this.
24th July 2021,1,"""Idiotic food and beverage staffing management""","Not Verified |  Idiotic food and beverage staffing management. Covid excuses: One poor overworked worker responsible for managing a full bar plus long line of customers for Grobbel's sandwiches. Poor woman at Grobbel's isn’t allowed to take orders so has to wait for the overworked one to get to her customers before she makes their sandwiches. Separately, the Starbucks in Terminal B has a rude closed sign with no info on alternatives. Probably 400 customers a day are confused and misdirected, and their irritation is invisible to you. Clean it up."
12th June 2021,2,"""This airport was extremely disappointing""","Not Verified |  We had a four hour layover here (added by the airline after reservations were made). This airport was extremely disappointing. Very few places open. In the 5-6 hours we spent here (delays!), I never went in a clean bathroom, never saw anybody cleaning anything. I tried to use some hand sanitizer. It was empty! Our gate was changed several times. Nobody told us anything to keep us apprised. They just sent us a text. If your phone was still in airplane mode, that would do no good. Right now, we are still waiting to board. Nobody is even at the counter and we are supposed to depart in 13 minutes. We've already been delayed 5 times."
10th June 2020,10,"""it is seamless, clean, and very efficient""","Not Verified |  This airport is amazing. I was connecting from a very small airport from a regional flight. I step off the plane in concourse b. I then go through the underground tunnel to connect to Paris CDG. I take the tram and stop at chick-fil-a. The tram is very nice and quiet with lots of room. I stop at the skyclub and it is one of the best I've ever seen. You can walk, take moving walkways, or the tram. The airport is very efficient from connections with seats for everyone. If you want to shop there are stores there too. The McNamara is the only terminal I've been in and that will be the only terminal I will use. If I have the option to connect through here, then I will go for it, because it is seamless, clean, and very efficient."
11th December 2019,1,"""no apology, no comment, no eye contact""","✅ Trip Verified | Purchased 2 products from The Wall Street Journal across from A19, one expired. Took it back to bring it to their attention. However the clerk merely threw away the expired one and found one on the rack not expired and left the remaining expired products to be sold. I asked if he was going to pull expired products, however I received no apology, no comment, no eye contact. As to how expensive products are (Price gouging) for us that travel routinely this is despicable behavior. I will be contacting the FTA to start the investigation process."
12th October 2019,10,"""a very nice airport""","Not Verified |  This is a very nice airport. It is clean, modern and there are of plenty of places to eat and shop. If you are lucky you might see the famous water fountain. Even the seats in the gates are comfortable, a rarity for an airport. I will be happy to fly there again, even if for a layover."
2nd October 2019,4,"""a middling airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit is a marginal airport with oddly assorted amenities. Shopping and dining opportunities abound, but travelers aren't typically there for the high-end options. Airports exist to connect travelers to their flights, with an offering of convenient quick-stop amenities for a bite to eat and a beverage of your choice. DTW appears to have been laid out with good intentions, with features like the quick elevated tram and plentiful people movers. Nonetheless, the airport lacks adequate quick-stop amenities that the hurried traveler depends upon. Furthermore, those amenities shut their doors/kiosks well before the final flights have delivered the last weary travelers, leaving them with no option for a snack or drink (other than vending machine). The hiring practices at the airport, particularly the TSA agents and ticket counter personnel, are also marginal. These folks seem to think that being surly is part of their job description. There are exceptions to this blanket statement, of course, and those gems are truly valued. Also, the curbside baggage handlers and Skycaps are typically quite friendly and courteous. (Of course, those gentlemen are often tipped for handling bags.) The security lines are often long, but the floors and facility itself are clean. It looks good. Once through security, it is easy to get to your terminal. Overall, a middling airport."
22nd September 2019,2,"""shortage of wheelchair assistants""","Not Verified |  I was flying to Amsterdam and I requested wheelchair assistance. I was told to sit close to the check-in counter and they will come. I waited for half an hour and decided to slowly and with difficulty walk towards the wheelchair assistance counter. When I got there with my daughter, we saw several customers screaming at the lady at the counter. They have been waiting for so long and nobody came to push them. Many were frustrated. Some decided to limp the whole way to the gate as they did not want to miss their flights. When I got to the counter the lady at the counter had my name already and there were so many passengers ahead of me, all waiting in frustration and anxiety. My flight was 6.15 pm and by the time we got a person to push me through, it was 5.30 pm. I barely made it to the plane after the security check. With this delay, I did not have time to stop for restroom or buy some food before the flight. I would say collectively in 2 locations my wait time was 1 hour just for the wheelchair service. And it was 1 hour only because 3 passengers ahead of me decided to limp to their gates and remembering my trip to Texas in July it was the same problem. There was not enough wheelchair assistance to push people who have difficulty walking or unable to walk. Worried that I may miss my flight with my daughter who was flying with me to Texas in July, pushed me as we had our own wheelchair. But this trip, I am on my own and I am depended on assistance. Why is there an acute shortage of wheelchair assistants? Looks like it was not an issue yesterday only. The anxiety caused to these people who are helpless and also I wonder how many people missed their flights and how many planes waited longer than they should for them."
12th April 2019,10,"""a very pleasant experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Very friendly employees. Arriving with a rental car and a quick bus transfer at the terminal, terminal very clean with clear and easy signage, security check took a few minutes with very friendly employees - they have the time to chat with the travellers a few sentences, after security check there are some fast food restaurants and enough seats to take a rest, a very pleasant experience"
11th April 2019,2,"""a big thumbs-down""","✅ Trip Verified |  Hey DTW, I know it's hard to believe, but there are airplane flights that take place after 9PM. So arriving at the North Terminal as flights are delayed until 11PM, yet every single restaurant and bar in the North Terminal closes at 9 does not make for happy travelers. That plus the lack of places to charge one's phone equals a big thumbs-down."
27th December 2018,8,"""not hard to be parent/child friendly""","Not Verified |  My 2.5 year old son and I flew from Detroit to Greenville 12/25/2018 with Delta airline. I knew going in that DTW would be even busier with it being Christmas. When I got inside, the check-in kiosk for Delta did not recognize any of my information. This occurred in Greenville when I flew to Detroit on 12/21/18. I stood in a very long line for 30 minutes before reaching the check-in agent. The check-in agent could not help me at all and said I needed to go stand in ""a special line."" So, I go and I stand in another line, this time for maybe 15 minutes. Remember, I have a toddler, a car seat, and a carry on bag I am trying to handle by myself. This special check-in employee was able to check me in. Apparently because I had a minor flying with me, that is why the kiosk would not allow me to check-in. Then I was told that while they could check the car seat for free under Delta policy, I would need to walk to the other side of the Delta check-in terminal and place it with the oversized luggage. Now I had to walk across the terminal to drop the car seat off and then walk all the way back to the other side I started at in order to go through security. Again, remember that I am one adult trying to manage a car seat, a toddler, and a carry-on bag. I finally get back to the other side of the check-in terminal and to domestic security check. Thankfully we were able to get through security rather quickly. Then you have one TSA agent who was literally having almost every bag in his line be checked. I had a back pack and a carry-on that needed to be checked, which means additional wait time because only one person was there going through items. I know TSA has to do their jobs, but this agent was flagging almost every bag going through (I watched him with the bags before and after ours). Yes, I had toys from Christmas morning we were trying to get home to SC. I have flown in and out of Detroit numerous times to visit my family in MI. I have never experienced such frustration and utter anger with Detroit as I did yesterday. Dtw is not made for parents who are flying solo with a child, plain and simple. There are no courtesy strollers or luggage carriers with a child seat attached. When I expressed my frustration to a Delta agent about being a solo parent trying to fly with a minor and being told to wait and then walk all over the airport, all I got was backlash about how everyone has to do it. It is not hard to be parent/child friendly."
24th November 2018,4,"""I really like this airport.""","✅ Trip Verified |  Overall I really like this airport. Easy to get to and easy to navigate. However, I am traveling today and at the security checkpoint I encountered two especially nasty workers. One woman was taking the boarding passes and DL’s. She mumbled something and I was next in line. So I asked if I should come to her. She rolled her eyes and repeated “next in line” with a sarcastic tone. Why so nasty? I did nothing offense. The next worker was another woman telling people to take shoes off and stay with your belongings until they go on the conveyor to be x-rayed. She apparently was tired of saying take your shoes off, so she mumbled (loud enough for everyone to hear) “I am apparently just talking to myself”. While these incidents may not seem like a big deal, they do reflect on the airport and set the tone for people’s trips. If you don’t like your job find another."
21st August 2018,8,"""plenty of restaurants""","✅ Trip Verified | It's a very modern airport that is ready for possible extensions. The tram in the McNamara terminal makes it very easy to move in the terminal. The airport is very spacious, enough seating and plenty of restaurants and shops. There is also free WiFi that works well."
24th June 2018,1,"""overpriced shopping mall""","Not Verified | Airport or overpriced shopping mall? I travel quite frequently for work and Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) is one of the most ridiculous places I transit. This airport seems to consider itself some sort of luxury shopping experience instead of a place to board or change airplanes. Walking through the airport you will notice large selection of expensive name brand stores and high priced restaurants. You will also notice a sever lack of quick and useful concessions. I can't speak for all travelers, but I myself rarely have time during my 1 hour connection time to have a nice sit down dinner at PF Changs and then do some browsing at Swarovski Crystal. What I do have time for is to stop at a food concession that will have my order ready in a reasonable amount of time and maybe for a nice cup of coffee. Neither of these is a possibility at DTW. The severe lack of of basic food/beverage concessions is appalling. Any concession that would be considered ""quick"" is never quick in DTW. The biggest reason is because of the lack of options the lines at the ""quick"" places is often out the door and these places are generally understaffed. On example is the Starbucks located in the A terminal. There are 2 Starbucks for 76 gates, each staffed with 2 under motivated individuals. I have seen lines with over 20 people in them while not surprisingly the Hugo Boss store next door is completely empty. Detroit Airport needs to figure out its true purpose. The purpose of an airport is to provide paying passengers the opportunity to get a bite to eat and a coffee while attempting to make a connection that has most likely been reduced because of weather or some other reason. It is not to sell MAC cosmetics and running gear."
8th May 2018,1,"""No help for the handicapped""","❌ Not Verified |  No help for the handicapped at this airport. The disaster started with a 40 minute wait for my arriving plane to get a gate for us to debark. In 60 years of flying, in airports all over the country, I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my plane to get a gate. Then finding that my connecting flight was in another building and I would ""just have to go downstairs, through the tunnel and upstairs to the other gates,"" the gate clerk scoffed at me when I said that would take 40 minutes with my arthritic knees. He didn't offer transportation, I had to ask for it. Apparently there are no golf carts or trolleys for the mobility disabled at the airport, as there are in every other airport I've visited. He ordered a wheelchair, which took 20 minutes to arrive. In spite of everyone's assurances that I would make it, the plane left without me when I was only a gate and a half away. No one ever attempted to contact the departing gate to let them know that a crippled passenger was trying desperately to get there on time. Other than the wheelchairs, which are slow and take an inexcusable amount of time to arrive, this airport makes no attempt to accommodate mobility handicapped persons. There were no electric carts traveling the length of the interminably long tunnel between C and A terminals, and none that I could see at gate level either. Again, something I've seen in all but the smallest airports. This is not a place a mobility disabled person would want to travel through."
20th April 2018,1,"""most dysfunctional airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  This is the most dysfunctional airport I have ever seen. I was just there to change planes. It is extremely time-consuming and difficult to navigate the 3 huge far-flung terminals with poor signage and no explanation of how to get from one to the other. I had to ask staff along the way or I would have wandered endlessly. I actually had to go through security a 2nd time that was located *inside a hotel* at the airport because the regular security was not operating. They also seem to have a rule against scanning luggage. My suitcase was *lost for 5 days* with no record of it ever being scanned by either airline I flew, so I thought it was lost at the point of origin. It was finally located at the *wrong airline* in Detroit (why they sat on it for 5 days, I'll never understand). It took a dozen phone calls and literally hours on hold to get the bag located and sent to a 4th airport (because I was no longer in the city where it was supposed to go.) There was one helpful woman at Detroit who tried and did help me, finally. If it weren't for her my bag would still be a mystery. Delta denied all responsibility but was required to reimburse my out-of-pocket expenses (my daughters having to buy changes of clothing.)"
10th March 2018,2,"""Avoid this airport at all costs""",❎ Not Verified |    Detroit airport is by far the worst airport I have ever been to. Not only are none of the flights on time but the gate for your flight will change at least once and flights are delayed by 1 or 2 hours. Avoid this airport at all costs. This is not an airport you want to experience.
23rd February 2018,9,"""DTW is a grand airport""","✅ Trip Verified | DTW is the unparalleled airport success of the Midwest. The McNamara Terminal is beautiful and architecturally stunning and always clean. There are multiple TSA queues, allowing for quick terminal access, even on international departures. Food options are really strong here (any airport with a Chick-Fil-A is worthy of an award), and as far as I could tell, the shopping options were solid. Gate seating is plentiful, and DTW is a grand airport."

The bathrooms are filthy and in disrepair. Soap dispensers are often empty as well as paper towel dispensers. Toilets, well lets say you should use the facilities on the airplane rather than rely on the airport facilities. The ongoing lack of regular maintenance and general condition of this airport has been a problem since this terminal was constructed. Whoever the airport has contracted with to provide cleaning services is not doing their job."
26th July 2016,2,"""annoyed at my questions""","Missed my connecting flight due to the worst international arrivals system I have ever experienced. The attendants I asked for basic information looked bored and annoyed at my questions, took a long time doing everything. Even trying to walk by them in the hall was an extra chore, I said ""please excuse me"" to an attendant as I rushed past her in a tight space, and heard her yell, ""just be patient"". I saw them snapping at other international travellers who were not accustomed to American airports and didn't understand why they kept being redirected to different lines. Many people around me also had connecting flights to make and their concerns were continually dismissed. The kiosks for reviewing passports in detail were massively understaffed, for about fifteen minutes there was one clerk servicing three different lines. And when I finally got to my terminal and found out I had missed my flight, the woman running the desk sent me to the wrong area to get a new flight, and refused to answer my questions when I asked for clarification about where to go and what to do. I fly between the US and UK frequently and this was the absolute worst customer service treatment I have experienced. The only positive experience I had was with the waitresses in the restaurant I stopped at during my extended layover, an absolute day-and-night difference in attitude, helpfulness, and general commitment to helping people have the easiest travel possible."
4th June 2016,8,"""one of the better airports""","Detroit is one of the better airports I have experienced in the United States. The McNamara terminal is clean and well maintained. TSA wait times can vary greatly depending on time of day. Once inside, concourse A is roughly a mile long from end to end, with many shops and restaurants to check out. They actually have good food inside the terminal, such as Longhorn Steakhouse, although prices may be slightly higher than at the same restaurant outside of the airport. The Delta Sky Clubs are okay, but not necessarily worth the $50+ for a one time visit. They do have nice and clean showers, but the food they offer is not that special. It is a good place to relax, grab some snacks, and get some work done, but don't count on being able to get a full meal there. My only complaint is that the public WiFi is not dependable (or at least I couldn't figure it out). I am able to connect, but usually have no luck getting it to work. I often am only able to use WiFi at a Delta Sky Club, where I use the club's WiFi and not the airport's WiFi. If you ever go through Customs and Border Protection at DTW, your experience can vary greatly. DTW now supports the automated kiosk passport system, however, some officers will ask you question after question, holding up the line.."

Went to get food at a Chick Fil A, no signs indicating a line or where to enter so I stepped up to a register, had an airport employee (not Chick Fil A) grab my arm and say sir you need to enter over here. Looked a little irritated as she grabbed me but I moved. About the time I moved to where she was another passenger walked up, she looked at me again and said no you need to enter here. Lady who had walked up said for me to go ahead and stay, did not want the wrath of the employee so I said no but thanked her, went around and got in line. Never dealt with such a rude person and I literally walked up to a counter. After eating found one of the floor managers explained what happened and gave employee name. Boarded flight and left. I have flown through here a few times and never encountered such a rude person."
2nd August 2015,10,Detroit Airport customer review,"Detroit airport, specifically the Delta terminal is a great terminal. I flew Delta arriving from Chicago, and heading to Amsterdam.

The terminal has lots of shopping possibilities and a great variety of restaurants to pick and choose from. Best medium-sized airport."
31st May 2015,n/a,Detroit Airport customer review,For international departure DTW is ideal. For international arrivals DTW is to be avoided at all cost. The gross incompetence of TSA and US Customs at DTW amazes me. It took me almost two hours to slug through security and customs at DTW after arriving on time on a scheduled flight. DTW personnel (of which there are many but poorly trained) seemed taken by surprise by the arrival of my flight. TSA lines were needlessly long due to severe understaffing. DTW and TSA seem to have conspired to hire many employees to shout instructions to arriving passengers to cram into inadequate screening lines rather than to provide more screening lines. Avoid arriving at DTW from an international airport at all costs: TSA + DTW = totally inadequate to the point of utter incompetence. Delta and KLM: this is a major hub for your international operations. Why do you routinely subject your unfortunate customers to such mistreatment at DTW?
21st December 2014,10,Detroit Airport customer review,This is a very convenient clean and well-designed airport. It works well both for international as well as domestic travel. There are numerous transportation options to and from the airport and the tram in the McNamara terminal is very convenient. Security is always very efficient yet thorough. I have been running late a number of times for flights our of Detroit Metro but the ease of parking the efficiency of security and the tram have always got me to the gate on time. Additionally there are numerous dining and shopping options for those who have time prior to take-off or those connecting to another city.
17th July 2014,9,Detroit Airport customer review,We arrived at and connected at the MacNamara terminal used by Delta etc. rather than the older north terminal used by Southwest American etc. which we had used on a previous trip. This terminal is relatively small clean and easy to use. We had a very short walk between gates. Almost disappointed we made our connection as I was secretly hoping we'd have to overnight and be put in the lovely Westin hotel that's in the terminal.
3rd July 2014,10,Detroit Airport customer review,I flew AMS-DWT and then on to MKE at the end of May it was a fair walk from the arrival gate to immigration passing the US citizen entry area which was quite full I only had 1 hour left of my transfer time left so was a little apprehensive as to how long the queue for non US persons what a surprise around ten booths open and around twenty people yes 20 people queuing! I was chatting to the CBP guy for 5 minutes since there was no one behind me it seems that immigration had been full at 2pm with flights from 'Asia' but is slow at 3pm for a while. I continued on past baggage claim (I only had hand luggage) and on to security screening again no queues. The staff were very friendly and we chatted about the difference between DTW and the madness at ORD and I was on to my next flight around 20 minutes from leaving the plane and half of that was chatting to officials. The elevators bring you out in departures at the central train stop so on to the train to the north station and the gate was around 2 minutes walk as usual I checked the gate and time I had time to freshen up and bought a Philly Steak which was very nice and around $5.00 soon after they were calling the flight. I have used the airport before without problems I have to give DTW 10 out of 10. A quick note you can take food and drink you buy in the terminal on to planes in the US most people seem to since they don't serve more then pretzels on board it is called buy and fly.
3rd July 2014,2,Detroit Airport customer review,The Customs procedure leaves something to be desired. We will not book another flight that goes through Detroit for international flights again. We were on a flight that originated in Barcelona then onto Amsterdam (where we did a complete security scan) onto Detroit. We passed through customs just fine with the declarations paper completed and verified by an officer before we collected our luggage. Then our luggage was late coming off the plane and by then other flights arrived making the customs line exceedingly long. We told 3 customs officers patrolling the area (there were another 4 just standing around doing nothing) that we had a flight leaving in 30 minutes. Each one said we would make it. Then we had to go through another security check (we just had one at the gate in Amsterdam). Well we missed the flight. The next one we were put on was leaving 6 hours later and did not have the option of an extra 4 inches of leg room previously purchased for our original flight. In Amsterdam by the way there was an express line through customs for those travelers that had a flight leaving in 30 minutes or less. Why US airports don't do this should be explored. Probably because it makes sense.
10th February 2014,10,Detroit Airport customer review,Passed through on the way to Japan and was pleasantly surprised. I like this airport very much. Very clean excellent signage excellent dining options (pricey but good) video boards with the playoffs on the walls everything seems to run smoothly. Also had comfortable chairs which is nice.
10th October 2013,9,Detroit Airport customer review,Travelled here from Schiphol in transit to Orlando arriving at 4.20 pm on 10 October 2013. Shortest TSA lines we have experienced ever and the agent was both polite and welcoming which is unusual in our past experience. He apologised as the computer system froze and he had to reboot - as did his colleagues. Took around 10 minutes to get back on line and thereafter very efficient. Baggage recheck very quick and security well staffed and again very polite particularly when dealing with children and one passenger in a wheelchair. Overall Detroit is now our favourite transit airport.
7th October 2013,n/a,Detroit Airport customer review,What should have been a simple flight turned into a nightmare. Gate C24 boarded plane was told plane there was a problem had to de-plane and walk all the way over to Gate B18 and get on a second plane. Then told there was another fault had to wait 20 minutes for them to fix it after 20 minutes we had to again de-plane and walk back to the C24 Terminal. Now on third plane - waiting. To compensate they offered me a complimentary can of pop and pretzels. A lousy airline!
28th August 2013,10,Detroit Airport customer review,Great stopover-airport to use for immigration. Immigration is always empty and within few minutes you are through the process. The airport itself is large but they have a train going thru the terminal which avoid long walks. Shops are ok. It is certainly a lot better than what you heard and read about the actual city of Detroit.
22nd April 2013,7,Detroit Airport customer review,This airport is very large and long. It is just one tunnel. There are 3 train stops throughout the McNamara Terminal. However there are constant announcements telling people the time in Japanese Spanish and English. I can't however rate the restrooms due to my non-entering. This airport is very large and spacious. There is never a contest for seats.
21st April 2013,10,Detroit Airport customer review,McNamara (Delta's) terminal. Very fast security (<5 min) very clean aesthetic and airy. Very helpful staff good places to get a snack or a good meal that range from common and affordable chains to exclusive restaurants. Love their VINO bar. There is a hotel inside the terminal and free internet for 30 min. Very rare delays. Very fast luggage delivery. Probably the best airport in the country and the best place for transit. Very limited public transportation. Plenty of parking - the closest one (2-10 min walk to the terminal) is expensive - 20$/day.
3rd April 2013,9,Detroit Airport customer review,Probably the best US airport. Customs and immigration very efficient. Out of the customs queue in 30 minutes (including re checking bags for connecting flight from an international arrival). TSA not surly as in other US airports. Good facilities and eating options. Free wifi but limited to only 30 minutes. Would make this my transit point when visiting Eastern US.
22nd January 2013,8,Detroit Airport customer review,Delta uses Detroit for international flights. Good for return flights to Germany when you do not need to go through customs. Stopover time was little less than one hour and no problem. Walking distances are fair and they have a train to make it faster to get from one side to the other. OK duty free and other retail options. A convenient hub to go through.
26th November 2012,10,Detroit Airport customer review,Choose Detroit as a gateway airport on my journey from the UK via Amsterdam to Phoenix. Reviews promised reasonable TSA and a comfortable terminal with a train inside it. These promises were kept! The a/c docked at 2.23pm. At 3.23 I took a seat by the gate for my connecting flight. I'd allowed 2.5 hours for transfer and I did it 1 hour. Immigration were helpful - there were few US nationals and lots of internationals so they processed the US nationals in the US only area and then opened it up to non USA passport holders. Sensible. Flexible. Customs were fine. Next help was on hand to ensure transferring passengers sent their checked baggage to the right place. TSA processed us fairly and efficiently and before we knew it we were out in the terminal. There are 2 trains which shuttle back and forth incessantly so it's a quick way to the far end gates. Terminal staff seemed happy and helpful - even ground crew were getting merrily on with the work. The place had a very relaxed atmosphere though it was early afternoon with few flights. All in all it was a very good experience. I'd recommend Detroit as an easy entry to the US.
3rd May 2012,10,Detroit Airport customer review,DTW is my home airport so I may be a little bias. Flew out of Delta terminal and it is still a world class terminal compared to other airports. Great restaurants and a lot of shopping to pass the time.
29th April 2012,9,Detroit Airport customer review,Flew in here for a transfer for the first time. It is probably one of the nicest major airports in the US. Well laid out lots of restaurant options tram to get from one end to the other of a very long terminal. All gate staff very nice. Cannot speak of terminal side stuff as only there for a transfer but for my next international trip would not hesitate to fly in and out of here.
12th March 2012,10,Detroit Airport customer review,Using this airport has always been our preference for entry into the US. Recently the care and support we received from so many employees at the airport along with officials has been outstanding. My in-laws traveled there recently with our son who has learning difficulties and they made every effort to make his passage through the facility as stress free as possible. At other airports help has been offered grudgingly and resentfully - here at Detroit Wayne it was offered professionally and effectively.
27th January 2012,9,Detroit Airport customer review,Nice clean efficient airport. I arrived during a snowstorm with active blowing snow and 5 degree weather. The airport didn't miss a beat with a fleet of ploughs keeping the runways clear and no apparent delays due to the weather. Nice tall ceilings and lots of windows give the airport a nice open feel. Moving sidewalks and transit train make quick time of getting from gate to gate.
26th November 2011,9,Detroit Airport customer review,It has been vastly improved since 2002 with its complete rebuild featuring the two new terminals. The McNamara terminal used by Delta and its SkyTeam partners continues to impress me since I wrote my previous review in 2006 (below). The distances in the overlong A concourse are covered effortlessly by the tram system and even the long walk to the end of the B and C concourses feature moving walkways along their entire distance. The best architectural feature is the light show tunnel connecting the B and C concourses with the main complex. The new North Terminal extends this welcoming atmosphere to the non-SkyTeam airlines that use the airport. With the exception of one overly rude person the employees have all treated me well here too and the amenities at both terminals are exemplary. Gone are the days of the old terminal system with their horrible congestion and decrepit upkeep. With Detroit's urban decay they might look to the airport for ideas on how to improve things elsewhere in the metropolitan area.
19th November 2011,8,Detroit Airport customer review,A great place to change planes as food and other services are noticeably better than most US airports. The corridors are very long but moving sidewalks and a tram make this manageable. Sky Clubs in the Delta terminal are noticeably better than those in ATL and most other airports - less crowded with very comfortable furnishings and sense of space and quiet.
14th October 2011,7,Detroit Airport customer review,DTW remains perhaps my favourite airport. I have used Terminal 3 times and encountered courtesy and friendliness from check in and security staff. Shopping facilities are fine Huge concourses but easy to find your way around and lots of seating. I have never had to change flights here so cannot comment on that and my only note of dissent would be the amount of time that it takes to get through incoming security. There never seems to be enough people on the gates.
7th September 2011,4,Detroit Airport customer review,The McNamara (South) terminal looked clean and modern and easy to traverse for passengers. However we arrived at and a few days later departed from the North Terminal. The terminal itself is clean and un-crowded but once we got our bags we had to take them up one level then cross a pedestrian bridge over the airport road then down to a lower level go outside and find the appropriate shuttle bus. Rental car facilities are some distance from either terminal. You have to go to the lower parking structure level of either terminal and then take a rather long convoluted trip to the facility. On the plus side I have no fault with the cleanliness of either terminal. Eating facilities were decent. TSA personnel at the North Terminal seemed brusque but that can obviously vary from shift to shift.
1st September 2011,4,Detroit Airport customer review,DTW's south terminals (Delta and affiliates) are well-designed and functional with better than average food and beverage options. Ideal for connections but not so much for O&D traffic as there are long walks/rides to the bag claim and rental car facilities.
11th August 2011,5,Detroit Airport customer review,Arrived from Dulles on Delta. A reasonable walk under the tunnel to the reclaim area. Bags arrived in good time and a short walk to the car park. I was out of the airport 30 mins after landing. Departure to Baltimore from McNamara Terminal. Checked in using self service machines easy to use. Bag drop quick and efficient many desks open so no queue. Security efficient. Walked to our gate but you could take the fast train a good food court and bar near gates A70.
19th January 2011,5,Detroit Airport customer review,DTW is a very nice clean and modern airport with a straightforward layout that is easy to navigate. For all of the bad economic news coming out of Detroit you would never think it from seeing the beautiful airport the city has.
11th January 2011,5,Detroit Airport customer review,Clean bright tall ceilings lots of windows. The ratio of seats to passengers is good. Same goes for bathrooms which are also clean. The McNamara terminal is one long line with repetitive stations where you can find flight monitors bathrooms ATMs and restaurants. It has even numbered gates on one side odd on the other. The bad : customs agents are not the nicest regional ground employees are stretched too thin.
4th January 2011,5,Detroit Airport customer review,This has become my favorite transfer point if I'm headed anywhere in the eastern US other than New York. DTW is just about the only US airport that strikes me as first world. It's intelligently designed with an internal metro system running the length of the main McNamara terminal and moving underground walkways to connect to the parallel B/C terminal. It's long and big but that's the nature of airports and the transit systems are easy to use and obvious. Food options are pretty decent too with a few choices that rise above the usual food court fare. Immigration and customs are about as painless as is reasonable to hope for given asinine TSA practices that reflect absurdly unrealistic US passenger expectations for security.
26th August 2010,5,Detroit Airport customer review,Delta terminal is excellent for making connections. Yes it is long--1 mile long to be exact-- but it's great for exercising when you have a long layover. There are also moving walkways and an indoor monorail that run the length of the A concourse. The A concourse and the B and C concourses are connected by a psychedelic light & sound tunnel. Don't rush if you don't have to-take it all in! Facilities terminal-wide are excellent with the best dining options in the A concourse although if you like burgers there is a Fuddrucker's in the C concourse.
19th April 2010,5,Detroit Airport customer review,My first connection flight thru Detroit. I sat business from Frankfurt so I was early off the plane to immigration. That part was handled virtually in 5 minutes. Very empty friendly staff - have seen that different in other US hubs. We had a delay ex Frankfurt I still managed my connection within less than 30 minutes between both flights. The facilities seemed to be ok. I had hardly any time to look around. Looks like an airport you can stand a layover.
22nd February 2010,4,Detroit Airport customer review,Nice and clean but whoever came up with the stupid parallel and long terminal design clearly lacked imagination and must have been a runner. I don't know why they thought having only 1 connecting tunnel between terminals was a good idea and then made the main terminal super long but I think it could have been better designed. Never had a chance to check out the retail since I am too busy trying to make the connection. All I can say is that if you are connecting from a large jet to a regional flight have at least 45-60 mins between connections.
5th October 2009,4,Detroit Airport customer review,I connected for the first time in DTW with NWA. As previously mentioned the McNamara terminal is indeed VERY long. However it does have moving-steps and alas: its own metro system (with red trams like NWA's planes) - with tram stops along the way. Also the terminal is immaculately kept with a clean decor and floor to ceiling windows throughout. Add a wide array of dining and shopping options and you've got an award-winning product. Definitely better than ATL and even better than the pleasant Delta terminal in CVG.
7th September 2009,4,Detroit Airport customer review,Detroit Airport is one of the most interesting airports. Uniquely long stretch from one end to the other very clean facilities good dining and interesting duty-free shops. I loved the fact that the airport has a tram that travels very quickly from one end to the other at the top corner of the building. However security staff are not friendly especially the immigration sector when travelling in and out of Detroit to Tokyo.
2nd August 2009,2,Detroit Airport customer review,Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) has good bus connection via Michigan Flyer serving East Lansing Ann Arbor and Jackson MI were it not for the fact that Metro Airport management refuses to allow signing of the bus stop location at the terminal The Landside Director insists that signage must be restricted to concessionaires (taxi companies). The Michigan Flyer was forced to remove a diagram showing the bus stop location from its own website. Also the airport authority removed all written material regarding the Michigan Flyer service and bus stops from the traveler's aid desk. As a senior arriving after a 24 hour international journey I was unable to find any airport personnel who could direct me to the bus stop. Exhausted and loaded with my luggage I took a bad fall in my hurried attempt to find the bus stop. Finally a police officer directing parking traffic gave me directions. Although I should have had ample time had I known where to go I barely made the lengthy distance to the unmarked bus stop in time. This lack of proper signage is totally unacceptable and contrary to public interest and safety.
19th July 2009,5,Detroit Airport customer review,DTW is the best airport I have visited. Have not experienced much delay in all the years that I have used it. Baggage claim was good. McNamara Terminal interior (I have used NW much) was excellent. Though the terminal is freakishly long (one mile) the walkways help ease walking. Customs was excellent (perhaps due to the fact that I am a US citizen). Oddly enough I have never used Dulles for international. My only complaint is that the security areas are compact and check-in can sometimes be inefficient.
5th April 2009,4,Detroit Airport customer review,I have travelled through Detroit on several occasions. McNamara terminal is very neat courteous security and check in airline staff. Lots of shops and things to do before your flight. The new North terminal is a big improvement from the old terminals! The security isn't as precise as I imagined but they were very friendly and cracking jokes. The only complaint I have is I purchased a new expensive set of luggage only for it to come out with several tar footprints on it! My luggage has been destroyed in a sense I flew through Detroit just a couple weeks ago and it has more footprints on it! Well at least it got there! I will fly through Detroit again in the future!
17th January 2009,2,Detroit Airport customer review,The immigration officials were a bit incompetent. Mostly due to lack of familiarity with computers. Airport facilities are fine and I had flown before through the airport. But immigration and customs are not like other US airports. I would avoid it if this is your port of entry because of this. Otherwise domestically it is fine.
6th November 2008,5,Detroit Airport customer review,Arrival at McNamara Terminal from London on NWA was smooth and efficient. Uncharacteristically Immigration Officers were polite! Baggage was delivered promptly and transfer to onward NWA domestic flight was painless. A sports bar at the airport provides a haven for smokers! All in all an excellent experience.
26th August 2008,4,Detroit Airport customer review,Nice airport easy directions. I arrived and departed at the Edward H. McNamara Terminal. Terminal was very clean and you found everything to eat or a quite area to read. Nice is the as well the Tram that you brings you easily from one end to the other. At Security you was asked in a very friendly why you are leaving and it was a smooth way from check in to the gate.
22nd July 2008,4,Detroit Airport customer review,I found Detroit airport to be an easy airport to get around in. I arrived at the Smith Terminal and found the check in at American Airlines very quick and easy. I saw the line for security and thought it would take forever but moved along quite quickly and left me with about two hours to go before my flight. There were limited amount of places to eat Quiznos was every where and not much else. You could get a beer for an inflated price.
28th February 2008,4,Detroit Airport customer review,I have transited the DTW airport numerous times and found that it is a great facility. I arrived at gate 78 and my departure gate was gate 6 with 15 minutes to make the flight. Jumping on the tram made this easy and doable. Once you understand (it is easy) how to use the tram you can be in any part of Terminal A within minutes. If you have time there are a variety of place to eat that can fit any budget and many places to shop. There is an intriguing water/fountain feature in the middle of terminal where its fun just to people watch. The facility is clean with lots of bathrooms and really easy to get around.
4th October 2007,4,Detroit Airport customer review,For BA passengers the new terminal is a vast improvement from the old terminal BA used (1 food outlet /1 shop (always closed). On arriving the immigration/customs queues were quite long and slow must have waited 30-40 minutes. Checkin and security flying out was painless. The terminal design is not for everyone a narrow mile long structure with gates on each side. Plus Points; Lots of space and seating plenty of eating places easy to navigate and very clean. Negative points: The choice of eating places depends on where you are. If you want to see whats on offer at each place you need to spend time and walk a lot. Shopping is quite limited. All in all a very good airport
25th November 2006,n/a,Detroit Airport customer review,Having used both the McNamara and Smith terminals I find it safe to say that Detroit Metro is almost two different airports in terms of quality. The new McNamara terminal used by Northwest and its SkyTeam partners is a monumental improvement in terms of quality over that awful old Davey Terminal. Some distances can be long but unlike many airports of this size there are moving walkways (and the A concourse tram) the entire distance to your gate. The architecture though not entirely cutting-edge is very light and welcoming and the center mall area contains a wealth of dining and shopping. The Smith terminal (which serves all non-SkyTeam domestic airlines) on the north side of the airport is uncrowded but astonishingly dilapidated and depressing as some reviewers mention below. The new north terminal that is now being built will be a welcome relief from this antiquated and obsolete relic.
16th October 2006,n/a,Detroit Airport customer review,A great airport - clean modern well organized. The dining and shopping choices are excellent and I really don't mind having to spend a few hours in this airport. It's quite comfortable. Clearing customs is always fairly quick and efficient and the people who work at this airport tend to be very friendly and helpful. Even though I am not from Detroit when arriving at this airport from abroad I already feel home.
5th May 2006,n/a,Detroit Airport customer review,As a resident of the Detroit Metro area I have to say that the new terminal is definitely an improvement over the old one. Definitely get to this airport early - traffic can be horrible in the area and you'll want the extra time to clear the security. But once you get through the checkpoints the MacNamara terminal offers many opportunities to relax and enjoy yourself before your flight. You can catch a beer and a game (and a smoke if you so desire) in one of the bars peruse the various shops around the terminal or simply read a book or magazine that you can purchase from many different kiosks if you didn't bring one with you already. Generally very clean spacious-feeling and easy on the eye.
6th February 2006,n/a,Detroit Airport customer review,I was pleasantly surprised by DTW. The terminal is modern design is attractive food and shopping provide great selection and the staff no matter if airport or other is usually very friendly (not common at US airports according to my experience) - plus good news for smokers there is legal spot for smoking Fox Sport Bar right across the Sky lounge. Even the immigration process and customs are smooth and quick without pointless hassling and abusing the power of uniform. I admit the terminal is very long and narrow and can get crowded easily and the inside terminal tram can be confusing for first time visitors but the atmosphere and facilities are good and definitely beats majority of the US airports.
11th January 2006,n/a,Detroit Airport customer review,"I booked a ticket from Atlanta to Amsterdam via DTW on Northwest Airlines. After hearing the rave reviews about the new WorldGateway I had high expectations for it. However as soon as I stepped out of the gate I realized I had been let down. There are only three tram stations in the entire mile-long terminal so some walking is needed. It is easy to walk such distance in a normal scenario but toting a carryon bag does not help. Also senior citizens who have some difficulty walking will find the airport to be miserable for the same reason. The terminal is actually quite narrow so crowds cannot disperse too easily. If a family of eight or nine stops to look at an airport map a bottleneck will ensue as two or three people at a time try to make their way around the family. Besides the walking and crowds the choice of dining is minimal- besides the normal fast food chains and two or three restaurants there isn't too much more to expect. I found that my packed peanut butter sandwich was better than what most stores offered. After returning from Amsterdam I was faced with perhaps the rudest customs agents I have encountered. The agents barked orders to people who hardly knew English and made no efforts to explain things to them. In every other city I have cleared customs I've been greeted with a pleasant ""welcome home!"". Not this time. The man behind the counter grumpily stamped my passport and bade me farewell. Detroit's new terminal isn't all it's made out to be and I will make a point to avoid it in the future."
30th November 2005,n/a,Detroit Airport customer review,I've flown (international flights only) in and out of DTW several times since the new NW terminal opened and I can't believe what a massive improvement it's been. The food and shopping are great and the NW Worldclubs are really really nice. But coming in from London once our NW flight was prohibited from deplaning until all the passengers from a previous flight had cleared passport control. We had to stay on the plane at the gate an additional 50 minutes after landing and most of us missed our connections. The explanation the airport provided was that there was some rule permitting only one flight to clear passport control at a time - something I have never heard of at any other airport - and we were encouraged to write to the local legislators to complain. It was an utterly bizarre experience and one I still don't understand.
6th November 2005,n/a,Detroit Airport customer review,I've flown home several times from Montreal to my hometown Chicago on NW for the holidays good connections at the McNamara Terminal and impressive duty-free on the way back to Montreal. Just a tip for smokers as of January 2005 smokers could still enjoy a cigarette in the Fox Skybox Lounge located in the middle of the terminal near the duty-free shop. Used to airports like O'Hare and Montreal's Dorval which relegate smokers to the curb (more complicated in Montreal because you have to exit through US customs again to get back out!) this was a welcome surprise.
2nd June 2021,4,"""Lack of proper communication was a huge issue""",Not Verified |  Two staff members were extremely rude this morning. Lack of proper communication was a huge issue. Please tell me politely to not take my small electronics out of my carry on bag (which has always been the procedure before) instead of yelling the words so quickly that I did not have enough reaction time to process what was being said. Patience and kind words were all that I needed. Please work on this.
23rd May 2021,1,"""Staff were extremely rude""","✅ Trip Verified | Staff were extremely rude. Every part from ticketing, to security, to boarding all spoke down to us customers. Very disappointed in the continued disrespect. Security were also beyond slow. I can appreciate good security, but the airport wasn't busy at all and it took forever as they kept just taking their time."
28th March 2021,3,"""Fort Myers airport is so poorly equipped""","Not Verified |  Fort Myers airport is so poorly equipped with bathrooms, enough restaurants, stores that are open, and places to watch TV. There is not one TV in the waiting areas. If there is a delay, there just are no seats available. Breakfast food was not available at 9am. They were out of both breakfast food and coffee by 9 am. The lines for pre packaged food were 20-30 people long. They need to visit an airport like Grand Rapids MI to get it right. Grand Rapids is the same size town and so much more efficient and consumer friendly than this Fort Myers airport. Fortunately, the staff were friendly."
13th August 2020,3,"""belittle their customers""",✅ Trip Verified |  I think everyone can count on more than two hands the amount of rude experiences at an airport that they’ve had but today’s stood out more than usual! My boyfriend and I set our backpacks down after having gone through TSA already to go grab a bagel which couldn’t have been more than 10 minutes. When we came back to our seats there was a guard standing near our stuff with a dog. We didn’t think anything of it and then he approaches my boyfriend to belittle him in front of other people that you “can’t leave your bag unattended” and “it makes people unsettled”. He went on for about 5 minutes and then told us some other people may be coming to talk to us. All for a backpack ?! What is TSA for if you’re still worried about my bag?! Maybe this airports needs to put signs up saying not to leave bags unattended before they belittle their customers for their unwritten rules. Attached is a picture of the dangerous scary backpacks!
23rd March 2020,2,"""This is awful and disrespectful""","✅ Trip Verified | We are under a pandemic and I am wearing a mask and gloves, respecting 6 ft distance. Workers at security didn't want us to maintain 6 feet and told me they didn't care if we all got sick. one guy called me sick girl and said you decided to fly, you should have stayed home. This is awful and disrespectful. Security needs to be more aware of the part they play in helping keep people safe. Otherwise, they can stay home."
9th February 2020,5,"""they have horrible wifi""","Not Verified |  Small airport, clean and friendly staff. However, they have horrible wifi. Make sure you have a good data plan if you have to sit for a while for your flight."
30th September 2018,8,"""clean and welcoming""","Not Verified | This airport is clean and welcoming. The problem I recognize is the preponderance of dogs not being carried or placed in a designated kennel. During my last visit, I saw an emotional support animal lying on the floor in the TSA queue. Three dogs on leashes were seen at the Jet Blue gate. Announcements about dog rules and regulations are made repeatedly but are ignored. Signage would be helpful enforcement is needed."
22nd March 2018,1,"""Parking there is a mess""",❎ Not Verified |  We dropped off and picked up twice in March and went to cell lot to wait. Parking there is a mess! Cars are parked everywhere they shouldn’t be and people can’t move or get out. Has no one ever checked this problem out? Wish I would of known I could of taken pictures and sent in. I will definitely next time!
11th June 2017,8,"""TSA agents surprisingly friendly""","TSA agents at Fort Myers Airport were surprisingly friendly. I was on a red-eye flight home to Chicago, and was feeling restless. They were very understanding, and I am still to this day shocked given my experience with the TSA at O'Hare. WiFi was ok. The decor was quite tasteful."
1st October 2016,8,"""there is a lack of shops""","Beautiful airport, lots of palm trees, like a nice Florida airport, staff are very friendly, though I would say there is a lack of shops in Concourse C but other than that it is a great airport. No one really connects through RSW so honestly I don't have an opinion on that, but in general, beautiful airport."
13th July 2016,10,"""security check was efficient""",The airport is clean. The security check was efficient but still appeared to be thorough. The TSA agents and others in the airport were courteous and respectful. This is a great airport and I would recommend.
30th January 2015,8,Fort Myers Airport customer review,RSW is a lovely airport with plenty of amenities. However I had TSA-Pre status and the lines weren't open so I had to stand in line and go through regular security. Why offer a product that isn't available?
13th January 2014,8,Fort Myers Airport customer review,Very nice small airport that's the only close one to Southwest Florida. Never had a bad experience in the 5+ times I've traveled round trip through it. It's small so the waiting times are good security isn't an issue at all and they have a few basic amenities. It's not an airport that can keep you busy for long layovers but I don't think there's really any reason one would have a long layover here. If you're traveling to Naples Ft. Myers Marco Island or any of the cities in and around Collier Country this is definitely the best way to do it.
21st June 2013,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,I use RSW each year for the puddle-hopping trip to Key West courtesy of Cape Air. It is an exemplary airport at every level. Parking is well-organised staff are friendly and well motivated (and this includes TSA) the layout is spacious and the food and beverage facilities are good. An all-round pleasure to use.
19th May 2013,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,Fort Myers Airport (RSW) is always a good start and end on our vacations to SWFL! The airport is clean calm and modern the staff are always helpful and the Security is efficient!
13th May 2013,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,Southwest Florida International is easy to get around Security is fast and it offers lots of shops and food options.
23rd April 2013,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,This is the best airport that I have been to. It rarely has long security lines yet apparently they could get long due to the large maze at the security checkpoint. The parking is very easy to get to. You don't need to take a bus if you are parking for a short time.
17th January 2013,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,You can't ask for anything more from a mid-size airport shops in main terminal with 3 gift shops attached! Beyond TSA. checkpoints there are nice shops and a few restaurants. Airport is modern and very clean! Check in is always fast rental car agencies are in a separate building and it is only a few steps away. I just find that sometimes the luggage wait is a little long.
4th July 2011,3,Fort Myers Airport customer review,I remember this airport being very small. Not offering a lot of airlines. The security is extremely small. The decoration was nice and very modern looking. It was very clean and organized.
26th August 2010,4,Fort Myers Airport customer review,Flew on Delta out of Concourse C. When traveling with my 7 year old daughter it took about 30 minutes to check bags and clear security which is about the same if not slightly better than Tampa. RSW has a very clean efficient well-lit terminal that I consider to be one of the best if not THE best medium-size airport I have been in. Facilities after security are pretty typical but there is a very large Chilis before security in the corridor that runs behind the ticket counters.
5th January 2022,1,"""tops the worst airports""","Not Verified | Honolulu International Airport tops the worst airports I have ever experienced. After arrival, we had to go through a Covid screening check point which took over 2 hours. The lady at the check point held on to my ID while I had to upload my vaccine card into the Hawaii Safe Travel portal and forgot to give it back to me. Once we passed the secured area I remembered and asked the security guard if I could go back to get my ID. The guard of course didn’t speak English and while I was trying to explain I need to get my ID back from desk #1 which was like 50 feet away, I was yelled at by another security guard to go through the TSA check point again and through the Covid line only to get my ID. I said I don’t have a boarding pass and can’t get through TSA and he said “that’s your problem!” I asked if they could please send someone to get my ID and they said I should go back to delta and ask for a pass to go through TSA which took me in a circle around the airport to get to the Covid screening line. Once at desk #1, the lady who had held my ID, said she had just given it to a security guard and I have to go to their office to get it back. So I had to find where their office was which no one apparently knew where it was, only to get to a desk with two ladies sitting and while I explained my ID should’ve been brought here, they not only didn’t help but started answering phone calls with me still standing behind the desk. I had to ask multiple times for someone to please help me so I could go home and that my husband and dog have been waiting outside for me for hours. I haven’t even mentioned how rude some of the airport staff were and how clueless they were about the airport and how it works. Thai airport system is a disaster. Our experience here was a nightmare and I don’t wish it upon anyone especially after a long flight back home. This needs to get fixed! Travelers shouldn’t be treated like this when they are being charged thousands of dollars to travel and relax. Even LAX operates better and has more knowledgeable and nicer staff."
23rd November 2021,1,"""Inefficient and inept""",Not Verified |  Inefficient and inept. Waiting in lines like at an amusement park to get to baggage. People controlling the flow are either incompetent or don't care. We had to traverse the line three times while others had a straight shot in--and I'm not referring to the active duty personnel and their families. Several people complained when they started allow other general passengers go through but the persons controlling the flow ignored everyone. Be prepared to wait an hour just to get to baggage.
19th March 2020,5,"""never look forward to this place""","Not Verified |  Concrete monstrosity and mainly a disappointment. Disorderly queues at check-in but fortunately short waiting times for service. Aged TSA infrastructure and again, weak disorderly queues. Really nothing at all interesting in the gate areas and was pleased to join my flight. Baggage came quickly on my return but was pulled over by a clearly bored CBP agent who did a cursory check and sent us on our way - what a waste of time. Can't avoid unfortunately but never look forward to this place."
7th March 2020,1,"""no excuse for the condition of this airport""",Not Verified |  There is no excuse for the condition of this airport. The washrooms are filthy and ancient. The seating and waiting areas are poorly designed and filthy. The check-in attendant at WestJet (Priority) was visibly hostile and unhelpful. No one at this airport was helpful or friendly. Hate their jobs and it is no wonder considering the condition of this airport.
2nd January 2020,1,"""Humid, hot, and lacking air-conditioning""","Not Verified |  Humid, hot, and lacking air-conditioning. Line for check-in stretched outside the airport. Honestly, I've been to several third-world countries with better airports than this. It's so bad in fact that I would almost consider skipping flying into Oahu all-together."
29th November 2019,1,"""This airport is complete trash""","Not Verified |  I had to get a last minute flight to go to the mainland for a funeral. This airport is complete trash. To be fair, maybe I'm in a bad mood, but I would literally rather fly into or out of any disgusting airport in the world. At least they have beer. Its 10 pm and nothing is open. The bathroom smells like a portable toilet on the third day of a rugby tournament on a hot summer day in Georgia. It's so hot and humid in here that my knees are sweating, not the back of my knees, my kneecaps. I live in Hawaii and I'm used to not having air conditioning, but this would be much more tolerable if you could at least get a beer. Next time I leave, I'll see if I can just be a stowaway on a cargo ship. It would be about as comfortable and wouldnt cost $1000. Oh, I forgot to mention a pigeon decided to relieve himself on my shoulder inside the airport. Keep up the good work, guys!"
14th November 2019,2,"""fly any airline but American""",Not Verified |  This airport is pretty small. American Airlines closes their baggage check counter from 7:30-11:30 and apparently you have to call to get this information or it’s your fault for not having the knowledge like this is common practice. All the airport staff and other airline staffs were helpful. When flying out of this airport I beg you please fly any airline but American Airlines. They seem to be the only airline that has baggage check counters closed. No other airline follows this procedure.
14th October 2019,1,"""inadequate rental car return signage""",Not Verified |  Totally inadequate rental car return signage! I circled the airport for 30 minutes - about 5 times driving through departures area - following rental return signs that go nowhere! Finally had to drive wrong way through a one way street because I could see the Hertz signs far ahead. Delay caused me to be late for my boarding. Extremely dangerous situation caused simply because airport security or construction personnel couldn’t Ensure rental return signs actually get you to the rental return instead of back to the freeway. SHAME ON HONOLULU AIRPORT. You guys totally suck.
12th October 2019,1,"""each time, I've been beyond underwhelmed""","✅ Trip Verified | What an armpit. I don't know what else to say! Thankfully, the State of Hawaii appears to be finally, slowly moving to revitalize this ancient relic of air travel, but who knows how long that'll take?! I've flown in or out of Honolulu three times, each time, I've been beyond underwhelmed, and it's legitimately hard for me to even think of anything positive to say about this place (as if you couldn't tell already). To elaborate: The layout had to have designed by a third-grader (and that may even be an insult to third-graders), illogical, seemingly lackadaisical, with unnecessarily long walking with little art work and shops along the way. Oh, and poor signage, as you're approaching and leaving the airport and within the airport. The exterior just looks little better than what I imagine a bombed-out set of the show M*A*S*H would've looked like, but at least there are some neat tropical plants here and there. There is no tram, which makes it horrifyingly handicapped-inaccessible to travel between security, terminals and gates. Few airports I've ever been to seem to have more intentionally curt, unpleasant personnel than Honolulu, whether they're check-in and ticketing agents, TSA, customs and immigration, Starbucks baristas, or bartenders. Security is astonishingly slow and ""un-methodically methodical"", even having TSA Pre-Check helps, but just a little. The only perk is the people who are wearing leis, and greet you into Hawaii with smiles as the plane is disembarking. Just avoid this place if you possibly can, it is easily avoidable if you're flying from the Americas or Europe, if you know what you're doing, but probably not avoidable if you're flying from Australasia or Asia."
7th October 2019,1,"""Absolutely ridiculous""",Not Verified |  Worst airport I’ve ever been to. I travel constantly for work. It took over two hours and walked miles to get to gate. Then I was bumped because flight was oversold. Absolutely ridiculous.
3rd October 2019,2,"""Needs knocking down and building a new one""","Not Verified |  Absolute worst airport ever. Needs knocking down and building a new one. You get out of your taxi etc see a long line which is outside, no idea if you should join it as no staff to ask. Get to the end of the line to find it’s not the right line if you have luggage. Eventually find the right machine get boarding ticket then have to go back to the original line to queue up again for sniffer dog. Then security. Nowhere to sort yourself out when you get through. When you think you are finished another security check for fruit and flowers. Need more and trained staff. Or it needs a big sign to say where to go first. They spend a fortune building hotels and designer shops which has spoiled the place but can’t get a decent airport."
1st October 2019,1,"""most disorganized airport""","Not Verified |  The most disorganized airport I've ever flown through. I showed up 2 hours before departure for a domestic flight, which is usually plenty of time. It took over an hour to get through security, and I barely made it to the gate for final boarding. The terminal signs outside are unclear. My flight was departing from terminal 1, gate C1. The signs at the curb all showed ""Terminal 1 Gates A & B"", as if C gates are located elsewhere. They aren't, but you wouldn't know that by looking at the signs."
20th September 2019,2,"""waived her finger in my face""",✅ Trip Verified | TSA in this airport was good. However I did have the most interesting encounter with a little angry cleaning lady in the women’s bathroom. She waived her finger in my face while angrily telling me to flush the toilet before I had even used the bathroom. Rude.
14th September 2019,2,"""Disorganised and dirty""","Not Verified |  Has been 20 years since my last visit and swear nothing has been updated in that time. Disorganised and dirty, very little signage, very poor food options, closed restrooms, stressful security experience all takes place in dark crowded and dingy spaces. Such a shame as totally does not reflect the amazingly beautiful and friendly Hawaii. Needs complete demo and rebuild sadly."
3rd July 2019,1,"""a horrible airport""",Not Verified |    This is a horrible airport. It is disorganized and lacks signage. The waiting areas lack outlets to charge cell phones. Security is just rude - my guy was quite thrilled when he found my oversized container of sun spray. I won’t be back soon.
12th June 2019,1,"""a terrible experience""","Not Verified |  Like most reviews mention, the disorganization and overcrowding run rampant at this airport. The Hawaii heat coupled with lines out the door made for a terrible experience. The lack of directional signage pointing us to the rental car return forced us to get back on the freeway and loop around the entire airport again. Of course when we asked a police officer for directions his only response was to follow the signs. But worst of all was the rude and angry TSA agent who yelled at us for no reason. We were traveling with our child and he was adamant that we were hiding something in the stroller. I quote, ""Take that carseat off! I know it comes out!"" After being told by one agent to take our shoes off, the same angry TSA agent yells at us again that we need to keep them on. When I told him we were getting conflicting information, all he did was throw a fit. Yeah I'm never flying out of this garbage airport again."
17th May 2019,1,"""needs professional training on how to talk to customers""","✅ Trip Verified | Wiki-wiki shuttle complaint at Honolulu airport. The wiki-wiki shuttle bus driver at this airport was so angry and belligerent towards the passengers after picking us up from the international arrival gate to take us to the luggage area. He picked us up from the gate on May 5, 2019 at around 9:37 am. He was so angry that he yelled at everyone in the bus as he told us to ""Move back! This is a full flight, the sooner you move back, the sooner we can do this!"" and repeatedly yelled at us with the same statement, only more belligerent and agitated at each time he repeated. He looked as if he was ready to fight the passengers at the front of the shuttle. He was so angry to a point of harassment towards us. I do not understand why he treated the visitors and returning residents to Hawaii like this? There seems to be a fake Aloha being thrown around this airport. This wiki-wiki shuttle driver needs professional training on how to talk to customers. He would not have a job without passengers that arrive and leave from this airport. Arrogant. He was so aggressive and hostile towards the passengers, I am still perplexed what the heck did we do to him?"
1st May 2019,3,"""no directional signage""",✅ Trip Verified |   What a disaster. I could not find a single sign in the inter-island terminal to point me towards the mainland/international terminal. When I arrived at the mainland/international terminal I could find no sign telling me if I were in Terminal 1 or Terminal 2. I could not easily locate an arrivals/departure display. Upon my return to the islands I could not find a single sign in the mainland/international terminal to point me towards the inter-island terminal. Departure boards in the mainland/international terminal did not display inter-island flights. Many forking hallways had no directional signage. I nearly missed my connection in both directions.
29th April 2019,3,"""Disorganised would be the operative word""","Not Verified |  What is there not to enjoy about an 80 minute wait to check in? As a frequent traveller, to lots of airports, this one is pretty bad on the face of it. Disorganised would be the operative word - 4 check in staff for about 200 travellers, 3 of whom were looking after 1 set of travellers for some time. Glacial movement on the queue and when you see people being pulled out of that queue because they are about to miss their flight, then you know the check in isn't going well. Also the first airport I have been asked to step out of one queue for security (with 30 or so others) and then walk about 500m to a completely different security spot downstairs as they were unable to cope with the numbers. Considering so much of Hawaii is about tourism, they certainly aren't wasting money on improving the arrival/departure processes."
16th January 2019,2,"""This airport is the pits""
","Not Verified |  This airport is the pits! My flight doesn't take off for 3 more hours, but there are about 15 of us sitting in a diesel fumed corridor. It would be nice to be able to sit in the gate area where there are restrooms. The restrooms are few and mostly dirty."
26th November 2018,4,"""slowly getting better""","Not Verified |  Honolulu Airport is slowly getting better. My wife and I have been through this airport many times starting in the early 70's. The check in area is dark with a cement atmosphere. The mens bathroom was absolutely disgusting, very poorly maintained. There are a number of ""YES"" high end shops. Very few eating places other than a few fast food kiosks in a small food court. There are improvement slowly being made. Security check in was much better this time. We arrived early to check in with Air Canada and that process has much improved. This open concept has its advantages however there are drawback. Overall this is not the worst airport I have been through but it certainly does not rank in my top ten list."
7th October 2018,1,"""such a lack of organization""","Not Verified | This was the worst airport for departures ever experienced. Lines went out the door to the sidewalk. We asked one employee inside where the luggage check for first class (HA airlines) was located and she sent us outside to stand in a line for check-in. We had already checked in. The crowds were large. Finally we went back in through another entry door and found the first class baggage check. Now all they do is tag your bags and send you to another line for loading bags. At lest that line was short. Then on to the TSA precheck, again we had to exit the building to stand outside. The ticketing lobby was so small, that they had to have security at PreCheck to let people pass from one side to the other side. Then when the Precheck line was shorter, they would allow you to enter the building to get in line. Rest of the experience was ok. There seems to be a lack of knowledge in at least the employees we talked with, exception HA employees, to be able to guide you anywhere. We heard multiple complaints about this while waiting to figure out where we were really suppose to go. We have never experienced such a lack of organization. The automated walk ways were not functional, bathrooms had inoperable toilets and sinks, enough worked that the wait lines for women were not too bad. Don't think we will ever fly out of Honolulu again."
9th August 2018,2,Honolulu Airport customer review,"Not Verified |  Crazy security lines. I live here, travel several times per month inter island. I have TSA Pre and Platinum status but even those lines are out the door onto the sidewalk, standing in the rain sometimes. This has been the case all summer. Big change from earlier in the year. No explanation from security or airline personnel who range in demeanour from indifferent to hostile."
24th April 2018,9,"""found all staff to be incredibly helpful""
","❎ Not Verified |  We arrived at Honolulu airport from Aus and departed a few days later for NYC. OK so the airport is crowded but we found all staff to be incredibly helpful and efficient. At no time were we in any doubt as to what to do or where to go. At every turn we were directed by staff to the next stop. On arrival, we went through customs as quickly as we have experienced at any international airport. On leaving the airport our pre arranged shuttle was exactly where we were told it would be and we were on our way in no time. On departure to NYC we once again got through the airport quickly and easily. We had to be bused to our terminal because the airport is undergoing a large upgrade at the moment. If you do all the usual airport things like allow plenty of time, check in online beforehand, declare any food items, etc. you will find your experience at Honolulu airport as pleasant as ours was."
14th April 2018,1,"""Security was so rude""",❎ Not Verified |  Our departure was the worst experience of our time traveling. Security was so rude. We were yelled at and treated like we did something wrong. My grandkids have better manners then they did. I would not go back again. You need to give some of the workers a lesson on how to treat people.
11th April 2018,1,"""A totally unpleasant experience""","❎ Not Verified |  A totally unpleasant experience, hard to tell which is worse, departure or arrival. On departure, long and slow security lines, confusing with three feeding into two so that some people who arrived later got through earlier- unfair. Check-in at Interisland terminal, also used by Hawaiian Air for mainland and international flights, total chaos at midday. On international arrival, herded into ""wiki wiki"" shuttle bus for short trip to immigration. People with carry-ons and small children forced to stand, Immigration hall too small to handle many overnight flights from Asia which arrive close to each other, causing incredibly long lines. Unlike most airports were luggage goes around carousel making it easy to spot, airport workers remove luggage from carousel making it difficult to find. After finally navigating this travesty, faced with traffic jam of cars, taxis and shuttles trying to pick up passengers. That such a shambolic airport be named after a distinguished gentleman, Senator Daniel Innouye is a crime."
5th April 2018,3,"""Absolute chaos""","✅ Trip Verified | Using Domestic Terminal to fly to New York from Oahu. Absolute chaos. The queues make no sense and merge into each other for boarding passes and bag drop off. There is a system and it could work well if there were instructions anywhere. You first need to weigh your check in bags and the screens are really self explanatory. You have good choices to use eticket scan, input flight confirmation no. Scan passport etc. The machine then walks you through weighing bags etc before printing off your boarding passes, bag tags and receipt for any costs. You then need to join the bag drop off queue once you work out where it ends as the queues for the bag weigh machines stem out around circular hubs and invariably merge with the single bag drop queue. Once you’ve dropped off your bag, you need to work out which security queue you need to be in. Security B is TSA and the others A, C and D are for all others. We were in C despite this being clearly labelled “international” when we were going to Mainland US. Once you get through security, options for food etc are ok. Toilets were dated but clean. There is free WiFi and sockets to charge phones etc free. Travel to the gates is far easier by foot than the further confusion of the wiki wiki bus. The airport is small enough to get to any of the gates within 10 mins Walking and they’re well signposted (although your bags are scanned again as you technically go outside albeit undercover). In summary, once you get through security it’s ok inside. Just try and do as much yourself as if you need to rely on staff, you’ll struggle."
30th March 2018,1,"""Never again to Hawaii""","❎ Not Verified |    Massively overcrowded, ""officials"" gave wrong info, which made me drag suitcase here, then there, to wrong area, took hours to go through security, absolutely no signage, ""drop off"" areas never explained. Flight to Portland was then a dream. PDX was sane. Never again to Hawaii."
20th February 2018,1,"""no proper signs or information""
","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is totaly inadequate to modern airtravel. Long queues everywhere, no proper signs or information. Every step requires several stops. Security control is a joke. People yelling at you contradictory orders. There are no plastic boxes at the scanning machines for your personal items but after control there are hundreds of them lying in a corner. The entire terminal is overcrowded and hasn't changed at all since the 90s, while air travel changed dramatically. It's a shame that the main airport of these beautiful islands is such a mess."
18th February 2018,4,"""Airport is just plain dirty""","❎ Not Verified |    Sitting at Gate 14 waiting for my departure flight. I've traveled a lot around world including several 3rd countries. Honolulu Airport is just plain dirty. I am embarrassed for people around world to see this. The airport maybe a bit dated but that is no excuse for the filth. The walls, ceiling, sinks, toilets, tiles, light fixtures are soiled, there are fingerprints, grease, dirt everywhere. The workers and Management, and local government has no pride in their State, work or themselves I guess."
13th January 2018,1,"""the worlds worst security staff""","✅ Trip Verified | The Hawaiian airports have the worlds worst security staff. You can hear them yelling long before you get to security. They just keep yelling and being ignorant to people. Also if you put your shoes in the tray they give you heck. I have been asked if I treat my owen house that way, when I put shoes in the tray. Do they not realize that in all the other airports in the world we have to put our shoes im the tray? We don't read minds."
11th January 2018,4,"""the worst airport in the United States""
","✅ Trip Verified | I’m sad to report that this has to be the worst airport in the United States. The bathrooms are filthy, small, outdated, etc. This was my first trip to Hawaii and I was really surprised at the airport. I’m used to Portland, Oregon, which is the #1 airport in America, so I do have pretty high standards, but I know I’m not out of line here at all. I truly hope someone with some authority reads this and other reviews as this is an honest review. Embarrassing to our country."
3rd January 2018,2,"""Security is a nightmare""","❎ Not Verified |    Security is a nightmare, here everything goes slower than other places.

29th November 2017,2,"""washroom disgustingly dirty""","❎ Not Verified | I have been to 3rd world countries that have better airport facilities than Honolulu. I asked a TSA agent where a bathroom was located on arrival in the baggage pickup area and was told that he was not an information booth. Great Aloha welcoming. I have been to the Islands many times as we go there every year for a 2-3 month stay. This is not the norm. The washroom was disgustingly dirty. No soap, no towels an absolute disgrace. More high end shopping places than eating establishments. Open concept is nice however it does have its drawbacks. The check in area is dark and dreary reminds me of a cement car park garage. There are improvements being made. eg parking facilities. They charge 2-3 dollars for a baggage cart. Another nickel and dime travel expense. Security screening area is far too small for the number of people being screened at one time."
17th November 2017,3,"""indoor signage is poor""","❎ Unverified |  This airport was the worst part of our trip to Hawaii. It is older and dreary, surprising seeing that it is a tourist destination. As others have noted, indoor signage is poor. Amenities such as shopping, are limited. I had to look to find a shop to buy even a bottle of water, and then endured a long line as only on cashier was on duty. The Delta gate we were at was large with adequate seating, but while air-conditioned was still warm. And no working wifi. I don't know if it was just down when we were there or if it is truly non-existent. I dreaded every minute at this airport."
7th November 2017,1,"""there were no signs whatsoever""","✅ Verified Review |  The worst airport I’ve ever been to, out of over 20. Arriving there, there were no signs whatsoever indicating where the exit was, or where to find public transport. When coming back to depart, the departures location turned out to be the car rental, and there was only 1 sign indicating roughly what way to go towards departures. Arriving there, the airport officer told us there was no flight leaving to Seattle that night. Turned out there was, just from a different gate that was difficult to find as well. Once inside, there were barely any charging stations, and the 3 they have do not even have seating. Even the coffee shop only has 2, meaning only 2 people can charge their phone at a time. I’m sitting on the ground as we speak. There is no wifi either, so forget about getting any work out of the way while waiting for your delayed flight - of which they forgot to inform you. Worst airport experience of my life, would avoid this airport at any cost. Would have given it a 0/10 if it were possible."
26th September 2017,1,"""the most disorganized chaos I have ever witnessed""","✅ Verified Review |  Honolulu Airport almost ruined our honeymoon! We arrived two hours early for a weekday afternoon, inter-island flight to Maui. The scene at the ticketing and bag check was the most disorganized chaos I have ever witnessed. It was completely unclear which mess of a line to get into for bag checking, and the staff was rude and unhelpful. After asking 3 staff members for assistance and receiving only grunts in response, I finally found the correct bag check area. It was a complicated self check process that took even tech savvy people upwards of 20 minutes to properly navigate. Then we were ushered back outside into a pre-security line that didn't move for 30 minutes because they didn't have enough staff available! By this point our flight was about to board! Staff were sarcastic and unsympathetic, remarking that we'd ""better hurry and run."" I've been to third world countries that have easier and more effiecient airports than Honolulu."
27th August 2017,3,"""transfer just a nightmare""","❎ Unverified | Total Chaos. Arrived into Honolulu on a morning flight from SYD and had to transfer to SFO, both on Hawaiian Airlines. Was told in Sydney to go to area ""O"" to drop bags after going through immigration and customs, but when we went there was told no, this is not Hawaiian bag drop. We had to go outside the terminal to be confronted with no signage and lot of lines seemingly going nowhere. Immigration and customs had already taken an hour, we had only a 2 hour gap between flights. Eventually nearly in tears we found a lovely lady from HA who took our bags from us and told us to run to the security line which we did, then another sprint to the gate. Made it on to the flight but when we arrived that night in SFO our bags didn't make it - we were without luggage for a day and a half. In my experience with HNL airport (probably been there over 10 times) it's fine if you're coming in and staying but when you try to transfer to a different flight it's just a nightmare. Seriously, add some signage! English is my first language and I couldn't find my way around - imagine if you were coming from a non English speaking country - no chance!"
13th August 2017,1,"""complete lack of organization""","✅ Verified Review | Departing out of Honolulu is similar to using a 3rd world country airport as far as their security is concerned. My flight was to depart at 715 AM, and I arrived at the airport at 515 AM. I used the luggage valet, which meant that they took care of the agriculture screen and checking the bags. (Well worth the tip as a side note, no time spent with checking the bags). I have TSA pre-check and flew first class for this flight. I waited in a security line labelled TSA pre-check, which was approx. 20 yards long. After 10 minute wait, a staff member came to us and told us to move to another area to wait, and assured me that there also was a TSA pre-check. Once I walked 40 yards to get to the new area, one had to enter through a door, and encountered another member of staff. She rudely said ""no separate for pre-check"". The line was long and winding, and since 20-30 showed up more after us, there was now going back to the original line. We did not want this somewhat inefficient experience to ruin our Hawaii vacation, so we patiently waited. After 20 minutes of wait, a group of 20-30 travellers showed up. Since there were so many of them, the security staff decided to open up a new line and let these folks essentially go to the front of the line! The staff said this was being done to move the lines along. What about those of us with Pre-check, who showed up 2 hours earlier, patiently waiting in line? What is maddening the most, is the complete lack of organization. No preferential treatment for people who were waiting in line, no preferential treatment for TSA pre-check, etc. The line is being managed by someone who could care less about customer service or fairness. Really leaves a bad taste upon leaving after a Hawaii vacation. Honolulu Airport authority needs to seriously look at how they run their services at peak times."
24th June 2017,3,"""they have no wifi""","✅ Verified Review |  It's 2017 and they have no wifi. Upon my arrival, I inquired at an info desk and was told they are currently installing wifi. Upon my departure, I experienced rude and unprofessional ""welcomes"" at four restaurants, including: PGA Tour Grill, California Pizza Kitchen, Gordon Biersch, and The Local at HNL. I walked away from all of them, finding a very professional young man working at Burger King. I arrived at 6 pm and 80% of the stores were closed."
12th June 2017,1,"""most unorganized airport""","✅ Verified Review | Honolulu has been one of the worst airport experiences of my life. I flew in on an international flight and was told I had to get my bag, recheck it, and then go through security again. There were signs to mainland USA, but when I got to the sign where it said to take the elevator, there was no floor number to go to. So I just had to pick a floor. When I finally found Hawaiian check-in there was just one huge queue. No one knew what they were doing, half of the check in computers were not working, and then I couldn't even get a seat number when I dropped my bag off. Then security took 45 minutes, and the line was not that long. Finally got through security and had to walk a mile to find my gate. These sound like little things, but this was the most unorganized airport I've ever been to. I will try at all costs to never fly through here or use Hawaiian Airlines again."
20th May 2017,7,"""had no problems at all""","✅ Verified Review |  We had read some bad reviews about the airport at Honolulu but had no problems at all. We applied for a ESTA Visa which gave us reassurance about entering USA. The customs officer on arrival was very welcoming and when we departed we were met by a gentleman at the Air NZ area and what a huge difference he made, just couldn't believe how the stresses of travelling could be completely alleviated by such a helpful and cheerful fellow who made us feel like royalty. Once again, clearing customs was smooth, first time we've had to take off shoes etc but that's America. The arrivals area was in need of brightening but the departures area had good facilities and seemed pleasant."
20th February 2017,1,"""entire Airport needs a face lift""","✅ Verified Review |  This entire Airport needs a face lift, bathrooms are in very poor conditions, majority of electrical outlets do not function, some are held together with tie wrap. For the amount of visitors that travel through this airport, this airport should be Primo."
1st January 2017,1,"""chaos the only descriptor that fits""","Honolulu is possibly the worst major United States airport. Because it is a major entry point for foreigners visiting the USA, it is an embarrassment, not only to Hawaii but to the country. The airport is massive and sprawling, yet poorly signed. Connecting from inter-island to a mainland flight requires walking down many confusing aisles and escalators and then waiting for a shuttle. We left from Gate 8. The sevices consisted of a shop selling heated-up frozen pizzas and an overwhelmed Quiznos. This, in an airport where every flight is hours long. The bathrooms were so filthy as to be septic - and in poor repair. The public areas are dimly lit and the check-in (united) was a joke. The lines to board crossed the lines of those seeking assistance. Chaos is the only descriptor that fits."
18th September 2016,1,"""totally inadequate signage""","A stressful transit experience. Queues extremely long that did not appear to be moving. Unhelpful Hawaiian Airlines ground staff, some were abrupt and rude. With totally inadequate signage we were forced to ask for help and the response from staff added to the stress. We ran between queues. Two and a half hours should be enough time to change connecting flights - not in Honolulu. We had no time for a drink or toilet stop."
7th May 2016,2,"""TSA pre-check a total joke""","I have no desire to return to Hawaii at this point, this having been my fourth trip there. The TSA pre-check which I was assigned was a total joke. They were merging regular passengers with pre-checked ones which made the line go slow and negated the whole purpose of pre-check. I complained and a not so pleasant exchanged ensued with other passengers backing me. Also American Airlines had no curbside bag check after I stood in line for 15 minutes was rudely told by a Delta employee they couldn't help me. Also all of the televisions in the airport play sports, not one had the news on so I couldn't watch the primaries that day. I read all the other comments and agree with the observations. Like I said, it'll be a long long time if ever I have any desire to return to Hawaii."
15th April 2016,1,"""definitely showing its age""",This is the most poorly designed airport in the US. It's definitely showing its age. There is only one moving sidewalk from the Hawaiian terminal so you have to walk from one end of the terminal to the other which can amount to more than a half mile. Ridiculous. Everything in the airport looks weathered and worn. It definitely needs to be brought into the 21st Century.
26th December 2015,2,"""disgusted with airport staff""","We flew from Auckland to San Jose with a transfer in Honolulu. What a nightmare. Because we rode in the front of the plane, there was minimal wait getting through customs and, for once, we had the good fortune to be interviewed by a human TSA agent. After you collect your bags from the carousel, you have to stand in line again to run all your checked and carry-on baggage through an x-ray machine. They're searching for biological items that could disrupt Hawaii's agricultural balance. Upon exiting x-ray, you hand over your checked luggage, and all the in-transit passengers are directed to a specific exit. Once outside the exit, you have no idea where to go. There are no signs. We asked an airport employee outside, who acted like we greatly inconvenienced her with our question. She waved us off toward another building, and we dodged busy vehicle traffic to cross a road, dragging our bags. Upon arriving at the second building's entrance, we rode an escalator up to the second floor to go through security screening again, in order to board our connecting flight. We were then told that we had to exit the building and re-enter through another door to get to security. Brilliant logistics, whoever planned that mess. So we went outside, walked down to the next door, went back in and breezed through security due to our TSA pre-check status. After security, we inquired where to find the Business Class Lounge and were told that it was in the other building. So to use the lounge, we'd have had to retrace all our steps, undergo security screening in the other building, only to return two hours later to undergo security screening a third time before boarding our flight. Again brilliant planning. While standing in line to board our flight, an extremely arrogant Hawaiian Air employee showed up and began to bark orders about the size of carry-on bags. When a woman near us had the audacity to answer that her carry-on bag had accompanied her thus far, so she knew it fit, he grabbed it and measured it, and declared that it didn't fit. We could all see that it did indeed fit into the metal measuring standard at the gate, but he grabbed it from her, tagged it, ordered her to take any medications out of it, and sent it off to be loaded under the plane. He did the same to her husband. Then he directed his attention at Hubby and me, and I showed him our first class tickets. He retreated, though my carry-on was obviously wider than theirs, and went on to harass other poor souls flying economy class. It's evident that this old airport was thrown together hodgepodge and there was absolutely no planning for passenger convenience or ease of access. I am utterly disgusted with Hawaiian Airlines airport staff at Honolulu."
9th November 2015,1,"""gave up waiting for my wheelchair""","Arrived at HNL after flight was delayed for 3 hours. Gave up waiting for my wheelchair to be returned to me at the gate. Made my own way to baggage claim with my wife's help. Lots of building work so it was very confusing to navigate. Finally arrived at baggage reclaim to find all of my fellow travellers still there. Only 2 baggage handlers on duty apparently. Finally managed to collect our cases with the assistance of another passenger. Asked one man where my wheelchair would arrive. He smiled and said, ""don't know"" and that was it. We got it back shortly afterwards. Finally made it to the car rental shuttle bus to take us to the new car hire building. The airport looked like a building site and a poorly organised one at that. Insufficient staff and signage available to help able bodied and disabled passengers alike. It was also deserted, something that I did not expect for an international airport. It took me 20 minutes, with assistance, to get off the plane, get luggage and clear immigration / customs at LAX. It took me an hour just to find baggage claim and get my luggage at HNL. Not acceptable."
27th June 2015,6,Honolulu Airport customer review,"Having traveled to and through Honolulu quite a lot over the past two years, I have to agree that it is an older and sometimes chaotic airport but I always found it tolerable and somewhat charming in a tropical sort of way until now (arrival, taxis etc are another matter). Traveling from here to the other islands has sometimes been unpredictable but I have had no real complaints. But now (2015) the usual difficulties of traveling out of Honolulu have been compounded by construction. Problems include crammed lines at agriculture security, no one to deal with priority customers (in my case American Airlines), a long walk and terrible mash up of a line up at the non TSA checkpoint (curiously my line this time around - June - was almost all females with children), one line for everyone, no faster lane as in almost all medium sized or large airports. I am sorry for older folks or folks with disabilities who might have to contend with this. There is one positive thing at HNL and that is that I have always found the Security staff to be polite and usually cheery. That makes the airport experience more tolerable."
20th November 2014,3,Honolulu Airport customer review,"I transited HNL twice on my way from San Francisco to Auckland recently and wished I hadn't. On my outbound trip after I got off my flight from SF I searched for information about where my connecting gate was. There was simply none to be had the first screens I found were blank then there were some ""arrivals"" screens (not very helpful in the departures area). I walked halfway down the terminal to baggage claim in the heat since there was no continuous air-conditioned walkway and the first ""departures"" screen I found only had about one hour's worth of flights on it; mine was still two hours away. Just then I heard a loudspeaker announcement saying it would depart from the gate right next to the one from which I had just disembarked. The return trip was not much better there was a similar lack of information compounded by the need to go through customs and immigration. It became clear that HNL was never meant as an international transit point - the path of travel was chaotic (up stairs down stairs through various inside and outside corridors to end up close to where I had started in the first place) and the personnel surly. Not much aloha here. It's also worth mentioning that the terminal has birds flying around it to such an extent that some of the seats in the departure lounge had bird poop on them."
17th September 2014,7,Honolulu Airport customer review,It is an old and open-air airport and I imagine it is not like any other you have flown through. It could be larger especially the airport lounges (and they could be closer to the gates). That said it is easy to navigate there are enough shops around the gates though there could be more food options. The gate areas are small and far from the main terminal where security is located. It could do with a massive renovation but I am nostalgic and have been using HNL since the 1970's and it kind of takes me back.
10th June 2014,1,Honolulu Airport customer review,Stuck for 10 hours. Came from Osaka. Leaving customs found almost no none checked on facilities. One coffee and one bar joint total for one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. So I had to check in. Place is dark and dirty. Worst prices in the United States. Chaotic check in. Noisy. Avoid HNL.
24th July 2013,1,Honolulu Airport customer review,"One of the ugliest airports existing on US territory. Arrival on the International ""terminal"" compels you to take horrible buses where you have to literally climb stairs. Checking-in for inter-island flights is rude. No wi-fi no store nothing. Departure for US domestic flights in confused. Only attractive: nice furniture. Boarding lounges are too small queues for security don't fit in the allocated space."
22nd March 2013,3,Honolulu Airport customer review,Although the design of the airport may have worked in the 70s when it was built today's security requirements make many of the airport's spaces either cramped or abandoned. The first floor gates have ugly dividers corralling the gates creating narrow bottlenecks in the passageways. Meanwhile the entire second floor is completely abandoned with old ceiling tiles laying about. In general it isn't a very welcoming design.
27th October 2012,7,Honolulu Airport customer review,Aesthetically Honolulu Airport is a throwback to the 70s. For a place that is supposed to welcome people to a tropical paradise it is heavy and dark concrete architecture. There needs to be more wood greenery and updates to the fixtures. If you are taking Hawaiian Airlines to a connecting neighbor island flight be prepared to walk if you are in the far terminal where some mainland and international flights are parked. Its even a farther walk (or ride on the Wiki-wiki shuttle) if you're on Alaska Airlines. Our flight from Seattle parked at the far terminal and we had less than an hour to our connecting flight to Hilo. It was a mad dash with several co-passengers in tow scrambling for directions. Fortunately we made it in time. The airport is trying to make improvements and there are better dining options along with more shopping for people waiting at the gates for their flight. You may want to eat before coming to the airport as prices are steep. Its really nice to hear announcements in Hawaiian too which reminds you this is Hawaii after all.
12th September 2012,2,Honolulu Airport customer review,Although they are trying to improve the airport at least in a cosmetic sense it has to be once of the worst designs ever with marathon hikes to go anywhere and dark dingy areas which are truly hideous. Having come and gone through Honolulu some 12 times since early 2011 I can at least say that the immigration security and customs people are generally pleasant and polite this not always being the case in the US who generally have some of the rudest and surliest officials on earth! Officiousness and coldness are general characteristics elsewhere in my experience over 50 years plus of travel. Since I spend a lot of time in Hawaii where I own a home there is at least a bit of a positive here.
15th July 2011,2,Honolulu Airport customer review,I was amazed that a city so known for its tourism has such an outdated airport. Someone wrote that the decor was 1980's I would say it looks like vintage 1960's or 70's. The bathrooms looked as old in disrepair and with filthy floors. There is no free wifi nor could I find a place to charge up my electronics. You have to get around on a clunky bus shuttle between terminals and there are no good restaurants out by the gates. I ate literally the worst sandwich of my life at the Quiznos subs; it was total (overpriced) lump of mush. It's not even possible to buy a bag of normal packaged pretzels at the newstand just a tiny zip-lock bag of them for $5. Positives: you can buy leis upon arrival and even the security staff had that friendly aloha spirit.
14th May 2011,1,Honolulu Airport customer review,Whoever designed this airport must not have been thinking too clearly or had very little background in airport design. This is without a doubt one of the world's most confusing illogical places to depart arrive or change planes. There is no sensible flow from one part of the airport to the other. Gates are scattered about in a way that makes it difficult to get from one to the other. Transport between terminals via Wiki-Wiki shuttle is inefficient. Arriving internationally involved the longest walk imaginable from the gate to customs. No signage at all after clearing customs for onward journeys on domestic flights. They should tear it down and start over.
12th October 2010,1,Honolulu Airport customer review,Found the checkin and agriculture check in process at Honolulu airport totally chaotic and staffing unable to cope with demand. Long winding lines of hundreds of confused and stressed people queuing to check baggage at kiosks as commanded by 2 yelling roving staff. Directions are not apparent outside the airport building (where lines begin) and its not until you reach the beginning of the queue and get close to a human to find out you need to be on another line. People were treated like cattle. We were in a line for an hour and a half lost our visa card in the confusion and were charged baggage fees when not required.
6th September 2010,2,Honolulu Airport customer review,Inter-island terminal (also used by Hawaiian Airlines flights to the U.S. mainland). The terminal looks like a 1980s time warp. Dark corridors dirty carpeting cluttered floor space between jetway and hallway dirty restrooms limited concessions and the worst food of any airport in the USA. If you're stuck with a long layover bring a good book or a laptop and your own food.
1st September 2010,3,Honolulu Airport customer review,This is an unusual airport to say the least. International arrivals are relatively straight forward although the immigration hall can be very crowded when 2 or more flights arrive. Waiting times in excess of an hour are not unusual in the passport control hall. Queues can be horrendous and disorganised at International check-in. If you are flying Star Class on Jet Star beware that you do have a priority check-in but there are no signs directing you to it. This can easily save you an hour. Security staff are typically surly and disinterested TSA employees. They try to cram as many people as possible through one small x-ray machine/metal detector so allow a minimum of 30 minutes to clear security. Airside is average - whilst it is hardly to the standard of Changi or Hong Kong there are some shops selling overpriced souvenirs books and food. The open air walkways are very pleasant and provide a nice tropical feel to the terminal. International departure lounges are very plain with old and uncomfortable seats. A full A330/B747 will result in standing room only. They apply a quarantine method here: once you are in your departure lounge you cannot go back to the shops. Overall it is probably one of the better US airports but it still has a lot of work to do.
26th August 2010,3,Honolulu Airport customer review,This airport desperately needs a major overhaul. It amazes me how such a busy airport can be left to deteriorate and not receive any funds to remodel into a modern airport in the pacific. The airport is gloomy and screaming out for a make over. Staff are always pleasant at all times which is the island way of doing things. I also noticed that checking in can be shambles with staff trying to keep people in straight lines.
23rd August 2010,3,Honolulu Airport customer review,"Whilst this may not be the most modern airport I like the design. It is open (welcome in those islands) & airy. The bars/diners may not be the best nor cheapest but it is O'ahu; it has to be expected. The plant shops are a delight for those who like growing things. Produce not so much. My gripe is the staff at check in & security. They appear to hate their jobs yet feel secure in them. Try security upon leaving. Go First Class on United United do not care & security will ignore ""Priority"" passengers just because scanty clad young(ish) girlies are going through. Whooppee! One month later premier economy... ""You are not flying First sir I know! use THAT line"" YEP He knew exactly which class I was flying each time & yet failed to give any priority. Males be warned. So I shall not be flying first through THAT airport again. All the islands have airports they all inter-connect. Really the directly employed staff let down HNL & leave a very nasty taste with their attitude. This Xmas we shall be trying Kaui'i. Let the recession resolve the issues management fail to address."
11th May 2010,1,Honolulu Airport customer review,First time back in Hawaii after 15 years. Nothing has changed in all that time - still a dark and dingy airport with little natural lighting. I am sure that prisoners see more light! Immigration on arrival took 50 minutes. On departure after clearing security there are limited facilities. If the state government of Hawaii had any money they should bulldoze this airport and build a new one.
19th April 2010,3,Honolulu Airport customer review,Arrived and departed during lunch time on Delta. Once you deplane you have to walk a long way to the Delta baggage claim and signage is not very good. The airport is old but everything works. I found it quite interesting to leave the gate area and walk outdoors to the main terminal where baggage claim and the arrival hall is. Baggage was delivered within a few minutes after the first pax made the long hike. Once outside I found the official airport shuttle to Waikiki and was on my way. Departure was just as swift with your bags being scanned by the agriculture department before heading to check-in. The departure lobby is really very old and baggages are stacked behind the check-in counter before being transported to the plane. Security was quite quick and if you are leaving on an international flight you have a nice choice of duty free goods but if you leave on a domestic flight like I did there really is not much. I had some Japanese food before heading to the gate area and I was glad that the plane left almost on time as it's pretty boring being stuck in that airport for long. As I was on vacation I did not mind HNL but I guess if you are travelling on business through HNL on a regular basis it would not be such a good experience.
26th February 2010,3,Honolulu Airport customer review,Been five years since we last used this airport and it's still exactly the same. A throw back to the 60's although they appear to be doing some upgrade work at the moment. Be aware if you are on an early morning flight we had a 7am departure and all checked baggage has to be screened by the agriculture department before you can go to check in and nothing opens before 5am so no point in arriving mega early. Not a lot in the way of eateries and everything very basic. Staff friendly enough though. Never a problem with immigration as most international travelers from Europe have already cleared immigration prior to departing for Honolulu. No hassles.
12th February 2009,2,Honolulu Airport customer review,I was first at Honolulu Airport in 1981 and thought it was an airport out of the 1960's. Nothing has changed much. I was there in December 2008 (in transit) and again in January 2009 on way back to Sydney. The decor has not changed the food choices are very limited and so are the shops. Pity if you are catching an Hawaiian Airlines flight. After we checked in got our boarding passes and went through security you have to walk for miles to the gate (no shuttle bus was made available. They make an announcement to passengers to enter the gate lounge but once there you cannot leave (pity if you have to go to the toilet). Only one small shop available to buy souvenirs and only place to purchase drinks near the gate was Starbucks and they were a rip-off. Honolulu is in desperate need of a makeover as it looks old and tired.
23rd June 2008,2,Honolulu Airport customer review,In the 1980s Honolulu Airport was appalling and I was sorry to discover that it still is. Poor design has put courtesy phones half a mile (it seems) from baggage collection so ring your hotel or shuttle -- Reliable shuttle bus is great -- before collecting bags or you'll have to drag them back a long way to the phones.
23rd May 2008,3,Honolulu Airport customer review,"I have been travelling thru the Honolulu airport for over 15 years and many of the comments here are very true. Poor decor very poor signage uneven staff regarding knowledge and ""aloha spirit"". But many are just fine helpful. Fortunately its not a large airport which makes it easier to have patience. The food choices and shopping you see at other international airports just does not exist. Most taxis are honest and the rates are approx $3.00 per mile to the Waikiki area 12 miles away. But some are not. I had one airport taxi charge me $49 to Waikiki. Thats not even close even in bad traffic. I have found its easiest to make arrangements with one of the flat rate ""car service"" companies. Its less than full meter rates and most dont charge for regular baggage. They will have someone waiting for you. Its nice to know you'll be on your way when your ready. Security checkpoints can often be long and curbside for departures can also get congested. Because of Hawaii's location and the time differences to Asia and US Mainland many flight arrive and depart within the same time ""window"" to accommodate with the mainland schedules. Its unavoidable. Overall its not the best airport but not the worst either."
10th January 2008,3,Honolulu Airport customer review,Checking in at HNL airport is like waiting in line at a busy subway station. Very dark poorly lit and totally colorless. One commentator likened it to a cement parkade. Once past the security area it does get better. The open area is very nice. Though small in size there is a lovely garden area in a V shape where one can walk and watch the planes dock and depart. On my last arrival I found it a long walk from our gate to the baggage pick up. Some of the staff could perhaps do well by treating people to the Aloha Spirit that permeates throughout the islands. Improvements are being made at this airport.
12th November 2007,4,Honolulu Airport customer review,This is a busy but relatively small airport. Some improvements currently being made in the departure area - but catering and shopping is limited. The best thing about the airport are the wonderfully manicured lush gardens with water features and ponds with koi carp. Not a bad place to wait for a delayed flight!
17th October 2007,3,Honolulu Airport customer review,I have flown in and out of Honolulu a few times and it reminds me of arriving in a car park in a 80's shopping centre. Its true it has a laid back Hawaiian feel about it. But I do think the state gov could spend money on a refurb. It is an international gateway from Asia South Pcific. Restaurants cafesduty free internet etc! The check in area at the inter island terminal is a mess with 2 security check points both for mainland and international flights. So if your on a Hawaiian flight you must stay in the queue which ends outside the door of the terminal at peak times with no signage. Make it a true aloha welcome!
20th August 2007,2,Honolulu Airport customer review,"Waiting 2 hours to get your passport to be stamped by the US Immigration is unacceptable. Our flight is arrived at the same time with 3 Asian Jumbos. The immigration was crowded and they couldn't cope with the high number of pax. Thanks to a ground staff who directed us ""Australian passengers arrived with Hawaiian Airlines"" to the US citizen entry point then we were out in 10 minutes. We almost missed our connection flight to Kahului. On the way back to Sydney all was OK. We were warned by a friendly domestic terminal staff if wanted to eat something before we caught the shuttle bus to international terminal we should eat at domestic terminal as the international terminal has very limited to offer to eat or to shop anything. Very basic international terminal. The airport looks tired like Kahului Airport."
27th August 2006,n/a,Honolulu Airport customer review,"I may have an answer to Pam Frank's query. I would have to give the Supreme Order of the Jobsworths Award to the staff who operate the USDA machine at Honolulu airport for American Airlines. This is a joint award given also to the person who refused to let us put our hold bags through the other USDA machine being used not more than 30 feet away as we were not travelling with ""her"" airline!. When we arrived at this airport for our flight back to LAX there was a sign near this machine informing pax that this machine operated at 5.30 am and 10am. There was nothing else there indicating where pax should line up to get their hold luggage x-rayed so of course when said staff arrived at 10am (and not a minute beforehand) to start work there were three lines of pax and total chaos. So what do said staff do - they started to shout at the pax because of the disorderly lines!. Very helpful not. Please do us all a favour and operate a proper queueeing system by having some poles set out and a sign saying ""line starts here"". That is not hard to do now is it?! Anyhow once hold bags had a sticker placed on them we made our way with our hold luggage over to the American airlines check in desk. Fortunately the woman we saw had some common sense and readily assisted us. After receiving our boarding passes we stood in line for the security checkpoint to open (they werent quite ready for us yet!). Once through there you are airside. I like Honolulu airport overall (its far better than practically all the other US airports I have visited) as its open to the elements and it has plenty of shops and restaurants catering to passengers needs. One last point - we flew at a time when the no liquids on planes rule had been introduced a few days prior. Two pax boarded our AA flight with drinks from the food court and no-one said anything at the gate! Makes a mockery of the whole exercise!"
31st May 2006,n/a,Honolulu Airport customer review,I can't understand why Honolulu airport security would not let our clients in the airport 4 hours earlier than their flight. When they arrived they were told they could not go in until 2 hours before this is strange because all the airlines tell you  you must check in 3 hours prior to return to the mainland. They wanted to get a bite to eat first and be at the airport. Then when they asked about a rental car they were told to go stand in the middle of the highway and flag down one of the car rental companies. How rude and inconsiderate! I have never had anyone be turned away from an airport because they showed up earlier for their flight home I have been selling tickets for 30 years. This has put a x in the box for places I do not want to send my clients. Now we have to call all the people we have going on a group cruise and let them know just how inconvenient the Honolulu airport will be when they go to return home.
26th March 2006,n/a,Honolulu Airport customer review,I'm originally from Hawaii live in Japan and fly the Narita-Honolulu route at least once a month usually on JAL. My comments about Honolulu's airport: except for the international departure terminal which has undergone a lot of renovation and has plenty of shops (though not much in the way of restaurant choices) the airport is definitely showing its age. While it's nice to have the open-air lobbies and terminals and the greenery that should characterize Hawaii's gateway stepping inside presents a gloomy poorly lit run-down plain-old dusty interior. Much of the airport looks as though people seldom use it. With the state budget in surplus and tourism up the local government really needs to look at making improvements beyond the duty-free shops catering to the Japanese visitor. Domestic (Hawaii-Mainland) terminals and gates are certainly far behind the clean bright mall-like atmosphere of many newer airports elsewhere. There were a lot of comments about immigration and customs. I have never had a problem (though Immigration booths are often understaffed) - usually getting from arrival gate through immigration and customs in no more than 10-15 minutes. It pains me to see people talking about rude staff in Honolulu especially - the very place the Aloha spirit is most needed.
16th November 2005,n/a,Honolulu Airport customer review,"The first problem as already explained by previous poster is the lack of adequate signals around the airport which prompts for common mistakes. Following our arrival the entire group of passengers got lost in its way to the baggage claim areas. Perhaps we made the mistake of not taking the ""Wik-Wiki"" transports but those vehicles were so slow. Security can be an issue especially with all the laws that protect the ecological environment of the island which is quite understandable. Still the achille's point of the airport is that is so far away from the city. The transport system from/and to the airport is frankly pathetic and don't be surprised if you wait 15 minutes for an overpriced cab."
12th November 2005,n/a,Honolulu Airport customer review,"After living in Honolulu for the better part of two years and making about a dozen trips to/from the mainland US I've conluded that HNL is one of the most antiquated ""major"" airports in the US. Check-in lines are often lengthy as most domestic flight departures are bunched n the early morning mid afternoon or late evening and are jumbo jets full with tourists. Security generally moves well but once inside you'll find nothing but a couple of sundries shops an archaic bookstore two dirty fast food restaurants and a dilapidated bar. Gate areas are straight out of the early 70s and are in bad need of a makeover/refurbishment. Like to chew gum on an airplane? Bring it ahead of time as it's not sold in the airport because it ""makes a mess"". Amazingly cigarettes are available wherever you turn presumably because they don't make a mess! When arriving domestically avoid the wiki-wiki (""express"" in Hawaiian) buses and opt for the three minute walk to baggage claim. Be patient if you choose to take a taxi - a wait upwards of 20-30 minutes is not uncommon. In short HNL has a long way to go to catch up to other mainland and Asian airports."
18th March 2022,1,"""I would not fly out of here again""","Not Verified |  Horrendous treatment by TSA on March 18, 2022. I would not fly out of here again. Extremely rude, unfriendly and unhelpful."
24th July 2021,10,"""It has a casual laid back atmosphere""",✅ Trip Verified | I been through many airports and no one airport is the same other than it is an airport with like amenities and services. However like amenities and services do vary in traveler experience. Indianapolis Airport is by far the best at everything. It has a casual laid back atmosphere but it’s efficient in all aspects of getting passengers to and from their positions whether you are coming or going. The bathrooms are clean and in working order. Food vendors are unique and suitable and quick to get you in and out. The next closest airport to Indy I would have to say is Phoenix.
21st June 2021,6,"""Do better""",✅ Trip Verified | It's 3.30 on a Sunday afternoon. Both coffee shops and the 3 quick pick restaurants are closed. This forces people to have to pay $11 for for sandwich that's possibly been in a cooler for 3 days. Do better.
17th February 2021,6,"""they seem to be intentionally not following guidelines""",Not Verified |  Maintenance/janitorial guys - using their mask for their beards only - walking around boldly with nose and mouth not covered - watched them for some time and they seem to be intentionally not following guidelines - we're all in this together and need to follow health guidelines.
24th December 2018,8,"""repeated service deficiency""","✅ Trip Verified | Overall, this is a good--even excellent--airport. However, once my husband required a wheelchair to get to and from the gates, we encountered a significant and repeated service deficiency. This last trip was not, unfortunately, an anomaly. We called ahead, followed instructions to call again when we were within ten minutes of the airport. No wheelchair. The attendants at curbside luggage called again, and pointed to a bench where we were to wait for the chair. Twenty minutes elapsed; no chair. I asked at the service desk. Another ten minutes and no chair. I finally found one and pushed him most of the way to the concourse when a wheelchair attendant finally appeared and took him the rest of the way. We have not encountered this in any other airport. If we had not had similar, repeated problems at Indianapolis International, I would not complain. This is really unacceptable."
5th June 2018,10,"""very clean and well-maintained""
","❌ Not Verified |  Indianapolis International Airport is great. Since it is relatively new, the inside is very clean and well-maintained. Compared to other US airports, it's significantly less crowded. The waiting areas by the gates are very nice with USB chargers and outlets, and there are many great stores and restaurants in the terminals. Baggage claim is nice and checking in is easy. Before you even go through security, there is a very nice food court. Staff are always friendly and parking is convenient."
21st January 2017,1,"""I must have missed my car""","The five storey parking garage has the same color scheme, and relative letter/number combinations on each floor. I never dreamed this was possible, so spent more than an hour wandering back and forth on the same floor figuring I must have missed my car. This was while I was dragging three bags and I'm 74 years old.  The first person I asked after 1/2 hour said of course the number scheme was different on each floor. Exhausted, I finally returned to terminal where they told me number and colors identical on each floor. So I found my car on third floor I tried. This can be fixed easily in the future by putting a sign at end of each row facing the center access on each floor (maybe 20-30 signs per floor) reading Color, Lettering, Numbering scheme identical on each floor."
9th July 2015,10,Indianapolis Airport customer review,"I've been through Indianapolis many times as I live in the area, and the airport is fantastic. Security here is a breeze and there are decent food choices before and after security as well. The airport is also extremely easy to navigate and is definitely visually pleasing. "
28th March 2010,5,Indianapolis Airport customer review,I've departed and arrived at IND several times but only once at the new terminal. It's quite an improvement over the old terminal. As a departing passenger you'll walk in to your airlines check-in area where check-in and baggage drop is very easy. Then you enter Civic Plaza which is a a food court/shopping area which is open to the public. As you enter Civic Plaza the domestic terminal Terminal A is on your right and Terminal B the international terminal is on your left. I generally fly early in the morning and security is a breeze at that time. After you get into your terminal you can go between the 2 terminals freely without having to go back through security. There's plenty of seating at the gates. There is plenty of shopping and eating on the airside. The food is also very affordable as the airport had to agree to keep the food at street prices with just an extra 1% tax on it. Overall a great place to start and/or end a trip.
25th January 2010,4,Indianapolis Airport customer review,Modern new terminal and a pleasurable experience. it is extremely easy to navigate compared to other airports around the country. It is very wide airy and open. Check in is easy and the terminal has many amenities. It feels like a nice food court or outlet store with many shops and restaurants to stop at. The art inside the terminal and concourses are a nice touch. Security is fairly quick and easy. Both of the concourses are identical in design. They are fairly short so no long walks like in Denver. Inside the terminal there are family restrooms and clear signs. Kids can watch their favorite TV show and there is adequate gate seating.
16th August 2009,4,Indianapolis Airport customer review,The new IND terminal is excellent. Built along the architectural lines of HKG airport it is spacious and well-designed. Dining opportunities abound both inside and outside the secure areas and the moving walkways are well-spaced and speedy. The lavatories are clean and open and baggage claim well-lit and possesses sufficient signage. The only downside to this facility is the purpose-built security area which is designed well but still staffed by the TSA which means that the humiliation and incompetence zone includes slow-moving lines constant barking from the agents and inconsistent application of nebulous security rules.
15th June 2009,4,Indianapolis Airport customer review,The new terminal of the Indianapolis airport is now open and is very nice. There are two concourses (A and B) with 25 gates each. The terminal is very bright and open thanks to all the glass. There's a large circular shopping area pre-security that has plenty of room and seating. There is a decent variety and number of shops/restaurants after security for an airport of this size including some with sit down service. The security areas are very spacious and have 7 lanes each. They did have only 2 guards checking boarding passes however in the security section that we went through. My only complaint was there was always a line 5-6 people deep for the mens restroom near our gate. Not sure if they're all like that or not but it seems like poor planning given that it wasn't really all that busy in the airport the day we flew out.
26th February 2007,n/a,Indianapolis Airport customer review,I fly through IND a few times a year and find it fairly simple due mainly to its small size. The queues through security seem to get longer and look worse than they are mainly because it was built before security was the priority it became since 9/11 - the queues often stretch back into the shopping and food court area. Hopefully the new terminal will have much improved facilities. The first time I used the airport I made the mistake of going through into the departure area too early - haven't done it again as the facilities there are limited to say the least. All in all nothing great nothing too bad - not somewhere you'd want to spend too much time but does offer a relatively stress-free travelling experience.
31st August 2004,n/a,Indianapolis Airport customer review,The best thing about IND is the availability of low fares. IND is nobody's hub but there are nonstops to lots of destinations. Service from ATA Southwest Frontier and now Independence Air keep the fares really low unless you're flying to someone's fortress hub like Minneapolis. And thanks to Northwest IND now has nonstops to Boston Raleigh/Durham Hartford and a bunch of others. The airport itself isn't too bad. There's a decent food court and a few shops - plenty for the departing passenger to pass the time but much less than hub-airports offer. The two areas in greatest need of improvement are the restrooms which tend to be well-worn and sometimes dirty; and the security lines which can really back up at peak travelling times. IND is building a new midfield terminal which won't be ready for a few years yet; but when it's open it should make IND one of the nicest airports in the US.
9th January 2004,n/a,Indianapolis Airport customer review,Indianapolis airport is not particularly exciting but is extremely functional small and easy to navigate around. The checks are conducted in an efficient timely manner and there is generally no problem whatsoever. The problem I have faced is in the departure lounge there seems to be a lack of seating as is the case in many American airports especially during busy hours.
4th December 2003,n/a,Indianapolis Airport customer review,A very nondescript airport fairly quiet limited eating and shopping facilities. Some areas are a little dingy.
20th March 2022,1,"""food venues close at 6pm on a Saturday night""","✅ Trip Verified | Bad service, food venues close at 6pm on a Saturday night during spring break. Traveling with kids flight delayed no food venues open, it doesn’t even makes sense. Not enough charging stations."
19th March 2022,1,"""one of the worst airports ever""","Not Verified |  This has to be one of the worst airports ever - on arrival in the middle of the night there was no one to ask for any help but the worst time was on departure the left luggage was full so we couldn’t leave our items and had to wait 8 hours in the airport, no internet at all even to pay for! Who doesn’t have internet, it’s dangerous especially when you have to sort out locator forms we had to pay for internet time at the airport hotel to ensure we could check in - no seats available at the airport and it was dirty and simply awful. Never again such a shame"
28th February 2022,1,"""service at this airport is bad""",✅ Trip Verified |  The service at this airport is bad and they don’t know how to treat customers. The service at store coffee roasters is very slow and the employees don’t treat customers good. Hope people buy their coffee at other concessions with better customer service.
18th October 2021,2,"""airport is dirty, the service is horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airport I have ever travelled through. As a Puerto Rican myself, I am very ashamed that this airport is what tourists see when they come here. The airport is dirty, the service is horrible, the food is lacking, food court isn’t existent. Bar service, those that are open, is characterized by their rudest behavior. The prices are the highest I have ever seen and the food is awful. The people of Puerto Rico don’t deserve an airport so mediocre that only can compare with third world countries airports. Shame, shame."
6th March 2021,1,"""it took me about 45 minutes to find somebody to help""","Not Verified |  Let me just start off by saying the communication between main land Americans and Puerto Rican Americans is so bad. I came from Arkansas on my way to the Virgin Islands and I had to layover in San Juan, it took me about 45 minutes to find somebody to help me, everyone I approached looked at me and with disgust and said they didn't speak English, I finally found a janitor that was willing to help me. I will never in my life go back through Puerto Rico or visit Puerto Rico, its such a shame the security screeners told me to go away. I was in distress and finally found where I was supposed to go, the walk was horrible like 20 minutes straight walking. I ended up having a panic attack."
4th June 2019,3,"""not a single person could help me""","Not Verified |  I arrived at San Juan airport on May 20 around 2 pm I speak no Spanish me and my boyfriend came for vacation. He speaks it I don’t. I got lost and was crying and freaking out I had lost my phone. And I had all these bags plus my cat. I had no clue where my boyfriend was. I talked to 5 different people that were working at the airport and not a single one of them could help me. The lady for lost luggage area was super rude to me and told me she could not look after any of my bags so I could go look for my boyfriend. Then I talked to a luggage guy and he literally ignored me. Then I even talked to an airport security and he could not help me either. I thought this was a tourist airport but not a single person could help me or understand me. No one would even let me use a phone they had. I think this is messed up on so many levels because I spent so much money to fly here and I got lost and not a single person could help me. Imagine a child getting lost and people just ignoring him or her because they speak english only and don’t understand them, leaving them to fend for themselves,It’s sad and a very scary thing, I am now afraid to go back to San Juan airport because of my experience and it needs to be heard and something needs to be done about it."
11th April 2019,3,San Juan Airport customer review,"Not Verified |  It is a shame that San Juan Puerto Rico has such a poor airport! The outlets dont work, the chairs are awful, not enough shopping and lets not start with the condition of the bathrooms! The food is over priced and bad. I will suggest for the management of this airport to visit Punta Cana airport! This will put them to shame. Puerto Rico a commonwealth of the USA you will think that the amenities or standards will be similar to those of USA? Wrong....nothing to be excited here!"
12th September 2018,2,"""very disappointing""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew out of SJU early this morning, decided to wait to have breakfast at the airport, that was a big mistake. There are no proper breakfast places to be had at Terminal B. There was this over priced coffee shop, with prepackaged pastries, and prices that would make Starbucks blush, a Margaritaville, great if you are an alcoholic and wanted early morning booze, and a Viena restaurant offering chicken wings, burgers, hot dogs and meat patties, seriously?Not a single item containing eggs on site, yet alone any proper breakfast foods. I am really shocked they did not even have a McDonalds, Burger King or Mesón, heck, any restaurant known to offer real breakfast foods, it's really very disappointing that an airport this size cannot even provide sufficient and proper restaurant options. Hoy por la mañana salí de la terminal B, no comí afuera del aeropuerto, ni antes del control de seguridad pensando que encontraría un lugar apropiado para desayunar. Pero ocurrió todo lo contrario, un local de café, con precios más caros que un Starbucks, un restaurant tipo bar, en serio! Y el Viena vendiendo comidas de almuerzo, cena a las 5:30 am, en serio? No podían poner un Mesón, o hasta un McDonalds o Buerguer King, al menos esos ofrecen desayunos como Dios manda, y algo común y normal en cualquier restaurante del tamaño del LMN por todo el mundo, da vergüenza ver empanadillas, alitas, hot dogs o dulces en vez de comida verdadera de desayuno."
14th February 2018,5,"""the bartender was rude""","✅ Trip Verified | The airport personnel were very helpful and the girls at Popeyes were very nice! Tried to get a cocktail at Mango's village bar and restaurant the bartender was rude, in fact he was so rude I walked away. Puerto Rico was wonderful just don’t go to Mango's on the way home!"
31st December 2016,7,"""displeased with security staff""","I loved San Juan airport and the facility. I was very displeased with security staff. I travel at least 3 times a month and have never encountered such rude people. I had 3am flight, was very sleepy, and forgot to throw away a tiny bottle of water (from the hotel). It was my fault and I do not minimize that. But after that I was treated with such disrespect like an offending criminal. My message to security staff - please be nice and more human. Just because somebody forgot to empty a bottle of water, you have no right to treat them poorly."
27th September 2016,5,"""less options for eating""","I have flown into and out of the San Juan airport often. The airport was not as bad as I had read online. Yes, there were many people because of the time of year, with very long lines. If they were better organized, they could move at a decent pace. I didn't have to wait too long to go through security. There are less options for eating but this is to be expected since the airport was taken over another company. They did away with a number of eateries. In fact, comparing before and after, I find the airport was more efficient when it was run by the local government than what it is with this different company."
7th March 2016,2,"""can and will take hours""",The TSA inspection station can and will take hours. Yes hour(s) plural. The lackadaisical way they operate insures hours of standing in line and a definite crunch of passengers panicking as their flights leave. They have four scanning stations with proper bag scanners etc. but you will find only two open despite huge snaking lines. Good luck.
8th December 2015,1,"""If you can avoid this airport""","I'm very frustrated with the way the new airport is set up. When you arrive from St Thomas, nobody directs you where to go. The employees are clueless. The terminal layouts are in disarray. The last time I was here there were many eateries and now there are only a handful. A breakfast spot only operates from 6 to 11. It was very frustrating when someone directed people to go outside to reach terminal A when you can easily walk to the terminal from the inside. And yes, please put readable signs and train the staff. If you can avoid this airport. Also, getting a flight out of this airport from 6pm to 12am is hell."
27th July 2014,3,San Juan Airport customer review,I arrived yesterday at SJU. The airport looked clean but it has changed a lot since my visit last year. A lot of the eateries were removed so choices are few and far between. The biggest change is moving the car rental companies to a parking lot across the street. There are no shuttles to take you where the car rentals are. If you have a lot of luggage you are going to have to hire a baggage handler to take your luggage where the car rental companies are at. Even if you don't have a lot or no luggage at all you have to walk a significant distance to reach the car rental companies. There a no pick ups for the disabled if you have to go there you'll have to do that on your own power. When asked about it to the car rental person she said that the Mexicans that operate the airport changed it. This arrangement surely violates ADA if someone wants to push with the Federal government I think they should.
19th November 2013,2,San Juan Airport customer review,1st time at SJU. Am a United 1k flyer. Looks like a modern airport but it truly is just for show. TSA pre-check line was allowing all kinds of non pre-check people into the line causing major confusion and delays. No Star Alliance lounge yet this is an airport with increasing passenger traffic and over 8.5 million passengers a year. Completely amateur. Avoid if possible.
18th November 2013,5,San Juan Airport customer review,An older largely uncrowded airport that seems to have the facilities you'd expect of a small-to-mid-size domestic airport. While arrival was easy departure was a bit of a pain for us due to the complete absence of baggage carts on the arrivals level either at the curb or inside. No skycaps except in the baggage claim area. And no apparent curbside check-in facility. This was a big factor since you have to first take your bags to a Department of Agriculture inspection area to be scanned then take them to your airline's check-in counter then take them to the x-ray security station. Line for TSA security was relatively short. Selection of eateries inside security was fine. Note to airport authorities: put some darn carts at the curb on the arrivals area! Getting exercise is fine but when it's hot departing from SJU can be a pain.
16th September 2013,2,San Juan Airport customer review,Returning to the US from St. Maarten. First of all our flight was delayed 2 hrs so we only had 45 mins to connect. We have been flying international for 20 years and never had the delays lines disorganization that we had to go thru in San Juan. First a line for the Custom Check then collect our baggage then another line for another custom check. Walk 10 minutes to the connecting terminal to stand in line to re-check our baggage personally with the ticket counter (even though it was originally tagged/checked all the way through to our final destination) then one more TSA check get rid of all liquids. OK fine now if you wanted a bottle of water to take with you there was not one place to purchase it just run to your gate to be informed that we were late and they were kind enough to hold the door for us.
21st August 2013,n/a,San Juan Airport customer review,My wife and I were travelling from Beef Island in the British Virgin Islands to New York JFK and had to change at San Juan. Flight into San Juan had been delayed by 2 hours and we were now in a position of missing our connection. Beef Island phoned ahead and San Juan airport had promised us all that a member of airport staff would see the 20 passengers through the check point etc. They also said not to worry about collecting bags because our bags would be transferred for us. Arrived at San Juan with 45 minutes until our connection told we aren't allowed off the aircraft. Held on the plane for 15 minutes. 20 passengers all with connections to make locked outside the airport. We then sprint to passport control and it takes 4 checkouts 10 minutes to see my wife and I. With 15 minutes left informed that because of a mix up our bags were not sent to our next flight. We had to run back to collect them. By the time we arrived at the counter our flight had departed. The checkout man then had the cheek to ask us why we only left 45 minutes to make our connection. We were informed by 5 different staff members that this means we would be 1st to get a seat on the next flight. This wasn't the case though. Given boarding passes for a 17.45 flight direct to JFK gate 8 we were on the system for gate 9 to Miami at 17.25 (this was the 1st we'd heard of this). We could catch a connection from there. So with 10 minutes to spare off we run to gate 9 to explain the situation. Gate 8 phoned gate 9 and it turned out yes we were meant to be on that flight. By the time we finally we arrived at our hotel in New York we'd been travelling for almost 14 hours.
6th February 2013,4,San Juan Airport customer review,Horribly disorganized! No instruction as to which lines/areas you should be in - in what order - awful. After standing in a long line for 20 minutes waiting for luggage tags I was told that I had to have a boarding pass first. There was no instruction and no signage near the baggage line. Back out of line - wait 15 minutes in boarding pass line - then back to luggage tag line. Just when I thought I was finished - back in line dragging the suitcase that they had already been tagged to yet another counter. It was ridiculous. The airport employees are no help and appear to be more interested in socializing with each other. I will think long and hard before booking anymore trips that will take me through this airport.
14th May 2012,6,San Juan Airport customer review,The timing of flights is good service is friendly although not always fast. Usually crowded especially during 11-3 pm when many flights leave and 5-7 when many arrive. Needs more food options more store options and cleaner bathrooms. This is my home airport so it's easy to travel through here but connecting throughout the terminals is sometimes confusing. TSA is usually full mostly in terminal C check-in is very crowded too because it's really nearby USDA is very smooth travelling so is Immigration.
16th April 2012,6,San Juan Airport customer review,YYZ-SJU-EIS return. Does its best but is clearly well above its design capacity in terms of passenger volumes. Check-in is hampered by too little space between counters and the exit which results in chaotic snaking queues and no free space. This is particularly trying during cruise ship changeovers when passenger volumes are highest. Security screening is passable with fairly efficient staff. Airside services are ok for the Caribbean but there is little available space for seating in the waiting lounges. Clearing US customs here is easy as it is mostly small planes feeding in passengers. San Juan's principal advantage is the number of direct flights from North America and the extensive connections provided by local airlines like American Eagle Cape Air and Fly BVI.
23rd December 2011,3,San Juan Airport customer review,YYZ to SJU return. Second visit to Luis Munoz Airport first time 3 years ago. My experience has not improved. Clean good maintenance and reasonably spacious however the electronic board with flight information is a complete joke. Only a small fraction of flights are listed and most without gate information. The only way is to walk around the terminal looking out the windows to find an Air Canada plane - totally unacceptable! Three years ago my US Air flight was cancelled but never indicated on the board. No Wifi - not even available for purchase. No Star Alliance Lounge. I was told by check-in counter that Continental had one but since its merger with United the lounge closed! Food choice limited and very expensive. Lineups at security long and chaotic. I was refused the Priority Line as a Star Alliance Gold member and was only grudgingly accepted when I pointed out my travelling companion was using a cane. Very incompetent and poorly trained ground staff. It's hard to avoid SJU if you go to southern Caribbean but I will try hard to avoid it in the future!
25th June 2011,4,San Juan Airport customer review,The international airport is huge: the largest I'd guess of all those on Caribbean islands. It is immaculately clean. There are many dining and shopping options. Check-in (US Airways Business/First) was a breeze. Getting through security was a nightmare: long long lines inched toward the TSA stations at all four concourse entrances it took us over 20 mins in the early evening.
18th December 2010,1,San Juan Airport customer review,"Today was my third time flying into San Juan but the first time I ever had to connect to another airline. I found everything shutting down at 5pm - restaurants shops security even ticket counters! It seems to run on ""island time."" The layout is awkward and not labeled well with signs. My favorite part is how the terminals list the gate numbers but not the airlines serviced. And don't count on using the arrival and departure screens to locate or confirm your gate. Only about a third of the flights have an actual gate listed. When I return to the Caribbean I will do my best to avoid San Juan."
7th September 2010,4,San Juan Airport customer review,Airport offers good facilities for the Caribbean. Acceptable air-conditioning clean terminal and loos. Spacious terminals with plenty to eat (although for authentic Puerto Rican food dine before security). Staff is friendly and professional and there are plenty of reasonably- priced taxis to San Juan and the surrounding areas. All in all a pleasant experience and a good first impression to the visitor of this magnificent destination.
11th December 2009,5,San Juan Airport customer review,Flew into San Juan this past summer from JFK for my honeymoon. Had no problems. We landed and the baggage claim was not a long walk and in a matter of 15 minutes I was my wife and I were in the taxi going to the hotel. Returning was even easier.
13th April 2009,3,San Juan Airport customer review,Traveled into and out of SJU in April 2009. Upon arrival it's not very clear how you just walk out to the car rental shuttles (I think there's a way you can avoid going through the baggage claim check however it's not clear). We also did not see signs pointing out the tourist info booth upon arrival. The airport generally poorly signed. Departed Weds. 4/8. Huge lines at most airlines for baggage check. You do have to have your bags inspected (checked and carry-on) by USDA prior to departure. This is a separate process and these machines are right inside the doors at Concourse B. The video displays did not give our gate or concourse so we had to ask to find United. The ticketing area is not well air-conditioned (doors open to street) so it's pretty warm. Some restaurants and shopping before security fairly limited choices in Concourse B but you could walk to at least C. Overall especially in ticketing area rather chaotic.
28th July 2008,3,San Juan Airport customer review,I don't know where Josh Brown got his data from but some of his numbers seem exaggerated. That being said SJU is the largest and most modern airport in the Caribbean but it certainly has a lot to catch up with other US airports. SJU doesn't have luggage cart rental service; instead they have baggage handlers that work for tips. They are unionized and for obvious reasons their union is adamantly opposed to the carts. It's also probably the only US major airport where only passengers are allowed in the baggage claim area and possibly the only one where they actually check your luggage tag against your ticket as you leave the claim area. I think that is PLUS considering how often people grab the wrong bag. As far as security goes there's nothing they can do about checking your luggage for plants/animals. That's actually a USDA requirement - the same happens in Hawaii. It's true that once you go through security the food choices are extremely limited. Everyone working at the airport must be bilingual. To have staff that does not have a dominion of the English language is a crass oversight.
12th May 2008,n/a,San Juan Airport customer review,These last comments were posted on 2005. We're now in 2008 & the airport has more gates more renovations. More renovations expansions & service facilities will be going on through 2011.
6th November 2005,n/a,San Juan Airport customer review,San Juan airport is the best airport in the caribbean also the one with major traffic San Juan airport moves almost 700 daily flights making it one of the U.S. Major Traffic airports also has 2 runways the North Runway(more than 10000 feet long) and the South Runway( more than 8000 feet long).

It has over 30 duty free stores for a last minute shopping and it holds Aeroparque a place located near the North Runway so that you can see planes departing and arriving. It is all you can expect from an airport but get prepared for very long lines in counters(especially in Delta Continental United and Cape Air counters) and a severe car traffic when you arrive. San Juan airport is the hub getaway for the caribbean and also one of the most important hubs of American Airlines and American Eagle. Puerto Rico has more airports like Aguadilla Airport Mayaguez Ponce and Vieques. Aguadilla's Rafael Hernandez Airport located over the Ramey base in the northwestern area of Puerto Rico is the 2nd airport in Puerto Rico with major traffic moving over 100 commercial daily flights.

7th July 2005,n/a,San Juan Airport customer review,I guess everything is relative. Compared to similar airports in this part of the world I guess San Juan is pretty nice. But in comparison to most airports in the modern/western world its definitely lacking. Outside security expect long lines bad food (with equally long lines) and a generally chaotic vibe. Inside security (airside)  it felt a lot like being in the Ft. Lauderdale airport (could be a compliment or not I guess) with a less hectic vibe decent food decent shopping). If you're flying out of here leave plenty of extra time to check in and get through security. And I'd suggest eating ahead of time as you're options are pretty slim.
7th April 2005,n/a,San Juan Airport customer review,San Juan International Airport compared to many airports in the region is very nice and clean. It has very good facilities though getting to the airport is somewhat difficult if you are using PR- 26 access to the airport from PR-17 is very easy it takes you straight there. Interactive service about the airport are not that easy to find either. The people of the airport are not as costumer oriented but if you get their attention they are gentle and will help you in the way they can.
28th February 2005,n/a,San Juan Airport customer review,"SJU is a decent airport but not comparable to those on the US mainland. Getting to the airport from Autopista 2 is a hassle. The signs to the airport are poorly placed and confusing. Once on the airport grounds the signs are still confusing. Eventually you will end up in the place you need to be. You may have to circle the airport once or twice however. The American Airlines passengers are in the oldest terminals which are not so clean. Most other airlines are housed in newer cleaner terminals. Signage is posted in both Spanish and English (for all the ""americanos"" who cannot speak Spanish). Security is a nightmare. First all departing passengers must send their bag through a machine to check for plants and animals which you are not supposed to transport off Puerto Rico. Then you must drop your baggage off after check-in at the TSA bomb screening device. Afterwards passengers proceed through the security checkpoint which takes a long time to pass throught. The TSA agents are friendly however the one that screened me did not speak English fluently. Once through security there are only a few food places and duty free shops. Take note that all US passengers do not have to pass through customs when you are coming to/from Puerto Rico. Therefore all the shops in Puerto Rico are a good deal. Puerto Rico charges no sales tax so that makes most shops on the island ""duty free"". Almost all American Airlines employees are bilingual and friendly. Overall it was not a terrible experience. It is hands down the best airport to use in the Carib."
22nd March 2022,1,"""still can't figure out how to manage arriving queues""","Not Verified |  It's 2 years into the pandemic. Most places it is actually over. But not at this sorry excuse that masquerades as a top Canadian international airport (working hand in hand with gov't, no doubt). Pearson still can't figure out how to manage arriving queues. So now they force people to sit for an hour on a plane after an 8- hour flight, without letting us disembark, because they can't get their act together. If I see any more awards for this place, I'm going to puke."
14th March 2022,2,"""most of the time a nightmare experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I still can not understand that this Toronto Pearson INTL Airport is getting Awards and most reviews you read here and on so many sites are linked to services at Pearson as being most of the time a nightmare experience, such a shame as being Canadian and travelled extensively around the world, when you are at Pearson nothing really improved it's getting worse. You can change the walls but till you get inside these walls and new decor is really + totally despicable. I did official complaints in last few years at Pearson admin and have over the phone, they try to show you that they listen but never follow up properly on any of my complaints especially the ones where I tackle them about no or poorest service in French language an official language in Canada, they don't seem to care. I still have complaints after a year that are still under investigations in Ottawa about the rude service I got about asking for services in French at the airport, I was told to keep quiet and not to speak a foreign language by one of their official staff, so inconsiderate towards any one to this airport who would ask the same service and being told it's only in English here! How Rude!? Well I beg your pardon but I am not taking that as an answer and the promise it will improve is the same in 10 years."
10th March 2022,4,"""The worst baggage delivery in the developed world""","Not Verified |  The worst baggage delivery in the developed world. You will wait 45 minutes to an hour for your bags. Don’t check a bag. This is especially true when it comes to oversize items. If you have a bike, golf clubs or skis then bring a blanket. You are going to wait at least an hour."
28th February 2022,3,"""Toronto airport is truly a nightmare""","Not Verified |  Toronto airport is truly a nightmare from personal experience. It began by us arriving at 9.30 pm from Costa Rica - over 2 hours late (airplane mechanical issues). No flight reps to meet us to help with tight connections or wheelchair assistance). Lots of etcetera's including zero communications to report but the highlight for us returning to Canada was the closing of the connections lane. This forced everyone into the arrivals long line up that required all persons to take another covid test regardless of our negative molecular tests taken and uploaded just 36 hours before (what happened to random testing?). Almost 100 of us missed our connections even though Air Canada held the planes for an additional 30 minutes to Ottawa, Calgary and Vancouver. We all had to start over at the ticket counter to offload our luggage (even if we hadn't missed our flight we still would have had to do this). Epic nightmare. If I wasn't an optimist I would have guessed that they did this on purpose to punish people for travelling during covid time."
20th December 2021,1,"""I am very disappointed""",Not Verified |  I am very disappointed in the way Pearson has handled the new covid testing rules. I understand it is government implemented but there should be some consideration on how to do things better. It is required to take a test before leaving the country you were in to enter Canada (which costs money) & then you get home from traveling - already presenting a negative covid test - only to get through customs & baggage to have a covid test done again. My problem is the fact that they are putting several people in a small area all from different parts of the world to get covid testing which to me seems like a “breeding ground” for the virus. I’m not against stopping the spread but I think there are better ways to ensure we aren’t spreading it and shoving 100s in a small space does nothing but spread it more. Makes for an extra long day after traveling - especially because being fully vaccinated in a requirement for travel and having a negative covid test already so we should be fine to get through. Sending us home with an at home test would make a lot more sense as there wouldn’t be a backed up covid testing line & getting people out of the crammed airport faster.
14th December 2021,2,"""I will look for other airports to depart from""","Not Verified |  My entire life I have been travelling and have never been through an airport as bad as Toronto. It took 2 hrs to get through security upon departure, 2 security lanes open for thousands of passengers, staff are extremely rude. It took 3.5 hrs from check in to get through security, Cancun airport took 5 minutes. Upon our return, it took another 2 hrs to get through security, and then a covid test, they told us 12 to 24 hrs for results, it has now been 72 hrs. If this were a private sector business it would be gone, management should be fired immediately and replaced with capable people. This is not just covid related, this airport has consistently been a nightmare for as long as I can remember. From now on, I will look for other airports to depart from, if you can avoid this airport, do it you will enjoy your trip far more than being subjected to an establishment that employs the rudest nastiest team of employees I have ever seen in any business."
12th December 2021,1,"""Terrible signage availability!""","Not Verified |  Terrible signage availability! Since trying to find the parking lot, to all inner signage to know exactly where to direct your self correctly! My parents have trouble when arrived since nobody helped them or gave them assistance or instructions where do they have to go, specially now with Covid measurements! Worst airport ever."
27th November 2021,1,"""Long lines and slow service""","Not Verified |  Very disorganized, no organization, set up of customs hall is inefficient and ineffective. Long lines and slow service. I’ve travelling to numerous airports in North America, this one consistently is the worst. The management of this airport should be fired for this mess."
16th November 2021,1,"""zero social distancing""","Not Verified |  The worst experience ever. Long line ups, rude and unprofessional staff, no help for families, kiosks and luggage areas are total mess with zero social distancing. Paid $100 for for PCR test as required by Canadian govt but no one even checked the or asked a single document. Terminal 3 arrival is falling apart. It’s so dirty, and luggage carts are parked everywhere blocking people and no one’s there to pick up."
8th November 2021,6,"""further upgrades are needed""","Not Verified |  I arrived and departed from Terminal 1 and if you've travelled a lot around the world, you know this is not the worst terminal in the world, but it's far from being the finest either. Poorly designed from the outset, I have seen improvements made and they are more than welcome, but further upgrades are needed. Here's my experience with a few recommendations for improvement (hope management is reading!). Arriving in the baggage hall, there is no big screen indicating which carrousels are for which flights. You have to walk around and eventually you find it. Confusing to say the least. Having said that, luggage arrived fast, and immigration was relatively quick and pain-free. Agent was not unfriendly. Washrooms in arrivals area clean and modern. The UP train to Toronto Union station is excellent: comfortable, fast and not expensive. Upon departure, check-in and security were efficient and fast. The security area is a vast improvement from when the terminal was first built, and the walk to the international gate area seems much more spacious and attractive. There is fast and free WIFI. The international gate area (E gates) is another story - much too narrow a space and totally unfit for purpose, still crowded with strange tables and stools with Ipads (fine for eating but inadequate when waiting for flights with hand luggage) and a total lack of seating despite this flight being a smaller plane and not even full. No relaxing seating of the kind you find in multiple international airports around the world anywhere (not that there would be any space to put them). People were sitting on the ground and queues for flights snaked over into adjoining gate areas. Bathrooms near the gate are small and gross - it felt like something taken out of a high-school circa 1980. If there is one thing to say about this terminal it's inconsistency, with gate area spaciousness, seating (kind and amount) and queuing for flights being especially poor for a terminal of it's size. Needs a re-think if international hub status is every to be achieved."
7th November 2021,4,"""Poorly handled and severely understaffed""",Not Verified |  Really stupid queuing system which delays everybody! The so called self service check in results in more than close to 90 minutes waiting in line for the bag drop. Poorly handled and severely understaffed.
25th October 2021,2,"""Everything was messy""","Not Verified |  I was flying back to Canada from Colombia and I had the worst experience I have ever had in an Airport. The customer service was terrible, immigration staff were nasty, not friendly and they were profiling people coming on this flight. My luggage took 2 hours to finally show up somewhere, which made me miss my connection to come to Vancouver. Everything was messy, Air Canada staff didn’t help either and my trip coming back “home” took an extra 5 hours. Terrible experience."
25th September 2021,1,"""airport personnel did not want to provide priority""","Not Verified |  I had a flight on September 17, 2021 at 8.30am to Raleigh, NC. I had no checked bags and I arrived at the airport at 6.40am (1 hr and 50 mins) prior to my scheduled flight time. When I arrived, I was greeted with am extremely long line at TSA and come to find out TSA did not open til 6.15am. Why is TSA only opening at 6.15 am when there are various flights leaving at 8.30 and 9.00am. There was even a line in Nexus and I have never seen a line in Nexus in the amount of years that I have traveled. Myself and others ended up missing our flights, because airport personnel did not want to provide priority to those that have been waiting almost two hours (some even more) and their flights were departing within a short period of time. Air Canada needs to train their employees much better. When I missed my flight, I was told to go past customer service and use their courtesy white phones to reschedule my flight. I booked my ticket with United Airlines but it was operating through Air Canada. I even checked in through Air Canada and received my boarding pass with Air Canada. While I was on the phone with the rep, she advised (incorrectly) that I had to contact United. When I contacted United, they told me I should be speaking with Air Canada. Between 8.50am and 9.30am, I was on hold and being passed back and forth between the airlines. I then went to the Air Canada customer service desk and was able to rebook my flight without any hassle. So again, I was given the incorrect information from the Air Canada rep, whom I spoke with on the phone. By the time I was able to re book my flight, the next flight leaving wasn't until 2:45pm, connected in DC and my next flight out of DC wasn't til after 10.30pm. I spent 14-15 hours in airports for what would have been a 1 hour and change direct flight, if TSA coordinated much better. Also, we were required to take a covid 19 test prior to leaving the country and no one at Toronto Pearson Airport asked me for my Covid 19 results. This is definitely a compliance issue with the requirement of the Government, to provide proof of a negative covid 19 result."
24th September 2021,1,"""the worst organized airport""",✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst organized airport I have experienced. They tell you to come three hours in advance but people who arrive two hours get moved ahead of you while you get held back and have to wait. Then when the late people arrive for your same flight they go ahead of you and that is before you get to security! You get punished for coming early and doing what they tell you to do. Most ridiculous system I’ve ever experienced in my life and I travel regularly even during the pandemic!
19th September 2021,1,"""Huge lines, no organization""","Not Verified |  The worst arrival experience ever. Took 4 hours to get out of the airport. Huge lines, no organization, airport is run like a third world country. Canada is falling behind in every aspect."
12th September 2021,1,"""the arrival experience at Pearson was a complete disaster""","✅ Trip Verified | I must agree with all previous reviews that the arrival experience at Pearson was a complete disaster and looking at previous reviews, nothing has changed. As an international conference planner, this was my first opportunity to 'escape' Canada for an international trip. Departure procedures took 2 hours (not exactly a stellar start) - but the return to Pearson - how embarrassing for a city like Toronto to be so disorganized. No social distancing whatsoever once you arrive into the customs hall. There were at least 1000 people snaking through (multiple international flights landing around 9.00 pm) - all of us crammed into the hall to line up for the machines for customs declaration. How many hundreds of people touched those keypads, no cleaning in between (as is promised on all the signs about extra cleaning efforts). Let's not even talk about the toilets. Then the Customs Officer wants to physically take our cell phones to see the PDF file of our negative Covid test. What is the point of filling out the ArriveCAN app and uploading all the docs if the experience is not going to be contact free. By the way, agent had no gloves on and saw this person touch all other phones ahead of us. I must ask - how does this help with potential spread of the virus. Baggage took an additional 2 hours. From landing to exit - an exhausting 3 hour experience. I am ashamed to call Toronto Pearson my home airport."
1st September 2021,1,"""Horrible airport!""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible airport! To embark huge lines, to disembark huge lines, a mess. The bag carousels are a joke. Shame, shame! Over 2 hours waiting for my luggage! What a shame to this country. Travel to USA, Europe, South America and this one is by far the worst!"
30th August 2021,1,"""Get it together Pearson, you are an embarrassment""","✅ Trip Verified | The priority lines don't work. A man entered the regular security line at the same time I entered the priority line. He was through security before I was. They only give one line to priority and 6 to regular screening. Get it together Pearson, you are an embarrassment."
15th August 2021,1,"""it was complete chaos""","Not Verified |  I returned last to Toronto night & it was complete chaos at Pearson airport in TO. They have a work to rule by border security plus Covid measures and it has added up to disaster. Keeping ppl crammed on the plane for 2 hours after landing, huge line ups at customs with no distancing whatsoever, ppl fighting, exhausted, crying, sleeping on the floor. Baggage claim taking over 5 hours for some, luggage everywhere, no ability to physically distance whatsoever- unsafe & unreal! Staff seemed indifferent and unwilling/unable to deal with the situation. If you know anyone else traveling back, please warn them."
15th August 2021,1,"""experience was disgusting""","Not Verified |  Flying back from a short US trip, everything fine leaving Can, wstjet flight etc had ourAntigen test -ve, no one asked for it from Wstjet or customs or when we landed. We needed a PCR test to return, we complied and got a -ve test done and wasn't cheap to attain. Wasn't until we got back into Canada did the show start! We are born and raised Cdn's, and you wouldn't think we were in Canada! We are also Nexus holders and ID machines weren't working, went to customs and shared this so we had to go thru a normal Q&A with the agent, then the Can Travel app we did before our return and the agent said we never uploaded the vax results, but we had all our paper work showing we had our dbl vax and all the prompts on the app never stopped us to load but gave us our code anyway, so we had to redo while waiting with the agent even though she had all the hard copy docs needed! Finally she let us go thru after re doing nexus card scans, passport scans and vax and pcr test scans again. Then informs us we are picked randomly? To get another PCR test! We are directed to an area to upload more info and data, 17 stations, 2 in each stns to upload our info, not one white person, hardly could speak English, and all the random people being tested, all white!! The 1st 2 bumbled our data for 15 min and then informed their IPad wasn't working, hardly understand these two, send us to another station, inputting our passport info again, health card info etc everyone in this area plus maybe another dozen of them standing around doing nothing, all in masks, gloves, nurse coverups, etc then after another 10 + min we are directed to an area for the testing, again 1 to 2 in each curtain area to test with dozens standing around. Canada wants diversity, but not one white person was working, a total gross misconduct. I'm ok with diversity but this was a visual joke! This is what our Country has become! We got our test and left! An xtra 1.5 hrs thru this, you wouldn't even know you were in Canada! The whole experience was disgusting."
13th August 2021,1,"""A complete embarrassment for Canada""","✅ Trip Verified |  I had a horrendous experience at Pearson Airport. I was travelling with a 3 month old baby and a toddler. The staff was inconsiderate, lacked complete empathy for mothers travelling with young children. The line going to customs was so disorganised, impossible to safely distance yourself from one another. One staff physically blocked the elevators for those with young children. When we went downstairs to customs, there was no line for those with young children, when asked the staff if there was another cue, she rudely said « everyone is the same ». We waited in line with a small baby for almost 3 hours. It’s disheartening to see the staff there have zero compassion to those who are more vulnerable and might need extra assistance. I’ve travelled the world, young children are always given priority at other airports. When we come out, the luggage was impossible to find, we saw many other passengers frantically looking for their luggage since there was no clear indication. I came to Canada again after two years and the experience at Pearson left such a horrible impression in my mind. A complete embarrassment for Canada."
9th August 2021,1,"""The worst run airport I have ever seen""",✅ Trip Verified | The worst run airport I have ever seen. Been around the world. In some of the busiest airports nothing like this. Lazy staff. Always always late to get luggage. Luggage claim department is the worst I have ever seen or experienced. Absolute chaos. Waiting for at least an hour every time to get luggage even when arriving on a small flight. No other airport in the world is like this. I fly at least 5 times a year and this is always the case. Just sickening and unacceptable. Always luggage lying all over the place. Unclaimed. Complete mess. Something needs to be done about this Airport. It’s an embarrassment to Canadians.
14th February 2021,1,"""Rude and pushy staff""",Not Verified |  Rude and pushy staff grabbed my luggage out of my hands. This caused my finger to get pinched and bleed. They didn’t apologize or offer me a bandage. The rude man and woman stared at me while throwing my luggage on the conveyor belt. Washrooms are small and dirty. Staff are disorganized. I’m ashamed of this airport! I wouldn’t want any family members to come here!
3rd February 2021,2,"""improve your signage""","Not Verified |  I would request you to improve your signage as its very confusing. For example while exiting from Terminal 1 domestic departure, the sign says TERMINAL 3 in big bold letters and ""by train"" is in small fonts. Its very confusing as people think that the door is leading to Terminal 3 and they stand confused at door thus holding up the line, please put up an accurate sign showing that door is the proper domestic exit for terminal 1."
23rd January 2021,2,"""very bad experience with employees""","Not Verified |  Yesterday, I had very bad experience with employees in the airport, they were very rude and not helpful and  never smiled. After 10 hours flight, of course I'm gonna be tired and just because I showed another form to the officer, she yelled at me like I made a crime. She was very mean and rude. And by the way, there was not anyone on line so she wasn't on rush. The other officer when I showed him the form that he wanted, he stared at me just because I took 1 minute to find it. I didn't expect that at all from Canadians. Please be more respectful and nice to people."
16th March 2020,2,"""lose flights due to 2 hr long queues""","✅ Trip Verified |  Embarrassment of an airport, it is mediocre and disorganized. No separate line for connecting flights and arrivals which makes people lose flights due to 2 hr long queues."
8th March 2020,1,"""no organization whatsoever""","Not Verified |  Worst airport ever. It was the worst experience I had ever encountered in any airport. Highly populated and under staffed. I was passing through Toronto to Montreal. Absolutely no organization whatsoever. It was literally a zoo, so many people pushing to use a handful of machines and no personal assitant. You were literally on your own. Worst airport ever."
7th March 2020,2,"""Completely unorganized""",Not Verified |  Worst experience ever at this airport. Was awful. Completely unorganized. The automated customs card machines were a zoo. You couldn’t get to the machines and then waited in extremely long lines that felt like they went nowhere. The automation of this process has made it the worst airport I have ever been too. So sad that this is my hometown.
3rd March 2020,2,"""Inefficient, inconsistent, rude service""","✅ Trip Verified | Just boarded an Air France flight to Paris, flying business class. First of all, priority line ups to go through security were worse than regular passengers. Secondly, just had the worst ever experience going through security in any airport ever, and I have been flying for over 40 years. Horrible service, attitude of security female officer, unreasonable search of make up items, having every single item thrown out of my see through bag because it had to go in their plastic bag! And in this day of coronovirus, you are only allowed one tiny bottle of hand sanitizer because all your gel items, including mascara must fit in their plastic bag. We waited half an hour for the same agent to ransack the bags of a family of four, and then it was our turn, other passengers still waiting. Supervisor, not much help either. Inefficient, inconsistent, rude service at Pearson terminal 3, with no concern for the growing world health epidemic."
27th February 2020,5,"""return was a zoo at Pearson""","Not Verified |  Assistance required flying WestJet to and from Florida. Departure was no problem, return was a zoo at Pearson. The airport porter was rude and offensive. Would have got more of a tip if he had not demanded one. Tampa assistance was extraordinary and took us from flight door to luggage pick up through customs to rental car counter and garage and even put our luggage in the car Most friendly and helpful. Pearson needs to go to Tampa to see how it should be done."
26th February 2020,4,"""wait time was awful""",Not Verified |  US Customs line-up for a 6:.15am flight was woefully understaffed and the resulting line and wait time was awful. No need for such a wait. Adding even two more agents would make a big difference. Simple solve but they seem disinterested in their customers discomfort.
24th February 2020,2,"""plan to arrive at least 5 hours early""","Not Verified |  If you are traveling to the US and don't have Nexus or global entry, plan to arrive at least 5 hours early. My flight was at 7.45 am and reached airport at 5 am. Since I was traveling with my kid, I was able go through family lines and even then I only just made it in time, 10 mins before the departure. The lines were really really long in security and customs. The signage is non-existent in security, customs and in ticketing. Pretty bad for an international airport. Just disappointed."
22nd February 2020,2,"""Worst experience at an airport that I can recall""","Not Verified |  Worst experience at an airport that I can recall. Had a 9.05am flight on Air Canada to Nashville. Arrived at Terminal 1 at 6.35am and had to run to my gate to barely make the flight. Both the security and customs lines were longer than any I have seen at Disney. It shouldn’t take over 2.5 hours to make it to your gate at any airport. This was on a day with perfect weather, non-holiday or any other unusual circumstances. Whenever I must travel to Canada again I will just fly into Buffalo and drive to save time."
18th February 2020,6,"""Modern with decent amenities""","Not Verified | Modern airport with decent amenities. Food options could be a little better. My biggest issue are the long line ups for security, including the NEXUS line."
16th February 2020,1,"""Bad customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport! My 14th flight and airport in 6 weeks and Toronto Pearson Airport was by far the worst, most convoluted airport I went through. Connecting passengers have to leave the secure area and walk miles to go through security again! Poor signage. Not intuitive. Bad customer service. Delayed security screening. Give yourself at least 1.5-2 hours to connect through this mess of an airport. I have nothing nice to say about this airport."
16th February 2020,1,"""Stuck in an abandoned domestic terminal""","Not Verified |  Arrived in the middle of the night for a connection in the early morning. Could not connect from the domestic terminal to the international terminal as the connection desk closed until 5am. Seriously? Stuck in an abandoned domestic terminal for 4 hours with a single fast food only option, the only entertainment being to watch other hapless connecting passengers go to the top of the stairs and be turned back at the connections closed gate. Expected much better from Canada’s largest airport. Have managed to push together a make shift chair bed in the central lobby area next to a table which has been left covered in food scraps, garbage, and hair."

12th February 2020,1,"""the worst airport security experience""",Not Verified |  Probably the worst airport security experience ever. One non nexus line open and 2/3 of bags pulled over for secondary. Numerous passengers in danger of missing their flight and time staff were rude and disrespectful to everyone. How this is acceptable at Canada’s largest airport is beyond me. Makes me not want to visit Toronto ever again. 0/10.
5th February 2020,1,"""it’s very poorly organized""",Not Verified |  This airport is very disrespectful and has little regard for their customers. The security guards are rude and not one bit helpful. I’ve witnessed several security guards yelling at customers because they were trying to get to their flight. One man in particular was notified that several passengers were trying to make their connecting flight (and customers ahead offered to let these customers go ahead of them for security) and basically told them they’re out of luck. The bathrooms are never clean and it’s very poorly organized. I would not recommend flying into this airport.

Go to a kiosk to check-in ( which we had never done before). It was a madhouse. Only one person to ""help"". It was total chaos. No lines for specific areas to go-people butting into long lines rather than going to end of lines. Estimated at least 1500 people there at the same time trying to get through the process. Unbelievable Children screaming, one lady visually impaired begging for help. Elderly people asking for help from anyone around them who would aid them. It was an embarrassment that things were so poorly organized in this day and age. Changes must be made to make this transition easier."
27th January 2020,2,"""there is no service right now""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible experience with US border control. My flight is at 6am and I arrived at the US border control at 5am. It took me 43 minutes to get through and almost missed my flight. There were only 1 person working at the VISA line and takes his sweet time to work. They kept letting crew members and disabled people cut through the line, and makes no effort in staffing the counter better. They need to seriously consider their customers because there is no service right now."
21st January 2020,3,"""have to redo security""","✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely poor protocol in place for connecting passengers in terminal 3. Arrived from UK in transit for Halifax, crazy that connecting passengers have to redo security entrance again. Need to significantly improve this poor planning"
20th January 2020,5,"""Perhaps it is time to renovate""","Not Verified |  Bathrooms with 3 stalls in an airport handling thousands of people. Really? Someone wasn’t thinking when they designed this airport (terminal 1, gate D). Perhaps it is time to renovate."
19th January 2020,4,"""have never experienced such conditions""","Not Verified |  I and my wife arrived at this airport, Terminal 3, on 15 January 2020, returning from overseas, visiting relatives. Had no problem with immigration and other usual formalities of arrival. We were shocked when we proceeded to collect our baggage. The baggage area was awful with the smell of fish. We thought we were in a fish market. We have never experienced such conditions at any airport in our over fifty years of travelling. Secondly, the baggage handling staff was in a state of panic. The supervisor was literally shouting at the passengers who were waiting for their baggage. The Airport needs to clean up the baggage area of Terminal 3 and the staff, for sure, needs better training in dealing with the passengers. Next time we are at Pearson, we hope to see an improved baggage area and staff more respectful in dealing with the passengers."
11th January 2020,10,"""professional, friendly and efficient""","✅ Trip Verified | I had lost my cell phone in a public bathroom in Air Canada Terminal 1 while on my way flying home to Kelowna BC. The Terminal Customer Service lady went to a lot of effort to locate my cell phone with the assistance of two Air Canada employees (who also were very helpful). As I would not be returning to Toronto in the near future and am 69 years old on my own (I was not sure what to do and needed my only phone), I was very anxious to get my phone back before leaving. Luckily the plane was delayed leaving, this staff member located the phone and had to go outside Security and back through Security. She was professional, friendly and efficient. Thank you."
8th January 2020,1,"""process was badly organized and even worse staffed""","Not Verified |  When transferring from our initial WestJet flight from YYC to YYZ, we discovered we had to clear U.S. Borders and Security. This process was badly organized and even worse staffed. Less than half the CBP posts were manned resulting in roughly 25 percent of all passengers missing their flights due to delays in screening. For most screening took 1 hour and 31 minutes in marked contrast to the clearance procedures which argue for procedures of less than 15 minutes. Dozens of passengers failed to fly on their plane due excessive delays where the screening and CPB lanes in terminal A averaged a minimum of 1 and 1/2 hours to get passengers through to their departure plane. Meanwhile, in the same airport, the Canadian CBP perform these exact same checks on people travelling in Canada. The average time to clear their process this week was only 4 minutes and 11 seconds. Strong praise should go to the Canadians, for performing this task 22 and 1/2 times better than their American Counterparts. Unless or until the American CBP can process a like number of persons as the Canadians do and do with a lower error rate, then the US personnel should be fired and replaced with Canadians who will swear an oath to the U.S, to accomplish these tasks."
1st January 2020,2,"""Barely made our flight""",Not Verified |  Staff tried very hard to make the best of a bad situation. The security set up was insanely long and the customs machines were glitchy with some reps who couldn't speak english very well - in this industry where dealing with harried customers is the norm I am surprised this was happening. Barely made our flight - others were less fortunate.
1st January 2020,1,"""Total joke""",Not Verified |  Total joke. Land at the airport and sit on the runway with no gate for 15 min. Now waiting for our bag for another 30 min. This is pathetic — my 5 year old niece could run a better airport. AC 1130 from Saskatoon to Toronto. Look it up.
31st December 2019,2,"""Slow, inefficient, filthy""","Not Verified |  This airport is an unmitigated mess. Slow, inefficient, filthy. From drop off to working through dreadful line ups, totally awful security then to be welcomed to the squalor of the waiting areas. A disgrace."
30th December 2019,2,"""the worst airport I have ever been to""","Not Verified |  I have said it before and I will say it again, Pearson airport is the worst airport I have ever been to, I have travelled the world and by far this is the worst run airport I have ever seen. They need to get rid of having immigration inside the airport or something because a 2.5hr wait from check in to gate is inexcusable. From kiosks that don’t work right to little selection and over priced (yes even for an airport) food, I am going to do my best to avoid this airport whenever I can, even if it means doing transfers so I can fly into Hamilton."
28th December 2019,1,"""the filthiest airport in the world""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the filthiest airport in the world. You should be ashamed as a board and CEO to mandate this poor quality. Everything to do with Pearson is deplorable. Elevators, escalators and moving sidewalks are always broken and dirty. The staff are so poorly trained. They are rude and down right mean. I am embarrassed to live in a city and country that accepts this terrible level of service and rips people off with insane costs. Shame on you!"
25th December 2019,3,"""This airport is a mess""","Not Verified |  Gouging on food, very little choice of restaurants, and very little space to move around. This airport is a mess, and runs like it’s from a third world country. Get your act together PM Trudeau, Mayor John Tory and Bonnie Crombie, the airport is letting down the whole country. Go see the airports in Singapore, Mumbai, Hong Kong, Bangkok and experience what “world class” really means. I hate to say this but I’m ashamed to show my city."
23rd December 2019,1,"""The worst airport ever""",Not Verified | The worst airport ever. Security went through literally everyone's bag. 50 people in line and one group of incompetent people working the security. I watched dozens of people miss their flights because of the incompetence. Seriously screwed up place. The food and beverages are so out of control. Price gouging to the fullest extent possible.
20th December 2019,3,"""claustrophobic baggage claim""","Not Verified | Toronto Pearson Terminal 3 is a joke and unfortunately represents all that is wrong with how Canada works today. Flying out and back to Amsterdam via KLM; check-in is confusing for the occasional traveller with the automated kiosk repeatedly asking me for visa details (no visa is needed to travel to the Netherlands if a Canadian citizen!) to the point where I couldn't proceed with check-in until I finally got one of the attendants to help out. Then the machine was unable to print a baggage tag so off to another line to get that looked after. Then another line to put the bag into a bewildering automated bag handling machine that required another attendant to help me with. Once done, the rest of the check-in and boarding process went ok but for the life of me I don't understand why they try to board 250+ people through one door. On the return trip, the arrivals process was even more chaotic. International arriving passengers are diverted to a very long upstairs passageway and two of the moving sidewalks were out of service. The very first washroom you encounter halfway down this passageway has exactly one urinal and one stall. You can imagine the lineups when 130 or so men get off that airplane. Terrible design. Then the idiotic and intimidating automated immigration and customs machines (they need to take a picture of you so stand still!) and that, after all that, spat out a piece of paper that actually misspelt my last name! Then another long walk to the exceedingly hot and claustrophobic baggage claim area where it took forever to retrieve my bag. The whole time I felt embarrassed by how Canada presents itself to the world with this pathetic terminal, especially after just having experienced the incredibly efficient Amsterdam Schiphol airport."
19th December 2019,3,"""Staff up and handle the demand""",Not Verified |  It just keeps getting worse. The slightest weather and there aren’t enough crews to keep up. Baggage handling is the slowest of any airport I’ve been to. This is one of the biggest airports in the world. Staff up and handle the demand. It’s a shame passengers are treated so badly.
19th December 2019,2,"""Airport is filthy dirty""","Not Verified |  Airport is filthy dirty. Seats are not clean, floors and walls havent been cleaned in months. The bathrooms are disgusting. Would recommend heavy clean and add my washroom facilities. 8 toilets for 15,000 plus travellers. Overall better facilities in 3rd world countries."
18th December 2019,2,"""lost my money, passport and tickets""","✅ Trip Verified | I was travelling alone to Thailand from Terminal One Air Canada departures area 5. The area was packed with passengers with no security in sight. After checking in at a kiosk and receiving a boarding pass and luggage tag, I was approached by an elderly European gentleman and his ""daughter"" asking me to assist them with putting their passport into the kiosk. After placing an obviously foreign passport (by the cover) into the kiosk, it showed that their passport was not valid and so they had to attend at a physical check-in desk for help. I pointed to where they had to go and as they disappeared into the throng of travellers, I turned to find my backpack gone. Inside were my passport, large sum of cash, all travel documents for 7 flights and 4 hotels in Thailand, credit/debit/health cards with driver's licence, new iPad/earphones and a litany of other travel items. After an initial frantic search, I made my way to the police booth which was halfway along the terminal. Here I was told to ""fill out a report on-line"" despite being scheduled to fly out in 2.5hrs. In the end, I was directed throughout the terminal to various locations including airport Lost & Found, AirCanada Lost & Found, Border Services Agency and other areas looking for my bag. Police and ""public safety"" officers who attended sometime later were of no help and upon my request only contacted video surveillance only to be told that ""no cameras covered that area where the theft occurred? Post-911 and an international airport has no surveillance on one of the busiest areas of the airport where the national airline checks in its passengers? Police advised that theft and fraud is rampant at the airport with groups of organized criminals operating daily on an unchallenged basis throughout the terminals and that many crimes go unreported as victims often leave the country without filing any report but crime warning signs are nowhere to be seen. As a Canadian citizen, however, my situation was different and somewhat catastrophic and almost ten days later, still requires paperwork, phone calls and expensive replacement of documents. Needless to say, my bag and contents were never found as of this this date. I lost my vacation, I lost my money, I lost my passport and tickets, I lost my electronics and almost all of my personal financial details under the nose of the Airport Authority and according to them, with no recourse for recovery or reimbursement! Welcome to Toronto Airport. Surely one of the world's worst international airports with serious security gaps, rampant crime and no way of recouping your losses! Be very careful out there,airport staff and security could care less."
16th December 2019,1,"""airport continues to be a disaster""",Not Verified |  This airport continues to be a disaster. The customs area was complete chaos with no one giving any info or directions. This was a wonderful example of how not to deal with the traveling public! Many travelers were put under unnecessary duress trying to make connections. I have tried my best to avoid Pearson airport for years but had no choice for this trip. All my previous feelings about this airport were once again confirmed. Avoid at all cost. 
9th December 2019,2,"""Extremely disappointed""","Not Verified |  Yesterday when arriving in Canada I was absolutely astonished at how disorganized the whole customs process was! We arrived 30 min early, and immediately got into a long line up that started right as we got off the plane. One employee stood at the bottom of the moving sidewalk telling people they had to walk back to the back of the line as Customs was at capacity. We waited 3 hours. The line was not well organized as after waiting for 1 hour, people who had just arrived were bring merged into our line with no wait time. Another lady asked an employee if we were in the correct line and all she received back was an eye roll. Extremely disappointed. The other airports we visited had festive decor up and Christmas music playing, which was welcoming. But our own Canadian airport had nothing of the sort."
4th December 2019,1,"""baggage belt was not working for hours""","Not Verified |  Terminal 1 departure, area 6, the baggage belt was not working for hours, passengers lined up was terrible. I cant believe that in a big airport in north America such an issue took hours to fix. You have to see the line up.  At least it should be a mechanism to accommodate those two groups. Such a shame."
3rd December 2019,4,"""gate is never ready""",Not Verified | This is the only airport where the gate is never ready. I’ve now been sitting on the plane for 40 minutes at 1.30 am because there is no crew for the gate. The flight was two and a half hours so this is no surprise that we are here. Usual for Pearson. The worst run airport I travel through Baggage is also usually an issue.
30th November 2019,2,"""jetways are filthy""",Not Verified | Highest passenger fees in the world with the worst performance. Terminal and especially jetways are filthy. the terminal is shabby and construction is slow and messy. Typically half of the pedways (notably international arrival) and escalators are out of service. GTAA expects AC to do their work.
28th November 2019,1,"""very poor customer service skills""","✅ Trip Verified | After waiting through the queue in security I asked the airport staff directions to the “post security” ICE to prepare some cash for my trip which I booked in advance for better conversion rates. I was told to go towards baggage claim and followed the signs until I made it to the door that that said “baggage claim”, I didn’t want to proceed any further at that point so I decided to turn back. There was a security officer that was sitting back having an evidently personal conversation on the phone telling the person on the line “One sec” then proceeded to tell me to leave the area towards baggage claim. I tried to explain the situation but she refused to have me talk and gestured me away rudely with her long fake nails (definitely not what airport security should have on). I proceeded and went through security again. When I finally find the ICE, the teller was extremely rude. She could not understand the verification code so to communicate better I politely handed her my phone to see the code clearly. Rather than use the written documentation she passed my phone back in a manner that made it seem like my phone was carrying a disease and she said “no you have to talk clearly” as if I wasn’t speaking proper english (which is my first language). The staff in this airport have very poor customer service skills that many other airports are very strong in (especially in Narita Japan). This airport needs to fund the training for their staff or needs to discipline those that have poor skills. Unacceptable behaviours. Not Canadian at all."
25th November 2019,10,"""one of the best airports worldwide""","✅ Trip Verified | Pearson Airport is one of the best airports worldwide: clean, clear, modern and mostly friendly staff. I experienced the airport for domestic flights (Terminal 1) and for international departure (Terminal 3). Both terminal have high quality. Terminal 3 is outstanding though and is may be one of the best terminals I have ever experienced: Facilities, Seatings, lounges, service, everything is exceptional. In both terminals fast tracks are available for frequent travellers. Queuing time is low."
19th November 2019,4,"""no one took responsibility""","✅ Trip Verified | We were connecting from Toronto to Los Angeles, from Dublin on November 9, 2019. It took an hour to retrieve our luggage from baggage claim (2.5 hr layover). We were instructed to place our bags on a conveyor to be routed to our next flight prior to checking in for our next flight via Air Canada. We had to go through Canadian customs and another terminal for our connector, where we needed to go through another round for U.S. customs. By the time we were in front of the U.S. customs, we’re told that our bags didn’t clear and had to wait at a holding room, they called Step 2. Bottom line: we missed our flight and no one in Air Canada or the airport knew where our bags were. They all collectively blamed us and no one took responsibility. They made us go back and forth from terminal 1 to 3, 4 times as one would claim that the other terminal had them. From 5.30 pm till 11 pm, no one could retrieve the bags, even when their computers finally identified them. We had to book a night at the airport Sheraton to sleep a little. We got to the terminal to check in at 5.30 am for an 8 am flight and again was told by U.S. customs that our bags didn’t clear for travel. Step 2 again and no one could find the bags, till we told the Air Canada agent that at 11 pm their baggage services found them. We were 5 minutes till boarding and cleared for step 3. Our flight was forced to delay for 30 minutes because 55 passengers were stuck at step 2 and 3 to clear. Is the Sheraton airport the only party benefiting from the inefficiencies? Furthermore, why does the Toronto airport authority not fixing this?! Lastly, there has to be some compensation for the grave inconvenience via hotel accommodation reimbursement, so they will be motivated to fix the problem."
18th November 2019,1,"""Not passenger-friendly at all""","✅ Trip Verified | Super friendly ground staff at checkin area at Air Canada check in area. Security is super fast and efficient. But super long walk from departure terminal to the gates. There are no seats at the gate area if you are departing in the evening to Europe. There were so many people and there are not enough seats at all! Those are giant wide body aircrafts going overseas and how can you not have enough seats and spaces for people to wait before their flight? Also the boarding process is a disaster. The gate area is small. With the terrible boarding process that Air Canada has, it makes everything worse. People can barely walk through the crowd of passengers. Terrible design of the airport. Not passenger-friendly at all."
16th November 2019,2,"""worst airport we have ever been to""","Not Verified |  The worst airport we have ever been to. The system is so confusing and unorganised. There is no priority signs, unhelpful staff. They literally do not care at all. We were waiting in line for 2 hours and missed our flight in the end. If wasn’t for my disabled auntie fainting on the floor we would have been in the line still waiting. A fewer staff working with a massive line. I have seen so many people missing their flights. What a joke!"
12th November 2019,1,"""they just don't care""","Not Verified |  I have traveled a lot but I literally have not seen any other airport worse than Toronto Pearson airport. I was arriving with my wife and my one year old son to arrival terminal 3 where I found it was the biggest, most unorganized, chaotic airport I have ever experienced in my life. The security check are the rudest in the world, time consuming and redundant. They don’t have any family or special need lines and to make people suffer even more, the staff were not helpful, rude and had a bad attitude. In conclusion, I doubt if this type of airport can be found anywhere in what is called 'industrialized' or even 3rd world countries. Where is the ministry of transportation? Where is the audit process? Does anyone in the government care what people say about this horrible airport? The security checks are the most time-consuming process that is redundant with staff that literally seem like they are in a competition to see who can move the slowest or form the biggest line. They are rude, they don't care if you have a short layover or any special circumstances, they just don't care. Everything is extremely overpriced, the ""free internet"" doesn't work most of the time. This airport is a cluttered mess with staff that act like they are doing travelers a favor by showing up. They are nasty, indifferent people that need to find other work. There's literally nothing good I can say about this place. Will never travel to or through Toronto again."
8th November 2019,7,"""the cleanliness of the terminal was incredible""","Not Verified |  I found YYZ Intl Airport to be a very friendly, kind place. The check in was quick and simple, so I got in pretty early. The gates all featured seating with restaurants and iPads. The duty free section was very busy, but as it was 9.30 pm at night on a Tuesday, and in the middle of summer, I didn't know what to expect. The restaurant selection was very good, but as all airports, pretty over-expensive. The cleanliness of the washrooms was extremely questionable, but the cleanliness of the terminal was incredible. My gate was not one of the newly renovated parts, so it did not have iPads or seating; but I found a very close restaurant and seating, however, my only source of entertainment, my phone died. But luckily, the terminal provided not only a standard Canadian/American outlet, but a USB port. Now, for the boarding. The boarding was very organized, and I was very surprised that the entire lot of passengers was boarded in under 20 mins. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and if you get the opportunity to transit there, I would recommend the airport."
7th November 2019,1,"""set up very backwards""","✅ Trip Verified | The place is set up very backwards. You have to go through security and customs twice if you are on a connecting flight. Security and customs takes forever and the people working it are very rude. They are not willing to put any effort in helping you and are out of patience when you try to ask them. I arrived two hours early and still missed my flight due to security, customs, and no help from the staff. Also outlets for charging are few and far between and rarely work. Small choice for food. Avoid this airport I’m never coming back"
3rd November 2019,1,"""nothing good I can say""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is the biggest dumpster fire of an airport I have ever experienced in my life. The security checks are the most time-consuming process that is redundant with staff that literally seem like they are in a competition to see who can move the slowest or form the biggest line.

31st October 2019,1,"""chaos and confusion""","Not Verified |  You always should be aware, that Canada counts itself as an industrial country, that is a member of G7 and has one of the largest economies in the world. However, you wouldn't believe that, when entering and flying from Toronto Pearson Airport, that falls much behind the airports of Kinshasa, Asmara or somewhere else in a non-developed country. The airport tries to be modern (or sees itself at least this way) and automatizes everything from Check-In to baggage drop-off, but as it frequently happens, the loss of human beings is paid with chaos and confusion. You even have to print out your baggage tags yourself - if you are used to that as Canadian, this might be okay, but as a foreigner you first get lost at this airport as there is no competent or helpful staff to support this. Due to that automatic nonsense it is for example not possible to drop off your baggage earlier than three hours before your flight - that is well-known from airports in Africa, but in other airports, e.g. Frankfurt, you can check in and drop off your baggage already 24 hours before. In Toronto they only try to sell their airport lounges (only online of course, because at that time you don't know what you have to expect) and when you arrive at the airport, you cannot use them (although booked per hour), because you are not allowed to drop off your baggage - needless to stay that the run-down state line Air Canada does not inform you about that before. I could follow now with the absurd long security queues, the unfriendly personnel, etc., but other reviewers have done that already."
23rd October 2019,1,"""employees who are way too relaxed""","✅ Trip Verified |  This airport is the worst. It looks shiny and new but is filled with employees who are way too relaxed, don’t care, and have a “waiting to retire attitude”. A front line Manager at Air Canada is a perfect example of someone who clearly doesn’t care about his job. This is a person who is supposed to be a leader and help you but instead has the monotone attitude that should never be customer facing. I could not imagine having someone so uninspiring be a front facing representative of my company. I guess airlines hire bad people knowing you don’t have a choice and it doesn’t matter."
17th October 2019,1,"""security was an absolute nightmare""","Not Verified |  The queues from plane right through to baggage were horrific. At one point at the top of a moving stairs the congestion became quite scary. Getting through security was an absolute nightmare, one person to help everyone. Document process machines wouldn't work. It was really really hot in the terminal, pure hell. To cap it off by the time we got to baggage claim we had to search for our bags which had been taken off the conveyor belt and were left in the middle of the floor. It was 2 and a half hours before we got out of the airport. Never ever again will I fly into Toronto airport. Very bad organisation, more staff needed."
5th October 2019,1,"""Hardly any staff to offer guidance""","Not Verified |  Lines at T3 to clear customs were ridiculously long, confusing and no matter what passport you have or if you were connecting or not everyone is in the same line. Hardly any staff to offer guidance. Nightmare."
28th September 2019,2,"""would like to avoid""","Not Verified | I heard about how the airport was terrible before. It was true. The officers were aggressive, some of the staff were not helpful at all. The signs which lead to the gates were sometimes not clear, so I got lost. This airport is the one I would like to avoid from now on."
27th September 2019,2,"""Ridiculous queues""",Not Verified |  Ridiculous queues at USA security. Only 4 agents checking people through. Flights delayed while waiting for people to get through the lines ups. No facilitation of airport staff to prioritize people by order of departure times.
26th September 2019,2,"""the priority queue was ignored""","Not Verified |  Checking in was chaotic, as are most airports, but on this trip this was our 5th airport and it was the most disorganised. The check in machines didn’t work so we then had to join the queue for “assistance”. Then a member of staff went along the queue asking for anyone for the London flight to join another priority queue, which we did. Two customers at the front started arguing and the staff who had dealt with them were then taken off line, leaving less desks open. Then the longer queue was being called and the priority queue was ignored. At last we got to a desk and the clerk said sarcastically that they were about to close check-in in 5 minutes and we were lucky! Really? Having stood staring at the staff for half an hour while we queued, and having arrived well within the two hours, we didn’t feel that lucky! We then headed for the gate. There is no central area to wait prior to the gate, you are sign posted straight to the gate where there is very little seating, and certainly not enough for a large flight. At the gate, there was the usual boarding chaos as there is at all airports. Can’t review shops or food as we didn’t get the opportunity, and didn’t log into wifi."
25th September 2019,2,"""Ditch the kiosks please""","Not Verified |  Agree with all the other reviews. Very chaotic entry system. Lots of different stages and ""holding pens"" staff must be highly stressed working there. I arrive here once a year on a visit to family, and the new kiosk entry system has really made things worse. I guess it is either a precaution against terrorists or something to do with preventing cannabis being brought in from elsewhere since the law changed. After a very long walk up and down various steps and escalators you arrive in a customs hall where you are told to find a kiosk with a green light. The explanatory drawing on the machine is not helpful as it refers to an ID card and doesn't tell you you need to put your passport face down. You need to be fairly skilled in inputting into a computer to answer the questionnaire. It takes skill to get your face at the right angle to get your photo taken. Staff try to help but its so busy with confused people, especially those on connecting flights panicking. Its not even clear how to get out of the hall. Staff do their best. They can't indulge in chit chat in such chaos. They must be stressed to hell. They must hate people after working in such conditions. No wonder they don't smile. After another long walk you end up in another hall with those long queues snaking through with barrier tapes. You go through a physical barrier, show your passport and customs receipt, answer more questions, with another long walk through barriers where you show your receipt twice more before you get to the baggage hall. Allow about one hour for all this at quiet times. Do not throw away, lose or screw up the receipt with your face on. You'll never get out otherwise. Before the introduction of this system you used to just join one long queue and clear customs and border control through one exit point. Yes, you queued for ages, but it was simpler. l would describe Toronto Pearson as a modern version of one of Dantes Circles of Hell. I've been through some busy airports like JFK but never experienced such chaos as this. Ditch the kiosks please. Let's have grumpy humans again!"
23rd September 2019,2,"""Not many options for food""","✅ Trip Verified | I have completed two round trips to Toronto for business in the past three months. Both times with AA, flying in and out of terminal 3. Arrivals: (June and Sept 2019. Both Sunday early and mid-day arrivals) Pretty straight forward each time. Talked to CBSA general questions. Asked about tooling for work. No problems. Departures: (two weeks later each time Friday travel late afternoon). Again pretty straight forward. Declared items sent for extra screening questions. Talked to U.S. CBP No problems. Proceeded to terminal gates (T3 A gates). Not many options for food, small and can get crowded. Went upstairs to the premier lounge and it was standing room only. Not a fan of this part of Pearson. Down at the bottom for airport departures due to lack of amenities. No complaints about arrivals or security."
21st September 2019,1,"""more like a fish market""","Not Verified |  I would give this airport security staff a negative 10-star rating. This airport looks more like a fish market with security constantly shouting at your face at TSA. Although this was my first experience with this team I will make sure that it’s also the last because that’s how bad they were. I am a frequent traveler and I have never seen such unprofessional and arrogant staff. If you want to know what hell looks like then visit Toronto Pearson airport where the staff do not love their job, they hate it and they hate you too."
17th September 2019,1,"""staff can be jaw-droppingly dismissive""","Not Verified |  I googled ""Toronto airport awful"" to see whether the staff and processes are really as bad as my experience with Pearson has been, and the short answer seems to be yes. The staff can be jaw-droppingly dismissive, rude, and insensitive to travelers. Travelers are pointed to lines without any signage or verbal explanations of what to expect, and the lines can long and slow-moving, with no apparent concern about passengers missing flight connections for no good or even known reason. I was in what apparently is the ""immigration rejects"" line, though an ordinary tourist simply in transit between a flight in from the U.S. and a separate flight out of Canada. I have a ""known traveler"" ID in the U.S., and had nothing remotely unusual to declare or explain, but the immigration process (though I was just going from one airport gate to another) took three hours. I saw one woman who apparently took a wrong turn and had discarded her immigration slip being forced to go through immigration again - thereby meaning she would miss her flight connection - beg frantically and repeatedly to be able to talk to a superior instead, but was coldly refused any recourse or consideration, or even a human-to-human dialogue. Forcing the passenger to go through the process again might have been reasonable, but the way the staffer treated the woman was a horrible experience even for standers-by. About an hour later, the guy behind me laughed out loud with gallows humor because about 5 out of 6 of the personnel staffing the processing desks seemed to be having a leisurely huddle together instead. They never even glanced in acknowledgement, much less with reassurance, to all the people they kept waiting that much longer in line."
16th September 2019,1,"""will never connect through here again""",✅ Trip Verified | Stuck at the gate on Air Canada and cannot deplane because jetway will not move. Absolutely ridiculous. Need to make next flight. After 45 minutes moving to another gate. Will most likely miss connections due to customs and shoddy airport equipment. I will never connect through here again.
8th September 2019,1,"""Under manning is rife!""","✅ Trip Verified | Under manning is rife! On arrival there was a queue to get to a machine which asked lots of questions which would have been easier and faster with a person or online when applying for the visa. Rather confusing and slow after an 8 hour flight. Then you get a voucher and after walking miles you get to a huge holding pen in a vast hall full of people where you queue again for a what seems like an eternity. Eventually there is a real person who asks you why you are there and sends you on your way. In this vast hall full of people somebody was having trouble with a machine and called out ""Does anybody actually work here"" but there was no answer. So presumably there wasn't! On departure there was a big board saying ""Step 1. Check in at a kiosk. Step 2 Proceed to bag drop"". Unfortunately it didn't say how you identify a 'kiosk', and I queued at the bag drop thinking I was going to a kiosk. The result was it would not accept my bag because I had not got a label (There was nothing to say you need to get a label) so I had to go back to the label printing machine 'kiosk' and then queue again for the bag drop (for 20 mins). The second time round I had to redirect somebody else who had made the same mistake. The end of the queue was at one end of the line of bag drop machines and there was a crowd of people trying to stick their tags onto their luggage in the middle so the next person in the queue could not see the free machines at the far end so stayed in the queue. The result was the machines were heavily under-utilised and the queue was much slower than it needed to be. In fact they only seemed to be used by the few people who lost patience and jumped out of the queue to use them. The kiosk gives you a luggage tag, but there was no explanation of what to do with all the separate peelable parts of the tag so I had to ask one of the 2 very harassed staff members to do it for me. At security there was a woman member of staff heckling the passengers in the queue that they, the staff could process us much more quickly if we weren't so slow and if we didn't do everything wrong. Well there is not much surprise about that. They have the months or years of training and we don't! Perhaps the training is failing if the staff think this is the way to make things work better! Everywhere in the airport all the food was served on disposable plates with disposable cutlery and drinks were served in disposable cups. Conventional reusable china plates and cups seem to be non-existent. It does not need to be like this. This is not sustainable. What happens to all this waste?"
5th September 2019,1,"""have never experienced anything like this""","Not Verified |  My experience going through customs at Toronto Pearson airport was crazy. Many others complain that the agents were rude but the people I encountered were just plain cruel which was surprising. We arrived three hours before our departing flight and I was traveling with my mom who was in a wheelchair. I escorted her all the way through the airport up to customs. When I tried to go with her through customs an agent began to yell at me stating that if I didn’t share a physical address with my mother I would have to go to the end of the line by myself while she was escorted through the handicap line on her own. This wouldn’t have been such an issue if I hadn’t spent a huge amount of time navigating the airport with my mother in the wheelchair. Additionally, the fact that this agent berated me in public with my wheelchair bound mother right there watching just seemed hateful and hurtful. I missed my flight but my mother made it. As a result she had to wait at the airport in our home town for my flight to get in so I could give her a ride home. I’m not sure what the deal is with this airport or the customs there. I have traveled internationally to almost every continent and have never experienced anything like this in my life. I hope this airport and it’s local municipality work to make the experience for traveler maybe a bit more compassionate if not quicker or easier. Until then, I will avoid this airport and it’s disgruntled employees like the plague."
2nd September 2019,2,"""very little staff availability""",Not Verified |  Returning from a family holiday. My main complaint is the fact that on arrival there was utter chaos with very little staff availability. Still my luggage did not get stuck in the system as it did the last time we were there. Last March we visited Singapore and it might be a good idea if some Pearson executives visited Changi to see what an airport can be like.
29th August 2019,5,"""left me speechless""","✅ Trip Verified | Canada has a well-deserved reputation for being very friendly. As a citizen of the USA (but have moved to Mexico) I am quite accustomed to rude TSA airport security folks. But today's interaction with the group who were running the scanner area at about 6am at Toronto Pearson left me speechless. They berated customers, yelled at folks who I'm pretty sure didn't speak English, and basically made us all feel like idiots because we did not immediately grasp your particular airport's system. We were earlier on the same trip in two different airports and everything was different. We had never been to Toronto before and it might have taken just a few seconds to explain what was expected but they spent the same amount of time trying to belittle us. The place was not crowded (maybe eight people in line) and I don't care if they had a long night or a bad day - we might have had the same problems. I bit my tongue because I didn't want to be further humiliated by a search or be subjected to more abusive questioning by calling them out on their boorish behavior. I know this complaint will go nowhere but if you look online, there seem to be quite a few similar complaints. These few employees don't serve your goals at the airport or the reputation of Canada. Please don't turn into the USA. One of those is enough!"
24th August 2019,2,"""show my passport a total of eight times""","Not Verified |  The idea of security demands that you have a ""sterile corridor"" once you have passed security. Toronto Pearson does not do this. Instead of needing to show my passport once or at most twice as in modern airports, I had to show my passport a total of eight times within one fifty minute period, in one instance to get into a room and another to get our of the same room. The personnel are petty an officious but that is only to be expected. Standing on line is never fun but it is tolerable if you think that you will be treated equitably. Instead, lines were created, opened and closed for no reason, allowing those who had not waited to be routed ahead of those who had. I was told they were ""special."" That is surprising because some were members of my own party. The USA has transplanted customs to be done at Toronto instead of at people's destination (in this case ATL). That part worked well but came as a surprise since it conservatively added thirty minutes to a 90 minute layover. Probably the worse part was the ground operation for Delta, my connection. We arrived barely in time to get in line only to discover after having stood in line for long minutes, that we had to have our passports ""verified"" (that sterile corridor thing again). That took another ten minutes of standing in a long and slowly moving line to rectify. Al in all we got on as the door was closing and were treated to a steward whose primary interest was getting off on time. he was ""shoveling manure"" not dealing with humans. Do not go to Toronto Pearson without at least three hours to play around with the petty bureaucrats and feckless regulations before hand or on layover."
22nd August 2019,1,"""queues were unbelievable""",Not Verified |  Very aggressive and unhelpful staff from beginning to end. The queues were unbelievable. Thank goodness we weren’t connecting. Awful. Avoid Pearson if you can.
21st August 2019,1,"""this airport is getting worse every time I come""","Not Verified |  Don’t kid yourself this is the worst dirty airport, rude security officers. No help for disabled people they actually ran away. People sit in disabled seats and don’t even bother getting up. The carpets are filthy there’s garbage all around. The restaurants looked pretty bad, I will not eat at them. All of the workers have the worst attitude. I live in New York City and this has to be the worst. I’ve been to many airports around the world and this airport is getting worse every time I come."
20th August 2019,1,"""an embarrassing mess of chaos""","✅ Trip Verified | My arrival experience at Pearson was, similar to many reported here, an embarrassing mess of chaos from mass disorganization by YYZ staff and management. From the time I arrived after an 8.5 hour flight via Air France (which was excellent BTW) my mood quickly changed from relaxed to tense as the entire 777 cabin (260+ passengers!) was remanded into a single line to endure the new 'express' check in kiosks. Useless time waster as staff were unable to handle the capacity of arrivals. Absolutely agitating and embarrassing. Shame on YYZ. The epitome of chaos was a crowd of 70 tired travelers squeezed improperly-and unsafely-at the top of an escalator in a corridor while waiting to process us down to the customs holding area. our YYZ ""handler"" was literally yelling at everyone that customs below ""is too overcrowded and you have to wait a few minutes"" to allow descent. I was humiliated for all the international travelers there, as this is my home city and it showed a complete amateurism in processing us all to a simple customs check out. I could go on again, but safe to say, as a sole business proprietor, I would fire all of the GTAA management and start again- this time with professionals who are respectful to human beings, not cattle herding."
19th August 2019,1,"""our awful experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  We have just returned from a holiday in Canada which was partially ruined by our awful experience at Toronto Lester Pearson Airport. At the start of our trip, we had to change Terminals but, even though we had allowed 2.5 hours between flights, we missed our connection. The airline rebooked us on a later flight with the comment that people are seldom allowed enough time to change Terminals. After the inbound flight it didn’t take long to collect our bags but things started to go wrong immediately we set off for the other terminal. We knew, from a little prior research on the Internet, that we would need to take the train. The trouble is there are no clear signs to the trains when you want one. The train makes 3 stops: Terminals 1 & 3 and Viscount - this a car park. Stop announcements are not made so you don’t know which stop you have arrived at. Moreover, signs are in English as well as French which is a puzzle since French is 15th in the list of common languages spoken in Toronto. Given that my wife is MENSA qualified and I am retired aircrew I am surprised it took us long to realise that International Departure and Domestic Departures are signed by a picture of a Globe and that of a Maple Leaf thereby avoiding normal lettering used throughout world airports. I suppose this is a brilliant idea to overcome language problems but it doesn’t work because Maple Leaf emblems are everywhere. After landing we both headed for toilets only to find the queue for the ladies 20 deep across the walkway and a line in the men’s because there were only 2 urinals. Between floors the elevators are nowhere near large enough with the result that shins are banged into by carts. To add to confusion one double elevator is covered in an advertisement but is not identified as an elevator. It’s true purpose is given away by the call button. Nowhere is there a sign informing how long it will take to walk to a Gate and directions are not often repeated. I had intended to take my hosts a bottle of whiskey but by then I was in the Domestic Terminal which does not sell alcohol. When we eventually reached our gate there was less than 45 minutes before departure and so insufficient time to accept our hold luggage. On our return we deliberately allowed 10 hours to change Terminals. Even though we had experience of the procedure it still took a couple of hours. We then discovered that we would not be allowed to our airside lounge until 4 hours before departure. To recover our composure we decided to have a drink but we couldn’t find a bar or restaurant; however we managed to buy a coffee but then couldn’t find anywhere to sit or place a boiling hot cup. In fact there is no seating area nor anywhere so, at the suggestion of the airline, we left the airport for a room in the conveniently located Sheraton. Later, we again set off to drop our bag and then find the lounge at Gate C32. Thanks to use of my iPhone I discovered that this lounge is located as far as possible from the Gate and would take us half an hour to walk. There are no signs informing of this. Once at the gate, I thought it would be rather nice to buy a t-shirt for my 9-year old grandson in the shop. There were plenty to choose from but not emblazoned with an interesting picture of Canada. I could find only those promoting some sports logo known to few outside Canada."
15th August 2019,1,"""absolutely chaotic""","✅ Trip Verified | I travelled to Dublin on July 31 returning on August 13 with Air Transat at terminal 3. The terminal was absolutely chaotic. The check-in process was a complete mess with line ups everywhere and no organization at all. While Air Transat deserves some blame for the chaos, the experience that I had from entering the terminal to sitting down on the aircraft was easily the worst I ever had. T3 is a disgrace to this country and it makes most 3rd world airports look like models of efficiency. Bad and all that my outgoing trip was through T3, nothing could have prepared me for the arrival experience on August 13. It was simply unbelievable! Catastrophic overcrowding, seemingly endless line ups, no organization, passport machines that would not work, bewildered confused people, airport workers shouting contradictory instructions to people, rudeness from staff and almost intolerable heat. That the GTAA would create and maintain such an inhumane environment for travel-weary people is unbelievable. T3 is a shocking embarrassment to Toronto and it leaves a very bad first impression with visitors. I felt sorry for seniors and children in this dreadful and punishingly difficult environment. It was easily the very worst experience I have had in over 50 years of air travel. Shame on you GTAA!"
13th August 2019,3,"""Will avoid YYZ at all costs in future""","✅ Trip Verified | As a result of weather our flight was delayed arriving at YYZ and we missed our connection. So, we were rescheduled for some 6 hours later and had to remain in the airport and were not permitted to check in until 0400 hrs. Facilities in the check-in area are dismal, dirty washrooms, inadequate seating, continuous elevator piped music, etc. One bright spot was a young man cleaning staff who helped a fellow passenger who was sick and had vomited. He cleaned up the mess and then returned during his meal break to check she was ok. My wife did not get his name, however, it was around 0230 hrs 13 August at the West Jet check-in area. The manager (CEO) of the YYZ airport should take the time to visit other ""world Class"" airports such as Charles de Galle, Hong Kong, etc where appropriate facilities are provided some at no additional cost for weary travelers (Proper seating, Quiet areas, Dimmed lighting, etc. Just check out Charles de Galle. Will avoid YYZ at all costs in future."
10th August 2019,1,"""every time it gets worse""","✅ Trip Verified | I travel frequently through Pearson and every time it gets worse. The latest ""innovation"" for arrivals are banks of electronic kiosks which are jammed up, some don't work and the line ups are ridiculous. International arrivals also have to complete an ETA before flight so adds an extra layer of bureaucracy. Took over 35 minutes to get through the lineup and then you have to line up to get through passport control then pick up luggage and eventually exit - well over an hour and a half. The luggage hall is jammed up and the latest is folks removing bags onto the floor in hopes that you will hire them to take you to your transportation. There is also a man who solicits pax coming out for taxi rides - he is not an authorised taxi for the airport. Flying back through and using my nexus was bounced into another long line so that a large crew from an international flight could be put through first and it was organised chaos I truly wish there was an alternative airport to Pearson. Disorganized, dirty and just a poor experience for an international airport of this importance."
29th July 2019,1,"""tried to get his attention several times""","✅ Trip Verified | My brother and I, both deaf and wear hearing aids in both ears, were yelled at and threatened with being disallowed to depart to Varadero, Cuba by a staff member. I tried to get his attention several times to clarify the announcements for departures being made at the time. After being blatantly and deliberately ignored by departure security people, I merely asked three baggage handlers if they could tell us what had just been announced. The man spun around and began hollering at me all the way back to my seat and threatened to cancel my vacation. I tried telling him we are hard of hearing to no avail as he was visibly seething with anger."
28th July 2019,2,"""chaotic experience""","✅ Trip Verified | It was a chaotic experience with Air Canada. There was not any clear direction provided to those coming from connecting flights as to what was happening about retrieving luggage since I had come from a connecting flight. Finding airport staff to answer questions was a hit and miss process. Conflicting information was given. A new flight was provided the next day. Finding a phone to check what was happening was difficult and the wait on the phone was long and crowded. No assistance with overnight accommodation was even considered or any advice given. Not all overseas travelers have an active phone with which to call a hotel. When eventually I found out how to collect my luggage, I was not permitted to take my personal effects, i.e. handbag with me to collect it. I was forced to trust it to a fellow stranded passenger whom I had only just met and did not know. I would have been willing to have my carry on bags searched for security but this was not an option provided. The whole process took several hours to process."
25th July 2019,1,"""A thoroughly disgraceful display""",Not Verified |  Arrived from overseas yesterday to be met with a mob of the rudest people at Terminal three. Passengers moving from the airline shuttle bus to the self service customs kiosks were shouted at and subjected to unconcealed contempt. A thoroughly disgraceful display and an experience that will colour many people’s first impression of Canada. Sadly as a long time resident I am painfully aware of the fiction of the polite Canadian.
22nd July 2019,3,"""horrendous, unorganized airport""","Not Verified |  I had connecting flights. On the way to Manchester I had the unfortunate opportunity to experience this horrendous, unorganized airport. The positive note, I didn't need to go to a gym to get a good workout. Speed walking through the many, mile long corridors was stressful and discouraging. All I wanted was to get a bite to eat and have a drink, and find my gate. There was a few gate changes and every time it sent me into a panicking game of hide and seek. The gates are not always clear from the signs and are hidden behind stores and the food court. The lounge was cramped and crowded, hard to maneuver around people's feet. On the way back to Winnipeg, we were herded around to line after line, and did the miles of walking. I was extremely tired to the point I could've collapsed on the floor, and very dehydrated from the flight. It felt like the herding around wouldn't end. This was also the first time I got to talk to a security agent who could see I wasn't alright but she said that it's allowable to sleep in the lounge. We were herded onto a bus, then shuttled to the next terminal, then I had to go back upstairs. The corridor was vast and when I found the lounge I thought closest to my gate I found the seats are designed to prevent people laying down on them. I tried to find a way around that but I got uncomfortable and moved to the low, metal window sill. I was desperate to sleep. I thought airports provided something for passengers on several hour layovers to kick back and have a rest. I got up with ample time before my flight and found my gate was elsewhere. It was actually in an area under renovations. Literally, people were still there at night working on the renovations with the hammering and drilling and the beeping of machines backing up. The washrooms are not as nice as Winnipeg's Richardson airport. Maybe it's an airport size issue with me. It was my first international flight. But seeing other reviews this doesn't seem the norm."
21st July 2019,3,"""woefully lacking in outlets""","✅ Trip Verified |  Signage fairly clear and when you could find an employee they were helpful with directions. For an airport of this size it is woefully lacking in outlets to charge your phones etc. Gates had 1 receptacle and few and far between walking around to find one. When you have a four hour layover (which extended to 5.5) you definitely need access to charge. Most annoying issue was changing of gates, we had been warned in Vancouver that this occurred but the true hassle needs to be experienced. On our flight to Dublin, not only was craft delayed 1.5 hours but we changed gates, this consisted of a 20 minute walk, difficult with a 75 year old carrying carry-on baggage and purse. On our return flight another 4 hour layover jockeying for plug-in space, yet another gate change, gathered our sleep deprived bodies, carryons, duty free purchases and tromped with the mob to our new gate, I actually woke a poor gentleman as he had not heard the overhead, this trek was about 10 minute, but felt longer due to an already 12 hour day, only to hear the overhead, just as we arrived at the gate, tell us to return to the original gate. Much grumbling and frustration amongst all, especially all the over 65’s. Shuttle cars zipped by us repeatedly, empty with driver only and seemingly no interest in assisting people with transport. Seriously worst airport experience."
19th February 2022,9,"""YVR remains Canada's best airport""",✅ Trip Verified |  Flew through YVR both on my way to BKK through NRT and back. I was especially impressed with the good organization when returning to Canada. Employees were stationed at a number of critical locations to direct passengers. The airport has installed new machines to complete the entry declarations for the customs officers and this went smoothly. My luggage was sent on directly to my final destination of YYC without a hitch even though the connecting time was short. One has to say that the YVR remains Canada's best airport.
19th December 2021,1,"""The security screening is literally the worst""","✅ Trip Verified |  I will never make a connection in YVR ever again. Connection times are impossible to make now, with having to be re-routed outside of the secure area to re check-in for connecting flights and then pass through security again. Departing from YVR to MEX, there was one person checking the papers/vaccination etc of over 400 passengers. It was a 2.5 hour process to check in. No one is to be seen anywhere in the airport for help if needed, except for the overstaffed COVID test area where there is an excess of employees standing around directing you to get a test, including police officers. Bathrooms and food areas are disgusting and unclean. The security screening is literally the worst example I have ever seen as a world traveller. The staff are rude, especially the manager that stands around doing nothing. The screening is excessive and illogical, it is almost laughable. Security staff will not let you use your own 1L plastic bag, instead they pull you aside and transfer your stuff to another bag- which is the exact same ziplock bag! Staff are overly picky and power hungry, I witnessed them refuse to screen a passenger because he was trying to make flight and was justifiably angry at the delay, then the agent shut down the screening machine and walked away saying ‘he couldn’t concentrate’- leaving my bags along with other passengers bags stuck inside the machine, making us all late. On my return, same dismal experience and the agent made me destroy an expensive boxed gift from duty free containing honey pots because they wouldn’t fit in the plastic bag. I was not ‘allowed’ to use a second bag he said. As soon as I said I would not throw any of my belongings out, I was pushed aside so the ‘manager’ could come over and treat me like a criminal, causing a scene and telling me, ""you want this guy to lose his job? Then do as he says!” I actually do hope the manager and the agent lose their jobs because they are not fit for purpose. Border agents on return when 3 international flights landed with hundreds of passengers each - three. Incredibly rude and asked the stupidest questions I have ever heard that had nothing to do with immigration. Then I was ‘randomly’ selected (tell me how it is random when there is no machine making the selection random, it is the border agent who decides based on what you say) to do a PCR test, having to leave the secure area again and re check in and go through security again in the span of an hour?! The entire Lufthansa crew was left waiting with no one screening them, and the pilot loudly told the border agents how ridiculous the entire process in YVR is, to which everyone there agreed. It was actually embarrassing to know that this is what the first impression of Canada is to all of those travellers and airline staff from around the world. Overall, after travelling from other parts of the world, landing in YVR is like landing in a paranoid pit of incompetence, with staff going off on power trips whenever they can. The security screening needs a complete overhaul."
10th November 2021,5,"""Shame on the agents who thought this behavior was appropriate""","Not Verified |  I travel extensively and I have never experienced such intrusive measures and apparent justification of one's job. The CSB agents were pulling apart everyone's carry-ons, apparently looking for liquids. In my case, rifling through my dirty underwear and bras for all to see, redistributing fragile items and placing my legal sized liquids into their labeled 1 litre bag versus my zip loc bag, for no other reason than grandstanding. Then handing me the 1 litre bag like some sort of trophy, directing me to take my bag to a nearby table to repack. I felt demeaned and then angry about the treatment I received as a law abiding Canadian. Shame on the agents who thought this behavior was appropriate and the managers who support this archaic practice."
27th October 2021,1,"""never have I ever had such a horrific experience like the one I did at YVR""","Not Verified |  Never did I ever think to write a review about an airport, because out of all the countries (18) and States (28) I have visited, have I ever had such a horrific experience like the one I did at YVR. I just wish I would have read the reviews before my travels to Canada, because I would have never purchased a ticket to fly there. I honestly suggest that Canada close their boarders to American's if you don't like us! Especially if you are going to treat us like unwanted, covid infected aliens! If you don't want tourists in your country, it's very simple, close your borders to us, I'm sure you have the power to do so. Immigration has the worst attitude! Beyond rude and so inconsiderate! I have always been extremely respectful of any country I visit and obey their laws, however, Immigration made us feel so unwelcome. Come to find out, I was not the only one who had this experience. A few of us went outside the airport and shared the same complaints and mind you, we all dealt with a different officer. Here are of few examples of what I experienced and based on the reviews I read, it's very common. 1) Many of us were told we have been ""randomly selected"" to take a covid test there at the airport, even though we already had our negative covid test confirmation and vaccine cards verified before arriving at the airport. 2) I was asked for the address to where I would be staying. Although I had already entered that on ArriveCan 72 hours prior to departure. I did not mind answering the same question again, however, the officer said I didn't pronounce the street name correctly and was annoyed by it. What brings you to Canada? We are here for visiting for the first time. 3) Officer asked me how I was getting around in Canada. I had rented a car. He asked me, ""do you know how to drive in Canada. ""Well I've never been to Canada, as I said this was my first time visiting, but I asked him, why is it difficult to drive in Canada? He says, well it's rains here. I'm sure he was assuming that because I'm from LA I don't know how to drive in the rain. Little does he know that I have driven South America and Mexico (where they don't obey the driving laws) and I how I have driven my RV cross country! 5) He asked me, after you leave the airport, where are you going? I told him our first stop was Gransville, then Gastown and then to our Airbnb. He looked down at my passport for a while and I asked him, Is Gransville a good place to eat, we are starving. He says, I don't know. We finally a clear to go to get re-tested for covid when I hear them paging my name. It was the airline that our baggage didn't make it to Vancouver and that it would arrive on the next flight the next day. The attendant at the counter had me file a report, gave me my incident number and then asked me to take a form over to exiting officer. We walk it over and once again we were questioned. I told the gentleman that I was to give him this form because our baggage didn't make it. Question: What is inside your suitcase? Our clothes and toiletries, What else? Our shoes. What else? Do you need me to name everything one by one? Any Alcohol or tobacco? No, we don't have any of that. Again, very rude. With all that happened we forgot to exchange our money at the airport and our money no one would take our money. Thank goodness for our credit card."
10th September 2021,5,"""the immigration officers weren't interacting very pleasantly with incoming visitors""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is quite...the experience. Upon arrival from the US, using the passport scanning machine was a breeze. Waiting in line to speak with an immigration officer was not, in true Canadian fashion, the immigration officers weren't interacting very pleasantly with incoming visitors (the worst I've encountered in about 20 countries). Even though I had proof of a negative PCR test result and proof of full vaccination, I was still ordered to undergo a PCR test in the airport, as a random selectee (pursuant to Canada's Quarantine Act). The on-site personnel who registered patients and administered the tests were very courteous, which I appreciated. Nevertheless, while I greatly appreciate that Canada is taking this pandemic far more seriously and responsibly than the US, this random selection added some serious stress to the first 24 or so hours of my trip. Thankfully, I never had to actually quarantine anyway, as I tested negative and was even able to present that negative result for reentry to the US! Now, I'm glad to say that departing from Vancouver to go back to the US was a much easier process. All I had to do was present that PCR negative to the airline check-in in order to obtain my ticket, then go through Canadian security (as unpleasant as their immigration), then go through US immigration and customs using Global Entry. Using GE, I breezed through the US checkpoint in less than five minutes, with the most pleasant and professional immigration officer I've ever met (her fellow US officers, as well as Canada, should take pointers from her!) Then once in the trans-border section of the terminal, there were relatively few stores and restaurants open (due to COVID), but I was still able to buy coffee, souvenirs and lunch with ease, and pleasant service. The gate agent for United was also pleasant. The views upon arrival and departure can be spectacular. My only real complaints about this airport are the Canadian immigration and customs process, as well as the crummy restrooms and the fact that the facility is largely outdated, dirty, and just kind of depressing. All in all, YVR is slightly below-average. However, if you're flying to the ""Canadian Southwest""/US Pacific NW, then Seattle's airport is also generally dumpy, and Victoria (BC), Abbottsford (BC), and Bellingham (WA) will all be rather inconvenient to get to from Vancouver, so I guess YVR unfortunately doesn't find any incentive to improve at this time."
21st May 2021,1,"""the absolute worst airport I have ever been through""","Not Verified |  Must say after traveling around Asia for many years, Vancouver Airport is the absolute worst airport I have ever been through. Super long lines for baggage claim and even longer for Immigration. Waiting for baggage for over 45 minutes and being questioned for 30 minutes by a customs officer before I even got to Customs. They wander around the baggage area after a 13 hour flight from Taipei, the Customs kept confusing Taiwan with Thailand and sent me to secondary inspection. Tried to explain that they are two different countries, but the guy had no clue. Your job is to protect our country and you don't even know basic geography? 1.5 hours later after having all my bags ripped apart, I was finally allowed to exit Manila Airport is a piece of cake compared to Vancouver Airport."
10th April 2020,10,"""it was very open, spacious, and inviting""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport was one of the best I've been to, most likely my favourite. There was plenty of very beautiful artwork throughout the terminal, and it was very open, spacious, and inviting. There was plenty of seats available, it was very clean, and there was an extensive selection of food and beverage stores in the E gates. The directions were very clear, and all the staff were very friendly and willing to help. The lines at security and customs and immigration were very short. The Wi-Fi there was free and very fast. Overall, this is an excellent airport: it considerably exceeded my expectations, and I would go out of my way to fly through YVR again."
3rd March 2020,4,"""Long lines, slow security personnel""","✅ Trip Verified | Overall the airport is good but customs lines and security is always a nightmare. Long lines, slow security personnel. The guy literally body scanned me for 2 minutes holding up a big line behind me. The management needs to go walk through these lines and see why this airport is rated only 5/10. All the Asia airports (4 in last 24 hrs) were smooth as silk."
18th February 2020,3,"""struggling to cope""",Not Verified | The food options at YVR are improving but the amount of time spent waiting is unbelievable. Slow and long lines for security while departing. The customs hall for arrivals is a total mess with many passengers confused and in the wrong line up. I have waited up to an hour for my checked luggage to arrive on the belt. YVR is very aesthetically-pleasing but it is struggling to cope with the number of passengers it is receiving.
11th January 2020,10,"""staff once again were kind and genuine""","✅ Trip Verified |   I want to thank the kind people of Air New Zealand for their professional yet caring handling of my recent situation. Somewhere between Calgary and Vancouver, I lost or had my passport stolen and was unable to board my flight to Auckland with my family. The staff were persistent in helping me in my near panicked state to search my bags while the aircraft was being readied for flight. Unable to produce a passport, the staff sympathetically ushered me to a place in the airport where I met a family member. When I returned to the airport the next day after miraculously acquiring a new passport, flight and Visas, the friendly staff of Air New Zealand greeted me with the same warmth and compassion I had experienced the night before. They informed me that I had been bumped up to Business class and was offered access to the VIP lounge in the airport before my flight. Once inside the Lounge and breathing again for the first time in a day, Douglas Siefert, Vancouver Airport Operations Manager came to the lounge to personally greet me and ensure I was aware of the many luxuries including fabulous food and drinks that I was free to take advantage of. When boarding the flight, the staff once again were kind and genuine, having recognized how overwhelmed I had been the night before watching my family depart on the flight which I could not depart on. I just want to say thank you to the team who so kindly helped me. That was my first experience in Business class and what a way to start my vacation! This was a long awaited holiday where my son, wife and their 8 month old were travelling with me to Australia for my other sons graduation from medical school and then onto New Zealand for Christmas. Having lost my husband in the summer of 2018, this was going to be a very special time with my boys and their wives and families. You can imagine how I would have felt when I couldn't board the flight which was the beginning of this vacation! The staff did not know my story yet were kind, helpful and accommodating. This is a story I will tell over and over as their kindness (which seems to be rarer and rarer these days), made such an impact on me and the experience In Business class was like none other. It goes to show that simple acts of kindness will always be appreciated. We don’t often know what someone else is going through so in the words of another “be kind to each other”! Thank you again Air New Zealand!"
6th January 2020,1,"""a lot of complaints online but nothing changes""","✅ Trip Verified | The airline check-in staff are always very pleasant and accommodating. But the security Staff scanning the luggage are always unpleasant and rude to passengers scolding them. Also the security scanning the hand carrying luggage are always trying to pick an argument with passengers and are very rude, unpleasant and condescending to passengers. I have been through Vancouver airport a dozen times in 2018 and 2019 and always the same experience with Vancouver airport security, it seems there are a lot of complaints online but nothing changes."
24th December 2019,5,"""waited for over 1 hour at the check-in""",Not Verified |  This airport is a nice hub airport in Canada. I live in Vancouver and I am on a vacation to Lima. The massive lineup at the check-in is terrible. I waited for over 1 hour at the check-in on my way for a connection in Mexico City.
21st December 2019,3,"""Seriously awful experience""",Not Verified |  Disgusted. Waited over an hour for my luggage to be unloaded from BA0085. Nobody was interested in my connecting flight which luckily was delayed. Security decided to take my duty free apart and test it even though I explained I was time limited to catch my flight. I was very calm and nice to security. Seriously awful experience.
15th December 2019,4,"""30 min at security""","✅ Trip Verified | Even with a Nexus card, wait more than 30 min at security. By then no food options, the lounge is closed. I planned to pass security early to eat something after but I end up starving."
10th December 2019,2,"""Confusing system""","Not Verified |  Confusing system, arrival security steps unnecessary and annoying. Multiple staff verbally calling out for connecting flights confirms its a flawed confusing system. Can't leave without ridiculous photo booth pictures. People are tired, dazed after a long flight, thrown into moronic maze of confusion, bad airport."
24th November 2019,4,"""Average airport at best""",✅ Trip Verified |  Average airport at best but televisions in waiting areas only showing news in French instead of English the worldwide accepted language. What shows they did in English were all female-based like The View. Airport personal in charge of setting stations should stick to an English all-news channel to be gender-neutral.
16th October 2019,3,"""helpfulness of staff was atrocious""","Not Verified |  Waiting times, helpfulness of staff was atrocious. No care, sense of urgency, or desire for people to make their flights. No care taken to ensure people waited in proper lines or helped when needed."
11th October 2019,3,"""disappointing us enormously""","Not Verified | We arrived after a 10-hour flight from Switzerland. All passengers stood and waited at the wrong baggage belt. Negative experiences continued when leaving two weeks later, disappointing us enormously. I personally will never willingly use Vancouver Airport again if I can possibly avoid it."
10th October 2019,1,"""no transportation help available""","✅ Trip Verified | If you have mobility issues avoid this airport. There was no transportation help available arriving from international and then connecting domestic. The staff directing people at customs barely spoke English (should be expected in Canada) and were no help. We had to take a bus to transfer terminals and then had to walk up 4 long, narrow and steep ramps - no option of elevator. I have not seen a worse North American airport for mobility challenged passengers. Mexico City was better! I’m giving them a 1 because it was very clean."
29th September 2019,1,"""the most disorganized airport""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the most disorganized airport - including customs. My inbound flight from Denver was delayed - the Air Canada agent told me to tell the person in customs that I was delayed and they would help. The woman in the customs area could not care one bit, she said just wait in line. Totally bad experience - maybe I should spend my vacation $$ in a country that values and understands customer service. Terrible first impression! "
17th September 2019,5,"""Not a good lasting impression of Canada""","Not Verified |  Calm airport but avoid Lift Bar and Grill. Waited around 10 minutes for the waitress to seat a family of six but failed to notice the couples that I just wanted a drink at the bar. Eventually sat down to be greeted by a staff member crashing, smashing and slamming around. He was aggressive and rude. Not a good lasting impression of Canada. If he was part of my staff he would be sacked immediately."
15th September 2019,1,"""severely inadequate seating""","Not Verified |  Transiting from Shanghai to Calgary back to Shanghai. The international departure terminal is complete chaos. Food court area has severely inadequate seating with people fighting tooth and nail for every available seat. Long lines to order a simple hamburger. Security is a nightmare with people everywhere. Place is severely understaffed and under equipped. Transmitting from international flight to domestic is a nightmare and do not even think about doing that (we learned our lesson the hard way). We missed our connecting flight due to poor signage, causing us to have to take our luggage out into the general area and walk 2 miles to check back in. What an absolute nightmare. We will never transit through this airport again when there are so many better options."
13th September 2019,6,"""the organisation is normally excellent""",Not Verified |  After a long 10 hour flight we were placed to do our ESTAS but we didn't know what was to happen next - a 3 hour wait - this was without food or seats. Once into the country we went to get our baggage to our surprise it was order alphabetically this was a long awaited great end to our experience. I've been to this airport many times before and what strikes me is the organisation it is normally excellent.
24th August 2019,4,"""most confusing airport""",Not Verified |  The most confusing airport we have ever visited. We thought Sharm el Sheikh was bad but this was worse. People shouting out instructions all over the place and contradicting each other. Avoid if possible.
15th August 2019,4,"""unfriendly, aggressive and demanding""","✅ Trip Verified | Staff: Air Canada at the check-in desk: blunt, unfriendly, aggressive. You feel uncomfortable asking them. Poor treatment toward non-English speakers especially. Very few spoke Mandarin to support large demographic. Security staff: unfriendly, aggressive and demanding. Needs to be way more staff for the volume of people going through. Few people working were so mean and frustrated. I was treated very well and spoke to kindly. Primarily Asians were yelled at, rude remarks were made too. The women was angry that they did not speak English. Security: huge line! There were only 2 security points out of 5 open at 8am with many flights. Line was 40 minutes for us, later I saw the line almost out the front door. Nexus line was closed till 10, as was Visa Infinite line. Food area in international is small, but has a general variety of food. It was fine. Recommendations: more staff with open security booths. More staff who speak Mandarin. Timer for how long security takes. More staff to take burden off the few who are there, they were way too stressed out. Signs for expectations at security multi-lingual"
12th August 2019,2,"""an absolute disgrace to Vancouver""","NotVerified |  Vancouver and it’s inhabitants were fabulous. Friendly, wonderfully helpful and it has been a great experience in our time there. However, not so Vancouver airport! The World Duty Free was the worst I have ever encountered. Nearly all the staff were on cell phones and simply could not be bothered helping. When I did manage to get someone it was as though you were a complete nusience in asking them to drag themselves away from their cell phones. Then when there was no one in attendance at one area would anyone help from another area? No way. If I was in charge of this store I would sort out the staff, their ""I don’t care about you"" attitude. It is an absolute disgrace to Vancouver and it’s fabulous city and people infact it’s an embarrassment. To encounter such dreadful attitudes as visitors leave your country needs to be addressed. I have rarely written a bad review however I feel very strongly about this. The ""Information centre"" staff can’t muster up a smile or a decent greeting. When I asked one staff member in the domestic area (although I was international) after I said 'Hi May I ask for a bit of help with storing luggage' if it was a bad day for her, as the greeting I got was 'almost, out of line' she replied 'I’m waiting for you to get on and tell me what you want!' No smile and an angry voice! Vancouver please do something about your staff attitude and manner because it’s unacceptable for such a wonderful country."
25th July 2019,1,"""completely disorganized and lacks appropriate signage""","Not Verified |  The parking is completely disorganized and lacks appropriate signage. You get a ""token"" when you enter the parking area. What do you do with the token? Well there's no signs to tell you. (If you aren't psychic its helpful to bring it with you because there are kiosks by the stairwell to pay). Part of the parkade was blocked off for construction and motorist were left to navigate their own detours, there was no personnel to assist with the chaos. Customs. Well, my experience echoes the rest, it's a disgrace and needs looking into. People with valid Visas wait hours and hours to enter the country they are pre-approved for. Perhaps CBSA could consider placing the visitors that haven't learned the official language, lack communication resources, and/or are ill-prepared/disorganized in a separate queue? The architecture is nice. There are lots of shopping and food options but the place is a zoo. Long customs delays caused us to miss our ferry reservation and continued through the last ferry, causing us to spend a needless night in Vancouver."
11th July 2019,2,"""YVR is expensive to purchase anything""","✅ Trip Verified | My ""home"" airport but I do a lot of international travel so can compare to others. Inbound: Entry can be a problem for visitors (I see the long lineups for Immigration/Customs (Canada does it in 1 step rather than the 2 of most countries which is one of the reasons for the many delays - overloading of manpower). Read other reviews I use the Nexus/Trusted traveler option so no delays here - about as quick as going through normal EU Immigration at LHR: which highlights the 'pain' that tourists feel at YVR. But, all that time saving at Immigration is for nothing since the baggage handling is so poor, and why it is not reported as such in other reviews. It is almost like the baggage handling is designed to make the Immigration department look good - ""my bag just gets to the carousel when I finally make it through Immigration"". Outbound, Pleasant surroundings but YVR is expensive to purchase anything (more so than LHR, FRA, AMS for example). For locals this is a real slap in the face since one of the specific promises made by the Government and the YVR Management Company to the citizens who (through the Crown) own the airport would be that they would have pricing comparable to downtown locations. Services provided are ok in extent, but too often the server cannot speak English, which is hard to swallow for a country with English as its official language and located in British columbia. I bet that European/African tourists shake their heads. On the positive side it would be possible for an Asian language tourist to find a server that speaks their language."
6th July 2019,1,"""not international friendly at all""","✅ Trip Verified | I will never travel to this airport again. I literally saw an old man almost have a heart attack his gate was so far away. I had to walk 20 min to get to my international gate. Customs line was 75 people with 1 guy at the desk taking connecting flights, had no help with customs kiosk tried 3,making me have to run. Every time I fly from USA to Canada I have to walk 20 min. What is wrong with you, not international friendly at all."
6th July 2019,1,"""Worst immigration process""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst immigration process I’ve ever been through! As a former flight attendant who traveled quite extensively internationally, I cannot believe how poorly the signage and lack of personnel direction was all the way through. There were many, many people complaining while we stood in our third long line of checking in. There was no sign stating to wait your turn so when the line started moving we walked forward. An immigration officer yelled at us because “we were supposed to wait our turn.” We didn’t realize we had crossed a line. Then he threatened to make us miss our flight when we simply stated there was no signage telling us to wait. My father is in a wheelchair and instead of assisting us, he called at least 15 pax from another line. He didn’t just hold us up but the flight crew in line behind us. Total jerk with a badge, shame on you, Canada Customs! What we did see was a lot of employees standing around, talking or doing absolutely nothing. I will never return to this airport, Seattle is not that far away."
8th June 2019,1,"""the worst immigration setup I have seen""","Not Verified |  I have travelled through many airports but YVR has to take the cake as the worst immigration setup I have seen. Dozens of kiosks empty of passengers and no staff to direct pax to them. When you get through this snake like maze there were only two (2) officers to process the pax. Literally hundreds of pax going nowhere after enduring flights of up to 15 hours. After enduring this disaster went outside to the taxi rank to more mayhem. Snake like queue again outdoors, lucky it was not raining or snowing, very slow processing. Never again would rather go to Seattle and transfer."
6th June 2019,1,"""Worst security experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Worst security experience. Be prepared for any and all necessary and unnecessary delays by incompetent workers, who sit around speaking to each other in their own mother-languages and don't stop their personal conversations to assist travelers.  Yesterday's flights were Seattle to YYC, connecting through YVR. We had to disembark, follow poor signage to pick up luggage, that I thought had been checked all the way through, but turns out was only ticketed all the way through. So, go to baggage claim, pick up luggage, go back to West Jet, check back in, wait for employees to stop chatting so they could override the kiosk check-in system, which would not accept my pre-ticketed suitcase. Check in suitcase, get new boarding passes, go through security. Security was an absolute nightmare.  Get shuffled into the new, and poorly designed, cattle type belt, with one person per one narrow space. As I pull my purse strap off my 25 yo diamond earring that my husband gave me for our wedding (and is the ONLY earring I have ever worn) goes flying off my right ear, and I'm being bumped from both left and right sides, and it literally becomes a brutal race by all security passengers to force their own plastic bin onto the belt first. But I suffered a TBI (traumatic brain injury) and don't have the balance and stability to keep bending down to retrieve a plastic bin and stand straight back up, without assistance. As I do this 4 times, to accommodate their separation rules, I notice my son accidentally left a pack of smoked salmon we purchased in Seattle, so I reach over to pick it up and lose my balance. He's 20 yo and has no excuse, accept to say that everyone is so harried, no one can peacefully load up their bins. Next I attempt to walk through the security scanner, and have to give that 3 tries: 1 to remove a bracelet,1 to remove a fabric belt with metal buckle, 1 to remove my runners. When I attempt to ask for assistance to locate my earring lost in the shuffle, I notice behind 2 security guards, that my entire suitcase is opened on a metal table in front of someone else! I darted over to that table to ask what was gong on? Only to be told I couldn't travel with that many cosmetics. What really embarrassed me was that the inept guard also removed a clearly marked bag of medications, for the entire line behind me now forming to see.There's absolutely no privacy and no respect for privacy. I am utterly embarrassed, with no shoes, no belt, no purse, I'm sorting through the mess this guard just made to cram my travel size toiletries into the prescribed plastic bag.  I was unnerved to say the least. I ask where the rest of my belongings are, and he says he doesn't know. I ask for a manager at this point, who takes several minutes to appear and am literally told to my face that this is how it's being done 'today.' The guard also broke the zipper on my Coach purse trying to zip it close."
25th May 2019,1,"""try to avoid this airport as much as I can""","Not Verified |  I was in transit to go to Tokyo from Portland, OR. Even in transit, they make us go through immigration and customs with hundreds of people. I ended out totally outside and then go through security to get to an airport lounge. The whole process took me 1 hour and 20 minutes. This must be a new system, which wasn’t working. There were lots of empty kiosks and several “foreign passport lines.” This system is stupid and I would try to avoid this airport as much as I can in the future!"
17th May 2019,9,"""staff interactions have been good""","Not Verified |  This Airport has a vibe of its own, its big, busy and lot of people can be seen around. Well connected by Sky Train as well. Have use this for international and domestic travel and the staff interactions have been good. Good connectivity to Asian destinations with lots of flights to China, Japan, Hong Kong."
7th May 2019,2,"""Worst airport anywhere""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport anywhere. No customer service. Waited 2 hrs for bags, nobody cared. The announcements in baggage claim are non stop and are deafening. Then after all that you emerge outside to a taxi line up a 100 people deep. Avoid this over-rated city and its terrible airport. This is my thirrd bad experience in a row at this trainwreck of an airport."
21st April 2019,2,"""an absolute disgrace""","✅ Trip Verified | 17 April 2019, we traveled from Adelaide, Australia, via Auckland, New Zealand, through YVR around 2pm to Calgary. We are almost 80 years old. We had been traveling 24 hours when we reached YVR. In all previous security checks on our journey we had been dealt with expeditiously with no problems. The service at security in Terminal C was an absolute disgrace. Firstly we were traveling Business Class but the first agent did not recognize Air New Zealand boarding passes and we were directed through the general lane. Secondly agent was exceptionally inefficient directing people to appropriate lines. He appeared completely disinterested and slowed down the whole process. Thirdly we were sent to line 7 for which the X ray scanner was taking about 3 minutes per item. Our time in processing was around 40 minutes. We were not the only people exceptionally frustrated. Others complained. Finally I asked who was the person in charge. He said his name but would not give his last name. He was with a group of agents who were just standing around talking and not making any efforts to speed the process. He should certainly not be running the operation if he cannot do things better. This experience at YVR was a disgrace to Canada. We have traveled extensively, including through LAX which is bad, but YVR should be avoided at all costs."
16th April 2019,1,"""Taxi line always long and slow""","Not Verified | Taxi line here is always long and slow. For some odd reason, taxis don’t wait at the taxi line. They wait a few minutes drive away and only come 5 at a time. This is by far the worst taxi lineup I have experienced at any airport anywhere. It’s ridiculous. As a result, passengers who know speed walk (and some literally run) off airplanes to get to the taxi line first."
19th March 2019,4,"""One hour and 25 minutes""",Not Verified |  One hour and 25 minutes from AF374 plane landing early afternoon Mar 17 2019 until final group of baggage arrived on the carousel. (They did announce an apology for baggage delay after 1 hour). Enough said.
20th February 2019,2,"""Poor customer service""","✅ Trip Verified |   Poor customer service for travellers with disabilities. YVR is a large airport, crutching along with a broken leg from international to domestic is no easy task. Not a single customer service employee came to my aid to offer assistance. Coming from Acapulco &; Mexico City there were customer service employees waiting for me pre and post flights with my name and a wheelchair ready to wheel me through security & to the next gate for flight. Customer Service in Mexico 10/10, Vancouver YVR 0/10."
16th February 2019,8,"""I was impressed""","✅ Trip Verified | Spacious and tidy airport with varied and extensive shopping and dining opportunities. Children's play areas, art works, big and clean signage - all abound. Free wi-fi, lots of seating, clean toilets. I arrived quite late at night - after midnight. Without checked luggage I was able to exit the airport without any delay. Cabs waited in line outside the terminal - they accept credit cards. On return, I arrived a bit early because of bad weather. Thus, I had time to walk around to explore the airport. I was impressed. Shops carried local Native Canadian art work and there were both fast food and more formal eateries. Like many other Canadian airports, Vancouver also provides pre-clearance immigration and customs entry into the U.S. However, for the flight I was taking, because it left after 10 pm, this service was not available. I was directed to another gate on the other side of the terminal. I ended up doing the immigration and customs at my destination in JFK - as with everyone else on my flight. Security check was similar to the US and was unhurried - at that time I was the only person undergoing a check! Once you are through the security area, you are greeted with numerous shops. A wonderful airport - large floor to ceiling glass panels offer beautiful views. I generated the boarding pass and the lounge pass from a vending machine. I used the Cathay Pacific lounge which is on one floor above. Again, great views. Lounge hours are limited to arrival and departure of the company's flights. Staff generally friendly and greet you in both English and French."
9th February 2019,1,"""Fix this broken system""",✅ Trip Verified | Worst passport control and transit experience in the world. Staff only confuse while moving people from line to line until you take that awful bus ride. Fix this broken system.
2nd February 2019,1,"""Truly awful experience""","Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. The customs questioned me for an hour and made me miss my flight! Now in midnight I am still waiting for transit flight. I was going to Chicago as a visitor, holding Canadian passport. The officers suggested that I wanted to emigrate to US, just because I don't currently have a job. Reactions are very rude! I told them I will be supported by my parents, they asked many personal and nonsense questions, including do I live with my girlfriend, and what's my parents' job, suspecting how much they earn. I just don't understand! Do parents need to be millionaires to support their own child's basic living expenses? Asking me for I-20 when I am no longer F1 student. Luckily I brought it with me. And later told me that I don't need to show it to them.  Maybe it's their job to ask questions, but they had no right to judge people. Especially when they knew that I had worked before, but because of my current status, I cannot work in US. Finally, they called me the last time and let me go, when it's five minutes after my departure time. No apology. My airplane was gone. Truly awful experience!"
1st February 2019,2,"""some of the worst I've ever experienced""","✅ Trip Verified | I arrived from San Francisco, USA. Not a busy day at the airport, arriving on a Dash 8 Q-400 (not a very large plane). Maybe 1 or two other airplanes unloading passengers and all that. I only had carry-on luggage and still it took ages to get through the security alone. Everyone was forced to be in a rather limited area of the arrivals ""kiosk security/whatever"" area. Standing in what more and more became a chaotic line as there were very poor instructions or any hints of where to go and what to do. Everyone waiting to find an empty kiosk where you had your photo taken and answered all sorts of questions regarding your stay. I was lucky since I was just travelling by myself, but others were families or single mothers with 3-4 children (trying to get a decent photo, and getting rudely told to get back to a kiosk by a staff if it wasn't up to some sort of weird standard). No signals or signs to see which kiosk was available or not, those further away were all empty since nobody saw them in the first place from where the line was entering that area. This was for all non-Canadians. After finishing that chaotic mess I was even confused and walking in circles for a bit to figure out where to head off next. Finally did and handed my passport and a receipt-like ticket with the photo and questions and answers I just did at those kiosks. Only to have the security person ask me MORE and even the same questions I already answered. To top things off, rather weird personal questions also (""why aren't you staying with your friend while visiting."" ""Who do you work for?"" ""why does your shirt have that tag on it?""). Aside from long distances to and from everywhere. Food was mediocre, wifi good. But the important travel-related stuff some of the worst I've ever experienced, even when arriving as an international in the USA. Admittedly rather lucky with my travels usually, but seeing the chaos and frustration in fellow arrivals. Some almost in tears from being returned to those damn kiosks a 3rd or 4th time, with their children crying and screaming) was very telling."
28th January 2019,6,"""Train, re-train personnel""
","✅ Trip Verified | On our connecting flight to Calgary, we knew we were going to go to another security check which is understandable and appreciated. Being on our last leg of our very long and tiring day, I was not as prompt anymore. I was asked for my boarding pass, which I handed over to this young man. And while I was putting back by passport in my bag since I wanted to get my stuff ready for inspection I heard him say, ""hello, hello"" while waving my boarding pass in front of my face. I said I was sorry that I didn't hear him because it has been a long day, but I don't know if he was having a bad day or what, but in his mind it was okay to sneer back and say, ""And I have been waiting for you the whole day to get your boarding pass back...duh."" I ignored him. I was truly not impressed. I understand that security needs to act with authority but I think they are mislead that authority equals rudeness and worse, acting like a uniformed bully. I have been in many flights, in many security checks, but this so far tops the rudeness chart. Train, re-train personnel."
12th January 2019,2,"""an airport to be avoided""","Not Verified | This airport can be summed up as “Rip Off City” with regard the food and refreshments on the departure side. On the arrivals side and for such a small airport the baggage reclaim is awful, wait wait and wait again. The airport has been designed to be asthetically pleasing, the services are apparently designed to be as frustrating as possible to the passenges, very long distances from security to gates, minimal facilities and marginal services. For a one of trip it might be acceptable but for the frequent traveller its an airport to be avoided."
5th January 2019,6,"""Baggage claim consistently slow""",Not Verified | Baggage claim consistently slow. I travel through here several times a year and it just keeps getting worse. Wait times exceed an hour and the last two times announcements have been made that there are “technical issues” but that we’ll get our bags “today”. This is one of the few airports where baggage claim takes longer than the flight.
31st December 2018,9,"""fastest departure experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified | The fastest departure experience ever. I'm sure it took me from dropping my bags at the Air Canada counter to be at the airplane gate within 20 minutes. Arrival experience can often lead to queues in immigration which are not too bad. The only place this airport lacks in is the food and shopping options especially during nighttime when most international flights leave. However, this is the best airport experience I have had in North America."
21st November 2018,7,"""at least keep our stuff safe!""","Not Verified |  Typically a good airport, reasonable assortment of restaurants and shops, I'm urked they had an x-ray tech take away my solid shaving soap. She thought it could be spreadable (even though I rapped it with my finger to show it was a solid), and they took it away because there wasn't an ml written on it. Of course there wasn't - you don't measure solids in ml. The security area was slow - but x-ray totally backed up, the supervisor seemed apologetic as she also saw it was just a solid soap - but she said the final decision was the x-ray techs. Another plane saved from the evils of a crumbly piece of soap in a plastic container! This airport is good for general travel, I just want to rant because everyone got held up over a 3$ solid soap that I hated because it was a pain to have to lather while shaving - but brought only because I figured it was OK not being a liquid - and apparently it's not. Why even try? I take off my shoes and even my wallet so there's nothing in my pockets - last time they asked me to go for a random screening - OK, fine - but when I came back, I caught a random passenger going through my jacket - where my wallet was. I loudly said as I approached ""Why is someone going through my stuff?"" and he took off - but come on - if we have to take all our things off and walk away - at least keep our stuff safe! No harm done, in fact I think it was a senile old guy going through my stuff - so he probably didn't know what he was doing, just felt a bit violated."
18th November 2018,2,"""waste of taxpayers money""",Not Verified | The most terrible airport we experienced in a very long time. This airport has been designed by a marathon runner and is totally wrongly designed with customers lugging connecting luggage through the whole airport even if luggage has been tagged through the final destination. This airport should have invested money in a proper flow chart of Pax not waste money on waterfalls and Haida sculptures. Security is done again on connecting flights even you have been cleared by security on the previous flight. Security cannot cope with PAX since connecting pax are screen twice. This airport should be totally leveled and completely properly rebuilt by somebody who knows passenger flows etc. What a waste of taxpayers money.
2nd November 2018,1,"""minimal facilities for travellers""","Not Verified |  Bright and shiny with minimal facilities for travellers, food stands area a total rip off. The main resturant is a pretentious dump and everything costs twice as much as outside as soon as you pass security."
24th September 2018,4,"""restaurants are truly horrid""","✅ Trip Verified | Ok, so I’ve flown out of this airport to North American destinations and the departures lounge, the restaurants, seating everything really are of top class. Not crappy takeaway booths. However today I used the international, boy the poor suckers who have to use this are left with a final remainder of Canada that is truly dross. The duty free stocks nothing but Canadian stuff, “World duty free” as long as it’s Canadian. The restaurants are truly horrid. If you can even call them that. The only good testimony I can leave this place is Canadas amazing acceptance for immigration and integration but then again when you need help or direction and the staff have bare minimal English/French skills and my Mandarin sucks things become stalemate fast."
15th September 2018,3,"""staff were unhelpful and signage was poor""","Not Verified |  I travelled from Manchester to Vancouver, which was a very good flight. The arrival process however took over 1 and a half hours from landing to getting through security. This time was spent queuing in queue after queue. There was little communication from staff about the reasons for the delay. Staff appeared at best disinterested and had low customer service skills. This meant people waiting had a most unpleasant experience. Immigration was very slow and again staff were unhelpful and signage was poor. It was the worst experience I have ever had arriving at an airport and the process fell well below the standards that were expected. A poor welcome to Vancouver."
14th September 2018,1,"""Worst airport for international transit""","Not Verified |  Worst airport for international transit. Understaffed, slow at customs and securities. A lot of difficult procedures. Someone took our baggage out and airport is almost of no help to coordinate or provide a solution."
7th September 2018,7,"""Difficult to find where to check in""","✅ Trip Verified | Difficult to find where to check in unless you are flying within Canada or to the US. Needs labelled zones and active screens as at most major airports. Going through US immigration at the airport is a great boon. Quick and uncongested when I did it. Strange thing was, though, that you had your photo and fingerprints taken at an automatic gate and then had to go to a uniformed US immigration officer to have the same process repeated."
4th September 2018,1,"""Wait, wait, wait for everything""","Not Verified |  The staff at every outlet and service are inept and extremely slow. Wait, wait, wait for everything. Starbucks being the worst and out of basic ingredients when you finally get to order. How does a mega chain with minimal items run out of menu items. Despicable, deplorable, painful airport."
20th July 2018,1,"""very poor signage""","✅ Trip Verified | Parking at this airport is a nightmare. Construction everywhere and very poor signage. It has always been the case with the poor signage but now with the construction it is worse. Parking attendants told me this week that they get constant complaints from people about the poor signage and as a result of confusion and the stress of missing flight check in times people are often end up in the highest priced daily parking area. I did speak to three different people about this and here is the response I received: ""I spoke with my Manager and she advised there is plenty of additional signage in advance of the airport, prior to the construction areas, which directs people to the VLT (Value Long Term), as well as the jetSet lot, as well as signage directing people to turn for additional parking options."" Shamefully poor response. The rest of the services are good but parking and signage, and management response was horrible ."
13th July 2018,7,"""an attractive airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Twice transited with Air Canada which has its own terminal. Being Australian my baggage was checked through to my final Canadian destination. No immigration/customs forms were given on the plane. No need. There was quite a lot of walking involved to get to immigration, on the way I met a green coated volunteer who kindly told me what to do and the gate of my next flight at 10am (landed 7am). At immigration there are a series of machines where you scan your passport and answer questions. At the end a piece of paper with my picture came out. I showed the lady at the immigration desk area who directed me to the right. Just one person before me, a few questions asked and then I was in, There is a lift to the left that goes up to domestic. There the security people were very impatient that visitors didn’t know their ways (ie you put even your carry on in a bin). After that experience I found the unremarkable lounge (worst ever experienced) being crowded, dirty toilets and little to offer. Returning was odd, arrived on the same plane that would take us to Sydney however we had to walk down a long passage to come all the way back to the same gate. Odd. All in all an attractive airport that seems to prioritise it’s attractive displays over functionality,"
4th July 2018,10,"""red cap was outstanding""","Not Verified | My wife and I are senior citizens and had some heavy luggage, and decided to use a Red Cap for $10.00. Our red cap  was outstanding. Our bags were overweight and we would have to pay $100, but helped us repack our luggage and saved us the penalty. It was well worth the $10.00, and unfortunately I only had $2.00 cash for an extra tip."
24th June 2018,1,"""friendly, but inefficient""","Not Verified | My family has US Global Entry, but both machines were out of service. Luckily, there was no line. However, once we got into US customs, we had to wait for our bags to be scanned. Although, there were only a couple dozen people waiting, that queue quickly grew to around 200 people. My wife's bag didn't clear until 100 minutes later and we missed our flight. Mind you, we'd just spent 10+ hours on a flight back from China. Now, we won't get back home until tomorrow morning and have to add another segment. The entire time, the agents said they couldn't do anything and tried to blame Air Canada. The airline blamed customs new scanning system and mentioned there have been problems for the past few days. We then waited for over an hour to inquire about rebooking our flight. There were only 2 people ahead of us. I don't know what to believe, but know this. We will avoid flights through Canada in the future and will avoid using Air Canada again. They are friendly, but inefficient. Hopefully, they can get their act together and not ruin anyone else's vacation."
21st June 2018,3,"""the worst I have ever been through""","Not Verified |  I can say that by far the security at the airport is the worst I have ever been through. My flight coming in from Europe was delayed so I was already running late for my flight and waiting for 45 minutes in a security line where there is about 100 people and only one security lane open is ridiculous. Some of the staff were nice but others were not considerate of time and told me “oh well.” Perhaps this was just a one time mistake but in all my experience was not ideal, at all."
24th May 2018,8,"""security on gate C is a nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified | I love Vancouver airport. Also, It’s my home base. However, security on gate C is a nightmare pretty much all the time. There are only one or two lines open, while people in line waiting outside of the security room. Then, the staff takes pretty much anything that can they are not familiar with. Last time they took my screwdriver expended (length of the credit card), today they took my network cable crimping tool (couldn’t explain why). When I asked, they said I can go back and recheck. “Sir, you have two options: leave it here or recheck”. Mind you, I’ve been traveling with the tools all over Canada for many years and passed the security numerous times even thru the same airport. I would go and recheck my tools if I didn’t have to stay in the long line again. Quite upsetting to be honest with you."
19th May 2018,1,"""there no assistance""
","✅ Trip Verified | This was the return from hell. I had requested wheelchair assistance, which I really needed. Dragging luggage around the airport was no help. Not only was there no assistance, no one knew anything, not the Royal Mounted Canadian Police nor any of the personnel assigned to help travelers. Boarding passes were never emailed to my phone because I had asked for assistance. My husband and I traipsed from one end of the huge building to the other and back again. I put our information into one of the kiosks and got luggage tags for the bags. However, we were on the wrong line to drop the luggage because we were following instructions that a clueless airline representative had given us. We went to the other end of the building once more and met with the Cathay Pacific representative. She refused to take the bags until 8pm. It was noon. I needed to charge my phone. There are stands—literally—with no seats and plugs on the floor, only one of which work, so I was bent in half trying to get the charger into the 110 volt receptacle. I wanted to tell my husband where I was and asked the first misinformation woman to keep an eye on the phone for a couple of minutes since he was sitting in the food court with the baggage. She refused and told me that people come to the airport to steal phones and chargers, so I was stuck guarding it for more than an hour. When we finally dropped off our bags, we needed to go through security with very aggressive officers who made us take off our shoes despite the fact that we are in our 70s, scanned and wiped down our canes, poked me in the front and back of the knee that had a replacement when I explained it would set off the sensor, and went through all our jewelry in the carry-on luggage. To add insult to injury, we denied a ride on several empty golf carts to our gate. Access to the toilets was closed off at the gate necessitating a walk of 1/4 mile to another rest room. No consideration was extended for us as elderly and disabled passengers."
27th April 2018,2,"""terrible service""",❎ Not Verified | Inefficient customs process. Only 5 officers for Canadian residents with 100's of people in the queue. 1hr+ then get out and wait for baggage for another hour. Carousel keeps stopping because it's full because everyone is delayed in customs! Air Canada baggage guy was not helpful. They need to have people removing bags so it will keep running. I have been to much larger airports (ie: Shanghai) who handle much more volume but are way faster thru customs/baggage. Get it together YVR and Air Canada - terrible service.
17th April 2018,5,"""There were endless queues""",✅ Trip Verified |  My first time leaving Canada for the US and it has put me off ever flying through Canada to the US ever again. My experience here left me feeling like I was in the third world. There were endless queues that only ended in more queues. It took me just shy of two hours to get through security and customs. This airport needs to rethink their systems and procedures as they are a joke.
26th February 2018,3,"""has lost site of two critical aspects""","❎ Not Verified |  This review is not specific to any one trip, it is an overall review on arrivals and bag claim. YVR for all it's impressive space and art has lost site of two critical aspects that no other airport in the world seems to have lost site of: 1). When you are asking people to walk incredible distances from gate arrivals to customs. 2). Often a 45 minute plus wait for baggage to arrive at baggage carousels is simply inexplicable. By the time you've cleared customs (30 min/ walk to custom, then clearance) you now have to stand around and wait ridiculous lengths of times. This doesn't happen in the busiest hubs in the World. Get rid of the art and décor - get practical, get people on with their final destination. Painful."
26th December 2017,1,"""very long line not moving at all""","❎ Not Verified |  Air Canada flight 1831 on Dec 6, 2017. After checking our bags, we arrived at the security screening room where there was 1 screening lane open. The only travelers getting through were Nexus card holders. Waited over an hour with the very long line not moving at all. Attempted to call over the Manager that was standing at the back of the room but he wouldn't come and discuss the situation. The young man at the head of our line controlling the flow of Nexus passengers was downright rude. Blamed budget cuts on the delay. After several passengers started yelling out, they finally opened a second screening lane. Rude, inefficient and arrogant. Worst treatment of any airport anywhere."
26th December 2017,1,"""Completely out of control""","❎ Not Verified |  Air Canada flight 1830, Dec 20. Arrived at Customs which was crowded and getting filled quickly. Staff had failed to set up pathways properly - dead ends, shortcuts, lineups through the automated check out kiosks, so some passengers were shortcutting. Completely out of control. It was like they had never done this before. Thought this was a world class airport, but not the last 2 times I came through here."
24th December 2017,9,"""a great airport to travel through""","❎ Not Verified |  YVR is a great airport to travel through when departing and arriving. Lineups are short, staff are helpful and the airport features modern architecture with lots of art designed by local artists. The wifi at this airport is both fast and easy to connect to and terminal directions are simple and logical. The many services at this airport along with the incredible airport atmosphere makes this airport easy to recommend."
10th December 2017,2,"""Come on get the process figured out""","✅ Trip Verified | I arrived on AC34 from Sydney Australia, 7.20am, Nov 30th. Then walked the up/down route to get to the Immigration/Customs clearance. I would think that someone could have designed this airport better, having to go Up/Down stairs (they have escalator too) instead of on one level! But this isn't the worst part. Immigration/Customs clearance with the new computer terminals, where they scan your passport then you need to line your face in a narrow scan on the screen but the camera is up higher than where you are looking, so fail! After that you spend at least 1 to 2 hrs snaking back and forth to see an agent, whoever looks after this process needs to visit Australia. Sydney Airport where they put through a higher numbers of passengers. It took me 3 mins in Sydney once I arrived at the Immigration/Customs clearance area. Come on get the process figured out."
6th December 2017,4,"""lots of seating and nice washroom facilities""","✅ Trip Verified | I was flying out of Vancouver airport to Brisbane. My flight was scheduled to depart at 12.30am from gate D50. Unfortunately where gate D50 seemed to be located was in a far corner of the internationals terminal (You turned left immediately after the main security line). The only flights that were boarding in this area of the departures was the 2 Air Canada flights to Australia that night. There were no restaurants or bars nearby and the only shop that was open was a newsagent that also had a small 9 table area where a lady was serving either 'Red or White'. I did go for a glass of the red, as that was the only thing that was around. However, we did take a quick walk towards the main part of the international terminal once we got through security, which looked like there were a few more options that were still open at that time of night. It was about a 10 minute walk back to our gate so we didn't want to go too far. The terminal did have lots of seating and nice washroom facilities. I just wish we had a better gate number that was more central in the international terminal. If you do plan to enjoy yourself at this airport just give yourself lots of time in the case that you get assigned gate D50 for departure."
12th September 2017,4,"""45 minutes for airport staff to locate my wife""","❎ Unverified |  LHR TO YYV via YVR. Had requested assistance due to age and infirmity. Self 85, wife 72. Usually assistance is provided and works like a charm with both my wife and I being transported through the airport together. Not in Vancouver! Very slick (important) male said my wife must find her own way to departure counters. It took 45 minutes for airport staff to locate my wife and bring her to the gate where I was waiting. On our return flights things were as they should have been on the first flights. Just shows how one overzealous person can get an airport a bad reputation."
2nd September 2017,1,"""extreme long waiting times""","✅ Verified Review |  The worst ever experience on any western continent Airport! Flying in from Salt Lake City on September 1 and flying out the same day to Amsterdam. Thousands of passengers did experience the same as we did. It was horrible, hot, no fresh air, unorganized, and extreme long waiting times. We needed to go through customs for no reason at all when you are in transit. We needed also an ESTA form and pay for it. The baggage was not forwarded. The check in procedure was exhausting. We were treated as animals and separated from Canadians and Americans. Never again via Vancouver!"
28th August 2017,2,"""2 hours to get through""","✅ Verified Review |  Worst inbound customs and immigration lines, and the worst experience I've ever had in an airport. Yes, worse than Bangkok without fast track, worse than Moscow. Budget for at least 2 hours to get through."
15th August 2017,2,"""disappointing and disheartening""","❎ Unverified | Departing from Vancouver - departure area disgusting. Food everywhere, spills on seats, armrests and the flooring, can't understand why the upkeep of this place can't be held up to the standard of the international part of the airport. Very disappointing and disheartening."
9th July 2017,1,"""Very un-productive""",✅ Verified Review |  Long lines to security upon departure and long lines to custom upon arrival. There are ways to address it but nothing done! Very un-productive. Very frustrating! Unhelpful employees. What else can you say? Process should be revisited by their management!
26th June 2017,4,"""certainly not user friendly""","✅ Verified Review |  Looked beautiful but certainly not user friendly for those requiring assistance. We arrived with plenty of time for our flight, using a lounge prepared for post-cruise use at the Fairmont. Moving from the hotel to Delta's ticket area was easy as was check in. I was surprised that the passenger was required to move their luggage to the screening area - and then load it as the gentleman watching the operation refused to assist. We were able to obtain a pusher for my wife's wheelchair easily. She was friendly for the more than 40 minute wait to go through security. Seems Canadian security decided that only one screening position was required for strollers and wheelchairs. The entire process was glacial, maybe even slower as there were maybe thirty people in line. Each wheelchair, ours provided by the airport, was inspected as if it was an annual maintenance check. The area immediately after passing through the passenger screening check point looked like a demolition derby of strollers and wheelchairs with screeners doing more thorough inspections and passengers trying to collect their bags, belts and shoes from the mass of items packed into a mess. Finally clearing dis-functional junction, we broke into the clear for a smooth transit through US immigration and customs before transiting the usually duty free goods tunnel of shopping bliss, then a several hundred yard walk to Gate 90. The gate area reminded me of the Delta small plane area at JFK - crowded, uncomfortable, and seemingly more temporary than permanent in nature. The lady who spent the better part of an hour assisting my wife was pleasant and most helpful as was the Delta gate agent. Having to move and load your bags after checking in with your airline then waiting for security screening solely because you require assistance made for a rather poor impression."
13th June 2017,1,"""airport doesn't have the capacity""",✅ Verified Review | Vancouver airport is a failure! The staff have no clue how to handle the crowds. Lines are very long and the airport doesn't have the capacity to service this number of flights. It seems for the managers increasing the number of flights is more important than the quality of the service. The picture is the passport check at the arrivals.
11th June 2017,1,"""utter chaos inside""","✅ Verified Review | Arrived at Vancouver after a good flight from UK to be informed that all transit passengers would have to collect thier own luggage and check in again for their onward journey. I had 2 hours and 35 minutes before my next flight to Calgary, plenty of time, I thought. After disemabarking from my flight we were faced with total and utter chaos inside the airport, in fact it was more akin to a cattle market. In my 40 years of world travel and visiting both large and small airports, this was my worst experience at any time, anywhere. All the ""assistants"" were young girls who were far to busy on their intercom phones to talk with anyone, they just pointed where we all had to go. It was some 1 hour and 45 minutes later that I managed to get into the main hall (downstairs) to retrieve my luggage. I was then informed that I had to go through security before I could check in for my onward journey to Calgary. This I have never ever known before and there was now only 50 minutes before my next flight. Of course there was yet another long queue for the security. Many travellers (some quite older people) were trying to ask the young staff if they would miss there onward flight, their reply was always the same ""there is nothing we can do, just keep in the queue"". There was nowhere for these older people to sit and rest and most were just being pushed along, this was not a nice thing to see. Eventually, near the end of the queue I could see that the Immigration officers were sitting and there was not a single person in the queue? I just could not see why we were queuing at all until, I saw some machines. These machines were now quiet obviously the issue that was causing all the chaos. Thousands of people and only a few machines to service all passengers, and of course it was very plain to see that most passengers were having issues in working these machines and there was not one member of airport staff to assist anywhere to be seen. I finally reached the machines, in fact they are now the declaration machines. I am very competent with computers and I could see why people were now having issues. There was one question at a time on the screen and right at the very bottom it says continue, most did not see this were just looking around the screen and looking for some help. Alas, there was no forthcoming save from the odd passenger, myself included who showed them how these machines operated. There were no clear instructions anywhere. Disguting design in my opinion. Eventully I filled in the declaration and form the machine I recieved a ticket. I then rushed to the nearest Immigration officer as I had 10 minutes left to check in and get to the boarding gate. The officer just looked at my passport and said have a good holiday and let me through very quickly. I then look at three different boards for my Flight number and boarding gate. It is only now that I am beggining to feel totally frustrated at the lack of staff around to assist. I went from one end of the check in right down to the other end and there was no check in for Air Transat to be found. Now with only 5 minutes left before my flight it was due to another passenger who waved at me and showed me where the check in was. It was tucked away right at the very end hidden around a corner. I just made my flight, others unfortunately did not. I shall never fly to this airport again.The whole experience and the way passengers were treated was utterly disguting."
18th May 2017,1,"""an unfriendly service""","✅ Verified Review | I got to the security lines at Vancouver Airport around 8:15AM, while my boarding was scheduled for 8:20 AM. The screens were showing the estimated waiting time of 5-10 Minutes, so I was calm, 15 minutes the line kept proceeding very slowly, so I got nervous and went to the security staff and politely asked them if they could fast track me, since my boarding has already started. The response was:""Sir, I can't do that!"" So here I am standing additional 10 minutes in the line and running like crazy till my gate as the last passenger! Staff of this airport is so unfriendly and unhelpful! It's such a shame! Please investigate. I have never experienced such an unfriendly service."
3rd May 2017,10,"""no lines at check-in nor at security""","✅ Verified Review |  I am not surprised at all that Vancouver airport has gotten awards for being the best airport in North America several times already. I had the pleasure to arrive, depart and transit through YVR while being on an almost around-the-world-trip. On the day I departed the airport was very quiet and there were no lines at check-in nor at security. I was especially impressed by the decoration in the departure lounge which resembles a nature park. By mistake I left my wallet on a waiting bench and forgot about it. When I was about to reach the Cathay lounge, I heard my name on the intercom and suddendly realized that my wallet was missing. As told I rushed to the nearest information desk but there was nobody on duty. So I went to the supervisor of security and explained him my situation. After a couple of phone call by his assistant and a short waiting-time of five minutes a smartly dressed concierge appeared with my wallet in his hands. I thanked him and told him that I am surprised that the wallet was not stolen. He simply replied that I should not worry here in Vancouver: ""We are honest people."" I assure you that I will be back again."
15th April 2017,10,"""this is an excellent airport""","✅ Verified Review |  This is an excellent airport, from the quality of the people who work there, to the ease of movement about the place. We had no problems checking in for our flight to Florence. We had no problems on our return three weeks later from Zurich. Passport control and customs are well organized and we experienced no significant delays. Where possible, things like passport checks are done electronically, speeding things up. It is one of the best airports I have experienced. People are kind and knowledgeable. There is also a great deal of Northwest art in the airport, adding to the experience."
3rd April 2017,6,"""they could do much better""","✅ Verified Review |  Vancouver airport is clean, beautiful, great seating, food, and has very friendly staff wandering about to help out. My one concern is the international and domestic security. I travel, worldwide, often. And, I come through YVR often. Almost every time, the security personnel are discourteous and unorganized. Today, the person directing us towards numbered lines was rude and her instructions were very unclear and scattered. There were many non English speaking people in line which were barked at by her and several others. Speaking loudly and rudely does not magically make things clear. It makes people uneasy and confused. English is my first language and I wasn't even sure what she, and others wanted, or why we were being spoken to that way. There was obvious animosity between 2 staff which caused a back up as one refused to step up to help us move along, SO unprofessional. I understand that security personnal have an important job to do, and they're not there to be best friends with us, but they could do much better. They can be organized, kind, friendly, firm, and clear all at the same time. Security, in many other airports manages to do it quite well. The security at YVR is consistently unprofessional. This does not put our minds at ease."
18th March 2017,4,"""arrival logistics is atrocious""","✅ Verified Review | Vancouver Airport arrival logistics past the customs clearance is atrocious. You have to navigate through the greeting area which is often a bottleneck of passengers with their luggage and greeters. Terrible planning for this area. Then if you are taking a shuttle to a hotel or parking after planeloads of arriving passengers, you are faced with masses of people crowding on a narrow sidewalk and the shuttle buses pulling up haphazardly beside the sidewalk. So there you are with your luggage, fighting your way through the crowd, and trying to find out when and where your shuttle is arriving. This trip my wife and I took to the pavement to find a place on the sidewalk to stand while we tried to watch for our bus. Terrible planning again. This is my home airport and find it stupid to spend so much money on artwork and not enough on the actual functioning of the airport for the passengers, particularly the arrival areas."
14th February 2017,1,"""Terrible food selection with very little choice""","At the American departures area. Terrible food selection with very little choice. Tried to get a meal such as take away sushi and was not available. Then tried to get a drink at the terrible Vancouver Canuck lounge and told it was a 20 min wait when at least 20 tables were visibly empty. Not given a choice to sit at the bar, just shuffled on. Not impressed. One of worst set of choices in a international departure area."
24th January 2017,6,"""serious lack of vegan food""",✅ Verified Review |  Serious lack of vegan food! I like to take food on the plane because the airlines are forever mixing up the specialty meals and I find at least 50% of flights are unable to provide vegan food no matter how many times you confirm it. Considering the great food and plentiful options I've found around Vancouver and Whistler I was really shocked to discover that the only vegan options at the airport was hot chips or subway.
15th January 2017,3,"""1.5 hours for luggage to arrive""",1.5 hours for luggage to arrive after 13 hour flight into Vancouver Airport. This was midday on Saturday. No plane problems apparently. Just not enough staff. This is really poor and annoyed us as we missed out on seeing something we really wanted to see. Departing domestic at quiet time the next day. Queues again. Put more staff on.
19th November 2016,3,"""not what I expect from this facility""",Poor service! I had to wait 20 min in the plane for ground staff to arrive and then more than 30 min for the luggage. All of this at midnight with a 1 year old. I wonder if we can ask for our airport tax back? Certainly not what I expect from this facility.
15th November 2016,6,"""35 minutes before the first bags are dispensed""","✅ Verified Review |  Arriving on a domestic flight from Calgary. Once again, pleasant experience on arrival as YVR is generally very easy to navigate. The reason I scored this experience a 6/10 is because the trauma baggage claim at YVR has caused me. No matter where I arrive from, with Priority Baggage Handling or not, I always find myself waiting for at least 35 minutes before the first bags are dispensed. I try not to check bags if I have to fly into/via YVR but for a lot of my trips, I can't really avoid it. Airport was really peaceful upon arrival, with a number of restaurants to choose from on the departures level. As a whole, baggage claim was the complete bummer, but everything else is expected and good as per usual."
14th November 2016,7,"""hour to get through immigration""","✅ Verified Review | Arriving into Vancouver Airport on Cathay Pacific CX838 from Hong Kong on Labour Day. As midday hours are one of the busiest times at YVR, I was expecting a line-up at Immigration and baggage claim. However, it was worse. An overflow area of foreign citizens had to be set up to accommodate the number of travellers that day. It took me an hour just to get through immigration and then there comes baggage claim. Even with my frequent status with the airline and my luggage being considered as ""Priority"", my bags weren't dispensed by the time I got through immigration. Not the first time this has happened, it's every single time I fly inbound internationally. YVR definitely needs to work on that. Other than that, easy navigation, great wifi accessibility, and great airport staff to navigate arriving passengers."
13th November 2016,9,"""very well designed airport""","✅ Verified Review | This was my very first domestic travels from Vancouver International and I'm not disappointed. Contrary to my experiences when travelling internationally, security officers were really helpful and greeted all passengers in both English and French. Security lines are definitely shorter and the walk from security to the gate was very short. In addition, there was a wide range of restaurants and souvenir shops to choose from, which is good since I forgot my umbrella and desperately needed one. However, more gate seating would be nice. The good thing about YVR is that there's wifi everywhere, along with the great selection of shops/restaurants, makes long waits bearable. Overall, very well designed airport, easy to navigate, clean, all sorts of accessibilities. If only the international portion of the airport would improve, it would make the most ideal airport ever."
1st September 2016,4,"""waited for 10 minutes and none arrived""","My wife and I recently arrived from Mexico. We are both handicapped with mobility issues needing wheelchair assistance for longer walks. Since we were walking with the aid of a luggage cart we were told not to go to the wheelchair entrance but the regular line having to stand with difficulty for about 20-25 minutes to get through customs. Once we were through customs were were transported to the waiting area before boarding our plane. In Cancun we had 2 wheelchairs waiting for us at the airplane door. Two attendants transported us on our wheelchairs through customs, they picked up our luggage and dropped us off at our bus. When leaving Cancun we were met at the bus by two attendants with wheelchairs. Again they took our luggage. Took us through customs and were wheeled to the loading area at our gate. When it was time to load the plane they wheeled us to the entrance of the plane. Arriving back in Vancouver we had one wheelchair waiting and the called for another. We we transported by golf cart from the exit ramp of the plane to our luggage pickup and told that was a far as he goes. The driver said he would call for 2 wheelchairs. We waited for 10 minutes and none arrived. Found an attendant and we were told we have to go to our airline desk which was closed to get chairs. Found two wheelchairs in the area but they were locked up. We made our way to the bus pickup. I suggest that the personnel at the airport take a lesson from the Mexicans on how to treat and serve people."
31st August 2016,4,"""not a good start to our long journey""","Skipped breakfast to arrive with plenty of time for lunch before our 11hr flight from Vancouver to London Gatwick. There were no restaurant or bar facilities in D Gate, so our meal options consisted of Burgers, Subway, Hanami or Pizza Slices, not really substantial enough for a long haul flight. This was due to refurbishment of all the bar and restaurants. Ridiculous for an International airport. I noted that all these facilities where available across a walkway to E Gate (USA Flights), but we were prohibited from crossing just to eat. Not good enough. Why refurbish them all at once? Not a good start to our long journey home."
31st July 2016,10,"""process was quick and easy""","Excellent transit as usual at Vancouver airport. I had separate airline bookings so I had to exit the secure area and check in again, and the process was quick and easy. The food is great, but as of June 2016 the international departures section was getting work done on its restaurants, so the selection was below what it usually is."
29th July 2016,4,"""alternative arrangements could be made""","✅ Verified Review |  Flying back to UK had a flight delay of 3 and a half hours, there was nowhere to get a beer or glass of wine. The bar was closed for refurbishment. A big international airport in a big city like Vancouver with one bar beggars belief. Surely if a facility is going to be closed for some time alternative arrangements could be made."
13th July 2016,4,"""it is dysfunctional""","Vancouver may be shiny and clean, but it is dysfunctional, and filled with workers who are unsure of what to do. The security lines are long and slow. We were in transit for more than 2 hours, and still almost missed our connecting flight. As one of the flagship airports in Canada, YVR, you need to pull your socks up."
23rd June 2016,1,"""top 5 worst airport experiences""","Vancouver is in the top 5 worst airport experiences. Began with the arrival at the international terminal. The traffic router at the curb wanted to deny the bus unloading access. After suitable remonstration the driver prevailed. In the airport we moved our luggage to an American Airlines kiosk for check-in. A helpful agent assisted in tagging the bags and securing the boarding passes. That's when the fun started. She directed us to the baggage check-in counter. To our total amazement, the clerks there were simply weighing the baggage and ensuring the tags were properly affixed and matched the boarding pass. Then they simply directed us to get in the line behind the counter and haul our own bags somewhere further on. They did not accept the bags and load them onto a belt to a baggage handling area. We have never encountered such a system. So we got into a serpentine line that through a series of temporary barriers had a few hundred fellow travelers. Apparently 3 out of 4 baggage belts were not operating and we had to take them to the one that was operating. Security took a while once we had finally surrendered our bags to the conveyor (and they did arrive with us at our final destination). Then we had the US Customs and Border Patrol process with all of its redundancy, but that's not Vancouver Airport's problem. Finally we were enroute to the gate. The terminal has some odd numbering schemes for gates that require rapt attention to ensure, despite being on a relatively linear setup, that you are proceeding to the correct one. A very long walk with only a couple of short mobile walkways. They do have plugins for charging devices, some food vendors and the typical airport shops. Still, an unusual layout not particularly helpful for first time visitors. If I can avoid it, I'll never go through Vancouver airport again."
29th May 2016,8,"""a smooth departure""",Vancouver Airport is busy but check-in and security lines are smooth. Airport has large shopping facilities to cater for a large contingency of Chinese shoppers. Resting space is adequate and I used the Plaza Premium lounge. Easy transportation to airport via the train from downtown. It was a smooth departure.
11th May 2016,10,"""signage is perfect""","This airport is clean, bright and very welcoming with the traditional first nations art installed everywhere through the arrival and departure terminals. You feel like taking pictures everywhere to save these wonderful sculptures and artworks as souvenirs of your travels. The signage is perfect, and I had no queue at all getting to the immigration."
28th April 2016,9,"""clean and easy airport""","Clean and easy airport, with some traditional sculptures to welcome you to this part of the world. Strong and efficient Wi-Fi, and many shops, cafés and bars to spend extra time in if you have some. The observation area is a good place to watch the planes or wait for friend/family members flight to take off or land. Once you are in the security zone, you will find many comfortable benches and some power outlets to charge your electronic device."
18th April 2016,2,"""took over an hour""",It took over an hour to drive through just to pay and exit parking lot. This is the worst parking lot experience I have encountered. One attendent on for 40-50 cars in a line - get an automated system. The airports charge an arm and a leg to use this airport.
15th January 2022,1,"""the airport is grossly mismanaged""","✅ Trip Verified | YUL might just take the cake of the worst airport experience I’ve ever had.  Its quite clean, and has moderate facilities. You will be able to find empty chairs and charging ports. There is a Tim Hortons here, though typically of Canadian airports, not much else that will give a decent bang for your buck. The bathrooms are not abundant and not super clean but they suffice. Very few of the staff have ever shown me even basic standards of politeness and service. Customers pick up their luggage for a connecting flight and recheck it in even though they don’t intend to leave the airport. When you exit an airport, should you not have the option to stay in the international terminal? Why should I be forced to exit the terminal? If I have to pick up my bags, which is already ridiculous, why cant they be on the conveyer belt instead of thrown to the sides randomly alongside hundreds of others of bags. If you are forcing customers to pick up their luggage, why don’t you have more than one staff member who is helping them check it in for their next flight? The line dedicated to checking in without a connecting flight was much faster than the fast lane for customers who were already forced to pick up their baggage unnecessarily. "
1st January 2022,2,"""run by amateurs""",Not Verified |  This has to be the worst airport in the world. 1 week interval and we had more than 1 hour delay each time. The first time is because they lost luggage and couldn’t find them anymore. The second time is because a truck broke down behind the airplane and it took them over an hour to move it out the way. This airport is run by amateurs really.
2nd March 2020,3,"""no effort was put to accommodate incoming/returning travellers""","✅ Trip Verified | I'm writing this review as I am waiting for the baggage claim to finally deliver our luggage. Being the only airport in Montreal, it feels as though no effort was put to accommodate incoming/returning travelers. I have been lucky enough to visit quite a few other airports in the past and Montreal Trudeau has one of the slowest luggage delivery I have ever seen. This is a shame as I am from the region and am stuck with this situation, I can only imagine how incoming tourists must feel about Montreal when they have to wait 1+ hour for incoming luggage. I could forgive a single occurence but this is not an isolated incident as previously stated."
4th December 2019,5,"""immigration process was confusing""","✅ Trip Verified |  The immigration process on arrival was confusing; you have to use kiosks, I don't recall there being any signs explaining the process, and the staff were only offering advice in French unless you asked for help in English. I did carry-on only, but the baggage claim area had large signs saying not to expect bags to be delivered until at least 30 minutes after the flight. I got through, and once in the public area it was easy enough to get Canadian cash, buy a bus ticket, and find the bus into town. Departing back to the US was more disappointing. The trusted traveler lane was closed when I tried to go through security, and while the CATSA website says that trusted travelers can get front of the line privileges when the lane is closed, this was not honored at the airport. The security clearance procedure was also confusing; for example, while they require all suitcases to go into trays on the X-Ray, there were no signs explaining this, leading to a delay in getting through while the security officer helped me to find extra trays for my bags. Once through Security and US Customs the transborder terminal seems nice enough, though in common with a lot of airports the food and goods for sale were quite expensive. While Montreal is a decent enough airport, I feel that it would benefit from more signs explaining what is required at immigration and security."
17th September 2019,1,"""feel there is a scam going on""","Not Verified |  I feel there is a scam going on there at the duty free shop. I bought some items and when I went to pay for it, the young woman spent a time counting out the notes. She did it three times and could see I was watching. She then claimed I gave her $120 instead of $140 and wanted another $20. I told her I gave her 7 $20 bills and watched her count them. She acted sheepish and then said I was right. About 20 minutes later, I went to pay for something else. I handed the cashier 2 x $20’s and a $5 and asked her to charge the rest on my credit card. When I checked the receipt, she only credited me $25 of the $45 I gave her in cash. I called her out on it, and she gave me back my one $20. It just seems too much of a co-incidence that this happened with two different cashiers. The first cashier was not there when I paid the second time. I then walked up to an officer in uniform and reported it, and while I was doing so, the cashier stopped serving customers and was watching me report the issue. The officer said he was with customs and he was the incorrect person to report it to and that I should speak to a manager. I felt uncomfortable as I was being watched continuously by the cashier. It has been bugging me ever since. Hopefully the right person sees this. It was an Air Canada terminal in the 600’s and the flight was to Los Angeles."
20th August 2019,1,"""Disgustingly hot""","Not Verified |  Terrible. Disgustingly hot - absolutely zero air flow let alone cool air. And, no toilet paper in bathroom and no hooks to hang bag on which was critical being that the entire floor around toilet was wet. Felt like I was in a developing country. Awful."
23rd July 2019,5,"""must be the slowest luggage service""",Not Verified |  While the airport is run smoothly this must be the slowest luggage service I have seen. We waited 40 minutes for our luggage and this is not the first time it happens. This is a recurrent problem.
22nd June 2019,5,"""downside of this airport is the wi-fi""","✅ Trip Verified | Arriving at the airport is not a problem. The border can be a bit overwhelming, but does not take long. Departing is not a problem either, but some check-in areas are a bit confusing, being in corners (such as Lufthansa's). Unless if you fly to the States, where I had the quietest check-in in my life! The downside of this airport is the wi-fi. It seems that we need to keep connecting, even if are connected with no issues! Also, it was not very clean and I saw some very full bins. Interestingly enough, when looking at the departing details, the big screen stops, shows adds, and then shows the info again. It does have a very good variety of food options, though."
4th April 2019,1,"""there are always problems""","✅ Trip Verified | I have family living across Canada, France and Dubai so I travel a lot to visit them. Over the past years it seems that most if not all of my travel problems occurred at this airport. Lost luggage, late for connecting flights. My latest problem occuring on my trip back to Toronto from France with a stop at Montreal this April. I landed 15 minutes before my next flight which gave me just enough time to go through customs, I also had some french saucisson (shelf stable, fermented, ready to eat, cooked, with no required storage temperature processed pork sausage meat) I declared (which are perfectly legal as I checked thoroughly on the government’s Automated Import Reference System) as I did for every past flight coming back to Canada with such products. The customs officer kept arguing that all meat products outside the USA are forbidden from being brought into the country, even after a full explanation of the law of references for her to check, called me a liar and that any previous experiences I had of bringing these products into the country where done illegally, although every time the products were checked extensively by the previous customs officers and allowed into the country, the saucisson is now in a trash bin fault of having time to argue before my next flight. I’ll never use Montreal airport for any future flights, there are always problems and this time was just the final straw."
7th March 2019,5,"""it's very efficient""
","✅ Trip Verified |   Montreal airport is a relatively small airport and it's very efficient. However, it is very important for passengers to know that the public transportation from the airport to downtown is overly expensive. A bus ride will cost you $10 and more importantly the driver will only accept coins. It's very expensive compare to other airport such as Toronto Pearson that ask $3.50."
27th February 2019,4,"""Inefficient""","✅ Trip Verified | Inefficient. Just making a connection from Lima to Toronto, arrived at 11.25 am via Air Canada, so far it is 12.25 and together with at least 100 persons I am waiting for my luggage. They say 'technical problems' and I can see all is working, around 159 pieces of baggage were delivered. Have a risk of losing my connection flight."
24th December 2018,2,"""washrooms are dirty""","✅ Trip Verified | I was connecting a flight to Toronto so I have to stay in this airport for a few hours in the middle of the night. There was not much food choices. The facility is dated, seats in the sitting areas are ripped, washrooms are dirty, signs are not clear and the inspection crews are rude and clueless. The WiFi is slow and unstable, so I decided to use my data but the LTE reception is poor and some areas only 3G. The only good thing is the ground staffs are nice."
3rd December 2018,4,"""efficient and professional staff""","✅ Trip Verified | Bon aéroport, beaucoup de boutiques et de points pour manger et boire, facile de si retrouver, personnel efficace et professionnel sauf de la sécurité qui traite simplement les voyageurs comme des animaux, gros point faible de l’aéroport, hurlant et vociférant comme des malades mentaux. Cela gâche tout. - Good airport, lots of shops and points to eat and drink, easy to find, efficient and professional staff except security that simply treats travelers like animals, big weak point of the airport. It ruins everything.  "
22nd November 2018,10,"""All in all a good process""","Not Verified |  A very fast process through Canada customs using the eDeclaration system flying from Turkey. I was through customs in about 10 minutes, the kiosks are very good. Baggage came through quick enough and into the general airport. Into the parking garage across the street from the terminal in a snowstorm, Budget car rental was expecting me as I had a reservation. Quickly received my rental car and went directly to the Aloft hotel located on the airport property for a room I had reserved. All in all a good process. Same leaving to go back to Turkey, for a 22:15 departure, no problem with checking in with Turkish, quickly done and then through security which hardly had any lineup, about 10 minutes to clear it. Into the International departure area and flight was boarded efficiently and we departed onetime. A good experience."
30th October 2018,2,"""staff are the rudest""","Not Verified | Worst airport I've ever been to in my life solely because of the staff. Almost every staff member I encountered was so rude. Once I departed my plane and entered this airport my family went to a nearby bathroom. My sister and I were waiting for my dad to come out of the bathroom so we sat on the seating outside of the bathroom where some concierge man was also waiting. This man rudely asked my sister and me, ""the reason we were sitting there"" and said, ""this is not a place you can lounge around in, you need to move onto customs."" I explained that we were waiting for my dad to exit the bathroom. He waited a few minutes and then told us we couldn't sit there. We left and got separated from our dad who had our passports and could not locate him. I was so appalled that this worker would tell me, a 20-year-old girl, and my younger sister who was 15 that we could not sit in airport seating. It was not a specially designated area, but just a bench outside the bathroom. We had similar interactions with the rest of the staff members we encountered. I would warn any people who unfortunately have to visit this airport that the staff are the rudest out of the dozens of airports I've been to. I do not understand why these people would go into the service industry when they clearly do not know how to interact with people in a decent and respectful manner. I will be avoiding this airport as much as possible."
4th October 2018,1,"""lack of professional etiquette""","✅ Trip Verified | There was a bitter woman at customs who went on a power trip today and took me to a back room because I had forgotten about a banana in my purse. She yelled at me and behaved rudely. I fly internationally on a regular basis and was only in Montreal for five days for a conference. I enjoyed the city but this experience and this woman’s lack of professional etiquette was the worst I’ve witnessed. It certainly causes me to be less interested in coming back. I was greatful that another couple was in that back room with me. They wisely recommended I quickly eat my banana which I did, especially since I had to wait a long time and was disallowed use of my cell phone. How do you expect to increase tourism/business if you treat me like this for a banana?"
1st August 2018,1,"""airport is one of the worst""","Not Verified |  This airport is one of the worst I have ever been in my life. The WiFi is extremely slow almost non existent, the washing rooms are such few that it is almost impossible not to find queues. Very stressful especially if you have only an hour and a half for transit and need to use WiFi to communicate before departure."
6th June 2018,4,"""main complaint this time is the wifi""","✅ Trip Verified | My main complaint this time is the wifi. It's there, but so slow it might as well not exist. As a passenger coming from overseas, I didn't have a sim card with data when I arrived (inconveniently there are no shops that sell sim cards in the arrivals area) and I needed wifi to figure out which bus route to take to my accommodation. The airport wifi was so bad it couldn't load google maps at all. What's the point of having wifi if it doesn't work? It's 2018 and by this point I'm sure there's no excuse to have such poor internet service for your passengers, PE Trudeau Airport. I'm departing now and at least there are power points by some of the waiting chairs. Thanks for that. Still no wifi."
25th February 2018,1,"""will be avoiding this airport in the future""","✅ Trip Verified | My husband and I just returned from Mexico, with a transit in Montreal to the West. We were herded into lines where an attendant was loudly providing instructions to passengers, only to hear her give different instructions to the same passengers. There were hundreds of passengers in a 'mob' type gathering trying to get through to immigration in order to catch their connecting flights. Security allowed my 'carry-on' to go through without removing my laptop - he said it was 'ok.' This caused us to be 'stuck' in security for almost 30 minutes. We are so disappointed with Montreal Trudeau airport. We will be avoiding this airport in the future."
2nd January 2018,2,"""Horrible wait times for security""","❎ Not Verified |  Horrible wait times for security, 14 available booths and only 4 open, probably over 300 in the lineup. Been here for over an hour already. Staff has no concerns for people being late for their plane. A world class airport run line a third class junket."
6th November 2017,6,"""What a way to sabotage the Tourism""","❎ Unverified |  Security Clearance at the Montreal Airport is a joke. Given the present practices, they would never catch any bad guys. The selection of people for extra screening (X-Ray machine) is not done randomly. In fact, they routinely pick up people who are not from Montreal. What a way to sabotage the Tourism business in Montreal. Give them an unforgettable bad experience. Make them feel they are not being fairly treated. Make them not coming back for another visit. I am a frequent flyer. I know when Security Agents are not doing their job properly."
8th October 2017,1,"""Third rate. Absolute chaos""",✅ Verified Review |  Third rate. Absolute chaos! We joined an ever-expanding snake of people to get to security: this took 2 hours and is unacceptable. It was a holiday weekend but why were so many passengers scheduled at the same time? I will try my very best to avoid this place and would advise others to do the same.
30th September 2017,8,"""very happy with the arrival process""","❎ Unverified | We arrived from an overseas flight and everything was surprisingly fast and easy - no lineup at all at the passport control with the automatic passport control kiosks, very efficient customs duty service. It took less than half an hour to get out and that's only because we had to wait a little bit for our bags. There was a bit of an issue with renting a car but we didn't have a reservation so it took some time to find an available rental. Overall, very happy with the arrival process at this airport."
3rd September 2017,9,"""what a difference it makes""","✅ Verified Review |  This is the third time I have experienced a new pathway for connecting flights from NY La Guardia, to Halifax at Montreal Airport. Connecting passengers are diverted to a separate customs area, and once complete in there, arrive automatically in the connecting gate area, without having to go thru security again or pick up luggage! I understand this is only for Air Canada flights, but what a difference it makes. Because delays are usual these days, connections are often tight and line-ups at customs and security can be daunting with tight time frames. This has made such a difference! It is finally a truly customer-centred response. Yay for Air Canada in instituting this. It also means I do not have to discard my water bottle and buy another one after security. Question: can you please institute this thru Toronto, too? And also going in the other direction - Halifax- Montreal - La Guardia. Going in that direction to the US, I go thru security in Halifax, and when I go thru customs in Montreal, I have to go thru security again to get to the gates to US. Please do more of this kind of thing that helps customers!"
28th August 2017,2,"""shockingly outdated""","❎ Unverified | After travelling numerous times through Canada including Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Halifax and St. Johns, I found the Montreal airport to be shockingly outdated and unorganized. It should be embarassing that Halifax has a nicer more efficient airport given the fact that the city is 1 tenth the size of Montreal. The signage was so poor that you literally have to walk around in circles looking for your gate. The walls are plain and white. Although the airports of Halifax and Ottawa are smaller, they are at least aesthetically pleasing and have affordable options for food. Paid $39 in Montreal for a pint of beer and a poutine, ridiculous. If you have to choose a place for a connection in Canada, go with Toronto which has a ton of shops and restaurants and is actually nice. Montreal airport is an embarrassment knowing that it may be some people's first impression of Canada."
9th July 2017,1,"""A miserable experience""","✅ Verified Review |  One of the worst airports in the developed world. There was a two-mile long line to get into the airport with no reserved lane for taxis (the cab driver told that it was always like that). There was a 40 minute waiting time for clearing security (even if I went through priority lane, just to find it took some time because it was poorly indicated). The terminal was overcrowded with very little seating. Air conditioning was almost absent. Third rate shopping and eating/drinking. No Wifi. A miserable experience."
8th April 2017,1,"""40 minutes to get through passport check""","✅ Verified Review | Arrived into Montréal Airport at 15h from Barcelona and was in a long line of over 1000 people waiting 40 minutes to get through passport check by 5 agents. Arrived at the baggage carousel and it took 70 minutes from the plane's arrival to receive my bag. Why? The carousel was full, very few people were picking up their bags from the carousel from the 4 flights listed, and the system was only letting new bags trickle on, as people picked up their bags to create clear space. Nobody from the airport to fix the situation. Some passengers took matters into their own hands and started to arrange bags on the carrousel to make more room for new bags. It's embarrassing being a Montreal resident with a welcome to visitors like this! I'd like to understand why this is allowed to happen and what is being done to improve things?"
22nd December 2016,1,"""had to wait for well over 2 hours for the luggage""","Arrived on schedule on BA 95 from London. It is a longish walk from the gate to the immigration and cleared the immigration using the NEXUS machines, all fine to this point. But then we all had to wait for well over 2 hours for the luggage to arrive. Several announcements were made for the bags to arrive in the next 15-20 minutes, did not happen. This is not the first time the bag handling has gone so wrong. This is my home airport and I travel quite a bit - very disappointed."
16th December 2016,2,"""tedious and very slow""","✅ Verified Review |  I passed through this Airport (Dorval) 12 times in 2016, 8 times in 2015 and 10 times in 2014. 50% of the time I missed my connections as the stupid layout of this airport forces you to go through security again after arrival from an international flight. The security personnel from CATSA in Montreal is tedious and very slow and must be trained to be extra unfriendly. I never experienced such incompetence and unfriendliness and I travel a lot."
15th November 2016,1,"""2.5 hours getting through Immigration""","✅ Verified Review | London to Montreal with Air Canada. The flight was great, staff helpful, everything on time. However my nightmare started when I arrived at Montreal airport. Hundreds, possibly over a thousand, travellers were disgorged from planes from everywhere, arriving at the same time. We were in a kind of holding pen at the top of the steps, before being directed down the steps to form the endless cattle queue for immigration. There were pregnant women, families with small children, yet there was no order to allow these more vulnerable people to go to the front of the queue. I waited for 2.5 hours before getting through Immigration, and by that time the luggage carousel had stopped and luggage was strewn all over the floor. So on top of the insult of waiting a ridiculous amount of time, I then had to hunt down my luggage. By the time I got outsided I was furious, exhausted, and appalled to put it mildly. My holiday at my daughter's place did not start well. I did try and voice my complaints when I found the almost hidden complaints desk, and was told by the weary officer that this was ""due to lack of resources"", and that they can't find the staff to train to operate as Immigration officers. Out of the 10 plus booths, only 4-5 were occupied at any given time. I am sure the Government can – and indeed should - find the resources to ensure that at least during busy periods the immigration desks are fully staffed. I travel to Heathrow often - one of the busiest airports in the world - and yet have never ever experienced this kind of debacle. Whilst queues there are long they move quickly as the immigration stations are always fully staffed. I spoke to several people during those long 2 plus hours in the interminable queue, many who were in Montreal for the first time. Some vowed to never ever go come to Montreal again; in other Canadian airports the story had been much more positive. If Montreal is trying to entice more tourists, then this is definitely not a good look at first base, and leaves a very bad taste in the mouth. In December I will be again traveling to Montreal to visit my daughter and family, but am absolutely dreading having to go through the hell of customs/immigration at the airport. The powers that be need to urgently lift their collective game and make my and others experience at Montreal airport a pleasant and memorable one, not the nightmare that hundreds experience I am sure on a regular basis. I noted that there was an item about this in the Montreal Gazette a few days after my arrival, so my experience was not an exception. The excuse that it was a busy weekend, end of school holidays etc, just doesn't cut it. Airports the world over experience end of school crowds yet manage to keep things flowing. Wifi was a complete joke too."
4th October 2016,3,"""it was very inconvenient""","✅ Verified Review |  As airport machine check-in didn't work for my new British passport (very inconvenient), I needed manual check-in. I asked one of airport staff for assistance. Despite having a Silver Star Alliance member card, I was refused business class check-in (priority check-in) and was sent to economy class check-in, where there was the longest queue and I spent 50 minutes. It was very inconvenient. Lufthansa says that their Silver Star Alliance card does give privileges for priority check-in. However they do not recognize Silver Star Alliance member card at Montreal airport. Traveled on 2 Oct flight AC 864."
3rd October 2016,3,"""confusing and time consuming""","✅ Verified Review |  This airport is always mobbed and construction and traffic make getting into and out of the airport confusing and time consuming. Regular travelers are all funneled through a crazy-long line before they reach security inspiring a sense of helplessness and panic as you start to fear you will not make your flight. The two bathrooms that I visited had lines with a wait time of 5 minutes or more. None of the faucets seemed to be working properly - they only emitted a trickle of water if you were lucky. Neither one of the blow driers were working properly either. A sad sight to see people waiting hopefully with their hands under the dryer then finally shaking the water off on the floor which was dangerously wet. Terrible, non working WiFi - a real problem when you have to search for your confirmation email."
10th September 2016,7,"""signs would be nice""","After reading the reviews on this page for the last 3 months, I have been terrified to have my layover at YUL. I was coming from Halifax, to Houston with a layover here. I had to go through US customs here. Other than the incredibly long walking distance from my gate to customs and back to my other gate it wasn't so bad. I do wish there were more options for food or moving sidewalks around as this airport is huge. If I wanted something nourishing to eat, a walk from the gate I'm at would be a 10-15 minute walk, so I settled for chips and a drink. Customs was a quick easy process. One of the machines didn't work for me so I went to a newer looking machine and it worked fine. Other than the walking distance, and lack of options for food etc spread out, it's not a bad airport. I did have a hard time finding the way to go, but I asked someone and they directed me. Signs would be nice up the far end of the gates so you can find customs. Don't reccomend for elderly or families with children (due to all the walking) but otherwise I would reccomend."
9th September 2016,1,"""avoid this airport""","✅ Verified Review |  Third rate airport After our arrival, we were informed through a loudspeaker that announced we might have to wait ""longer than usual"" at the immigration because the number of arriving passengers was larger than usual. Still at the second level with the immigration officer's boxes out of view, we landed in a long queue of people. After about half an hour we could see the overcrowded immigration hall on the first level. The real waiting began when we had arrived at that level. It took us five or so minutes less than three hours to get through the immigration. Old people and small children alike had to stay in the queue. When we were close enough to the immigration we saw they worked at half capacity: one out of two exits was not operated. It was by far the worst I have experienced on any airport. When we eventually arrived in the luggage hall, nobody of the staff seemed to be able (or interested) to tell us where our belt had been, so we had to move around searching for our bags. We eventually found them after we met someone else from our plane who could tell us where the bags had been put. This search took another half hour. Conclusion: avoid this airport whenever you can."
2nd September 2016,2,"""a total mess""","The design and process of the Customs and Immigration at YUL are the worst I have experienced anywhere in the world. Having been to probably 75 or more airports on almost every continent, it is difficult to understand how in such a developed country can there be such a Mickey Mouse operation. The design of the arrivals and customs is like a funnel with all international arriving passengers coming into the same area. Segregation between arriving and connecting passengers is a total mess. Good luck if you have a connection in YUL. The three times I've been there over the last two months was the same experience. Line up all the way up to the second level long before even seeing the customs hall. Well over an hour to clear. Then you're expected to process your customs declaration through an automated terminal, which of course rejects it if you are a Canadian citizen but not a resident. Then the ever cooperative and welcoming customs agents send you back into another line...again. Once outside you can witness the architectural marvel of the bridge to nowhere which has been there for over 10 years and still yet to be completed. If you're connecting in Canada, go through Toronto or Vancouver. If your destination is Montreal, it's almost more efficient to connect through Toronto and clear customs there which allows you to arrive as a domestic arrival in Montreal thus avoiding the circus. Probably works out to the same amount of time, but a lot less frustrating."
31st August 2016,1,"""beware if you are making a connection""","✅ Verified Review | Beware if you are making a connection at Montréal Airport and have to clear customs. The immigration hall was overflowing. There were long lines to get into the hall stretching back to the arrival gates. By showing a connecting boarding pass we bypassed part of the line. Little information, few airline staff, not enough immigration staff. Result-chaos. We especially felt for those with small children. Then there is confusion as to where to drop your bags and then a further 30 minute line for security. The whole process was 2 hours. No time between flights for a bite to eat. Avoid customs and immigration at Montreal Trudeau if you can. It's a disgrace"
26th August 2016,3,"""understaffed customs and security""","Third world conditions in what should be a world class airport. It took us well over two hours to make a simple connection to Edmonton. Lineups, confusing procedures, understaffed customs and security, constant shouting by overworked and frustrated staff. I will avoid this airport in future. It made me ashamed to be Canadian."
21st August 2016,3,"""Chaos. Disorganized""",Chaos. Disorganized. It's almost like they want you to be lost in this airport. Airport have no idea where places are. The janitor seem to be the only person to know where baggage drop was. I know there is a language barrier of sorts but it's not hard to give instructions. Free wifi that doesn't work. Don't offer it if you can't keep it running.
16th August 2016,1,"""there is just too much chaos""","Awful. Chaotic. Seems they are surprised that airplanes are coming. Huges waiting lines. Last two times I had to transfer at this airport I missed my next flight. It took more then two hours to pass the border. The staff were ok, but there is just too much chaos."
17th May 2016,1,"""could not charge a phone""","Lived for years in Montreal and use the airport often. This past week demonstrated how antiquated YUL is. Getting off a US flight from Vegas, for hundreds of metres neither myself nor other passengers could locate, find and figure out where to find  Air Canada's transit check in. It was one tiny, concealed luggage drop-off point but the airport had no signs above to indicate what - it took 40 minutes overall to transit with long lines that made no sense. Finally at gates 1-20 good luck finding any working plugs - I could not charge a phone. By far the worse Western international airport that have been through."
11th May 2016,7,"""couldn't access the internet""","I had 1h30 min of transit at Montréal airport, and tried to access the internet. They send you an email and give you only a 15 min time frame to retrieve this email before having more free time. The problem is that my email is linked to a serve that takes more than 10 min to receive the email and in the end I just couldn't access the internet. This is the only airport so far where I experienced such a connection. It would be easier just to sign in a form or tick a checkbox (like everywhere else)."
7th May 2016,5,"""had similar 50 minute waits""","I was told to arrive at 3am for a 6am flight. I telephoned Delta to be sure and they checked and said it opened at 3.30. At 3.30 the machines started to work but there were no agents taking bags - they didn't arrive until 4.00. Security and US customs had similar 50 minute waits. Finally in the departure zone, the gate numbers weren't posted. A friendly agent was looking for her gate number on her phone and told me mine too."
14th March 2016,2,"""lack of personnel""","Worst queuing for security and immigration: each queue was about 45 minutes in all, more than 90 minutes. Many people almost missed their plane even if they arrived more than 2 hours before the flight. Lack of personnel, complicated process for immigration. Uncaring personnel."
22nd February 2016,1,"""chaotic at times""","We arrived into Montréal Airport 1/2 hour late only to find long queues in a huge warehouse-like building with hundreds of other passengers all walking through a cattle-like walkway up to immigration officers. This process through to immigration was chaotic at times and with passengers looking to get through to connecting flights, almost frantic. This process took 1.7 hours to go through only to find that immigration officers were leaving their shifts and no one was replacing them. These lines then became null and void. We then had to merge with existing lines, which made the process more of a bottleneck and mess. This unbelievable congestion of 100's of passengers was only made worst by more and more passengers coming through while signs were lit throughout reading ""Welcome to Canada"". Are they serious? I will ver go through Montréal airport ever again and will recommend the same to anyone else."
2nd December 2015,1,"""you don't feel welcome in Montréal""","Staff at the security were unprofessional, rude and incompetent. The terminal of Air Canada Jazz is old, needs a serious refresh and an improvement of confort. At this airport, you don't feel welcome in Montréal. It's a disgrace. I will definitely avoid this airport in the future."
1st October 2015,1,"""not fit for purpose""","This airport is an absolute joke and not fit for purpose. Repeated two hour waits for immigration with queues starting as you get off the plane. The staff seem to think it's acceptable to leave your luggage in random corners of the luggage hall with no signs. Something urgently needs to be done to improve this airport and the experience arriving international passengers have, it is a national embarrassment."
26th September 2015,1,"""we found staff curt, rude and uncaring""","We arrived on 1/09/2015 and encountered a queue in a corridor of about 60 metres just a short walk from the plane. We waited in this queue for over a hour and all the airport staff did was ask if you had a Canadian passport you could go to the front of the line. We asked the two staff who were policing the line how long we would have to wait to get to passport control we received curt and rude answers. We finally got to the end of the corridor only to look down on to the concourse and see a throng of hundreds of people walking up and down the concourse in a line to get to passport control. After another two hours of queuing we finally passed through passport control and headed for the luggage carousels only to find that none of the screens showed which carousel our luggage was on. We asked four members of staff how we were to find our luggage as luggage was scattered all over the luggage area but all we got from them was that you will have to walk around the area and find your luggage yourselves. We found staff curt, rude and uncaring and our first impression of Montreal was disappointing. After another 30 minutes of looking we finally located our luggage and left the airport for our hotel. Montreal is a fabulous city to visit but we will never return after the horrendous experiance and treatment we received from the staff at Montreal airport and advise other travellers if your travelling to Canada to use another entry airport. We have travelled extensively and found Montreal the worst airport in any country we have visited."
10th September 2015,2,"""a real nightmare""","Montréal Airport, a real nightmare. Immigration took more than 2 hours"
9th September 2015,1,"""completely overwhelmed by sheer traffic""","We left in the afternoon on a flight to Munich and noticed that most seats in the airport were taken and some passengers sleeping on them. Very modest offering when it comes to restaurants, the airport appeared very full. Leaving Montreal was acceptable, but returning from Frankfurt in the mid-day time period was awful. Huge line-up of arriving passengers, interminable walking through cattle-like enclosures with immigration officers completely overwhelmed by the crowds. Then looking for our baggage: The carousel was completely overwhelmed as well with 2 rows of baggage, many of the suitcases piled on top of each other,difficult to access or even find. To sum up: Montreal airport is completely overwhelmed by sheer traffic and out-of-control. What a mess, to be avoided if at all possible."
5th September 2015,1,Montréal Airport customer review,"I arrived 3.55pm local time Sept 4th. Customs hall was packed. Queuing on the upper level even to get onto the customs hall floor. I queued over 2 hours to get through customs. No explanation, only info was inaudible tannoy messages. (It was a hot day, why could they not offer drinks of water?). On eventually clearing customs I proceeded to baggage reclaim. Of course my flight was no longer displayed on the screens so I (and everyone else) did not know where to go. Saw a member of staff who asked for flight number and said cases will either be carousel 6 or 8. Wasted time looking and realised they weren't at either. Spoke to someone in authority who said carousel 4 which is where they were. Another long queue to hand in landing card, another longer queue for taxi. Why 2 hour wait in customs hall? Why no info? Why was flight not displayed in baggage reclaim? Why was incorrect info given to passengers? Have those in authority never heard of customer service?"
3rd September 2015,8,Montréal Airport customer review,"Flew out of this airport for a flight to Italy. I like that they have a security line for travelers with children. We cleared security with no problems in less than 10 min. The airport is clean and easy to navigate. I don't understand how certain people say that the signs are not clear. Travelers to the US complain that the process is slow. Once again I don't understand how this is the airports fault. These are security features imposed by the US governement on Canadian airports. Trudeau has no controll over American custom agents inability to be more efficient. My only complaint is the shear amount of people during rush hours. This airport is too small for the amount of travelers going through.I like the airport has free wi-fi. I dont understand how the previous traveler said she couldn't get FREE wi-fi. This airport is equiped with charging post near the seats. On the return, we arrived during rush hour, usually between 4pm and 7pm, to a sea of people at customs. There must have thousands of people there but the electronic check out system was easy, quick (less than 1 min for 3 travelers) and simple to use. My only complaint was the customs agent that reviewed my claim, he asked me what I had to declare as I was declaring dried fruits. He sends me to extra screening to which that officer after waiting 20 minutes see them asked the same question to which I ansered the same thing as the previous agent and they let me through. I lost an extra 20 min for nothing. We cleared customs and got our bags within an 1 hour. Exit signs are very clear."
7th August 2015,1,Montréal Airport customer review,Our flight from Paris was delayed and we would told by the flight attendants to wait at the end of the jetway if we'd missed a flight. The person at the end of the jetway berated us for taking up space and standing around and told us to continue to the terminal. There was no assistance. I was told I would make my flight if I hurried to the customs line -  there were well over 150 of us going the same direction and there was one slow and chatty security line. Then we were in front of passport machines with no direction as to how they were to be used. There was no organization to the line and the staff kept shouting to process our passports and wait for our name to show up on the screen. There was chaos and zero organization. It took well over an hour to get through this process. Of course I missed my flight. There was no one at the gate to help re-book. We found the customer service gate and stood in line to be re-booked. That was the only friendly agent. There is no free wifi (I traveled 7 airports in 14 days and this was the only one without wifi) - I had to get my boarding passes printed as they would not accept a digital version. I will pay extra money to never travel through this airport again.
30th July 2015,1,Montréal Airport customer review,"We transited Montreal on our way from Spain to Boston and so had to go through the US customs operation there. What a complete mess! We waited over 1.5 hours in various lines with very unclear instructions from generally very rude personnel. The signs are both unclear and contradictory about where to go for US transit passengers and in most places along the way, there is simply no information available about where to go or what the procedures are. We are Global Entry members and it was of no use whatsoever, even had the GE kiosks been working, which they weren't. A place to avoid."
20th March 2015,5,Montréal Airport customer review,Have used this airport for departure and arrivals over 20 times. Departures are pretty much what you expect of an airport. Space for large quantities of clients is OK. You don't bump into each other going from baggage drop off to security to customs (for USA). Restaurant choices have improved in the last years but prices are high. Cleanliness is from average to good. The Wi-Fi is on the slow side but its free. Security check does flow and takes around 15 mins outside rush hours. During rush hours its not worse than any US airport. The big hiccup with this airport are the customs on arrival. Over 20 arrivals for me and the management doesn't seem to know how many planes/passengers are coming. You should have seen the shambles when the Air France A380 was still arriving at this airport. They are understaffed and the custom officials are overworked and it shows. The experience lasts around one hour with a Canadian passport or up to two hours with a passport of another country. Once at the booth the agents do a good job they will question you but are efficient. On the positive side you waited at customs for an hour or more so your baggage is waiting for you. Transport In and Out of this airport is almost exclusively by car (taxis or personnel). The car drop off zone is ridiculous. You're fighting your way between cars taxis and buses. Short and long term parking is abundant. A bus service does exist from the airport to downtown MontrÃ©al. But if you want to go elsewhere you're better off using a taxi. No train departs directly from the airport. A shuttle exists (when its available) or you can walk to the nearest train station. Between 15-20 min walk outside with minimal indications and minimal pedestrian walk ways. This airport is saturated and cannot grow. It is situated on the island of MontrÃ©al with no more available terrain around it.
14th January 2015,4,Montréal Airport customer review,Flying from Cancun to Boston through Montreal-Trudeau. First of all any connection from one country to the US still requires going through Canadian customs and then going through security again and then US customs. So the process of transferring here is very time consuming. Secondly the airport makes the transfer process as vague and difficult as possible. We encountered a lot of difficulty in figuring out how to make the transfer in terms of either a) getting no information from posted signs about how to proceed and b) getting scolding contradictory information from airport staff about how to proceed through the airport from one flight to another. We were told by Information Services (we called for assistance in the baggage claim area) that we absolutely had to pick up our bags to go through customs then told by Air Canada baggage services that our bags had been sent on directly to Boston and we should proceed without them - then yelled at by the customs officer for not having our luggage with us. Clearly the airport staff in general needs to be far better trained in terms of providing assistance to travelers making connections through this airport. In all if you are making connections from abroad to the US I would not recommend this airport as a point of transfer due to the issues of time lack of clarity as to how to proceed and rudeness of staff.
25th November 2014,1,Montréal Airport customer review,This is an incredibly confusing airport as the signage is very poor. Found myself walking around in circles trying to get to my gate. The security line was very long and seemed to not be moving. After wondering what the hold up was we realized that ticket checkers were chatting away with relatives of another persons and people lined up behind them unknowingly. Security itself moved very slowly and most of the staff seemed to be having personal conversations with each other. Luckily I had a longer connection but I can't imagine how others would have made the flight.
28th September 2014,8,Montréal Airport customer review,Flying from Montreal to Boston we knew we would have to go through the American immigration procedures here and were not looking forward to it at all. The queues were quite short the official was pleasant and efficient and we were competed in a much shorter time than we have previously experienced at American airports. The departure lounge was clean and comfortable but facilities were not extensive. A reasonably pleasant experience.
28th September 2014,2,Montréal Airport customer review,Access by car is awful. I cannot think of an airport that is worse and it is unlikely to ever change. While they have made improvements (improvements which were torturous for passengers by the way) it does not and will never compare with the spacious Mirabel. I fly regularly to Europe on business and I recall the year in the early 2000's when AC switched from Mirabel to Dorval - it was like going from luxury accommodations to a shack. While it is better than that now there is no room for airport expansion (seems short-sighted) and access by car remains a nightmare. True that the City of Montreal (strangely) pushed for this and financed most of the improvements but I cannot imagine that the residents near Dorval like the noise and congestion. Lastly and generally speaking I have found that security staff at Trudeau-Dorval to be some of the rudest (though there have been a few nice ones over the years). I don't recall ever observing rudeness from security staff at Mirabel and the queuing at Mirabel was much shorter.
22nd September 2014,n/a,Montréal Airport customer review,We are not frequent travellers so we feel we are rookies and are constantly looking around to see where we should go or what we should do. We came home from Vegas on Thurs Sept 18th and discovered we need to use electronic check in of our passport. So we helped each other do this. I was travelling with my husband and Brother and sister-in- law. Once we completed this we were walking through the queue to see what our next step was. My brother and his wife had stopped ahead of us and was speaking with a customs agent and then one of them started just yelling in French which is fine but I did not understand what he was saying or why he was yelling. I could not figure out what I had done wrong. Apparently I was too close to my brother and his wife. He yelled at me that I was invading their privacy! I needed to stay back. He shouted that I should read the signs and be aware of my surroundings at all times etc.
5th September 2014,1,Montréal Airport customer review,Montreal airport is terrible for US Citizens. I have been to Montreal twice once in 2009 and once yesterday (August 2014). Both times I was sent with no stated reason to a secondary immigration inspection office after waiting in the original immigration line. I am 37 no criminal record I travel all around the world for business and pleasure and never have any problems with immigration except in Montreal. They don't even tell you that you are going to secondary inspection they just act like it's no big deal and send you to a room where you take a number. Well let me tell you I took number 37 and they were on number 14 with only two windows out of 12 open and operating. I was stuck in this airport for probably 2 hours due to the terrible laborious and understaffed immigration procedures. The actual immigration officers were fairly polite it was the wait the understaffed atmosphere and the needless additional screening of hundreds of people at a time that cause this airport to be a disaster and actually really hurt tourism.
26th August 2014,7,Montréal Airport customer review,Just to let you know that the slow US passport control is called the pre-customs clearance. It is entirely staffed and operated by the United States and Canada doesn't have a word to say about how these operations should be conducted. Therefore these officers are Americans and this pre-customs clearance was imposed on Canadians by Americans and applies to US citizens ans well as citizens of most other countries who travel to the US. I give a score of 1 for queuing times because of that US customs clearance where just last week Canadians were separated from the rest of the world sent to a special section of the waiting line and were imposed a supplementary self- check out with passport-reading machines and for the three hundred of us (or even more) waiting there given only two (very slow) US customs officers for clearance. No need to tell you that many of these Canadian missed their flight. We luckily weren't one of them. I would recommend this airport except if you are going to the United States (especially if you are Canadian).
16th June 2014,2,Montréal Airport customer review,"Arrival from United States: after walking to Canadian passport control I was surprised not to be in downtown Montreal already - I'd walked and walked. Canadian passport control slow but officer was moderately polite (he remembered not to scowl too much). No problem getting taxicab to downtown. Departure to United States destination: agonizingly slow security line staffed by extremely rude personnel who get nastier when (as I overheard) a person would rather speak a foreign language (one other than English or French). After security comes the more agonizingly slow US passport control which moves at the pace of a grumpy glacier. The technique of ""smile"" as these officers understand it is but dimly and imperfectly understood. I arrived at 5.15am for a 7am flight to the US and barely made it. I checked no luggage (would have made problems much worse). Considering how beautiful Montreal is and how friendly its local people were to me this airport as a gateway to those pleasures is like having a smelly dilapidated outhouse at the entrance to a lovely country estate."
4th June 2014,2,Montréal Airport customer review,Every time I've been through this airport there has been massive delays and problems. Yesterday a storm came through - which resulted in the grounding of planes for 5-6 hours. Hardly any announcements were made no extra staff on to deal with massive delays etc. The airport generally looks awful and the underground connector to more local Canadian flights is even worse. As a gateway into Quebec and the incredible city of Montreal it is a great disappointment. The signage is also pretty poor.
27th April 2014,n/a,Montréal Airport customer review,Avoid US connections. Transferring from BRU to FLL with more than 3 hours layover and almost missed our connecting flight! US transfer line is a nightmare! Hundreds of people cramped in tiny space. No information whatsoever and endless lines. Personnel extremely rude and unhelpful. No information. This facility was clearly not designed to handle a lot of transfer passengers only one security metal detector line available and one dedicated us customs officer! Avoid at all costs.
28th March 2014,1,Montréal Airport customer review,Very slow customs very rude at check in no help. No smoking facility very poor passenger services. Approach to airport is a nightmare taxi or regular transport even worse. If you have any choice to use or not Trudeau airport try to pass over it.
10th March 2014,3,Montréal Airport customer review,"Trudeau is my home airport traveling most weeks as an Air Canada Super Elite. We are well served by an airport which has better than average international and cross border connections given the size of the city. Air Canada service during check in and boarding is good (especially if you have concierge access). However the key weakness is security twice as many staff as a typical US airport process passengers twice as slowly evidently under the influence of a 1970's style time and motion study. The many comments on the board about disinterested personnel engaged in important personal conversations see it every week. Checking in this morning the security officer demanded that bins be turned lengthways on the way to the scanner (not vertically where you could fit twice as many and move more quickly). The reason - ""it was too noisy"" for the bins to run over the rollers unless they were lengthways. I hang my head in shame at the international visitors who have to endure this treatment when traveling through my city."
2nd January 2014,7,Montréal Airport customer review,The one-hour International to Domestic minimum connection time at YUL is unrealistically low. I arrived from Frankfurt on AC875 on Jan. 1 at 15.56 and connected to a domestic flight that departed to Winnipeg at 17.20 - officially well above the minimum required time. Clearing Immigration and Customs via the Connections line was as quick as I've experienced anywhere and I was slowed down only slightly by baggage re-check. Then came security where connecting and local passengers must all go through the same line. That was where things went pear-shaped with a long line snaking across the terminal followed by a few extra minutes going through a random more detailed (but professionally done) inspection. Literally ran for the gate without even putting my belt back on or refilling my pockets and was the final passenger to board just after the final call. Not everyone can run with a backpack on though without risking a heart attack or injury so give yourself no less than 90 minutes to make an International to Domestic connection at YUL.
25th December 2013,4,Montréal Airport customer review,Okay for domestic and international. Horrible for U.S. flights. Most insane customs procedure ever on this side whereas on the American side - things work great. When you have to get to the airport early and wait around food choices are bland and uninspiring. I fly a lot from YUL to YVR with kids and because Air Canada sells you poor off the cart even for flights that are 5.5 hours I would like to have a semi-digestible meal in the terminal. Also - flying domestically - get used to waiting for your bags for an average of 45 minutes at the carousel. No wonder people refuse to check their luggage and cram it all into the overhead bins. After your bags have finally arrived passengers can look forward to a taxi line that moves at a slug-like pace. The mystery is there's always a long line of cabs available. It seems that getting them to the waiting passengers is the problem. Like most things in Montreal third-world service is accepted with a shrug!
31st July 2013,n/a,Montréal Airport customer review,One of the worst airports in the world. The Immigration staff are rude and do not bother to check details thoroughly. The attitude of most of the staff is of a could not give a damn type. The floors and seating are filthy. If and when you finally get through the over the top immigration gestapo who need 2-3 checks for the same thing you will need to navigate the baggage hall where you will possibly find your bag if it hasn't already been moved from the carousel and dumped anywhere on the floor. Avoid.
29th July 2013,n/a,Montréal Airport customer review,For US citizens Montreal is the worst airport to connect through when traveling internationally. I base this on my numerous business travels globally over the past 10 years. One would think 3.5 hours is enough to make a connection yet my family and I spent 3.25 of it in line showing our passports and boarding passes numerous times to airport security staff going through a second security clearance in addition to US customs and border control clearance. Awful management awful system. Worst customs/border experience ever. Staff were uninformative and non- helpful to the crowds of folks waiting in line with us. There were only 2 customs officers on duty for 500+ people. Management needs an overhaul if they can't plan staffing according to flight arrivals! I highly discourage US citizen from making connections through Montreal.
24th June 2013,7,Montréal Airport customer review,I fly frequently from YUL both domestically within Canada and internationally. I have always been pleased with the service I receive. As a small airport there are no significant terminal changes to contend with. The new US departures wing looks great from the arrivals area. I have never had any problems with checking in and security is usually efficient. Customs is often slow though the new automated machines are great for Canadians returning from abroad. Customs staff are not always the most friendly but they get the job done. Amenities are limited once you pass security but you'll find food and convenience stores with all the essentials in case you forgot something. All wings are clean and signage is clear. Very difficult to get lost. Overall it's an easy airport to navigate and I would recommend it as a good option for those entering or transiting through Canada.
22nd April 2013,7,Montréal Airport customer review,Well I agree that PET is not perfect but I have yet to find an airport that is (Zurich comes closest) but having said that all the grumbles and grouches people have already posted here are just standard international airport stuff. The airport is far better than it used to be and is anyway undergoing major rebuilding which must have some effect. The lines are not bad so long as you do as suggested and don't try to arrive at the last minute much better in the immigration line than for example London Heathrow which is a real nightmare.
14th April 2013,n/a,Montréal Airport customer review,YUL is a third world airport characterized by some of the rudest personnel of any Canadian airport. The security personnel are not reassuring to put it politely. It is not uncommon to see some of the security personnel engaged deep in personal conversations with each other or on the telephone chattering away instead of doing their jobs. It would be nice if the personnel were comprehensible in one of Canada's two official languages. Gate personnel often have problems connecting the gates gangways to airplanes. Although the terminals are not as spread out as other airports it is a good thing as this is not an airport where one wants to spend time. The availability of food service airside is rather limited and the quality is dismal. Arriving late at night is a nightmare. Baggage can take up to an hour to arrive on one conveyor belt that is shared by multiple flights. The result is that PAX can crowd around one belt even though there are several other belts available. The arrivals baggage area is not secure as in other airports so non Pax can easily access the luggage belts (No security doors and no guard). The terminal especially the domestic arrival area is filthy. The parking lot is constantly under construction dark and dirty. The worst part of a YUL is the taxi service.
1st April 2013,1,Montréal Airport customer review,Connected here from London (LHR) to a flight to Chicago. Almost a 2 hour layover yet almost missed my connections because of slow customs processing. Personnel are totally unhelpful tell you planes will be held even when they aren't and have absolutely no interest in getting you to your flight. I think there were 500 people in line (two large international flights) and 2 customs clerks. They are inadequately staffed and the few people in the customs lines can't be bothered with the trivial issue of your flight connections. Why this interview is even needed with all the x-rays is beyond me? Do not connect within this airport under any circumstances.
1st April 2013,n/a,Montréal Airport customer review,US Customs pre-clearance on connecting flights can be a big problem. We arrived with 2 hours to spare and Global Entry cards and then spent the entire two hours in a line that rarely moves and arrives at a security check with no signage to help speed up the process (remove shoes no liquids etc etc for the uninformed). Occasionally an agent came through to take passengers with imminent departures to the front of the line but it was poorly managed. By the time they took us and a dozen others to the front it was too late we missed our flights by ten minutes. Since it is not the airlines' fault your overnight hotel stay will be at your own expense you have to retrieve your bags and you will have the pleasure of re-doing the entire pre-clearance process the next morning. Needless to say we will avoid coming through Montreal for international connections to the US in the future. If I'm going to be stuck for two hours in a customs line I'd prefer it to be stateside so at least I can catch a taxi home when it's all over.
1st March 2013,1,Montréal Airport customer review,Very disappointing experience at YUL. I will echo the comments below: security is both extremely rude and inefficient. Simply because they wear a uniform doesn't entitle them to disrespect people the way they do. I have never seem such behaviour elsewhere. They seem totally oblivious to an airport core mission: transport passengers. Facilities are very limited - not what you would expect from an international airport. Basic utilities like WiFi and cell phones don't even work well. Parking fees are outrageous it's pure extortion.
17th December 2012,5,Montréal Airport customer review,Every time I visit the business class lounge at this airport there are problems with the WiFi. The helpful receptionist says this is the fault of the airport and that they are always complaining but nothing gets done.
13th December 2012,n/a,Montréal Airport customer review,I have traveled throughout the world and have never been to an airport that makes you go trough security twice! We missed a 2 hour connection both ways flying through. The rudest security I have encountered. My husband asked a question about security and we were told to be quiet or not get on our flight! I was asked if we had bags (which we were clearly holding) and I said yes. He said quit trying to be smart. We will never come through here again.
1st October 2012,1,Montréal Airport customer review,The stated policy of the airport management (as seen by large posted signs) is to allow entrance to security only for passengers close to flight departure time. This means that if one gets to the airport in sufficient time to clear security and perhaps enjoy the airport and relax one finds (as happened to us this morning trying to wait for a flight to the US) that one waits for well over an hour to enter security because those passengers arriving with less time for their flight are given priority. This is patently unfair. Airport personnel state that they do not care if you make the flight and urged another passenger to stop complaining or he would be there all day. Further even though we have Global Entry cards Montreal airport personnel would not permit entry faster as is permitted for NEXUS card holders. In all other Canadian airports the Global Entry holder is treated equally as NEXUS. Airport personnel say that the reason for long delays is because there are not sufficient US immigration and customs personnel however it seems that instead there is not sufficient security personnel. Having arrived at the airport more than 2 hours before our flight we made the flight running and just before the aircraft doors closed. What a disappointment. We will not visit Montreal again as this airport is so poorly managed.
19th August 2012,8,Montréal Airport customer review,Passed through here on way to Halifax was apprehensive as only had two hours to clear immigration and check in again and collect bags. Worked well however eating facilities limited airside - otherwise ok.
19th August 2012,3,Montréal Airport customer review,The poorest airport service I have seen. When I travel I always book assistance because I have difficulties with long distances. When I arrived nobody was at the aircraft to take me to the exit. When I tried to address the staff that I needed help they were not even willing to listen and just shouted. Staff of the assistance service did not feel responsible even though I am a registered handicapped and the wheelchair icon was printed on my boarding pass. In future I will avoid Montreal.
17th June 2012,2,Montréal Airport customer review,"I had a terrible experience when i went through the Custom in the YUL airport to come back to US. The waiting line was long about 300 passengers were waiting but only 3 custom windows were open. A guy who might be a guard to maintain the line for lining up for the windows was extremely rude and vicious. When I asked him if there was anything he could do for helping me get through the line faster since I only have less than 1 hour left before departure and line seemed extremely long and slow. He yelled at me and screamed ""I don't care if you miss you flight or not! That has nothing to do with me! If you don't come to the airport 3 hours earlier that is your problem!"". I and many other passengers were stunned by his horrible behavior! Then he screamed at me again saying ""if you say one more word you will stay here forever!"" All of the passengers in the line were completely stunned. He has no right to treat passengers as such! How can an airport keep an employee who is so rude and vicious to the passengers? We are not criminals - he was yelling and screaming as if he had the authority to determine the passengers' fate."
2nd May 2012,8,Montréal Airport customer review,This airport is getting better since all international flights were transferred from Mirabel airport. Waiting in lines to pass security points and customs can be very long during rush hour. Walking distance are long when the flights leave from the last gates of the terminal but there's a shuttle that passes frequently. A good variety of stores after security points and many restaurants before security. This airport is well connected to the city of Montreal with an Express bus and connected to the cities of Quebec and Ottawa by bus. In a few years there will be a train station under the main terminal. Overall this airport is very good.
16th April 2012,9,Montréal Airport customer review,Very Welcoming Airport. Staff helpful and queuing time was relatively short! Flew on a busy week. Art pieces from various artist exposed around the airport (when arriving and leaving). Terminals were clean and so were the toilets (spotless) even though I had to walk quite a bit to find some. Overall shops nearly everywhere and heating was at correct temperature.
17th January 2012,9,Montréal Airport customer review,I fly back and forth between Turkey and Canada 3 times a year and always use Montreal Trudeau. The customs and immigration area is large always lots of gates opened and no different on my last trip just before Christmas. I was through immigration and out with my bags in 40 minutes. I have always found lots of immigration and customs officers and the wait time is minimal. Leaving the airport has greatly improved although the two security screening gates can get congested when a number of international flights are departing in late afternoon/early evening. Best to get into line to leave enough time. Airside the shops are small but offer enough choice. The big thing I like about the airport is free wifi and great speeds a nice touch. All in all a good airport to use.
13th January 2012,2,Montréal Airport customer review,Security staff so rude that makes the TSA look like a theme park. Immigration a complete mess waited in queue for almost an hour before reaching the counter where the staff were considerably more polite but still asked more questions than any other country I've visited. In the year 2012 the most effective way of going from the airport to downtown is a cramped bus. I will never set a foot in this place ever again.
25th November 2011,7,Montréal Airport customer review,A lot could still be improved at Trudeau but having to work with a 1960 built terminal they have done a great job in improving the experience. The 3 concourses and the aeroquay are pleasant and have a reasonable choice of shops food and drinks. The separate security checks for international transborder (US) and domestic flights divide the flow and makes for usually shorter queues. The international arrival hall and access to baggage belts are user-friendly and the space is beautiful. Trudeau is a decent airport and overall going through either upon departure or arrival is an easy quick process. Airports have a duty to make it easier for the traveler but the traveler also has a duty to come prepared.
14th October 2011,1,Montréal Airport customer review,I had connection was in a rush and at the customs (coming from France) I was questioned about the value of 100 dollars in gifts that I declared in the declaration form. There were some chocolates and gifts from my parents (I was coming back) and I didn't know the exact value of the gifts because I didn't buy them myself. I considered the value of all the gifts to be around 100$. In the end after many questions asked by the custom officer I offered to open and show my carry on (I didn't have anything checked in). She finally let my pass. I didn't think 100 dollars is something worth so many questions. Anyway I was late because my plane arrived late and when going through security to the connection I ask the employee to help me pass ahead but I was told to ask the people in line myself. A lot of people were nice and let me pass but somebody in the middle of the line didn't allow me. I was able to catch the plane last minute. Do not rely in much help from the airport employees.
3rd October 2011,1,Montréal Airport customer review,Trudeau International is poorly laid out and confusing. If you're connecting to a domestic from an international flight there are unnecessary layers of security that slow travellers to the point that missing a flight is a very real possibility. The staff were not helpful and even at times a hindrance requests for assistance were met with condescending answers or contempt which made the professionalism of a minority stand out all the more by comparison.
17th August 2011,4,Montréal Airport customer review,My overall impression of the security/baggage system is positive a few more signs would be helpful to those not familiar with the facility. I travel between Washington and Montreal at least once a year. However I do not understand why passengers waiting to board are only allowed to enter the gate area minutes before flight time. At a small door an agent checks passports/IDs and boarding pass and passengers enter a smallish lounge. There is only one other door leading to the aircraft. When boarding is announced and the door to the aircraft opened another agent checks passports/IDs and boarding passes again before passengers proceed to the plane.
13th July 2011,3,Montréal Airport customer review,A potentially nice airport spoilt by various non-customer-friendly practices. Four European flights arrive almost simultaneously in the afternoon including an A380 from Paris so Immigration Baggage Reclaim Customs clearance and taxis all involve long slow lines. Security on the departures side is a convoluted effort with holding pens through which progress is slow. I doubt if security is in any way enhanced in reality.
14th September 2010,2,Montréal Airport customer review,We flew to London from this airport. No real information desk and no way to track down British Airways check in. Not the fault of the airport but a bad start. Catering and shops are pretty limited both sides of the security barriers and what there is very expensive. Main complaint was that the supervisors of the area between pre security and the actual search area were extremely rude and very aggressive. They were shouting at passengers to hurry up and move faster they were like storm troopers I am still not sure if they were policemen or private guards whichever they were they were just a load of yobs. I will never fly through that airport again. I was glad to see the immigration officers at Heathrow and that is really saying something.
20th July 2010,3,Montréal Airport customer review,Connecting from FRA-YUL to LAX. Anyone coming from International connecting to the US don't go through Montreal. They have small holding area and push everyone to a dead end until all bags have been screened. It takes a long time as there is no proper staffing - these are US employees (pre-immigration in canada). Tight connections or impatient travelers stay away! Don't buy duty free from international or on the plane as connecting you have to go back through security (saw a lady's perfume get thrown away in front of her).
6th April 2010,4,Montréal Airport customer review,Nice airport and it's getting better. Good choice of restaurants and shops. I had no problem for check- in or pass security. Actually it was pretty quick ! 15 minutes from check-in to my boarding gate. On arrival from my international flight everything went smooth except for a 30 minute wait to clear customs even when all custom booths were well staffed. Overall I recommend YUL without hesitation.
20th March 2010,1,Montréal Airport customer review,International arrival connecting to domestic AC flight immigration a nightmare holding corral half full two or three agents on duty total mismanagement and incompetence. I will never again connect thru Montreal.
18th March 2010,2,Montréal Airport customer review,"Nice looking but horrendous baggage claim/customs passenger flow and needs better mass transit access. Had a domestic connection from YOW-YUL to USA: there is an ""inside track"" for connecting flights to the USA with baggage checked straight through - a very nice improvement from a few years ago. Unfortunately the passenger flow design for return connections from USA to other Canadian airports (even if you're flying with the same airline) is stupid - passengers have to deplane collect their luggage (several large carousels) and then wait in line with many other passengers regardless of connection flight or not then re-check your luggage and sprint to the other end of the airport and redo security with all the other pax getting on for the first time. This critical design flaw could be fixed by creating a separate track/floor for connecting passengers only bypassing most of the lineups and baggage transfers."
9th August 2009,4,Montréal Airport customer review,"Fast track although supposedly available for business class is very difficult to find and almost impossible to access. On my last visit I asked the pre security attendant who was getting very stressed where the fast track entrance was and he just motioned me to join the main queue. Only my persistence elicited a wave to the empty roped off line besides the main entrance - security officer at the end looked most surprised to see me and I had to repeatedly say ""fast track"" before he reluctantly removed the rope and let me through. What is going on here? It spoils an otherwise hassle free departure."
2nd August 2009,2,Montréal Airport customer review,"You can walk miles and miles without a toilet facility. They collect 25$ for ""facility improvement fee"" how ironical. Nothing is improving. The departure is a little bit better but still walking miles and miles. Food concessions choice and price are OK but duty free is limited and overpriced. You can have better price at drugstore in town for perfume. Price of bottle water are overpriced they profit the new liquid regulations but that happens everywhere. Traffic around YUL Airport is chaotic and confusing. Airport authority need to travel to some other airport in the world to do the improvement they promise for the ""facility improvement fee"" they collect."
13th April 2009,1,Montréal Airport customer review,As a world traveller and former Mirabel passenger I can only say Trudeau airport is a hidden conspiracy. Would have been much cheaper and convenient to get a high speed rail line from Mirabel. Not only a financial pitfall and logistical nightmare it is also poorly designed and surely a future sponge for more improvements and financial burdens to come in the near future as air travel becomes part of daily life. Expansion will be a problem. It is complicated to navigate space very limited parking a horror and quite honestly a giant accident waiting to happen. I rather fly to Toronto City Center island airport or Halifax or Victoria than Trudeau. Overly complicated not efficient and probably the worst airport in Canada and again an embarassment for a great city. Aeroports de Montreal needs a wake up call. I am all for improvements and keeping people in the work force but this was just a really bad idea. I filled out many surveys regarding the proposed closure of Mirabel at the time and have yet to see one statistic of what the passengers and users of the airports had to say. Last flight into Trudeau the carousel sign wasn't even working. Had to do all carousels to find my bag. Want a nightmare after an 8 hour flight ? Fly into Trudeau.
31st December 2008,3,Montréal Airport customer review,The improvements to technology that AC has made in terms of printing your own baggage tag & boarding passes seemed great when I took my flight from YUL to YVR on Dec 20th - until all the passengers (I would estimate a minimum of 200 people) who only had to drop off their already-tagged bags were made to wait in line for over an hour as there was only ONE employee at the counter checking in bags. What I found interesting was that my return flight the following weekend from YVR to YUL required a total of 5 minutes from printing the baggage tags and being on my way to security! I sincerely hope the lack of planning and organization at YUL's AC counters were just a fluke for that day because I'll be back there again tomorrow.
3rd July 2021,8,"""car rental returns was a nightmare""","Not Verified |  One of the cleanest airports but car rental returns was a nightmare. Sign was car rental instead of car rental returns. No directions how to enter the gate (turn right - press button and obtain ticket. Bar will be lifted). Directions to P4 / car returns not bold enough to see. No employee to receive returns, I wasted 30 minutes and barely got into the flight. If you can do something to improve, it will be helpful for future travellers. I read similar complaints by other travellers but does not look liked any changes have happened."
23rd December 2019,8,"""how regional mid-size airports should be""","✅ Trip Verified | Liked the airport of Edmonton. Very efficient security and no big walking distances. A nice bright design that make you feel comfortable. Besides, there are a lot of shopping and dining options here. This Airport can be a role model, how regional mid-size airports should be."
10th December 2019,1,"""over 45 minutes after flight arrival for bags""","Not Verified |  The majority of this airport is fine for a Canadian airport except for the baggage management system, which is worse than most other place in the world. Waiting for over 45 minutes after flight arrival for bags is outrageously pathetic. Dhaka in Bangladesh has less wait times for baggage. It is far past the time for this airport to upgrade to a modern system."
19th September 2019,2,"""shocked to be treated like this""","✅ Trip Verified | I am 63 years old, I was pulled aside for an indepth screening - the lady who was screening me told my husband he could go ahead - I said no I wanted my husband with me, she thoroughly went through my bag with a wand - what was most disturbing was how she would just throw my stuff around - not even closing zippers or putting my liquids bag in the pocket it came out. She was not very friendly - my husband and I were shocked to be treated like this. It was quite rude to be treated like this since I am an elderly woman."
2nd April 2019,2,"""It was chaos!""","Not Verified |    The problem was in security the morning of March 27th 2019, the scanners broke down but one, the staff were throwing the tote trays with passengers things in them to the one scanner that was working. It was chaos! We missed our flight with Westjet, no one from the airline came to get us, and they only held the plane for 10 minutes. Many people missed their flights! There was panic everywhere, even tears! When we got to the gate the plane had just closed the door, the Westjet employ was very cold, and not helpful at all. But did charge us an additional $1300 for 4 more ticket home! This is outrageous! No one wants to take responsibility for this, this is not our fault."
20th May 2018,2,"""Terrible signage""","❌ Not Verified |  Terrible signage. Arriving late at night into the domestic terminal trying to get to the US terminal you are led first to a bank of windows. You cannot get through and next you find signage taking you to a set of doors that is locked all night long. No one in the airport was helpful. Once you figure out how to exit the terminal and go through U.S. security the situation gets even worse. Over 100 passengers were held in a cramped area until 4 in the morning. Finally, exhausted we were allowed to proceed to our gate. I probably could have designed a worse airport but it would have taken a significant amount of effort."
12th May 2018,2,"""Horrible signage""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible signage! I returned with my Hertz Rent-A-Car and has no idea where to go! No signs where to go. No signs indicating the terminal and no person to assist. I travel every week for work and have never had an issue navigating an airport. Got inside and stood in security line for 1/2 hour to be told I had to walk half mile American gates. Are you kidding me? No signs when I walked in that I needed to do this! No person checking passports to say this! Security then tagged me and said I had too many liquids, 4 bottles with less than 3 oz? Seriously? Guy took my bag apart and then said, oh, I guess everything’s ok! Horrible experience!"
12th April 2018,9,"""Edmonton is well signed""","❎ Not Verified |  The only way to fly out of where I live, as I do monthly, is to get a connection either through Edmonton or Calgary. My main reason for writing this review is I cannot stress enough how horrible Calgary airport is. Edmonton is well signed, information of gate changes is always available. The staff are almost always kind and helpful. There is food/drinks or restaurants evenly distributed throughout the airport, and not a far walk to get anything I need."
6th December 2017,8,"""airport is well laid out""","❎ Not Verified |  Very nice modern airport for a city the size of Edmonton. The airport is well laid out, has some ok restaurants, good wifi availability and comfortable seating. When you compare this to Calgary airport it is heaven. Calgary has a low quality 3rd world airport."
17th December 2015,7,"""modern, well organized, and dependable""","YEG is a very modern, well organized, and dependable airport. The layout is quite simple and well marked with plenty of signage making it easy to navigate. Staff are friendly and informative regarding airport amenities. Edmonton International seems to fair well even during the most trying weather. Its greatest downfall though lies solely on it's laughable attempt at providing free WiFi to travellers. Anyone attempting to pass the time on the web, entertain the kids with YouTube, or download an update will swiftly become frustrated by either the glacial speed of the network. Or the intermittent loss of connectivity. Tasks as minor as checking one's e-mail becomes a feat. My advice for passing the time during layovers. Bring a book."
26th January 2015,8,Edmonton Airport customer review,Coming home from a 7 month trip (looks like I was the last reviewer) via a long distance flight during a snow storm is not fun. Thankfully I live in Edmonton where they know how to handle the weather/keep the runways clear. The only delay in landing was that the bridge connecting to the plane had trouble securing due to icing. Other than that we were off the plane quite quickly. Immigration had about 5 booths open and was only a 10 min wait. Issue with the baggage carousels in that the info telling us which one was ours was only up for 2 minutes (while we were waiting to get through customs) and then for some reason it disappeared which was quite confusing. Airport staff was waiting past the customs area to help passengers with connecting flights.
25th June 2014,8,Edmonton Airport customer review,June 24th 2014 outbound. Seems like a new airport with all the renos. Very clean lots of stores tons of plug ins (including usb) and varied seating (standard gates plus loungers foot stools etc). Security was a bit of a lag due to training but staff were very friendly and seemed to be enjoying their jobs. If you have issues walking highly suggest getting a wheelchair as it can be a bit of a trek to get to some of the gates.
5th September 2013,10,Edmonton Airport customer review,Great airport. Ideal if you are connecting to the United States. There are lots of services shops and restaurants. Easy to spend time during a connection. The US and Canadian customs are nice and efficient (much nicer than Calgary's dingy space).
24th January 2013,3,Edmonton Airport customer review,Nice New facilities in south terminal. The rest of this review is less complimentary. Even with delayed flights security closes in the afternoon with some delayed flights not departing for 5 hours after security closes. It ruined and ended our trip to Phoenix in Nov 2012. A nightmare after enduring an all day wait for a US Air flight with maintenance issues. Even though we were checked in at the airport 2 hours prior to the original departure time of our flight a US Air employee at the gate instructed security to refuse us admittance. I would suspect that US Air had over booked the flight and had given our seats away even though we checked in 7 hours earlier and had not gone through security yet. Having rules in place that force passengers through security into a lounge area that leaves a lot to be desired is awful service by our airport. Almost everything today with air travel is set up to benefit the airline and the airport financially and the passenger's needs or interest is kicked to the curb. You don't have to think long before accepting the 7.5 hour drive to Great Falls Montana to fly for 1/3 the cost.
19th November 2012,1,Edmonton Airport customer review,Edmonton's International Airport is lacking a lot of international destinations. I find most times easier to drive to Calgary and fly out of there.
11th December 2011,10,Edmonton Airport customer review,Very modern. Arrivals level could be updated. I would expand the arrivals level to the east expand the departures level over the road and build a new road accessing the departure level. Security is efficient and the hold areas are great.
4th September 2011,4,Edmonton Airport customer review,The arrivals lobby looked dated but was clean. The Edmonton Sky Shuttle is a regular bus service that runs from the arrivals lounge to various hotels across the city. It took an hour to get downtown but this may depend on the traffic and number of stops. It isn't the cheapest way to get downtown but there aren't any cheaper alternatives. The departures area is modern and functional. Some staff at the duty free shops seemed miserable a trend I spotted at other Canadian airports. Other than that the airport is fine but I wish they put a direct rail link to the downtown area.
9th March 2010,1,Edmonton Airport customer review,After a delightful vacation to the US myself and my wife were unprepared for the rude unfriendly petty bureaucracy of Canada Customs at the Edmonton Airport. We were treated rudely and treated like petty criminals rather than citizens. Could these customs people possibly smile and welcome you back home? After long tiring flights home it is depressing to have to be treated in such a miserable fashion by customs people who have all the charm of Soviet border guards. These petty bureaucrats with their 5 minutes of power need to be replaced by people who are friendly and welcoming. They are an embarrassment to our City and likely harm this City's business and tourist reputation.
1st September 2009,2,Edmonton Airport customer review,Connected through Edmonton to Calgary from London Heathrow. I was not impressed at all. The departures area is grimy hot noisy and smells like a dirty hotel. The airport is badly signposted and the International Arrivals/Immigration area is a joke. It took almost an hour to clear Immigration - only about 4 CBSA officers and they interrogated everyone as if we were criminals instead of citizens coming home. Next time I'll fly straight to Calgary - they are used to International flights there (obviously get more than 2 a day) and the CBSA agents are efficient.
12th August 2009,4,Edmonton Airport customer review,YEG-YYC return. YEG makes Calgary's airport look like a frumpy bus terminal. What 's with only one restaurant airside in Calgary? Anyone connecting with a choice of either Edmonton or Calgary would be very wise to choose Edmonton International
6th May 2009,3,Edmonton Airport customer review,I think that the airport is overall satisfactory. However I do believe from using YEG Airports Facilities that they should try to make the airport more appealing such as Vancouver International Airport. Nevertheless I do think it's a good enough airport to get the job done. Besides with it's expansion expected in being completed in 2012 they will have a total of 30 gates expanded parking lot office and retail space new control tower more baggage claim carousels etc.
27th February 2009,2,Edmonton Airport customer review,As a resident of Edmonton who often has to travel to Calgary for business the commute to the airport from downtown or any further north is excessive. Frankly when you include the extra time you have to build in for check-in and security it is faster to take the Red Arrow bus service from downtown Edmonton to Calgary northside then take their shuttle to the Calgary airport. The busses are confortable have free wireless internet and plug-ins and there is no need to deal with the miserable Air Canada agents and steward(ess) staff. If I cannot get a direct flight from Edmonton to my destination I prefer taking the bus to Calgary as it is much less troublesome to catch the flight in Calgary. EIA the local airport authority is trying their damndest to completely close the Edmonton City Centre Airport which is much more convenient for business and personal commuter travel from both Calgary and northern Canada forcing people to pay exorbitant taxi fees and spend excessive time in both travel and waiting time. Very poor service yet expensive for an underserviced location with lousy parking and pickup facilities.
26th August 2008,1,Edmonton Airport customer review,"In retort to R Wright R Skermer and Rob McMann comments I have been a business traveler for many years in Edmonton. I used to fly out of the Muni (City Center Airport) and connect in Calgary and Vancouver to my destinations. Since consolidation over 10 years ago I do still have to connect in Calgary or Vancouver to the following destinations but now endure a 45-minute drive. Edmonton International Airport has only one destination in all those cities London. It is much easier to fly direct from Calgary or Vancouver then connecting in London. As I live north of city the ""new freeway"" is still very far from being completed. Their are several over passes/bridges and lanes to be completed so it is far from complete. I do not have any complements for the Edmonton International Airport. I find it to be inadequate and lacking in service."
30th July 2008,4,Edmonton Airport customer review,In response to D Scott's comments on the lack of access to YEG. He says the freeway by-passing the city won't be completed for many years. It is actually complete and has been for many months.
22nd July 2008,4,Edmonton Airport customer review,The facility is not that far out and actually commiserate to many airport drives I get throughout North America. It is clean efficient friendly and probably the easiest airport to get in and out of that I have experienced in a long time. I actually look forward to using it when I travel. I get a choice of Delta Northwest Air Canada Westjet Horizon United US Air and a gaggle of smaller and charter airlines. As the numbers grow and the $1 billion expansion takes hold this place will continue to explode with activity. I am as happy as a clam that I no longer have to use Calgary as a connection point to get anywhere. This airport has the directs to where I need to go and single connections at US and other Canadian hubs for the other destinations that are not direct. This facility has made the reality of re-locating back to Edmonton possible. Now for more post- security non Cara amenities please.
12th June 2008,4,Edmonton Airport customer review,Daily scheduled service to US cities from YEG: Chicago Denver Minneapolis Salt Lake City Phoenix Las Vegas Los Angeles San Francisco Seattle. Mexico City daily scheduled European: London. Travel to airport from north side - via completed ring road to St Albert Trail - not many years away completed.
21st May 2008,3,Edmonton Airport customer review,I've flown in anD out of Edmonton for a number of years. The last time I noted that the airport on both sides is very cramped for space. Mr Scott is correct in saying that it is best to catch international flights in Calgary. The airport is a distance from the city. For a city that has a metro population of over one million this airport does not meet its needs. All be it Calgary is a hub city and Edmonton is not. Looking at the statistics it is apparent that Edmonton's air traffic is growing. Over all though Edmonton International is a clean facility with good to excellent amenities.
20th May 2008,1,Edmonton Airport customer review,"Just reiterate for K Lucht benefit. I stated that American Continental United and Delta do not fly into Edmonton. Had they bothered to read the next sentence I mentioned that ""United and Delta do fly the regional carriers in"" These are small 50-70 passenger regional jets. The seasonal flights they speak of are charters. Not schedule flights. Recently Zoom Airlines have pulled out of Edmonton as well. The point of going to Calgary was the cheaper and better selection of flights available."
15th May 2008,4,Edmonton Airport customer review,It is well laid out and things are generally close together avoiding the requirement to walk vast distances to get to/from your gate. There are good amenities available once you're past security if you want to get something to read or something to eat. And the Air Canada lounge at Edmonton is very nice indeed -- definitely the place to be if you have to spend a few hours between flights. The airport is a way out of Edmonton proper and getting there involves a slow drive through downtown if you're from the north side. Also in my most recent trip there it took about forty minutes to get through the security checks. I had allowed what should have been plenty of time before my flight boarded but it ended up being barely enough. I don't know if my experience is the normal situation but if it is the security facilities and staff should be beefed up to handle the amount of traffic.
5th May 2008,4,Edmonton Airport customer review,Not sure what D Scott or S Petersen are talking about. US Airways Horizon Northwest United and Delta all serve the airport. International destinations include Punta Cana Mexico City London and seasonal Amsterdam and Frankfurt service. These are in addition to other destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. The airport though small is clean and efficient and Edmonton Airports is working to improve the shopping and food options throughout the airport. A 180 mile drive to Calgary would not make sense for most travelers.
26th February 2008,1,Edmonton Airport customer review,Quiet and small is how I would describe Edmonton International Airport. It is a bit of a drive from the north side of the city. They are building a new freeway to avoid driving through the city but it will not be completed for many years so you are looking at least an hour drive. Hardly any flights going to major US cities. Small regional jets fly most of these. Not served by American Continental United or Delta although United and Delta do fly the regional carriers in. As far as International flights to Asia or Europe best go to Calgary or Vancouver. Air Canada has only one flight to London and that’s it. I do find the Airport Improvement Fee a joke. $15.00 added to my ticket for what? A few restaurants and no parking.
15th February 2008,5,Edmonton Airport customer review,Recently connected in Edmonton while doing Vancouver-Fort McMurray and back. Airport was clean modern and busy! Shops are limited understandable due to it's size. Staff were friendly and the terminal had a nice open feel to it. Edmonton is much easier to connect in compared to Calgary because it's simply more customer friendly and it makes these long day trips less stressful!
12th February 2008,1,Edmonton Airport customer review,Not much of an airport. Very few international flights (one to be exact). Located far from downtown Edmonton almost a 45-minute drive. Found it easier to drive or fly further south to Calgary where flights were cheaper and much more abundant. Airport was not crowded a least. May have to do with lack of flights.
28th February 2007,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,I connected here while flying between London and Vancouver on Air Canada. Very nice airport! Staff were very nice and helpful. Airport is spotless and very modern. Maple Leaf Lounge was great even better then some airlines' hub's lounges! Overall an excellent experience. I will fly through Edmonton again if the direct flights to Vancouver are full and who knows I might even want to make a stop here!
15th November 2006,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,I recently flew into YEG after not flying there for several years. The expansion project is now complete and the airport looks great. It is airy and functions well. However all flights to the U.S. clear US customs at the airport prior to landing in the U.S. This works well except that if you arrive early you are made to wait in US customs waiting area that has too few seats. Most people had to stand for the 45 minute wait. The duty free shop is somewhat limited so that is only worth a five minute distraction. Once you clear customs you are also restricted to a certain set of gates and you are not free to wander the airport. There is only one little food shop with outrageously priced food ($7.50 for a small sandwich). So for US bound passengers you are segregated from the rest of airport with very few services which is really too bad as the rest of the airport is great.
12th September 2006,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,I often travel into and out of YEG and never have I had a negative experience there. The decor is beautiful and it has a wonderfully open feel to it. It's the only airport I've ever been to where if you've travelled on a domestic flight you collect your luggage in the public arrivals hall. I'm happy to see that Air Canada is beginning flights to London out of YEG this fall. It's about time there's a scheduled service between Edmonton and Europe. Hopefully Frankfurt will soon be added making it easier for Star Alliance passengers flying with Lufthansa. If there's one thing that could use improvement at YEG it's install more automatic check-in machines as the queues seem to be continually growing larger.
12th May 2006,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,I fly through YEG very often. On the plus side it's easy to get around and the public areas are clean and comfortable and for me the ice cream sandwich vending machine is a nice touch. On the minus side the washrooms are almost alway filthy. The $40+ cab ride to downtown is quite the hit as well when they shut down the muni they talked about an Edmonton Express Transit Bus but that was a no show they talked about increased capacity and frequency of Skyshuttle but that doesn't seem to have materialized either.
6th March 2006,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,I'd certainly echo all the positive comments on the ambiance of Edmonton International. The decor including the beautiful forests and fields surrounding it the air quality natural lighting and remarkably polite/efficient staff all contribute to the atmosphere accentuating the excellent layout and organisation of the building itself. Indeed I feel it contains the most comfortable terminal space I've yet experienced. On its less than strong points It would be improved with more restaurants and it really needs better service to Europe.
30th June 2005,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,Edmonton International Airport is a wonderful mid-sized facility. After its expansion and renovation the airport now sports a brilliantly clean modern open and airy look that is refreshing after coming off a long flight. 3-story atriums with vaulted ceilings and floor-ceiling windows mark the wide and rarely-crowded departure halls. Services at the airport are also impressive for a facility of its size with many good shops and restaurants and great touches like an observation deck free power outlets and desks for those with a laptop. I also like this airport for its lack of crowds (with exception to the mornings). Compared to the maddening masses at the big hubs Edmonton is one airport which has actually not maxed out its capacity yet but has in fact already built to accommodate further growth. The only downside is the distance to the city. A taxi can cost over C$40 (US$32) though there are shuttles which charge less than half that and when push comes to shove it very rarely takes over 35 minutes to get downtown.
20th July 2004,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,I was through Edmonton Int'l Airport a few weeks ago for the first time in about 8 months. I was shocked at the improvement. It is extremely well-lit and spacious. Very easy to clear security and move around post-security. The only things lacking were decent shops and amenities. But for a small airport they're certainly adequate.
27th April 2004,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,I was slightly apprehensive about centralizing security for both terminals but have been pleasantly surprised. The security check is actually quicker than it used to be and the boarding area is inviting and comfortable with some nice shops and services. (Love the fireplace!) Just one thing for the whiners who insist there's only room for one international airport in Alberta - could you please try to cite a reputable source in the future?
26th February 2004,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,The new Edmonton International terminal is beautiful but comes at a price of $15 added to your domestic airline ticket (the taxes on air travel in this country are absolutely ridiculous). The terminal has a lovely fireplace area is spacious and welcoming. AC check in kiosks are great wonder why more people don't use them and stand in a line instead? Security was quick and friendly and they did an explosives test on my backpack and wanted to know my personal info. (kind of alarmed me). Luckily the airport has retained a viewing area although it is not as wonderful as the one in the older terminal. Shops and restaurants abound.
27th November 2003,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,The new terminal is spectacular. Also very efficient. The number of flights and usage of the airport is increasing (unlike Calgary or Vancouver) hence the time is just right for a new terminal.
14th September 2003,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,The new terminal in Edmonton is very pleasant. One wonders however why this terminal was necessary as it seems completely underused. Just because a new terminal is built does not mean that the flights will come. There is only room for one airhub in Alberta and that is Calgary (unfortunately). The security is admirable to the point of ludicrous.
10th September 2003,n/a,Edmonton Airport customer review,I recently visited Edmonton International Airport when I was travelling up north from the United States. I was presently surprised by this modern airport and the ease of moving from the passenger terminal to the car rental facilities. Compared to other airports I have visited in Canada and the United States Edmonton's had a very up scale feel to it. I wish there were more flights operated out of this airport.
5th January 2022,3,"""rip off charge £5 to be dropped off""","✅ Trip Verified |  Travelled to Lanzarote in December 12, will not be travelling again until covids over.  This covid form, that covid form, proof you booked a test on your return, passenger locator form etc, etc. Found out at check in we had filled in a locator form for the wrong country but got a great deal of help from an employee (called Peter) on his own phone when ours ran out of battery filling in  forms. Then he led us through customs to the flight lounge (fast tracked us basically). So i would recommend the staff and their excellent service. One thing I thought was a rip off was being charged £5 to be dropped off outside the terminal - we were all of 30 seconds. They even made it so you had to pay after 24 hours later (not now) so that you can forget about it with all that's going on and they earn more money from the fine you get."
11th November 2021,4,"""very few immigration employees"" ","✅ Trip Verified |  Departures was quick and fine, full of automation. However, arrivals was the opposite of quick. Very opposite. We landed at 10:50am and been in line for Passports until 12:20pm The issue was not that there was a lot of pax, but a very few immigration employees. Only 2 counters working."
25th October 2020,8,"""there was no queue or rather very little queue at security""","✅ Trip Verified | We used, Gatwick North Terminal for our departure to Corfu with TUI Airways. It was nice to that the restriction which everyone has come accept as the normal. The check in/bag drop queue people were self distancing and were aware of the rules of having to show your passenger locator form for Greece at the desk. Given the passenger footfall in the terminal there was no queue or rather very little queue at security so it was a good start to the trip. Most of the outlets are not taking cash payment and in some of the food outlets its order on the app the limit the contact with staff. At the boarding gate we were boarded in seat row order and this took about 20 minutes. There was or seemed to be extra time allowed to find the board gate. Our arrival back into Gatwick was a late evening one, the only queue seemed to be at the entrance to the Border Control where people had forgotten to obtain their passenger locator form. The two Border Force office's on the control point were friendly and polite and able to help passengers whose phones were not smart one. Most of the Epass gates were open and working so this made the experience easy and quick. By the time we had cleared the passport control thee bags were arriving in baggage reclaim."
9th September 2020,4,"""what a dismal experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Our first flight out since March and I wasn't quite prepared for what a dismal experience LGW would be. The main place for food and drink on the ground floor was Wetherspoons which had a queue of about 70 people. We could never have used it with the time available. The best we could find was Pret et Manger which at least sold wine and you could sit in the unopened Yo Sushi restaurant. For London's second airport it was a second division offering, especially compared to DUS where we flew back from. We deserve better, and they should offer better if we're ever going to start flying again as usual."
11th February 2020,10,"""Couldn't do enough for us""","✅ Trip Verified | Had great experience with security team this morning when my dad had an angina attack while in the queue. Couldn't do enough for us, got dad stable and took him to gate, very understanding, very professional. Can't believe some of the negatives you hear, think they just have a tough job to do."
4th January 2020,9,"""terminal was not busy""",Not Verified | The airport parking is not a nightmare and the terminal was not busy. I got through security in under 45 minutes. The terminal is a clean space and me and my son saw lots of different aircraft.
1st January 2020,1,"""terrible facilities for children""","Not Verified | I am writing to review the terrible facilities for children at Gatwick north terminal. I travelled alone with my 2.5-year-old 6 months ago, and at this time the children's area was being reconstructed. They were able to offer absolutely nowhere for young children to play, or a place to heat up and serve food to a toddler. They promised that the new children's area would be finished by the end of the year. We are travelling again tomorrow, and have just found out that there is still no children's area or place to heat/serve food. To me it seems completely unbelievable that such a major airport can offer no facilities at all to families with young children for such a long period of time. For the many families travelling through it must be a very stressful experience, and I know that I myself am dreading having to spend a few hours at the airport with an active 3-year-old. Much smaller airports manage to have great, free facilities for kids, and I find it unacceptable that Gatwick North terminal is so lacking in this way."
31st December 2019,3,"""we were overwhelmed by her rudeness""",✅ Trip Verified | Most rude security! Traveled from Schiphol airport to UK with the same quantities of bottles with permitted liquids. But at Gatwick a female security worker gave us the most rude treatment we have ever got in a foreign airport! She let us throw a couple of the liquids! How can that be? She even made a rude remark! We are not arrogant or rude people ourselves so we were overwhelmed by her rudeness! Non of the security workers in the line we were standing had joy in their work. If you don’t want to do this job than quite your job! The waiter of the Jamie Oliver restaurant who served us today was the only nice person we met at Gatwick. But for us never again Gatwick!
27th December 2019,2,"""Worst for immigration waiting time""",✅ Trip Verified | Worst for immigration waiting time. The “All passport” line is the last: 1 person attending with full verification needed of “all passport”. 1hour 30 waiting.
24th December 2019,1,"""Never again flying from Gatwick""","Not Verified | I will avoid flying from Gatwick North Terminal in the future. The chaos started once the went off the cab. It was heavily raining but there is no roof/shelter to protect you (and your kids) from getting wet while going off the taxi. We were struggling to find the check-in desk because there is a lack of indication. The security control was like a nightmare, very unfriendly staff with very poor manners and a complete mess. Not a single person organising the queues. Right after the control, you don't have another choice but to land in a shopping centre and have to zigzag through shops and aggressive staff trying to sell you perfume and alcohol, this can take up to 5 min to complete. We arrived at the airport 2.30 hours before the departure at 6.00 am but we had no time to have breakfast as we were all the time waiting on queues for everything. We crossed the boarding gate and had to wait 30 min with no seats available even for pregnant women. Once we were in the plane had to wait another hour until our flight number was given a slot to take off, this is also easyJet's fault as they rarely are on time. Never again flying from Gatwick."
19th December 2019,4,"""I won't be rushing back""",Not Verified |  I won't be rushing back. First time at Gatwick though I fly to and from UK every 2 weeks. Pre check in downstairs south terminal devoid of seating. Very little flight information. Once through security I thought I had entered a shopping centre and not an airport. Gave the impression of a posh shopping centre that may have a few flights tagged on. Shop signage so big and intrusive that the meagre signs relating to the purpose of the place totally drowned out. Saw several people in genuine panic as could not find signs to gates etc They need to remember the primary reason we go here and not just create an experience to syphon as much money out of people as possible. Will avoid if I can in the future.
17th December 2019,1,"""I am actively going to avoid it""","Not Verified |  Oh my goodness, I used to like to travel from Gatwick. Now I am actively going to avoid it. Poor security experience, queue after queue for everything. Poor food outlets with sky high prices. Treats passengers as cash cows or cattle."
8th December 2019,1,"""Terrible airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Terrible airport. Always bad. I have just waited 60 minutes for the plane to park at a gate due to gross incompetence of the airport. This airport should be permanently banned from any expansion plans, due to their incompetence."
19th November 2019,1,"""Very poor rating""","Not Verified |  Had to arrive and depart from Gatwick airport. Been to many airports in the world and never have I experienced such unfriendly staff especially at customs. I made the trip from Canada last minute for a funeral landing at Gatwick then connecting to Scotland. Didn’t have to go through customs in Gatwick upon arriving only in Scotland. On my return journey to Canada I did. Here this very unfriendly officer informed me I needed a card to show I had a pacemaker which I knew nothing about. I explained that I had been through Canadian and Scottish customs and was not asked for it. He replied, I don’t care what Canada or Scotland does this is our rules. His mannerism was terrible, never experienced this ever. Told me to sit while an officer came, took me to a room to search me. Felt like a criminal. He certainly didn’t win a certificate for politeness. Certainly not the way to treat people visiting the country. Will never fly into that airport again. Many issues there talking to other passengers reassured me, something has to be done there. Very poor rating."
15th November 2019,1,"""The whole building looks tired""",Not Verified |  Is Gatwick the worst airport in the world? Silent airport with no seats with visibility of the departure board. Same old same old overpriced rubbish in all the shops. All the cafés and foodstops are upstairs with a horrible claustrophobic feel to them. Again with no view of the departure boards. Have they forgotten their purpose? It's an airport. It's a place to catch flights not a place to buy the latest fashion at vastly overinflated prices (even more so than the normal ridiculous fashionista prices). The whole building looks tired. Knock it down and distribute the flights between 'regional' airports I will go out of my way to not fly to or from Gatwick ever again.
31st October 2019,3,"""airport is so family unfriendly on arrival""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is so family unfriendly on arrival. The passport control queues for families is always massive. There were people with small babies in their arms having to wait more than 30 minutes to get through passport control. It would be so simple to do like other countries and put a cue for families with children under 2 years old, instead of putting them together with adults and older children that can wait for longer. The alternative would be to hire more staff, at 9 pm on a Monday there were 6 out of the 28 passport control booths working. This is a service we pay for when we fly via gatwick, its not done for free, so I would expect much better service."
28th October 2019,2,"""an hour in the passport control""",Not Verified |  Awful! We landed and had to wait 15 mins for someone to give the light signal so we could park the plane. We had to then wait for about half an hour for staircase to be brought to us. And then about an hour in the passport control. Awful!
22nd October 2019,3,"""lack of communication2","Not Verified |  We had booked assisted travel on our flight and the girl that came to help us was brilliant, having cleared security we entered the area for us to be picked up from and were given our tag to tell us when we be called, great I thought, when our tag went off everything was going well until the guy in the buggy told me he could not transport me as the buggy was full. I asked him which gate gate we were going from which was gate right over the the other the end and would take me 10 mins to walk to and it was a good 10 mins. Duly arrived at the gate expecting my wife to turn up in the buggy - passengers were starting to turn up for the the flight no sign of my wife. She had the bag with our boarding passes in passports. Was getting concerned where she was there were only handful of passengers left. Luckily there was a supervisor there and explained what was going on, he checked and said they had gone straight to the plane and took my name and came back with my boarding pass and passport. I was the last one to get on, not good enough, she did laugh, but it’s hard enough making sure she is ok without having to worry about getting on the flight. She said 2 lifts were out of order and they had obviously taken the scenic route. I realise it is a busy airport, but think you need to address the situation when partner can’t travel with them especially when they don’t turn up at the gate. Talk to each other just to tell people what is going on, lack of communication, it’s hard enough, please get it sorted"
17th October 2019,9,"""lovely efficient airport""","✅ Trip Verified | A lovely efficient airport. Great signage, super shuttle between terminals, easy electronic passport control, efficient security clearance, free newspapers/magazines in hallways leading to gates, fantastic rail connections and a good Wetherspoons in Terminal 1. My only complaint is the duty free perfume gauntlet passengers must endure between security and the waiting area."
14th October 2019,6,"""lack of well-known British politeness""","Not Verified |  Did I really arrive in England? Passport Control very full. Young female employee shouting at passengers in a heavily accented voice ""Keep moofing. Do not stop in the queue."" It felt like I was in an Eastern European police state. A ""please"" or thank you"" would have made all the difference. Goodness knows what visitors from overseas would have made of the lack of well-known British politeness."
7th October 2019,1,"""feels as if you are being punished for being here""","Not Verified |  Worst airport I have ever been to! Lack of seating before check in and tons of people sleeping on the floor due to this (this is at a time when the airport was not even busy). Lack of hotels as well. It is also freezing in October! No heating in the airport, just cold air. It basically feels as if you are being punished for being here. I thought for a moment I was on a hidden camera prank show, how could a place like this exist. Staff are incredibly rude and deceptive. There's a reason it's rated the second worst airport in the world! Filthy and disgusting. I do not recommended especially if you have a lay over, pay the extra and have your lay over somewhere else if you have to, otherwise it will be one of the biggest regrets of your life as it was mine."
4th October 2019,1,"""Filth and dirt everywhere""","✅ Trip Verified | In my opinion the worst airport terminal in the UK. Everything designed to make travel through it as unpleasant as possible for passengers: Outbound - Enforced twisting and turning and elongated Ikea style path through fragrances and drinks retail - the only way through to departures. No free drinking water - or if it's there I couldn't find it. Not a single working usb charging socket in departure lounge, and only 1 working out of 6 at the final gate. Dirt and filth everywhere. WHSmith up to their old tricks of demanding UK boarding cards from unknowing shoppers. Hugely overpriced food (Jamie's Lasagne: £13.99!) Inbound: Far too long waiting for luggage - flight arrived 4.15am, first bags arrived 40 mins later, and this was the only flight to be handled. Filth and dirt everywhere, dust oozing from metal wall panels, filthy ceilings. Baggage reclaim toilets stank of stale urine. Welcome to Britain - The whole place needs a damn good clean."
22nd September 2019,5,"""being pleasant doesn’t cost anything""","Not Verified |  I don’t fly very often so I find it very stressful when I do, I found the security staff very rude and condescending which made my stress levels even higher, being pleasant doesn’t cost anything. I didn’t like the way passengers have to walk through the duty free shops to the seating area. It has been 3 years since I last was in this airport and it could be at least the same length of time before I’m back through it again!"
18th September 2019,2,"""Lack of signs""","Not Verified |  Lack of signs, couldn't find carpark ticket machine. When in Departure hall lack of sign for Arrival floor, only found one once in lift? Car park was very expensive, £13.00 for for just over an hour? I was picking a friend up."
11th September 2019,3,"""Far too overcrowded""","Not Verified |  Far too overcrowded. Family friendly security zone was a joke with long queues and very little space. It would have been quicker for us to go the usual route. Very frightening for a 2 year old who incidently was frisked. Overcrowded, overpriced food outlets. Lounge at departure gate did not have the seats for everyone so due to a two hour delay we were sat on a dirty floor"
4th September 2019,7,"""A lesson in customer service would not go amiss""","Not Verified |  The security staff were brilliant, very friendly and helpful. The same cannot be said for the jobsworth older gentleman on gate 54 this evening. Had he tried really, really hard he may of managed to be even more condescending. A lesson in customer service would not go amiss."
3rd September 2019,3,"""Terminal is completely overcrowded""","✅ Trip Verified | We traveled in and out with TUI on a tour to Sicily with an independent specialist tour company. Having used the South Terminal many times this was our first time travelling from the North Terminal for a number of years, we found it to be the worst airport terminal we have travelled from for many years. It is dire place, having experienced many modern Asian Terminal buildings, this was worse than any so called third world countries. The Terminal is completely overcrowded, it lacks decent food facilities there is a lack of seating and in my opinion it is filthy. Finally we found it old fashioned and not fit modern day air travel."
22nd August 2019,1,"""This place for sure earns up its 4/10 review""","Not Verified |  Worst airport ever. I’ve travelled to various airports across continents and have encountered varying customer service quality. Gatwick, however, is a totally different story. Staff made you throw out all liquid item (under 100ml) and did not give you a chance to reorganize items into the plastic bag. After I’ve decided to simply purchase another checked bag to avoid my items being thrown away, the lady literally said “it was such a waste of time.” Outrageous! Will definitely avoid traveling to, from, or even passing by this airport. This place for sure earns up its 4/10 review!"
16th August 2019,9,"""40m to disembark the plane""",✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport ever. Waited 40 min to disembark the plane. The reason - no steps available. Have you ever heard of such a lame excuse?
16th August 2019,1,"""Couldn’t disembark flight""",Not Verified |  Couldn’t disembark flight at gate due to a set of steps being left in front of the gate and had to wait 1hr 20 for bags. No reason given by the airport or their contractor Menzies.
2nd August 2019,1,"""shambles of an airport""",❎ Not Verified | Absolute shambles of an airport. Staff are inept and need basic training. Why oh why does it take so long to get back on to the UK. Other countries do it why not the UK?
4th July 2019,9,"""the best of the large airports in the world""","Not Verified |  Gatwick is probably the best of the large airports in the world. The security checks are fast, there is great food, shops and plenty of seats and screens telling you where your flight is due. There are numerous signs telling you how long it will take to walk to your gate, also the wifi is great. Some things could be improved: Like many airports you need to walk through the duty free shop to get to the main seating area - The water / bottle refill stations are hidden near the toilets - The outside area is a little confusing as it is on multiple levels and could do with better signage, lower level for pick up and generally upper for drop off. It is one of the airports that you really do not need a lounge pass."
30th June 2019,1,"""I'll avoid wherever possible""","✅ Trip Verified | Airport dirty. Being forced through shops after security is ridiculous. North terminal simply not designed/able to cope with the number of passengers making it hard to move around let alone purchase anything. Was there for breakfast. Choice so limited, long queues for any option leading to staff struggling to cope. I fly most weeks but out of Heathrow. A vastly superior experience there. Fly from Gatwick north every few months and this airport is definitely in decline. I'll avoid wherever possible."
26th June 2019,3,"""really needs to do better""","✅ Trip Verified | The staff from OCS do not seem to understand that some passengers may be disorientated after a flight, and they show no understanding of the stress caused to passengers when they are unable to get through an e-gate. I was told rather abruptly “So, do you want to see a guard then?” Not very professional! Emerged from arrivals at South Terminal, and looked for signage to Long Stay Car Park buses. I could not see any clear directions, except for a reference to the Upper Concourse. I am not familiar with South Terminal, so this meant nothing to me. I proceeded to the nearest Information Desk, which at 14.45 on Saturday 22nd June was unattended. Welcome to Britain! Eventually found the Upper Concourse, and went to wait for a bus at a spot which seemed like, in the absence of any bus stop, the place to wait. There were other passengers waiting. The bus came at 3.01 pm, and drove straight past all the waiting passengers, so we all had to haul our bags just a little bit further. Unacceptable! After exiting the Long Stay car park, after emerging from Eastway, it is completely unclear which lane is required to access the M23. I ended up in a lane for KFC Drive-thru, managed to get out of it and ended up going back past the Log Stay Car Park entrance and the Hilton Hotel and eventually managed to get to the M23 J9A. Gatwick really needs to do better."
26th June 2019,1,"""Sort it out Gatwick""",Not Verified |  Passport control machines are a joke. Very good for safety reasons however have more staff working on the machines to get more people through! You spend half your time waiting in the queue to be sent to another queue because your passport doesn’t work on the machine! Not what you need after long haul flights! Sort it out Gatwick.
8th June 2019,7,"""Good train service from London""","✅ Trip Verified |  Good train service from London, I think it's accessibility from London is good and takes only 35 mins from London bridge. Staff was a bit unhelpful when asked for any place to print outs and there are none after security check."
8th June 2019,1,"""Horrible airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible airport. Security mocked us for holding onto our passports like ""our damn lifeline"" and once you get through that mess you walk for 5 minutes through perfume land. My family and I all have bad allergies to scents so that perfume ridden shop made us uncomfortable for our upcoming 9 hr flight. This airport has almost no seating. Also, in the over 20 airports I've been through, I've never seen such disorganized gates. We didn't know where our gate was until it was posted minutes before boarding. Once all passengers knew their gate it was like a heard and we were all lined up and barely had time to use washrooms before boarding. I will never fly through this airport again. Go to the Heathrow airport, it's 100x better."
25th May 2019,3,"""drove me back to the main seating area""","Not Verified |  North Terminal - who thought it was a good idea to build ""kids zone"" play area right next to ""quiet zone""? The constant screeching of children drove me back to the main seating area. I appreciate that there's a lot of work going on at the moment and maybe there will be a real ""quiet zone"" when it's finished. I hope so."
21st May 2019,1,"""We waited and waited and waited""
","Not Verified |  My wife needed wheelchair assistance to the plane. Everything was very professional, up to the last waiting area before boarding. We were informed that someone would collect my wife at 2.10 pm, allowing all passengers who need wheelchair assistance to board first. We were flying with Norwegian to Tampa Florida. The flight departing at 3.10 pm. We waited and waited and waited, on 3 occasions we were informed that a wheelchair would be coming. The last time I went to the customer service desk area, a very rude, obnoxious and uncaring person, basically asked me not to bother her and wait. By then we had 20 minutes before departure, so I collected our carry on bags, and my wife with the aid of a walking stick made our own way to the plane. This was a very stressful situation. Other passengers who need assistance beware."
19th May 2019,1,"""A lack of seating""","Not Verified |  This is one of the most horrible airport experiences. A lack of seating, the hottest airport ever, expensive and poor quality catering outlets. There is really nothing positive to say."
11th May 2019,1,"""2 of our 4 suitcases arrived""","Not Verified | Arrived from Doha on Qatar Airways. Only 2 of our 4 suitcases arrived on the carousel. After a 45 minute wait we were told that there were no more to come and our cases must still be in Doha. We went to the Global Shipping Desk (I think that was there name) and they gave us a claims form to complete Half way through we were told that our cases were now on Carousel 5. We ran down there but no bags. I asked staff to go and find the baggage handling supervisor but they refused. After another 30 minutes we were told that they were not on the flight after all. I told staff that we had a train to catch and couldn't wait any longer and that they would have to send my luggage on to me in Cornwall. They refused again and said that I would have to go back to London to collect them. Suddenly, whilst we were arguing the cases arrived after about an hour and a half."
22nd April 2019,9,London Gatwick Airport customer review,"✅ Trip Verified | I want to thank an on duty Police Officer and the local Vicar for their help in assisting me in finding my iPad which had been left by mistake in security. They were able to gain access back through security for me to retrieve said item. Travelling alone is a difficult enough experience, but this really was frightening, the two of them leapt in to action to help me and thankfully we found it without the need for further investigations. It could have been a very different outcome without their help and I want to say how grateful I am and hope that you will be able to trace the people concerned from the date, time and flight number on my boarding pass as I would like to commend them and pass on my gratitude."
9th April 2019,10,"""outstanding customer service""","Not Verified |  I was travelling with two buggies and all my luggage, and a terminal manager assisted me by helping me push one of the buggies all the way to the departure check in. He provided outstanding customer service! I don’t know what I would have done without him!"
23rd March 2019,1,"""advice is to avoid Gatwick North""","✅ Trip Verified | Well the North Terminal is one step away from the low standards which Stansted fail to achieve daily. The Border force had 10 of the epass gates closed or out of service resulting in queues at the 3 manned EEU gates. Some person who is not customer facing decided not to use the aircraft stands nearer the main area and park the easyJet flights next to the A380 from Dubai, compounded the problem at the border with the lack of gates open. Maybe the airport management should stick to playing with a Lego City airport as they seem to be totally unable to operate a real airport. I have never seen a member of a railway station staff open the barriers and wave people straight though the barrier. Maybe its a plan to exact excess fares from people at the other end. My advice is to avoid Gatwick North unless you want to see how poor the country has become."
1st March 2019,2,"""airport has gone seriously downhill""","✅ Trip Verified |   This airport has gone seriously downhill. It is very much catering for the budget market these days (EasyJet have an entire floor for check in) and even Virgin desks are largely replaced by inefficient unmanned check in robots. The duty free hall is like a really bad (cramped) IKEA experience and don’t even get me started on the weatherspoon bar! My advice, if you can fly from Heathrow for an extra £50, pay it and go there instead!"
22nd February 2019,4,London Gatwick Airport customer review,"Not Verified |    Depressing airport. No atmosphere, and the food is awful, especially Jamie's Restaurant. A very confusing Commercial mix, with no concept definition."
13th February 2019,1,"""Border of control the rudest""",Not Verified | Border of control is one the rudest I have seen in my life. So many silly stupid questions that did not lead to anywhere. I'm American citizen and the guy was having a fit because I did not have a flight number on the landing card. He also asks me the reason for my visit which I explained and then was told that's not right. I was asked 4 times if I was going to be there less than a week like what am I going to in your country mate? Asked how much I make a month ? And how do I afford to travel? If I was on leave? What's my occupation? After all these questions he said I could come to their country. That was my welcome to London.
25th January 2019,2,"""Staff were helpful and courteous""",Not Verified |  We arrived from Tenerife late at night family + infant and found no airbridge being used (saving fees?) so we trecked up dirty stairways along dirty dull coloured hall ways with ambiguous signage. Eventually to immigration where we have to fill out forms because the airline hadnt bothered to hand them out. Staff were helpful and courteous. Pass through the sad duty free shopping eventually escape. This must be one of the crummiest airports we've been anywhere in the world.
8th January 2019,1,"""Avoid it at all costs if you can""","✅ Trip Verified | I am a 30 year old female, I have traveled before and have never been treated like this. The staff at this airport are awful, rude, uneducated and just mean! Avoid it at all costs if you can. I suffer from panic attacks and agoraphobia (basically irrational fear / flight-or-fight mode, especially in open crowded places, triggered by stress), thanks to them I suffered a severe attack and even when I told them I was having one they didnt care and kept treating me rudely. I was left in tears and humiliation. Totally awful experience. And as I said I'm a regular traveler."
2nd January 2019,2,"""one of the worst airports in the world""",✅ Trip Verified | Gatwick Airport has to be one of the worst airports in the world! It is on a par with Miami International Airport which I now refuse to fly to even for connecting flights. Once we had landed in the North Terminal it took us one hour and twenty minutes to collect our bags and connect to the South Terminal as well as having to walk for something like 15+ minutes to reach immigration. The airport is really badly laid out as well with the need to go up and stairs or using escalators several times on the way. The direction signs are poor and not always readily visible. The Fast Track facility was heavily overloaded - it was almost quicker to use the standard facility for your hand luggage control and the staff are not particularly helpful or friendly and the standards seem to change each time one goes through in terms of what needs to be removed from your hand luggage to be controlled separately! Why this is the case is difficult to comprehend. Passage through the airport once one is through immigration etc. is like slaloming on overcrowded ski slopes. Quite frankly there is nothing positive to say about this airport which seems to get worse each time we have to through it! One word of advice is to use Heathrow or London City wherever possible and if you use Gatwick you should avoid taking a connecting flight as with luggage you need plenty of time - probably two hours - particularly if you need to change terminals. To summarize a very frustrating and depressing exercise!
7th December 2018,2,"""airport is dreary""","Not Verified | After using Virgin Atlantic departing from Gatwick South for years now, having to use their new site of Gatwick North was disappointing and I wondered why VA relocated to the North. The airport is dreary, dull, boring and does not have the best shopping experience you have using the South terminal. No wonder I was given vouchers to use the V Lounge as there was really nothing else to do here. For an international departures airport, and I don't include flights to Belfast or Jersey with easyJet, it leaves a lot to be desired. Certainly not looking forward to visiting this airport again."
30th November 2018,1,"""none of the BAA staff cared""","Not Verified |  Arrived with a newborn baby and lots of luggage. Was asked to join a massive queue (I am a British citizen) with no regard to lots of empty lines with passport control staff sitting. I asked 3 times for help to be seen sooner as my baby was heavy to carry, none of the BAA staff cared. Feels like we are in a third world country and that Gatwick customer service is even worse! Disgusting!"
22nd November 2018,2,"""inane setup""","✅ Trip Verified | Why are the seating areas in south terminal unused while we all stand outside in a crammed walkway, inane setup. Can't you guys get your act together."
7th November 2018,4,"""customer service was awful""","Not Verified |  The customer service was awful, when I asked a woman at the desk a question about my flight and how I didn’t know where it was she then told me “it was closed” and proceeded to give me filthy looks and very rudely tell me that the only thing she can do is tell me to get to the gate quickly. I then had to ask again where said gate was and she then told me that it’s my fault and I should have gone earlier. Great way to help someone. When I tried to talk to one of your staff members on my arrival back to England I was rudely ignored after calling twice to be heard."
1st November 2018,10,"""so impressed with the level of attention""","Not Verified |  I was so impressed with the level of attention given when I was traveling with a young person who needed special assistance. I was traveling with a young lady who is blind and selective mute and her mother. The Assistance was so effective and seamless at each point of support given. It was the best special assistance service I have come across at any airport, I felt compelled to make a review. Well done to this amazing team."
30th October 2018,1,"""unhelpful and rude service""",✅ Trip Verified | Incredibility unhelpful and rude service. The epassport control was unable to register the chip in my passport. When I asked the lady at the machines how come the machine could not read my passport which is only one week old I was told to move on and she did not have time for me. She then waved me away. When I asked her to provide the service she was there for and help me understand if anything was wrong with my one week old passport she said she wouldn’t talk to me because I was asking questions she didn’t know the answer to. I had a similar unhelpful experience with the guy at the counter that I later had to talk to. This is the same every time at Gatwick’s arrival gates and I never experience in any other airport. They urgently need training in how to provide customer service. They seem to have forgotten that they work in customer service
22nd October 2018,1,"""disgusting and chaotic facilities""","Not Verified |  Sadly, I have to use the disgusting and chaotic facilities in the South Terminal! It's filthy, and smelly. Not only that, when I have to check-in at one of the airlines I regularly use for this particular journey, (as they no longer use London Heathrow). I have to walk miles to get to the check-in desk, and then walk miles again, and go up an escalator, and another long walk to security. Once I've passed through security, there are another set of escalators to use to go downstairs again, to departures, then you have to walk, round and round the duty free shop. Then, if you want to grab a bite to eat, at one of their restaurants, you have to go up another set of escalators! During the hot summer, when waiting at the gates, it was sweltering, as their air-conditioning wasn't working!! When coming back from a UK domestic flight, and getting off at the front of the aircraft, you walk on a short gangway, and then you have to go down the dangerous stairs (which I nearly tripped up on), to get to the buses to take you to the terminal. On the back of the aircraft you can go down their normal steps! I don't understand the logic in that!. When the bus takes you to the arrivals terminal, you can either climb up loads of stairs or take a lift. Once, the doors were locked too soon,and we couldn't get into arrivals; and the contract workers had to get permission from the permanent staff, to open the doors agaiN. When arriving back into the South terminal, from Europe, you have to walk miles to get to passport control, and once you have finally arrived at passport control, there are long queues!! A lot of the automatic machines are closed! It's a hotch-potch and chaotic airport. Unlike London Heathrow, when I recently flew out of Terminal 3, which is far larger than Gatwick, it was streamlined and well organised. From arriving at departures and going through security, it took me 20 minutes. Heathrow, is cleaner than Gatwick. In my honest opinion, they need to build another terminal there, and knock down the dated, South terminal which is totally chaotic. The airports authority, should go and see how London Heathrow, runs their terminals, and see their designs. The terminal signs and directions are a joke, and they are not very clear, when finding the check-in desks, for a particular airline you are flying with. When trying to find the gates, the signs are very unclear."
18th October 2018,8,"""same great service""","✅ Trip Verified | Asked for assistance for my wife, provided with efficiency and kindness. On departure, collected from the BA Lounge in good time and ensured boarding was easy. On return, despite it being midnight, same great service."
30th September 2018,1,"""Generally dirty and overcrowded""","✅ Trip Verified | One of the worst airport experiences ever. Generally dirty and overcrowded. After security you're forced to walk down a long meandering ""path"" through the duty free shop which stinks of strong perfumes, is overcrowded and noisy. Felt like I was on the road to hell! Security staff were short, impatient and brusque. Made to take shoes off at security - that's ok - but not provided with any seats to sit on to put shoes on again. Paid to get access to an airport lounge (run by a 3rd party company) but this was filled with loud, rowdy parties of drinking lads, so the noisd was intolerable. A most unpleasant start to my journey."
16th September 2018,6,"""airport seems to be overcrowded""","✅ Trip Verified | Although much smaller than London Heathrow, this airport seems to be overcrowded. Just moving from place is difficult and finding a seat in departures can be difficult. Also most restaurants and food outlets are crowded. As far as I am concerned this is not a very pleasant airport. There is of course plenty of Duty Free shops which can hamper your progress."
8th September 2018,9,"""light, airy and spotlessly clean""","Not Verified |  I travelled with my family in August. I had booked Special Assistance and want to say just how fantastic the whole service was, from beginning to end, both outward and return journeys. We travelled early in the morning, the airport was light, airy and spotlessly clean. We were helped to do 'bag check' then taken through security by a very helpful professional member of the special assistance team. We had booked the Aspire Lounge which was lovely and a great start to the journey. On our return, another friendly member of staff met me and took me through baggage reclaim and security. It made my whole flying experience easy, comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable. I had had my doubts about Gatwick Airport but they were thoroughly dispelled. A well run, efficient and welcoming way to fly. Well done to all the staff and management - this airport is certainly going places."
25th August 2018,1,"""terminal was dirty""",Not Verified |  Horrible. The terminal was dirty. Security took ages. Staff were horrlble and all the windows in the bridge and departure lounge was covered or not tranparent! Never using Gatwick again. I'd rather spend more and use Heathrow.
16th August 2018,1,"""Very decrepit and tatty""","Not Verified |  Very decrepit and tatty. Service at the border was very slow and officious (the electronic border gates were not working again). I was unpleasantly surprised to see that the luggage trolleys required a £1 deposit. Unfortunately the single change machine was out of order. The WiFi didn't work. All in all, a very poor level of customer experience. Someone senior should grip this urgently or Gatwick will continue to be of secondary importance to Heathrow as well as a poor reflection on UK Plc."
28th July 2018,4,"""Don't enjoy departing through Gatwick""",Not Verified |  Found the staff at security rude. I waved my Pacemaker card at a staff member as I cannot go through the normal channels. She looked at me and said 'Yeah whats that'! Our gate was called. Gate 22. It was sweltering in the departure area and no air conditioning in the hottest summer since 1976! I thought I would pass out. Don't enjoy departing through Gatwick!
26th July 2018,1,"""Gatwick is not family friendly""","Not Verified | Travelling with kids during start of summer holidays. Was directed to use family assisted check in. They only had 1 attendant. One Check point open considering most people were travelling were families. Family members travelling with me, who used normal check in, went through within 20 mins or so. They managed to get through, eat and rest while we were still in the queue with no movement. One person at the gate checking passport and boarding cards with no urgency. Taking his time casually whilst us pssengers were panicking whether we would make it to our gates on time. Almost every bag being scanned were searched by 3 attendees or so. Creams, food, milk being tested. Gatwick is not family friendly. I would rather pay extra and use Heathrow. Being July, busiest family holiday time, common sense to have more staff to assist the family and special need line. Travelling with kids is challenging enough. Though we arrived at airport way in advance of 3 hours we still had to run for the gates with kids pushchairs and bags at 6am in the morning. This should not be happening at a UK Airport. So disappointing."
25th July 2018,4,"""only use it because I have to""","Not Verified |  The only good thing that I can say about this airport is the help and assistance from the staff who provide the service ""special assistance"" especially the lady who met us on our return and who had only been on buggy duty for 4 days. she could not have been more helpful and is a credit to the assistance team. As for the rest of the airport I only use it because I have to, if there was an alternative I would use it and avoid Gatwick at all costs."
20th July 2018,1,"""people bumping into each other""
","✅ Trip Verified | Overcrowded with people bumping into each other, feels like an American mall on a Saturday only with more shops. This was my first and will be last experience of the S terminal, in comparison with T5 at LHR, like comparing a Butlins holiday resort with an overwater villa in the Maldives. Security was efficient and friendly however gate staff did not have the tools to effect a good job. Long delay leading to cancellation with little to no communication given to customers. No pro active refreshments or information on EU rights was visible nor did staff have any clue as to what customers were entitled to."
18th July 2018,3,"""will avoid Gatwick at all costs""","Not Verified |  While going through security our bags were pushed to the back and searched. The man at airport security was rude and screamed at my 12 year old. He took all our stuff out of our bags, threw it around then dumped it back in the tray all scattered in a mess and told us to leave. There was in fact no reason our bags did not pass security, but this often happens and was not the issue, the staff are rude and I will avoid Gatwick at all costs."
15th July 2018,1,"""staff are rude and awkward""","Not Verified | We all realise that airport security and immigration staff have an important job to do, but the staff at Gatwick are the most rude and awkward in the World. They are also completely disorganised, and they then seem to actually take great pleasure from stressing out people who are already stressed before flying. They have a horrible attitude and as such I will try to avoid Gatwick forever more. Gatwick is also very dirty, especially the toilets. Shameful!"
15th July 2018,9,"""prompt and courteous""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew BA Club Europe to/from Faro, the experience could not have been more pleasant. Asked for and received 'Level 1' assistance which was prompt and courteous, (bit difficult on the return as the aircraft did not park on an air-bridge, but handled well). Have used Gatwick several times recently and since BA moved to the South Terminal always had a stress-free experience."
10th June 2018,1,"""would not recommend""","✅ Trip Verified | We came in to Gatwick and had an 8 hour layover before our EasyJet flight took off. We could not check our bags into EasyJet until 3 hours prior to take off and so had to stay in the north terminal with no chairs, benches, or stores with our luggage. The kind workers at the Nicholas Culpepper Restaurant felt for us and let us use their upstairs area to sit. However this is truly sad that the airport has not been aware of this and provide at least some seating. I would not recommend this to travelers in the future."
25th May 2018,10,"""pleasantly surprised at the efficiency""","✅ Trip Verified | We were pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of this airport. The staff were very friendly, even joking around with us. Really put us at ease as flying can be an anxious experience as it is. We were treated like humans not numbers or cattle. The US customs is the exact opposite. The US customs treat you like a prisoner or a criminal when passing thru. No smiles and no human tendencies. Anyway, Gatwick customs folk get an A from us. We look forward to a stop by to say hello on our way back to Europe. They have a very quick and organized system with lots of staff available to keep our flights safe. The airport in general was very clean and offered easy access to all areas with clear direction.The layout of the airport was very good. Food and shopping offered here was amazing! Duty free staff as well A+ Good job Gatwick! "
17th May 2018,1,"""Grumpy and rude staff""",✅ Trip Verified |  Grumpy and rude staff at Norwegian check in desk. I missed my flight because of their incompetence. There were 7 people working at check in desk but there was only one person available and the rest of them were too busy chatting with each other.
4th April 2018,1,"""slow inefficient staff""","❎ Not Verified |  Gatwick security yet again is cumbersome, draconian, and totally out of touch with most of the world. Massive queues and slow inefficient staff. Much much easier in the USA these days. Had to do a check of my babies water bottle with maybe 200 mls in it. Just all show and no substance."
2nd April 2018,2,"""get ignored and left standing""","✅ Trip Verified | I pay for priority boarding in an attempt to make regular travel through Gatwick to Dublin even remotely bearable. Virtually every time I pass through the passport check to enter the gate I either get ignored and left standing, or encounter a very rude member of staff. This only ever occurs at Gatwick airport, and I find the training of these staff in customer service to be appalling. Also, once you have passed muster with the staff, you are then imprisoned in a room with no toilet facilities whatsoever. The only reason I continue to use Gatwick is its location near where I live in Sutton, although an extended trip to Heathrow might well be worth the effort."
20th March 2018,2,"""staff we encountered were so rude""","❎ Not Verified |  Departure was very efficient with quick turnaround through security and a good range of shops and restaurants. Coming back into the country was awful, the staff we encountered were so rude. We were told to go through the self service machines to check passports and I tried three machines six times and tried to ask for help but the member of staff was so condescending and was talking to everyone like they were stupid. It didn't bother me too much, however I am concerned that this would be the first impression of anyone visiting the UK. I do not expect the staff to be overly friendly as I know they have an important job to do but there is a way to talk to people. To top it off when we were walking though the airport yo get to the exit one of the staff driving the cart to pick up luggage trolleys swore (under their breath) at someone who got in their way. Now I know it can't be fun working at all hours in the day but this was not all nice greeting back to UK!"
2nd March 2018,8,"""Very impressed with the efficiency""","✅ Trip Verified | Used Gatwick South Terminal for my flight to and from Taipei (China Airlines, South terminal). Departure in the evening was easy. My taxi dropped me off outside the terminal and it was a track to reach the departure hall. The first issue is that to get access to the trolley you need to have £1 or €1 coin which is non sense. Check in area was well organised and business passengers have access to the premium security with no queue at all. Even the normal security seemed organised. I was through security in less than 3 minutes. Arrival was also easy. After I left the airplane it was a 5 minutes walk to the immigration. Using e-gate there was no queue in the afternoon when I arrived (3pm). It took me less than 10 minutes from leaving the airplane to clearing immigration, and when I was through the luggage were already waiting in the reclaim belt. Very impressed with the efficiency. I used taxi in both departure and arrival but am aware that there is ongoing issue with the train service."
8th February 2018,8,"""security was pretty easy and quick""","✅ Trip Verified | I took EasyJet, a Low Cost Carrier, for the flight to London as well as for the flight back. The airline is being handled at the north terminal in Gatwick which is not the convenient one. However with the free shuttle service it’s easy to move from north to south terminal outside of the airport. Immigration as well as security was pretty easy and quick as well."
30th January 2018,10,"""the staff helpful and friendly""","❎ Not Verified |  I booked special assistance this year for the first time. I was so impressed, the service is efficient and the staff helpful and friendly even though some people travelling were giving them a hard time. The special assistance service is excellent and I can recommend it to anybody who has mobility or other problems when travelling. The man who drove the buggy to the plane was very friendly and happy and went the extra mile for myself and two other people using the service. One person in the reception area was complaining that they did not come to the lounge to collect them, I just couldn't believe how difficult some people can be. There is no charge for this service and some people are never satisfied. Thank you Gatwick for helping to make travel easier for people with disabilities."
23rd January 2018,2,"""Only one word, atrocious""","❎ Not Verified |  Only one word, atrocious! The airport is run down, overcrowded, confusing and the staff, well they are absolute pathetic! Rude, unhelpful, ignorant and the staff outside just stand around on their phones. The airport is a big joke, needs a massive refurb and whole load of new staff!"
17th January 2018,5,"""not overly impressed""","❎ Not Verified |  I wouldn't call Gatwick my London airport, but it is now my local airport after years of living relatively close to Heathrow. My first visit to the North Terminal, not overly impressed, however the EasyJet self check in worked well, and the security experience was fine. I suspect that midweek mornings in January are relatively quiet, so I imagine if I was reviewing this in high season it would be a different story. Toilets were unclean and some cubicles out of order. To get to departures there is a long walk through Duty Free. There is enough to keep you busy airside, and ample seating. Long walk to gates for departure, too many stairs to get to Baggage Reclaim after landing."
17th January 2018,1,"""needs to educate it's staff""","❎ Not Verified |    This airport needs to educate it's staff in basic manners. Instead of staff being arrogant and obnoxious, they should actually help people, not make personal comments, judgements - when a person says something has gone wrong. Here's an idea: teach your staff to treat people with respect. Please anyone considering flying with this airport, don't. The people who work here lack humanity and your human rights in this place go out of the window when you first enter this horrid establishment."
16th January 2018,1,"""Everything was a mess""","✅ Trip Verified | With absolutly no doubt, LGW is the worst airport I’ve ever seen! (And I can ensure you i’ve seen a lot!). Everything was a mess. Nothing is explained and it was very difficult to go from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2. Was even difficult to find the right check in desk. The airport is confusing and really, really dirty. It’s unacceptable (I think) for an airport with this enormous amount of traffic. There were no smokers lounge inside the terminal and after security check, the only one was outside the terminal, really far from the check in desk. I got a fast track for boarding (I was flying first class), it was absolutly not respected at the boarding. (“First come, first served”). The shops and restaurant were absolutely not good (and very expensive!)."
10th January 2018,2,"""is where your holiday gets ruined""",✅ Trip Verified | London Gatwick Airport is where your holiday gets ruined. It seems like they are vying for 1st place in worst airport staff in Western Europe. The lack of service and respect is beyond comprehension. Some of their staff have nothing to do working in an airport.
2nd January 2018,8,"""I was impressed""","❎ Not Verified |  Came in to Gatwick from Faro and actually, I've better things to say about Gatwick than Heathrow! Landing went smoothly, and the second I entered the Gatwick North Terminal, I was impressed. Carousel area wasn't busy and we found our bags in less than five minutes, and the airport shops were very inexpensive and very clean. Signage could have been better and toilets could have been cleaner, but overall, a wonderful experience."
23rd December 2017,2,"""Stressful experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Gatwick does not connect flights easily like Heathrow does, they make you exit the baggage hall and self transfer terminals and go through security again. Also we had two hours from arrival on Virgin to departure on Aer Lingus and they managed to lose the bags for two days (airlines fault I know). Stressful experience connecting in this airport."
21st December 2017,7,"""it gets the job done""","✅ Trip Verified | This was the first time I was departing from this airport and even though it's an older one, it's not bad. It's not as nice as Heathrow, but it's efficient. Security is well organized and quick and there are plenty of shops and restaurants and when you have to go to your gate it's not far away. So it's not really modern and it doesn't look as nice as Heathrow, but it gets the job done at least for me as economy passenger (I didn't have any lounge access, so don't know about that part of the airport). So I can recommend this as an airport for your journey to and from London, it's just 38 minutes train ride from Victoria station, so pretty quick and it's certainly much better organized than Stansted."
17th December 2017,2,"""announced only 5 minutes before gate closing""","❎ Not Verified |  Waiting in departure for easyJet flight to Malta, the departure gate number was announced only 5 minutes before gate closing! We had to walk 20 minutes from departure lounge to the gate! We have complained to easyJet, and they phoned me back, and they promised to inform Gatwick, accordingly. I have complained to Gatwick airport myself, two times, and never got an acknowledgment, lest a reply! Unfortunately, Gatwick is the nearest airport to the south of UK, but, if this abuse persists, I will have to inform the competent authorities! If you can avoid Gatwick."
28th November 2017,1,"""A shameful shambles""","✅ Trip Verified | A couple of weeks ago I had the misfortune to have to fly out of Gatwick’s North Terminal. On arrival, like in all airports in the world (at least the ones I have visited), I tried to locate a departures board. Only to be told that there were none of these in the main hall and the only ones available were located after the security point! Quite a unique feature, ensuring that one cannot check one’s flight and its status till one is trapped in the departures area! On my return on Sunday, 26 November, on flight EZY8088 from Athens, the staff member meeting the flight, standing at the bottom of the plane steps pointed to a green painted path on the tarmac and told us to follow this to the arrivals hall: this is the only airport these days, in my experience, where passengers have to walk on the tarmac in all weathers to access the arrivals hall, everywhere else there are at least buses to take them there. On arrival to the gate, we had to negotiate a number of flights of stairs unaided. This was very difficult for some rather frail passengers with luggage. There was, of course, no staff around to offer assistance or even ask for anything. When we got to the landing, we found the swing doors there (Gate 49) locked! This resulted in a crush and panic, as more and more passengers were entering this confined space with no exit. A fellow passenger used the emergency phone located there to ask for help. He was told to stay there (!) and that someone would be on their way to unlock the gates. No one arrived and, about 10 minutes later, passengers smashed the emergency release button and eventually unlocked the gates. A shameful shambles at a supposedly major international airport!"
19th November 2017,6,"""Gatwick is greatly improved""","❎ Not Verified |  Did online check in and ""twilight bay check"" the previous evening and stayed at a nearby hotel, which was all fine. Problems started the next day with absolute chaos in Security, which I attribute to general incompetence by management and staff, in that not enough staff were deployed to deal with the volume of passengers. The staff that were deployed only appeared to have English as a second language which made communication in a very noisy, acoustically poor area extremely difficult, made even more difficult by staff issuing contradictory instructions, shouting over each other and at Passengers (who, let's not forget, ultimately pay their wages). A serious, in depth review needs to happen up to, and including, some staff members employment status. Apart from the above, Gatwick is greatly improved, but a few more landslide eating places in the North Terminal would be ggod!"
19th November 2017,2,London Gatwick Airport customer review,"❎ Not Verified |  Everything at the airport was fine as we had checked in online and checked in our baggage the night before. On the morning of departure, security was a shambles. The staff were all talking over each other, countermaning instructions to passengers and generally causing a state of anxiety. Please remember that although staff are there everyday and know what the process is, it’s unlikely that passengers are so familiar. I’m all in favour if enhanced security, but the area delegated is too small for the number of staff and passengers and this leads to passengers being parted from bags and separation of grey boxes so it becomes harder to keep up with what’s happening which adds to the distress. A grown up at the airport would benefit from standing and watching the process to see what is actually happening as opposed to what they think is happening. After security the black sparkly path leads through the duty free, all quite unpleasant, loud and garish and so immediately after the security stress cannot be good for sales. Food outlets in the north terminal are over crowded and shabby. Oh dear what message are we giving overseas visitors. Based on my experience And I’m a Brit...I’d prefer never to travel by plane ever again."
13th November 2017,10,"""a stressful experience""","❎ Unverified |  Had a stressful experience with easyJet regarding my hand luggage I had left on the plane! A safety officer working for Menzies helped me retrieve my bag back that I had left on the flight, he went above and beyond to help me retrieve it back before I boarded my connecting flight. Great asset to the Menzies company and a very helpful member of staff at Gatwick airport which is sometimes hard to come across! Otherwise I would've had to of waited a week while it was held in the forgotten/lost property offices. "
30th October 2017,2,"""Gatwick is to be avoided""","✅ Verified Review |  I arrived on WestJet 001 on October 11th. The airplane was a few minutes early but no marshaller available as I remember from my days operating in to the London airports as a pilot. Nothing new. Then nobody to operate the single jetway. When staff arrived it took three dashes up and down the jetway before he was able to make it work? Then the survival trek to immigration and a 1hr wait in the long lines. I am semi-disabled yet there were no carts at the head of the jetway. I saw one passing and he refused to stop although only carrying one person. On the back it said that the electric cart had to be booked 48hrs in advance. Where the hell did they get that idea from or don't any of the management travel? At Canadian and US airports ""comfortable"", golf carts not plastic boxes, run around the terminals all the time and are normally waiting for any long haul flight. At immigration, once I got to the desk, I found a very pleasant and charming young lady who was most helpful. That young lady was the best part of the trip other than going home again! Then to fight the hoards to get out and find a rent car? The rental car company was the usual rip-off as normal at any UK airport. Would not extend my booking at all but insisted on a new reservation at 6 times the original rate! Now for leaving! Ride the Conga Line through the expensive and hot duty free. What a joke. Then find a seat and try and read the departures board. Who invented those things? I had just passed my First Class pilot medical yet had trouble reading them. Finally the flight was called, WestJet 002, October 24th, to gate 54. On arrival I found a long line already there and no seats outside of the boarding area where agents were in place but not letting people in. I finally asked one agent who was passing what about disabled people and she allowed a few in. Then to the boarding process! No announcement for families with kids, old folk and disabled, just open a barrier and let the hoard rush down the ramp. The good thing about this trip was the arrival in Calgary with pleasant people, electric carts etc. Gatwick is to be avoided and my last trip to Heathrow was a bad."
29th October 2017,1,"""really puts Britain to shame""","✅ Verified Review |  This airport is an abomination. I checked our stroller at the gate from my departure destination but learned upon arrival, infant items checked at the gate are brought to the main luggage area. However, “courtesy prams” are provided. There were no prams anywhere near our gate. When I finally found some, they were metallic seats without any kind of buckle or safety equipment and totally unsuitable for infants. They could be used for a child perhaps age 3 or older – i.e. the kinds who can walk and don’t need the pram! Ironally the prams have a flag on them that says “Family Friendly Gatwick”. Traveling by myself, I had to carry the checked in baggage and my baby for a long walk to Customs, wait in a horrendous lineup through Customs, and then wait in the luggage area before finally retrieving our stroller, which was had bits loose that had separated and were scattered around different parts of the baggage area (literally, at different carousels). Before Customs, we went into the baby change room only to find a filthy toilet and sink – and no baby change table. It appeared to have been removed from the wall. It’s hard to believe this is an airport in a developed country. It really puts Britain to shame, and was a terrible first impression of London."
27th October 2017,3,"""rudest security staff""",❎ Unverified | This must have the rudest security staff of any airport in the world. They shout at you like barrow boys and please or thank you unheard of. These staff need some training in people management. There used to be a board the other side of security to write your comments on I guess it's full up.
26th October 2017,2,"""this airport needs to be demolished""","✅ Verified Review | Even by normal airport standards, Gatwick manages to lower the bar and keep it there. From the 45-minute wait for passport clearance to the noisy, crushing circus of departure, this airport needs to be demolished and rebuilt from the ground up. Our latest experience with the North terminal almost makes me swear off flying forever. We are forced by the airlines and the airport to arrive three hours before a flight, which usually means trying to find a place to sit and maybe have a meal of some kind. The restaurant has about 1 seat available for every 3 patrons. Trying to squeeze through the masses and find somewhere to sit is something I expect at a German beer hall, but not at a major airport. There is only one lift available to the public to get to the mezzanine/restaurant level, and when we were last there it was out of order, meaning we had to schlep our luggage up the stairs. Every restaurant is cramped with seating that is too close to accommodate the throngs of people and baggage. The noise is deafening. But our airline of choice, Wesjet, only flies to Gatwick, so I guess we're stuck."
13th October 2017,4,"""an uncomfortable experience""","❎ Unverified | The long term car park entry was fine, the bus ride to the south terminal worked fine, the check in for Thomas Cook Airlines was open at 4 am and that worked ok. There were no hold ups through security etc. Then it's like entering a madhouse, having to go through duty free, which is a misnomer, there were no daily papers available at WH Smiths and they are still pulling the VAT fiddle about seeing your boarding card, I thought they were going to stop that. They didn't get my boarding card but their lack of staff is a nightmare. The toilets had queues and in the gents there was a lack of toilet paper and almost no hand washing soap. The food is expensive and very little choice, there was a severe lack of seating, altogether an uncomfortable experience, plus being stuck on the plane whilst it waited 40 mins to take off didn't help you relax. Some things you can't do much about, but that fiddle by Smiths on the VAT should be stopped."
9th October 2017,2,"""deteriorating punctuality""","❎ Unverified | Gatwick is operating beyond capacity and without a second runway, it will get worse. My flight from Kefalonia in July was delayed by congestion at Gatwick, my wife's return from Rhodes today - what you would think was a quiet October weekend - has been delayed for the same reason. Anecdotally, others have said the same thing. In fairness to Gatwick, outgoing security efficiency has improved in my experience over the past few years and one rarely has to wait more than five minutes to get through. Border Control on return is a different matter and baggage reclaim has a justifiable reputation for its tardiness. But then generally it takes ages to get through Border Control so maybe they figure what's the rush? After we leave the EU, goodness knows what a muddle the arrival process will be. You can be certain there will be teething problems. Probably caused by introducing new processes over an Easter weekend when the place is at its busiest. Most UK airports are the embodiment of Rip off Britain. No opportunity to pick your pocket is wasted from parking charges that would make a footpad blush, to funnelling you through horrible duty free malls and having nowhere quiet to sit, the experience is rarely serene. Gatwick is no exception, I can put up with that but not Gatwick's deteriorating punctuality and seemingly indifferent attitude to speeding up the arrivals process and getting out of the place as soon as possible."
28th September 2017,4,"""whole issue is and was a total disgrace""","✅ Verified Review |  We arrived from international flight for domestic flight with Aer Lingus. We had only 1 hour to get through passport / security control and across to south terminal. When we got to the gate we were advised gate was closed and flight had left. We asked what to do and were advised we would need to return to north terminal to the ticket desk. As my partner is disabled we requested assistance, after 1 hour no one arrived we requested several times and were advised someone was on their way. On the final request we were advised to flag down a buggy ourselves! Great service! We got our way back to the 'Airline Desk' and again explained our situation and were advised we would need to go back to check in area. We again requested assistance to a lady and she said she would arrange it (my partner uses 2 crutches), same again sat for ages and kept being told someone was on their way. Eventually after another hour a lady arrived and an older gentlemen came over and told us to follow this lady, we again enquiried if assistance was coming and the guy stated no, no one had been called as he was not aware we needed assistance! He was so rude, ignorant and for the fact we were pressed for time I would've addressed the issue with him. In the end we had to walk for a further 20 mins to the desk, the lady at Aer Lingus was very nice and checked in all our bags and gave us our new boarding passes. She was aware of our situation and had been waiting on us arriving. The staff who man this 'Airline Desk' should be ashamed of themselves for their actions. I've complained to Gatwick but they cannot give me any contact details for this Airline desk or who is in charge of it. This whole issue is and was a total disgrace."
25th September 2017,3,"""poor impression of the UK""","✅ Verified Review |  I almost laughed out loud when I read the two reviews below this one. I experienced the same problems at the North Terminal as these posters had observed at the South Terminal! Firstly, on arriving from Basel, I had the luxury of a jet way from the aircraft to the terminal, but then discovered that our gate was practically the furthest from border control. It's quite illuminating and discouraging to see signs telling you how far in metres you had to walk, approximately how many minutes that would take you, and that there would be seats and toilets available to you on your journey! The next event was crossing the apron on the sky-bridge and the horrible rain forest sound effects from the speakers as you did so. What happened to good, old-fashioned silence? Perhaps that's why you need to know that you'll be passing toilets on your expedition from the lawless outer reaches to the relative promise of civilisation after transiting border control! On reaching border control, there was a dense throng of passengers for all methods of entry. It took about 40 minutes to be processed, but I am grateful that the officer who checked my passport was charming and courteous. Signage could be better for the exit and the shuttle to the South terminal as plenty of people asked me for help and this was my first time to Gatwick for many years. On my return, security was reasonably straightforward with minimal wait, but then I was thrust into a glittery floored shopping arcade worthy of Stansted and Manchester and as far as I know, Gatwick is not owned by MAG. Horrible lighting, low ceilings, no easy way through, running the gauntlet of the perfume sprayers. I did buy some chocolate from the World Duty Free after having pointed out that my preferred purchase was out of its sell-by date and when I did buy a couple of smaller bars, I found that WHSmith was offering the same product on a 3 for 2 basis so I had poor value for money. The restaurants (sorry, fast food outlets) were all upstairs and grubby and disappointing. My flight had been delayed so I chose Garfunkel's, and was served by kind folk who allowed me to relax over my meal rather than pushing me out to turn tables. That I was grateful for. I will be passing through Gatwick more frequently in the future than I might have wished, and based on my recent experience, I will have to try to spend as little time there as possible. Even the jet-way to the plane was dirty, and had litter on the floor and stuck to the walls. A poor impression of the UK. Hopefully something will be done about the overall cleanliness once the air-side shopping experience improvements will have been completed."
21st March 2022,1,"""ghastly experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I am curious to know why, with all the available information world wide, Terminal 5 design is not fit for purpose. A truly ghastly experience on our return. Long walks, long queues, rude immigration staff, long waits for baggage."
14th March 2022,3,"""the machines were not working""","Not Verified |  I went with my son for a trip to London, we were kept for hours, hundreds of people stuck because the machines were not working and there was just one customs officer who took ages asking people hundreds of questions while others were kept in line. The only answer to our complaints was: ""we have very few customs officers"".  "
13th March 2022,1,"""Security is an absolute joke""",✅ Trip Verified | Security is an absolute joke. They don’t allow you to keep your items together. They give you a bag to put all liquids inside and it must be sealed. Then they pick and choose what they consider a liquid/paste. They opened my makeup bag and removed one mascara but left the other. They make you throw away anything that doesn’t fit in their provided bag.
20th February 2022,1,"""horrible experience while transiting""","✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience while transiting. Arrived on time (actually a little earlier), bridge to the plane was broken and the airline staff took over an hour to find us stairs/get us out of the plane. The nearest restroom after exiting the plane was 10 minutes walk. Had to take a bus to another terminal and on arrival, I had to go through security. The lady at the security check was absolutely horrible and made me take out all liquids from my carry on from plastic transparent Ikea bags to move the containers with liquids to transparent bags available at the airport. She said that she will throw my liquids away if I don't do that."
20th February 2022,2,"""Poor Taxi pickup organisation""","✅ Trip Verified |  Poor Taxi pickup organisation at Terminal 3 Heathrow’s new approach to divert taxis to level 3 of the car park to pick up arriving passengers is causing long queues, congestion and frustration for arriving passengers. All passengers are required to navigate 2 different elevators with children and luggage. I waited with my family with at least 150 other people waiting for lifts to get to our arriving taxi. When getting to the pick up point there was further delays due to the congestion of around 20 taxis trying to find their passengers. More can be done to ensure a more efficient operation at the easily accessible forecourt."
7th February 2022,4,"""not in the same league as Gatwick""","Not Verified |  Heathrow T3 is not in the same league as Gatwick. Lots of seating but dirty with food crumbs or footprints. The shopping is ok but limited as are food offerings. The Curator Restaurant was the one redeeming feature. Lovely breakfast, fast service, friendly staff and reasonable prices, can recommend. British Airways in future at Gatwick until Virgin have a change of heart."
16th January 2022,1,"""I received a penalty charge this week""","Not Verified |  I very rarely post reviews, however, I was looking for reviews about T5, to verify if others had problems with the 'Drop Off Zone' at T5 like I did. I had the same problem as reviewed below by Adrian Sharpe, I was looking for the multi-storey car park, and by mistake I entered in the Drop Off Zone. I did not stay, I immediately left the Drop Off Zone, and I found my way to the multi-storey car park. I parked and paid for my parking. To my absolute dismay I received a penalty charge this week, charging me £40 to have entered the Drop Off Zone. I am appealing this."
14th January 2022,1,"""had to pay a extra charge of £40""","✅ Trip Verified | The car parking company, Apcoa, is, in my opinion, operating a corrupt practice. I wanted to pick my wife and children up (having parked nearby). The signs are utterly inadequate and don't tell you what you are doing. I asked a policeman in the end because there were no staff. You are funnelled towards the drop off zone. The short stay car park is signposted off to the right but almost unnoticeable. When you go in the drop off zone you are on APNR cameras and liable to pay. There is nothing obvious indicating this (I physically got out and looked). 19 days later I got a PCN. I pointed out that I was in a drop off zone, was supposed to be elsewhere (the policeman told me this) and had then gone to the short stay car park as directed. They weren't interested and fined me. An hour and a half held hostage by parking, paid £5.30 and then had to pay a extra charge of £40. Add to that that entry to the UK was standing in a congested line for an hour with all and sundry."
9th January 2022,3,"""Nobody seems to care about customer service""","Not Verified |  The worst experience! Upon touchdown we had to wait on the tarmac for about 10 minutes while the plane parked ahead of us tried to figure out what he was supposed to be doing. While transit through the airport and customs was a breeze (this was a first, usually takes over an hour), we waited for over half an hour for our luggage to start coming through on the belt. Meanwhile, we witnessed 20+ airport workers just hanging around joking and laughing like there weren’t hundreds of people across 4 flights waiting for their luggage to come through one conveyor. Nobody seems to care about customer service and everyone employee we encountered was rude and couldn’t be bothered to answer simple questions. By far the worst airport experience in my 30+ years of traveling. This airport should be ashamed!"

I arrived in the UK from the US, traveling internationally for the first time and was given helpful information from both staff and repeat travelers at Heathrow. Customs was very quick and straightforward, taking less than 20 minutes. I arrived and was picked up from the airport all in under 1 hour which is rather impressive for traveling internationally. Great WiFi connection, ample restrooms and seating and before customs all signage was easy to follow. Signage post customs and by the car park/pick up area was quite hard to follow, but I will possibly lend some of that to being American. I was frustrated by the amount of conveyers out of service, especially for disabled or elderly travelers. Lifts were also a bit tricky to find, especially for the demographics who need them most. Other than that, accessibility is great with many wheelchairs, trollies and services for travelers in need. Just be sure to take your time with navigating the pick up area."
2nd December 2021,1,"""No social distancing""","✅ Trip Verified |  Arrived with BA0104 flight from Dubai. Going to the emigration area there was 2 employees who diverted me with my passport and Biometric Work Permit to the general (Rest of the World queue) There were around 300 people standing there, No social distancing, no attention from airports employees. Only 4-5 emigration officers were checking documents, air climatization is bad, people are getting tired, leaving the line for the WC visits and we are still not moving, 1 hour, 2 hours… you start looking at the other part where it’s dedicated to EU citizens. Why don’t you divert part of passengers there? Finally after 2½ hours they started to take families and give them priorities. It took me 3h15 min and I completed passport check in 30 seconds, officer never asked any questions just checked my Ukrainian passport and let me though. This is a pure disgrace."
15th November 2021,2,"""will use Gatwick from now on""","Not Verified |  Terminal 5: Departure no problem, but dreadful queues on the way back - the Heathrow staff blamed multiple flights arriving at once, but with the skies less than full, this was a poor excuse. Well over an hour to get through the terminal, even though the e-gates were working - will use Gatwick from now on."
7th November 2021,1,"""More revenue is all we care about!""","Not Verified |  Hey Brains, I have an idea: why don't we charge people £5 to pick up passengers? We'll earn revenue from people who who aren't even travelling! Great idea, but won't that mean more people use the Short Stay car park instead and snarl up the lifts, cause extra queues and create even more chaos at Terminal 5, especially when some of our lifts don't even work? Yes, but who cares about them? More revenue is all we care about!"
9th October 2021,5,"""security staff was rude to me""","Not Verified |  When I got to the airport I had to go to T5 to get my test done, but due to a fight change I had to check in at T3. I had many bags, and one of the attendants was very helpful during the train transfer by getting a trolley for me once I got off the train. The check-in procedure was very quick and smooth. The attendant was extremely helpful and polite, and explained everything thoroughly and made sure I had everything I needed to have for my arrival at my destination. Afterwards I went back to T5 to get a document signed. I had asked about it before and was told it could be signed if I came back after receiving my test result. I was a bit annoyed when I returned and they refused to sign the document. When I was going through security the staff was rude to me. I had started preparing my stuff in the line and was ready to finish unpacking my stuff once I could put my bag down. He kept repeating his instructions and did not give me a chance to finish before he repeated it again. I got very frustrated with him, which resulted in him being extremely patronizing."

Untrained staff who check no paperwork (locator and PCR), disorganised facility with very poor signage, everything seemed to be on a cost basis. Chaos. . Then we come to the long stay carparking. I had to alter the booking 2 times. No problem in extending and paying more money, easy to do online. When it comes to shortening forget it. The system won't allow. I asked for a refund by email, to be given a reply ""claim on your travel insurance""."
19th February 2021,3,"""no enforcement of any of the covid guidelines set in the UK""","✅ Trip Verified | Even though we are in the middle of a pandemic, I did not see any real changes to when I last visited Heathrow Airport last year in January. There was no enforcement of any of the covid guidelines set in the UK, or when there were some attempts at social distances they made no sense and were extremely redundant. When exiting the plane after waiting for the majority of the passengers to leave, I was approached by a very rude and hostile security guard. As I was travelling alone he made sure to speak with me rather than the family with two children (with no masks) walking behind me. I have taken the covid precautions seriously therefore I was wearing PPE (white disposable overalls, n95 mask, and face shield). The guard, sarcastically mocked if I were travelling to paint and then began berating me about how it is my fault that there is still a pandemic going on. Considering that there are far more people who flaunt their ignorance of the guidelines it is baffling why he was being like this about it whereas the family behind me was let off. Ridiculous. The border control guard, however, was the complete opposite. He asked about my reason of visit which I promptly gave as well as telling him all the precautions I have taken and he was very polite and understanding and let me through with not an ounce of attitude."
1st February 2021,1,"""shocking procedures""","✅ Trip Verified |  Where do I start? We are in a so called pandemic as the government says. Well what I experienced today I would of never of thought that I could float from terminal 2 arrivals to departure with not one person challenging me to ask why am I here or where am I going? As I was seeing my wife and daughter away to Thailand by government rules I was allowed to do. I proceeded to terminal 5 for my flight back to Aberdeen. Well I was in for more of a shock. Main entrance only had a bit cardboard saying if not a traveller do not proceed anymore than this point, where was security to stop anyone from walking in off the street with any disease with no checks, shocking procedures."
29th December 2020,3,"""so shocked at how backwards Heathrow feels""","Not Verified |  I am so shocked at how backwards Heathrow feels. I fly for work regularly and I'm not very critical. The lack of personal support and consideration for customer experience is pretty shocking. Feels like Brexit is already taking its toll!

17th December 2020,1,"""Terrible, disgraceful immigration experience""","Not Verified |  Terrible, disgraceful immigration experience, 200 people cramped in queues with 1 immigration counter open. Then you complain about rising Covid cases, people are catching it at your airport. Shameful especially during this pandemic when people have been away from loved ones. This shows lack of respect and incompetent management leaving 1 immigration officer on her own. Disgraceful."
16th November 2020,3,"""Awful experience today""","Not Verified |  Awful experience today at the security’s before departure. I was asked in a very rude manner to remove my boots and then, with a horrible body language and voice, I was told there were no disposable shoe cover available? I wonder if the authority can’t afford to hire decent, polite staff or if they need to save money from the cleaning company and asking the customers to wipe the floors instead?"
18th October 2020,8,"""it was a very straightforward process""","✅ Trip Verified | First overseas trip of 2020 and surprisingly it was a very straightforward process through Heathrow Terminal 2. We arrived with 3 hours before departure but needn’t have worried. Travelling to Warsaw on LO282, our check in was completed online 24 hrs before. The check in area was quiet and we walked straight up to the kiosk to print our luggage tags. After issuing the tags, the kiosk printed paper boarding passes without any prompt - trying to save paper, we had already got our passes on our mobile phones. Would advise airlines to check if passengers need a paper pass at the kiosk. Once our luggage was tagged, we walked straight over to a drop off desk. In the past, there would be a queue, but given our early arrival at the airport, and the drop in passenger numbers this year, queueing wasn’t required. Tags scanned and luggage on its way, we joined the queue through security. Only two lanes were open, but the staff were extremely quick in moving passengers through. Before we knew it we were airside. From walking into the terminal to getting through security only took 20 mins. Obviously the main difference this year is the number of travellers going through Heathrow (or any airport for that matter). Airside was much quieter than we have seen, and one can only imagine the loss in revenue for the high end shops that cater to the wealthy passengers. We made do with visiting World Duty Free, then WHSmiths (always need some reading material) followed by a pint at the pub on the upper level. Naturally everyone is wearing masks and observing social distancing. My wife was disappointed that the perfume samples were not available - for me this was a major plus as I would usually have to wait ages for her to try different scents before choosing which to buy. Our flight usually departed from a B gate, but given the low number of flights, we were directed to one of the gates at the main lounge. Arriving back to Terminal 2 a week later was a little bit busier than before. To start off with as we deplaned, we had to show our COVID documentation (completed online 2 days before). Several fellow passengers had not done this so had to stand to one side and do it there and then. Our arrival coincided with a couple of long hauls from the Far East so there was a long queue at passport control. This wasn’t helped by only three e-gates being used. Just as I got to the front of the queue, they closed the e-gate! However, a member of staff was very good at getting three lanes down through the 2 remaining e-gates. I wonder how these queues will change once we end the transition period at the end of the year. By the time we got through passport control and walked over to the carousel, the luggage was just being brought out. From exiting the aircraft to leaving the terminal took 50 mins."
5th October 2020,1,"""one of the worlds most awful airports""","Not Verified |  Well I was pleased to see that in 2018 Terminal 2 was awarded ‘Terminal of the Year.’ Because after waiting in a 6 hour immigration line today I was grateful I was not at the worlds worst terminal, because that would have been simply awful. Heathrow must truly be one of the worlds most awful airports."
7th September 2020,3,"""Staff are not friendly""","Not Verified |  I generally enjoy the service at Heathrow. However, the customer service at duty free bare minerals is appalling. Staff are not friendly, there is a lack of foundation shade variety and diversity and staff made absolutely no attempt to offer any help or sincere advice. Would not attend again."
14th June 2020,9,"""directions very visible and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent airport to travel from, we organised,  professional well trained and helpful staff, A wide range of duty free shops, Signage and directions very visible and helpful, seating area is great, Business lounge is fantastic, even though at times there are long queues due to the efficiency and intuition of the dedicated staff these queues move quite quickly. I have always travelled through this airport despite living over three hours away, the standards at this airport improves each time I have travelled through it inevitably adding a positive experience to my travels In all honesty I cannot pick a single fault or negative experience that I have been through at this airport."
22nd April 2020,6,"""I was expecting more choice of food""","✅ Trip Verified | The airport is spacious, looks pretty, however for this kind of airport I was expecting more choice of food in terminal 2. Compared with Gatwick, Gatwick is much better. Staff should have better training at check in area. Not family friendly. Its good if you travel alone outside Europe."
18th March 2020,1,"""will avoid as much as possible""","✅ Trip Verified | Poor airport and security measures. Was in transit coming from New York going to Bucharest. Of course we had to pass security again, even though it was transit and the same terminal. So anything you might have bought back in New York was good to throw out. Luckily for us it was just some bottles of water. But at security, I had a can of Powder spray for the shoes/feet. The can was clearly Powder, measured in grams and was on an outside net pocket of my backpack. The security staff, instead of just taking care of the can, they got everything out of my backpack, every single individual thing, including cosmetics that were actually in the bag on the tray, and put them directly on the incredibly filthy tray (exactly what I tried to avoid touching with my stuff). This was done at a very slow pace. Also my dad had issues with all his bags, instead of going directly to the problem, the staff touched and got everything out of the bag. Hopefully I never have to use this airport ever again, will avoid as much as possible."
18th March 2020,10,"""received nothing but helpful and cheerful service""",Not Verified |  Had to return home early due to Coronavirus. The airport was extremely busy. We received nothing but helpful and cheerful service from all staff. Thank you guys for a job more than well done.
9th March 2020,2,"""idiotic systems and procedures""","Not Verified |  Someone needs to explain to me why I go through security at Edinburgh and then have to go through it again when arriving in London when all I have done is go on a plane in the UK and got off a plane in the UK? I’m in Transit you morons - I have not left the Airport / I am arriving at the same Terminal that I am leaving from to go on my International Flight (Terminal 5) but I have already done Security at Edinburgh! Different story if I have left the Airport, spent a few hours in London and then returned - that I get! Sounds too much like common sense to Heathrow? - they deal with idiotic systems and procedures that bear no resemblance to reality / order. This nonsense is compounded by moronic staff who get their kicks out of being exceptionally stupid / rude and arrogant."
5th March 2020,2,"""VAT refund was horrible""","✅ Trip Verified |  The check in has to be done by machines which for me kept failing and ended up needing staff to help us. Also, the VAT refund was horrible. Only 2 staffs were there and although many people were waiting, the staffs were slow. There were about 20 people in front of us when we first arrived at the queue, and after 1 and a half hour, only 10 has been processed!"
28th January 2020,10,"""my experience was always positive""","✅ Trip Verified | Over the last 5 months I have visited Terminals 2, 4 and 5. Credit where it is due, whether it was departing or arriving my experience was always positive."
25th January 2020,10,"""Well done Terminal 3!""","✅ Trip Verified |  Well done Terminal 3! Departed from there yesterday on AA flight to Miami with my wife. Unfortunately she had just twisted her knee and was struggling to walk far, but all the staff were very polite and helpful. Security was polite and professional, then a member of staff offered to get my wife a wheelchair (without prompting), which she declined as she thought she could manage. But the gate was a long way, and she wasn’t managing very well, then one of the electric buggy drivers saw us and stopped, turned round and took us to our gate. Again at the gate all staff were polite and helpful. Just to let everyone there know that we appreciated your great attitude!"
24th January 2020,2,"""I got randomly selected""","Not Verified |  I got randomly selected by a staff prior to entering ""nothing to declare"" gate. Immediately asked if are you from Dubai instead of checking my boarding pass/ticket. Then asked if I had any tobacco, I said no, I wouldn't buy those because I have asthma, to which he chuckled and said ""I didn't ask if you have asthma, I asked if you have tobacco"". I firmly said no."
15th January 2020,9,"""Hugely impressed by Heathrow T3""","✅ Trip Verified | Hugely impressed by Heathrow T3. Having said that, my local airport is MAN which is like a 3rd world, despot run nightmare. Flew with AA. Boarding a full flight was calm quick and orderly. Prior to that, security was a breeze, with polite, non-shouty staff (MAN take note). A very nice breakfast followed and it made a great start to a weekend away. On return, immigration was quick and I was in the carpark bus within minutes."
15th January 2020,3,"""no smoking areas here""",Not Verified | I never came on an airport where it not possible to smoke. Why are there no smoking areas here?
6th December 2019,3,"""go out of their way to make life difficult""",Not Verified |  The south security gate was closed and all passengers were directed to the north portion and the queues were simply horrendous. Heathrow security thrives on beings rude and unpleasant and go out of their way to make life difficult. The amenities in the airport are geared up for millionaires and full of designers outlets unfortunately not much fun for the normal people. Flights are never on time so don’t expect a happy visit. I avoid this airport whenever possible.
3rd December 2019,2,"""experience absolutely awful""","Not Verified | Had just come off a 12-hour flight from Hong Kong and had to connect to get a domestic flight. We arrived at Terminal 5 but we were at the C Gates, so we were required to travel to the main terminal by train. It was around 5 in the morning and at least 2 flights had landed with a large number of passengers. There was only one train available that needed to take people back to the main terminals before returning to the C Gates and back and forth, so this took longer than expected. We were then required to go through security again however there were no signs or guides advising that we needed to do this. In some other international airports that we have connected, there is no need to go through security checks again. Because we only had 2 hours to connect, we decided we would try and head straight over to our gate before going to the toilets etc., but we encountered security instead. The queues were all over the place and you could see everyone was a bit fed up at this point. I had just come off the plane with at least 500ml of water left as well and instead of being helpful, I was shouted at for having a large bottle of water and was told to empty it on the spot by drinking it all (seriously?) or the security guard would bin my water bottle (was desperate for the toilet as well at this point). When we told her that nobody informed us that there would be security checks again, she shrugged and told us we should've emptied it in the toilets - obviously, I would've done that if I knew we had to go through this again! Overall she was incredibly rude, treated us as if we were stupid, put the blame on us and made our experience absolutely awful. If I had gotten her name I would've made a formal complaint. Honestly the worst airport I have ever experienced and would avoid in the future if possible."
27th November 2019,2,"""should do smoking areas""","Not Verified | It is ridiculous, I understand that is the law not to smoke inside the airport but they should do smoking areas for the people who are travelling more them 12h in the row (I just arrived from a connection flight)."
17th November 2019,3,"""Horrible customer service""",✅ Trip Verified | 5 Check in machines I tried were out of service. Horrible customer service! Staff member at the check in desk was rude and ignorant. She asked me whether my final city destination was Turkey and then had a go at me for not knowing the airport code. Very very bad!
13th November 2019,8,"""Very kind security control service""",✅ Trip Verified | Arrival to Terminal 2. Departure from Terminal 4. Both Terminals are very ok. No big queues to security control. All information presented loud and clear. Very kind security control service.
11th November 2019,3,"""airport is totally incompetent""","✅ Trip Verified | This airport is totally incompetent. They took my jam off me but they left my razor in my carry on. Very poor, I don’t feel safe here and there is no security check that I can rely on."
8th November 2019,1,"""Security staff hate their job""","Not Verified | Security staff hate their job. We're a family of 4 with 2 small kids and connecting to Miami at Heathrow terminal 3. First we have to go through the security check in Helsinki and get rid of all our drinks, buy water, drinks and even a bottle of liquor at Helsinki. Arriving after a 2.5hr flight at Heathrow, with 90 minutes to change flights. First you need to go through exact the same security check as in Helsinki. Security staff yelling and threatening people to listen to them or else they will be delayed. Here you are as a parent trying to get your family to another plane for a nice and stress free vacation. Unfortunately I forgot to take 2 iPads out of my bag. A simple mistake. The security staff took my bag (and several other bags of “criminals”, including an old English lady who clearly had difficulties understanding the instructions) to put it aside for at least 15 minutes before eving looking at it. The bag and iPads now needed some special investigation and it took another 15 minutes before I had my bag back. While I was waiting I could see several other people in the same situation, staff not trying at all to help the travelers, staff yelling and cursing at people for not putting the trays at the correct place. We had to run from the security check to the gate, me carrying a crying 3 year old, and a 7 year old trying to keep up. What a relief to make it to the gate and meet the incredible nice and friendly staff of British Airways. I feel bad for them, but I will never fly again via Heathrow. We had plenty of alternatives to fly to Miami, but thought Heathrow was a world class airport. Oh and the glass bottle of liquor I bought at Helsinki airport tax free and had with me in the flight to Miami. Not a single word to get that through security."
23rd October 2019,8,"""terminal was clean and airy""",Not Verified |  Departed from LHR T2 to Bangkok in October (evening). The check in for premium passengers was hassle free and security check was super efficient. In fact I've never encountered long security checks in any of the Heathrow terminals. It's one of the most efficient security I've been through. Once passed security there were plenty of shops or sitting areas with charging facilities. The terminal was clean and airy. On arrival we were connected to jet bridge in no time and was out of the plane very quick. Early evening on a Sunday with multiple wide bodied planes landing resulted in longer immigration queue. However the queue kept moving fast and most of the e gates were in operation. From landing to clearing immigration it took me less than 25 minutes despite the busy landing time. The only disadvantage or slightly negative experience on T2 is the long walk between the main building A and the satellite gates B (where most long haul flights depart/arrive). You have to go down and up on long escalators.
20th October 2019,3,"""rudeness of security staff""","Not Verified |  The rudeness of security staff is unbelievable. One tells you to load your contents one way, others want them laid out differently. You can hear one of them complaining the passengers were not listening to his instructions. Do they realise we are their customers? Without us, they won't have a job. "
18th October 2019,8,"""security queues are quick and painless""",✅ Trip Verified | Traveled in and out of Heathrow four times this year. Most recently on Terminal 5. It's a good airport. I don't understand the complaints about this. The security queues are quick and painless and the self service bio metric check on arrival with the machines work well and I'm out of the terminal into the underground within 10 minutes of landing. The toilets are well maintained and the prices of food and drinks with the variety means there is choice for all price points. The negative is lack of seating throughout the terminal as nearly all the space is taken up by retail shops.
17th October 2019,1,"""immigration queues extremely long""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport for two reasons. Firstly, the security staff I encountered are very rude and unhelpful. When they try to check your bags, they do it at an incredibly slow pace that's literately maddening for anyone trying to catch a flight. Secondly the immigration queues are extremely long and counters are poorly staffed, normally people have to wait for an hour or so to go through immigration which is unbelievable. One time for a complete 15 minutes interval there was not a single staff member serving at the counters, not a single one!"
10th October 2019,1,"""despise this airport""","Not Verified | I absolutely despise this airport, not because of their layout, though it's rather complicated and time-consuming to get around, but because of the staff running the security. For the second time now, the last time was about 5 years ago and I swore that would be the last time I went through Heathrow, but security seemed to find yet again a way to cause me to be within minutes of missing my next flight. Both times my items breezed through the scanner, but ""I"", who had no metal objects on or in me, had to be scanned twice, and held to a very aggressive body pat-down. They even used two hand held metal scanners to search me and couldn't find a thing. I'm wearing a cotton shit, jeans and socks, no shoes. It took them well over 15 minutes to perform this abuse of power, and for a reason, I have no idea of. These people are truly messed up, I despise them and hope never again to have to go to that horrible airport again."
9th October 2019,9,"""have new found admiration for Heathrow""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been on a series of wide ranging business trips and now have new found admiration for Heathrow having used it at least 20 times in the last 4 months. The main thing is it realises it is an airport with shopping not the other way round. Inbound the connections from Domestic to an International can be made in 20 minutes - I have to do it at least twice on Sunday evenings as my flight has been delayed. The signs are clear, the 5A to 5B or 5C shuttle is effcient and never seems crowded. I have access to BA First class or Concorde lounges but have tried other lounges and bars and they all seem good (one in T5 beside the domestic gate lounge is very good at serving rapidly). There are loads of snack type outlets but it doesn't stink of food everywhere. On arrival the e-passport gates and security works very efficiently and I am not sure fast track actually delivers very much. Shopping is very good and I can't fault the terminal cleanliness. Two issues stop it getting a 10/10 - firstly if you are on a remote stand it is a very long bus ride and the buses are not very good, and secondly the have too many slots so if you are on alate out say 21.00-13.00 then you are going to spend a lot of time at the gate or in a queue."
2nd October 2019,1,"""Totally unacceptable""",Not Verified |  From landing to exiting the airport took 3 hours! This is meant to be a world class airport and this took almost as long as the flight itself. Totally unacceptable.
1st October 2019,1,"""horrendous experience with the tax refund office""","Not Verified |  I’m compelled to write this review after a horrendous experience with the tax refund office at T4. British wit and world famous repute for good education and common sense is no where evident as we queue in dingy surroundings, eye sight gradually deteriorating due to faulty blinking fluorescent lighting, somehow no money forthcoming from the coffers of the wealthy British Empire for a replacement tube. Rows and rows of happy holiday makers after enjoying gentle British hospitality, cursing the somewhat hostile system of tax refund, obviously aimed at discouraging visitors from claiming what is rightfully theirs, in a cunning, sneaky, unfriendly, money-faced manner. Having travelled extensively, contributing to the healthy economies of a large number of countries, I can safely say this tax refund system and premise to be the absolute worst, even surpassing Paris’s CDG many times over. Common sense dictates more counters required for expeditious service, better ventilation (!) in a bigger area, toilet facilities, seating areas for the elderly and those with children and properly functioning lights (basic requirement!). This system of screwing visitors is keeping the economy afloat in a most underhanded manner. How disappointing that we leave Bonny ol England with this impression and what a put-off!"
1st October 2019,10,"""plenty of signage and helpers""","✅ Trip Verified | Still the best airport I’ve been to, it’s quick and easy to get through check-in and security. Duty free is good, and a fast transfer is made easy by plenty of signage and helpers."
1st October 2019,2,"""Very confusing and complicated""","Not Verified |  Baggage drop off for my mum, traveling to Singapore. Very confusing and complicated. We had already done online check-in the night before and still had to wait 25 minutes for baggage drop. Also very difficult to find the right queue."
29th September 2019,8,"""impressive for a harshly criticized airport""","Not Verified |  This was the very first time in Heathrow, really impressive for a harshly criticized airport. First of all, very clean airport. Terminal 2 is always spick and span and presentable. Signs are very helpful, want to go to the tube? Arrivals, then underground. Don't know the terminal you're going to? Check their website and find your airline's terminal. Queuing times are efficient as they take into account the intense amount of passengers that go through the airport, just not the planes, you'll be waiting 10, maybe 20 minutes waiting to take off, possibly missing a connecting flight. Seating wise, the seats are quite good to rest on for a person who lives quite far from airports. The food is fatty but really tasty. I expected so much less from an airport like this. The staff are genuinely lovely. Especially some of the staff at the UK border that are pleasant to speak to. Overall, a very good airport to fly in if you're not on a time crunch."
19th September 2019,1,"""there is no excuse for their hostility""","Not Verified |    The screeners were vicious morons. If a sensor lights up, that means certain areas are to be inspected. Fine. But a lit sensor did not mean that I was guilty of something. The screener pummeled me and kept saying, ""Ma'am"" in an officious tone. I am a little-ish old lady with blue eyes and light brown hair, an American of Germanic descent. I have not been out of the United States since 2008, on a cruise in the Caribbean. I would be stunned if anyone could find a terrorist of my description but the screener acted as if I were carrying a grenade. I realize that your screeners may not be the brightest of people but there is no excuse for their hostility and complete lack of common sense. There is no other word than, ""Bully."" If the screeners keep up at this, someone is going to sue them for battery. We have relief in common. I would rather be buried alive than travel to England again and the screeners will never see me again. The trip was supposed to be a birthday celebration for me. Not much of a celebration."
8th September 2019,10,"""plenty of helpful staff""","Not Verified |  Quick efficient passage, through Terminal 2, plenty of helpful staff available to assist, check in and Security queues were minimal. Security staff efficient and quite pleasant, terminal was fairly busy but clean and tidy and easy to navigate from entrance to departure gate."
6th September 2019,9,"""a very good to excellent terminal""","✅ Trip Verified | Leaving - T5 is still one of my favourite terminals. there have been some changes since my last visit in 2017. Self Check in is now the norm. At 05.30 on a Friday morning, it wasn't that busy. Terminal signage indicated that South was less busy than North for getting through security, and indeed it was and it delivers you right outside the Gordon Ramsay restaurant, which is excellent! Flight left from C57, which must be one of the furthest gates from the main terminal. It is also a long walk to the plane from there. Arriving - E-Gates are now the norm for immigration. It was quite busy, and I fear that if there is a Hard Brexit, it will be very chaotic at the UK Border. Bags from my flight started to arrive on the belt as I arrived in the Baggage Hall. Overall still a very good to excellent terminal."
30th August 2019,1,"""there was no trolley""",Not Verified |  I traveled with my family from terminal 2 to USA. Came back on terminal 2. The biggest issue was claiming baggage there was no trolley at all to keep your bags.?when I asked them they said they run out of trolley. After an hour of claiming our bags I found 1 trolley and some how managed to came out. When we came out I can’t believe it but there was so many trolley outside - airport staff was just going around but not bother to bring the trolley inside the airport. Very disappointed. I think they not bother about service.
21st August 2019,9,"""No hassle at all""","✅ Trip Verified | Terminal 5 is a very good terminal. There is lots of space and the queue times are not very long. Security would be my only issue, as a lady was very unpleasant to passengers queuing up for security. Through security, there are a good range of shops and food options at a reasonable price (for an airport). There were plenty of departure screens and signage was good. No hassle at all when travelling through Heathrow Terminal 5."
18th August 2019,1,"""Worst transit airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst transit airport in the world. You will miss your flight or be running to the terminal while having a panic attack at the 100 thoughts going through your head on how to reschedule a missing flight. This is due to the extra security for liquids. I left my chapstick in my purse along with a prescription eye drop size of my pinky which warranted extra security! This is insanely ridiculous! Extra security took forever. My colleague wasn’t able to put all her toiletries in the small clear plastic bag they provide. The bag has to fully close and hers didn’t, thus extra security warranted for her. After going through the extra security, she had to dump the things that didn’t fit in this ridiculous small bag. We ended missing our flight. No other airport makes you go through this scrutinizing process of extra security that only causes delays and angry passengers. I’ll never fly through Heathrow again."
18th August 2019,2,"""T2 is a truly awful experience""","✅ Trip Verified | T2 is a truly awful experience. Firstly, try to get up and down in the lifts from the car park in less than 20 minutes. Total bottleneck, always full, and if you don’t dive in the doors shut on you in a nano-second. Then try to get VAT reclaim in less than an hour, with queues out of the door and rude service. Then try and walk to the furthest gates and see if you have survived the T2 experience. Throw fast-track security in that doesn’t allow our child to come through with us (Star Alliance Gold Elite) together with the worst shopping selection and now you have my nemesis airport."
15th August 2019,1,"""VAT refunds with long queues""","✅ Trip Verified |  This is one of the worst airport I have been to. Services are slow, staff were rude to me, VAT refunds are impossible with long queues. When I have a feedback regarding the VAT service, the staff said that I am the only one giving a negative feedback. Really? "
8th August 2019,8,"""Terminal 2 is a good terminal""",✅ Trip Verified |  Terminal 2 is a good terminal. Not too big and small. Just the right size for the volume of traffic. Security length was short and I was inside the terminal within 10 mins. Polite staff. Good range of shops and the gates and toilets are clearly signposted. Plenty of seating available. Coming back I was out of the airport within 10 mins as I used the new self service passport screening machines. I'm impressed.
8th August 2019,3,"""unnecessary extra check""","Not Verified |  Rude airport security workers. The airport is fine until you get to the gates, that’s where they do an unnecessary extra check of your luggage and carryon and ask you  questions to distract you and get you to give information. I did not like my experience and the unnecessary checks."
29th July 2019,1,"""security check is a nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified |  I always try to avoid a Heathrow as going through security check is a nightmare. They can have 5 bags pulled for further check yet 1 checker leaves on break. Appears they don't like their job or they get off on terrorizing travelers. They take everything out and dump it in a bin leaving you to carefully fit everything back in your carry on quickly. Numerous people said they are going to miss their flight but they just shrug.  I was given an orange express card yet they didn't look at my luggage first. I'm all for security but not in the manner these heartless people do it. Heathrow, worst airport in the world."
29th July 2019,3,"""lifts are too small""",Not Verified |  Terminal 2 is ok in many ways. But the lifts between car park and arrivals and departure floors are too small. Lifts constantly arrive already full. 2. Cafes landside are far fewer ie 2 than old T3.  Walk to gates is a marathon including massive down escalator immediately followed by 2 up escalators. Fancy baggage carousels on arrival are slow owing to stupid traffic light system that slows the whole thing up.
27th July 2019,7,"""Terminal 3 was exceptionally smooth""","✅ Trip Verified | The arrival experience in Heathrow's Terminal 3 was exceptionally smooth. During immigration, US citizens were allowed to use the kiosks for UK citizens, which made the process quicker. While flying back to US on a Sunday, the check-in and security lines in T3 were long. After security, the terminal was crowded, but there were open seats available. The seating area doesn't provide any plane spotting opportunity. Terminal 3 has a shopping mall vibe, so the shopping and dining options are fantastic. In Heathrow, the boarding gate is displayed minutes before boarding starts. When I was walking to my gate, I saw a sign that read, ""No restrooms beyond this point."" Overall, Terminal 3 is good, but Terminal 2 still provides the best experience in Heathrow."
21st July 2019,9,"""Staff friendly and security was easy""","Not Verified |  T5 is light and an unhindered with space. Staff friendly and security was easy. The only unhelpful hindrance to our staffing experience was the assistant at the bag drop, (then again, that is down to the Airline). The other issue is the Heathrow website on the screens at the tables in Ramsey's restaurant)/bar, the information greatly differs to that of the actual information screens: The former showed a delay, the latter showed the gate boarding as of now!"
19th July 2019,3,"""What a total nightmare""","Not Verified |  Security was similar to the 9/11 experience if you are old enough to remember what that was like. Every little “cream or liquid like item” was thoroughly checked! Once we (as middle aged Americans) passed through that check point, my husband was singled out for an additional check. He had 3 agents on him at once. It took 10 minutes while they dumped again every last item out of his bag! I tried to take a photo of him only and was then harassed by a staffer and told to show my phone with pictures! What a total nightmare! We are simply visiting tourists!"
19th July 2019,1,"""don't want to use the scan machines""","✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived hours early and almost missed the flight because of the queues. Those who don't want to use the scan machines and opt for the pat down are lectured for ages on their disobedience while the bags are scanned and hand checked for hours. Also the walk from security to the gate was 20 mins.Luckily our flight was delayed. This will be the last time, Heathrow. It used to be a good airport."
9th July 2019,4,"""the service was inefficient and sloppy""","✅ Trip Verified | First time using the new Heathrow Terminal 2 to departure from / arrive to. Disappointed both times. At departure the check-in machines weren't accepting valid bookings. Long queues built up a check-in desks and check-in weren't proactive in opening more desks. One member even said ""I wondered why the queue was so long"" and yet that wasn't sufficient to prompt them to do something about it. On return around 22.45 the finger took a long time being deployed and then suitcases took ages to arrive. Big pause of around 15 minutes between first and second batch of bags coming through. For a modern terminal the service was inefficient and sloppy. Would avoid using this terminal again if possible."
27th June 2019,9,"""found the experience excellent""",Not Verified |  Terminal 2 - found the experience excellent. Very helpful staff on the automated check in. No delay on getting rid of baggage. Short wait for security. Loads of seating in the lounge. The whole place was very clean. Absolutely nothing to dislike.
21st June 2019,1,"""Staff were hopeless""",✅ Trip Verified | Use Amsterdam or Copenhagen for a good experience not Heathrow! BA flight from Bangkok - 2 hours late - rushing for Edinburgh flight - no help from BA. Customs and Security were a joke - automated equipment did not work. Boarding Passes did not register. Staff were hopeless - I will never use Heathrow again!
20th June 2019,10,"""a stress free start to our holiday""","✅ Trip Verified |  Heathrow airport is very near to where we live so use it for travelling. We use Terminal 5 to travel to Corfu. We checked in online the day before. Outbound we used the self service bag drop and was assisted by a lovely ground staff lady to deliver our cases. We went to Security which had a very small queue and passed through with ease, no pushing or being forced to move through quickly. Spent time at a restaurant for breakfast. After breakfast we waited for our gate number. The Terminal is very clean and tidy, any of the ground staff will help with any queries or questions with politeness. We always use Terminal 5 for convenience and a stress free start to our holiday."
18th June 2019,5,"""Airport staff was nice""","✅ Trip Verified |  I flew through LHR twice on this vacation. I had to connect from T2 to T5 from Air New Zealand to British Airways. Finding the connection was easy, but it was a bit unclear which bus I should take and it made random stops where people weren't told anything. Airport staff was nice, some were funny too. On my return flight I had the same connection issues. Signage in T2 could be more clear as I nearly exited the airport."
11th June 2019,4,"""Queued for 45 minutes""",✅ Trip Verified | Awful arrived at 04.45 to find 3 check in desks open for several flights. Queued for 45 minutes to do my bag drop. Asked the young assistant why it was taking so long and got told it was because a lot of passengers turned up at the same time. What a surprise when there are so many early flights. Also people who turn up with 4 times their baggage allowance and then start arguing over the cost of excess charge should be sent to a separate check in and wait.
6th June 2019,1,"""worst security experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  The bag check in is now automated which means there is no one to help. Waiting in line to try to figure out the system by ourselves. Took a few tries. Stressful. Then the worst security experience of my life. I was pushed, hurried, shoved around, roughly searched. They took off my prescription glasses and I couldn’t see anything to find the buckets that held my phone, handbag etc. The search was brisk, invasive and there was no one polite enough to help me after they were finished with me. I have never felt shocked and distressed in a security check before and there was no one behind us, so there was absolutely no need to shove me through. "
24th May 2019,1,"""Good riddance Heathrow""","Not Verified |  Worst airport I ever went through. My family of 6 had a connection with British Airways with 90 minutes for us to get from one gate to another after we arrived here from Philadelphia. We missed our flight thank you, the lack of any interest in moving passengers through especially those of us with connections is evident. Nobody sees to care about the customers and travelers passing through here, they just don’t, it’s obvious. This is my last trip to the UK. Good riddance Heathrow."
24th May 2019,2,"""This airport is a disgrace""","Not Verified |  This airport is a disgrace. As a UK citizen entering from the US and transiting to Manchester, we arrived in T3 and had to wait about 10 minutes for an operator to attach the airbridge. Once attached, we had a lengthy walk (about 15 minutes) to get to the UK Border and immigration check. Signage was OK but limited. Having been scanned at the ePassport barrier, I thought I was through and into the terminal proper but I was immediately confronted with another bank of scanners and bar code readers - no explanation or instructions. There was an unhelpful and surly security guard who stopped me from walking around these scanners. He told me that I had to (again) remove my glasses and have my photo taken for ""airport security"" - why? I asked him when my data would be removed from Heathrow's system. He gave me the impression he had no idea why I was asking and then glibly agreed with me that it would be deleted when I left the airport. I dont believe it for a moment. Given the recent court case about facial recognition software, where is the policy statement from Heathrow about the usage of our data and how it is protected/deleted? Once through this barrier, another lengthy walk to a bus gate for a long transfer to T5. Why does Heathrow not have a skytrain connecting terminals? After our overnight flight, we were made to wait about 30 minutes until a bus arrived at which point, there was a massive queue of people. The driver of the bus was rude, just packing people into the bus and then driving at quite a speed around a maze of roads to get to T5. We were then confronted with another walk to security where we again went through the usual street theatre of security, overseen by an unsmiling security guard - welcome to the UK. Had I been a foreign visitor, I would not have had a good impression of the UK. Once through the chaos of security, the shopping mall which is T5 was crowded with very few seats available and throngs of confused looking people. Eventually, we got to our connecting gate where our pictures were taken again before we were allowed to board. This airport is horrendous. Having flown in from JFK, I suggest that LHR management take a look at how a proper airport should be run."
17th May 2019,4,"""18 processing stations, only 8 were staffed""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived London Heathrow at 8:30 pm. I was in Row 75 on the plane so well back in the Border Force queue. I rarely ever complain, but after a 24 hour flight, I found it really unpleasant to stand for 2+ hours in the ""Non EU"" queue for Border Security Checks. Of about 18 processing stations, only 8 were staffed and sometimes as few as 6 whilst staff had breaks. There were 4 or more staff doing crowd control which seemed more than necessary. I have no problem with the processing staff who were diligently carrying out their work. There just wasn't enough of them rostered on and that's avery poor VERY POOR and needs addressing. This visitor will in future choose to spend my hard earned dollars holidaying somewhere else."
16th May 2019,1,"""What a nightmare LHR has become""","✅ Trip Verified | What a nightmare LHR has become. We landed in T5 domestic and had to transfer through to international, the line of site signage is almost non existant. There are E gates everywhere, we must have gone through 2 or 3 e gates before we were allowed on our plane. If you have a cap or glasses you can forget it. You just don't need this when you have many things already to carry. The number of the departure gate is not displayed until quite late. We found our plane by the registration and using an app. Seating at departure gate is limited and the boading of the flight was mixed up to say the least. Our return leg was even worse, Passport control was all but un manned there were a few advisors sending everyone to E passport gates and my 16 yo Autistic son was ushered off to another gate. I was allowed through but my son was rejected and told to go and stand in a queue in unaccompanied. I asked why and they said that he was under 18, my son should have been allowed to use E gates according to the heathrow website at the time. Again lots of e gates and photograph taking, no glasses allowed, no caps, etc. And gates not even in logical places. There are some very nice people in the shops but the passport control staff need to have their personalities re installed and learn their own rules regarding e passport gates."
9th May 2019,1,"""they do not have a clue""",Not Verified |  We have traveled extensively and have never found such rude and inconsiderate workers at security. We were told two different things by two different agents. In general they do not have a clue.
5th May 2019,1,"""good food and good seating""","Not Verified |  Airport security were beyond awful for me - slow, careless, thoughtless, unapologetic, and incompetent. Signage isn't just confusing, I found it often incorrect. Best approach is to print out a map and find your own way versus. That said, the airport is modern and clean with relatively good food and good seating."
30th April 2019,8,London Heathrow Airport customer review,"Not Verified |  Heathrow does the job. Even though Heathrow is further than Gatwick we still go to Heathrow to go to Vietnam Airlines. A lot of options to choose from (for breakfast) in terminal 3, the food was delicious and kept us going through the flight. The only thing that I’m a bit miffed about is the long queues! There were two opposite queues, and both were long, 1 longer than the other. But it didn’t matter as we planned ahead our time (5 hours ahead) so we were able to pass security on time. I recommend going to the airport way earlier than you expect, as there are many many queues which take a lot of time."
22nd April 2019,7,"""sign posting was confusing""","✅ Trip Verified | Departing and arriving at LHR T2, I found it a little bit frustrating to find my way from and to the Central Bus Station. The sign posting was confusing and the lifts were slow and temperamental. The escalotors are formidable even if you are carrying standard baggage. However, the staff, including Hotel Hoppa bus drivers, are very helpful."
8th April 2019,1,"""Heathrow is a disgrace""","✅ Trip Verified | 30th Anniversary Rhine River cruise trip, from Amsterdam to Basel. Heathrow was our connecting flight both coming in and returning home. By far the worst airport experience my wife or I have experienced on 'every' level. We are AA Frequent Flyers with Global Security status as well. LHR had the single most unnecessarily invasive, rude, redundant and down right nightmarish security checks & processing of any airport (International or domestic) we've ever encountered. And this was merely for a 'connecting' flight both times wherein we never left the secure area! In fact upon our initial arrival we were so delayed waiting to land then gate docking that we nearly missed connecting flight and were rushed with ""expedited pass"" by airport personnel with small group others yet we were 'still' run through the most rude, confusing and inhuman security checks ever experienced 'just' to get to our connecting flight gate! Really? Barely made our connecting flight and had no time to even use restroom in between all this rush and harassment. Our second Heathrow experience (returning home) was if you can believe it very much worse! Words are not enough to detail that experience and it still literally gives me nightmares and anxiety. The airport security is staffed almost exclusively by employees who almost all seemed to 'profile' travelers and ""run them through the ringer"" in the most rude, abrasive, disrespectful and insulting manner. I have no bias against any person as long they do their job properly and with respect for themselves, others and the institution they represent. The airport itself is horribly inefficient beginning with the bus transfers from arrival to departure gate areas, continuing with confusing signage or especially instructions, and finalized by some of the worst airport staff we've ever encountered in all our years flying. Again this was 'both' times we had to go through Heathrow and experienced by others around us as well, not an isolated incident. Heathrow is a disgrace to air travel & travelers and the fullest example of everything that is wrong today with airports in general. It is quite a shame that Heathrow is meant to be an International hub for so many travelers and thus such a gruelling experience for so many."
5th April 2019,2,"""poor signage""","✅ Trip Verified | Heathrow Terminal 5, massive Terminal, poor signage, information counters unmanned, slow and not very friendly security check. Worst were the toilets which were rather dirty. Overall an experience I want to forget."
27th March 2019,1,"""such a poorly run airport""","Not Verified |  Hopefully, one (and only) positive result of Brexit is that Heathrow will cease to be an international hub and we will no longer have to endure such a poorly run airport. Missed flights, long lines, rude security officials, total incompetence are all at work here. Avoid at all costs. Especially do not attempt a connecting flight here. My family trip from the US to Barcelona was marred by a hellish experience here! Avoid!"
20th March 2019,9,"""I was very impressed""",✅ Trip Verified | This was my first time travelling through LHR T2 and I was very impressed. Check in (for EVA Air) was very quick. Security was very efficient and there was a very small wait time. Once airside there is a good choice of shops and restaurants and importantly plenty of seating available. Toilets were clean! Will be happy to use T2 again.
19th March 2019,3,"""limited seating and limited amenities""","✅ Trip Verified | I have not been at Heathrow for many years, and I had to use Terminal 3 for a departure to New York. Not traveling on business this time, I was an economy passenger and I experienced this in such status. Basically, Terminal 3 is just a vast, overpriced shopping mall, crammed with every high-end store imaginable, with limited seating and limited amenities that I could see, e.g., USB charging ports for cell phones. One has to sit in a crowded, central seating area where gates are not announced until around 40 minutes before the boarding time. Once a gate is announced, it can be a 15-20 minute trek to a gate, even with moving sidewalks. And beware, there are very few toilets! The signs for the toilets take you on a yellow brick road kind of odyssey which can encompass a 10 minute walk through a maze of stores, unless I missed something, there is only one near the entrance to the mall after exiting security. There are no toilets near or at the gates, which, as I said, can be very far from the main seating ""pen"" so to speak. Also, the security lines can be long. When the airport web site states ""arrive 3 hours before departure"" there is a very good reason for that. I travel quite a bit internationally, and this is the first airport review I have ever written. But, I feel compelled to do this to warn others. I was very disappointed."
19th March 2019,3,"""poor planning, design, and management""","Not Verified |  Poorly designed. After a long bus ride from T3 to T5, it can take up to 30 minutes to get to your gate. The gate for my flight was assigned and posted on the board less than an hour before the thing took off! So fun not knowing just where I needed to be for my flight. Just poor planning, design, and management!"
12th March 2019,10,"""very well organised and clean""",✅ Trip Verified |   Terminal 5 arrivals is very well organised and clean. I love passing through the fast passport control E-gates system. I didn’t wait a lot for my laggage to be delivered. The terminal is very well connected to the other terminals and London.
3rd March 2019,1,"""Avoid going here""",Not Verified | The absolute worst airport that I have ever been to. They made me throw away all of my face products because you can only carry on one plastic bag of things. It took 2 hours to get from our first flight to our connecting flight. Absolutely ridiculous. The staff was very rude and disrespectful to me when I had questions. Avoid going here if you can help it.
2nd March 2019,3,"""rude and inconsiderate""",Not Verified |  Airport security staff at terminal 3 are rude and inconsiderate. No customer service skills nor empathy. Unfriendly. Airport management needs to invest more in their staff to increase job satisfaction and maybe hire people who are a better fit in dealing with customers.
27th February 2019,6,"""such dirty trays used""",✅ Trip Verified | Really unpleasant with such dirty trays used in Security. Further used for shoes as well as all other belongings that you would normally not expose to “door mat” environment. Does not match a modern western style airport experience.
25th February 2019,10,"""One of the best airports""","Not Verified |  One of the best airports. Great service, clean and a large variety of shops and restaurants. It would be nice to have aircraft spotting facilities. A third runway is definitely required. I would definitely recommend flying through London Heathrow Airport."
25th February 2019,3,"""expect the worst""
","✅ Trip Verified |   Terminal Two, 7pm on a Thursday evening. Quite possibly the worst airport check in experience ever. We are a family of four with a three year old and a one year old. Check in process is a shambles now with people queuing for four different flights down one lengthy maze of barriers. Only two assistants struggling to cope with the chaos. We were treated like animals, penned into a barrier tape maze for 90 minutes. My wife had to crawl under the barriers with a buggy to go and feed the younger child who was getting quite upset, again no airport staff to advise or assist. Fellow travellers gave up their turn in the queue for us as they could see the effect that this experience was having on the children. The terminal building is clean and well signed but under staffed. If you are going to depart from here, expect the worst and hope for the best."
14th February 2019,10,"""Amazing experience""
","Not Verified |  Amazing experience out of T5. Great fast track security, nice selection of shops and duty free. Never disappoints me. On the way back, a whiz through immigration. Compared to Gatwick or Amsterdam, miles ahead."
31st January 2019,9,"""quite a good airport""","✅ Trip Verified |  As a frequent user living in London I have to say it's quite a good airport nowadays, but with proviso that for transfer travellers I think its pretty awful. Great shops, food options and  security and immigration work quite well. "
22nd March 2022,1,"""no organisation whatsoever""",Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible airport now. Last time we used it it was so easy. Ignorant staff and no organisation whatsoever. Horrible security staff. He had no consideration for customers. People missed their flights. I understand there may be staffing issues due to recent events but there is no need for customers to be treated so appallingly.
21st March 2022,1,"""not be using this airport any more""","✅ Trip Verified |  I will not be using this airport any more. Its complete chaos, not sure who the CEO is but he/she needs to go! Cues for check in where so long they were leading into the walkway from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. The travellators in the connection walk-way not working either on the way there or the way back. Cues for security were out the door! Even with fast track it took far to long. Unfortunately, each time I have used this airport I tell myself I will never use it again. but this time has to be the last straw. Read a release on my holiday saying they had more people arrive at the airport then expected. How is this possible, and then then a simple ""sorry"" for the delays with security. I personally don't think this is good enough and will show with my feet by using a different airport next time I fly. Dropping someone off costs £5, you have to pay for a trolley for your baggage! Don't fall into the trap of thinking it is convenient to where you live. Its badly run and not a good start to any journey, be it for business or pleasure."
20th March 2022,1,"""have never experienced anything like it""","Not Verified |  This is the worst airport in the world. I am reasonably well travelled and have never experienced anything like it. The airport security staff all need to go on customer service skills training. They are rude and ignorant, barking orders. On my last ordeal I was reduced to tears. I have a pacemaker so was advised by my consultant to not go through the scanner. I showed my pacemaker card to a female security guard who let me through and then used a paddle to pat me down. Not satisfied with that she then frisked me. She then said she would need to swab me. Then in full view of everybody asked me to lift my jumper whilst she put the swab down the front of my jeans. I felt violated. "
17th March 2022,1,"""finally reached the front after 90 minutes""","Not Verified |  5 March departing for Cape Verde with Tui we were in a line waiting for check that went back as far as T1 from T2. We finally reached the front after 90 minutes, to find there were no face to face check in staff only Self Check in with very few members if staff to help One staff member took our passports from us and ran off somewhere with them, we could not see him and it was very worrying. He had gone to put them through a scanner but did not tell us that was what he was doing. Security wasn`t as bad to get through, however they are shunting trays containing personal valuable possessions out of the security scanner and onto the conveyor belt at a rate of knots, and those possessions are exposed because they are not letting the people through the scanner fast enough to keep up with the baggage check - very worrying. 17 March return journey from Cape Verde with Tui, flight not showing on internet search. Even the Tui rep could not get any information. We were told that it would be delayed by at least two hours due to problems at Manchester Airport. Through social media we did find out that it was due to staff problems trying to deal with volume of passengers. When we finally boarded, Tui announced that Manchester Airport had been unable to load new stocks of foods and beverages, so there was extremely limited availability for a 6 hour flight. Would I use Manchester airport again ? Absolutely no."
16th March 2022,1,"""a complete disgrace""",✅ Trip Verified |  I’m a frequent flyer with several airlines I live in Manchester and I have to agree that it is the worst airport in the world. Security today was 2hrs (priority fast track). Many stressed people missing flights! People crying and 1 minor scuffle. I made my flight my seconds but hundreds not so lucky! This is 2022 Manchester Airport simply not good enough! In fact a complete disgrace.
14th March 2022,3,"""shambles of a 3rd world airport""","Not Verified |  This airport is shambolic. I have been in many, many airports in cities around the world and this is comfortably the worst one. Organization is dreadful, airport is well outdated and grubby. One of the worst aspects is queueing for security on departure where you are constantly being barked at by staff and immigration / passport on arrival. Its such a shame that people in NW England have little alternative than to use this shambles of a 3rd world airport."
13th March 2022,1,Manchester Airport customer review,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight to Austria was scheduled to take off at 06.55 so arrived at the airport three hours before flight. Was shocked to see the queues at check-in/bag drop had filled the terminal area and were two hundred metres down the air bridge. It took two hours to get to the self-bag drop machines which refused to output the required tags for luggage, staff member printed all off separately and got us on our way. Wait, no we then had the joy of a one and a half hour queue for the ski drop scanner - apparently Manchester Airport has only one working scanner and this kept failing - at this point we were already thirty minutes late for take off and had yet to go through Security - another massive queue. Went straight down the fast track (without passes) and told the chap at the end that we were already late for the plane, after a detailed review of our boarding passes he let us through, even though we were then at the front of the queue, it still took a further twenty minutes to get through. Boarded the plane an hour after it should have taken off to find it waiting for the luggage to be loaded and other passengers to get through security. As an encore to this fiasco, we found that some of our luggage had been put on the wrong plane, honestly you could not make this stuff up. Manchester Airports response? ""We had an unexpected number of passengers"". I mean, it's not like the flights were scheduled and booked weeks ago is it. It was the same story on the return flight a week later. We took off three hours late from Innsbruck as the plane originally delayed in, yes you guessed it, Manchester! We landed two and a 1/2 hours late and it then took a further two and a half hours to offload the luggage from the plane. I feel sorry for the staff who have to deal with very frustrated passengers, this is not their fault. Management is non-existent they just keep booking the planes in even though they don't have enough trained check in staff, baggage handlers, security or border control staff. To add insult to injury you have to pay £5 to ""drop off"" passengers at this airport, even though you are stationary for circa sixty seconds, a total rip off."
12th March 2022,1,"""level of incompetence is unbelievable""","Not Verified |  Appalling experience this morning - five hours after getting up at 4am on site, we were still on the tarmac. Queueing several hundred yards on the skywalk outside Terminal 2, no check in desks open as the baggage system had failed. When given our boarding cards, finally at the front of the queue, we had to go to a machine to weigh bags and print labels ourselves. Try figuring out how to attach an airline label when your brain is not working - another long queue to get the bags on the couple of functional conveyor belts apparently for the whole terminal. Security a complete nightmare, another very lengthy queue, the usual removal of boots as expected but even my little wooly cardigan had to go in a tray. My hand luggage was taken for inspection but nothing unacceptable was found, don’t know what that was about. Now half an hour to takeoff and no gate on the screen, but another flight with the same airline and destination was taking off at the same time from the C gates - adjacent to security, so we went there although no catering or duty free. Our gate was displayed twenty minutes before takeoff - a B gate - last call was promptly announced, so we had to sprint back to security and out the other side, through duty free etcetera, a further significant distance, to find seated passengers and yet more waiting for a bus to the plane. The plane took off nearly two hours late, as apparently our bags had been loaded on the flight which left from the C gate and vice versa. The level of incompetence attaching to these organisations is unbelievable.  Anything but Manchester Airport"
8th March 2022,1,"""it was disorganised and chaotic""","Not Verified |  I have registered with the sole aim of posting a terrible review about this airport. I had to wait nearly an hour in a passport control queue on arrival, it was disorganised and chaotic. The staff were unhelpful and didn't appear to care. What really annoys me is looking at the web and finding that Manchester has been getting terrible reviews for years. Whoever owns it clearly doesn't seem to care what the public think as long as they are making money. Its not that hard to go and visit a decent airport and work out what you need to change is it? I will be trying my utmost to avoid this awful facility in the future."
8th March 2022,4,"""confusing signage upon arrival at Terminal 1""","✅ Trip Verified |  My comment is specifically around the confusing signage upon arrival at Terminal 1 departures. I arrived at the T1 Meet and Greet car park and entered the building from there. There was no clear sign pointing where to go for Terminal 1 departures, just a lift with a very confusing list of options. I had no idea where to go which is very stressful for anyone who may have been held up and be in a rush to check in. I wondered if it was just me being stupid but as I hung around trying different lifts / different floors, the people I encountered along the way were also clueless as to where they had to go. Eventually I found my way but lost lots of time in the process. Why is there not a clear sign for Terminal 1 departures / check- in desks as you go into that entrance?! This would be so easy to fix - such an easy win to improve the customer experience and the airport's reputation."
3rd March 2022,1,"""I had forgotten how unbelievably awful Manchester airport was""","Not Verified |  Grounded for 2 years of Covid, I had forgotten how unbelievably awful Manchester airport was. Obviously determined to retain its spot amongst the worst airports in the world and despite it apparently building a new terminal it remains the shambolic stressful mess of old. Staff training appears to focus on shouting at passengers, who are herded up and down alleys like livestock. Security experience is third world, crowded and chaotic. Premises are dowdy, stuffy and grim. Has no one in charge ever gone to see a modern airport? If you can avoid this airport you will be doing yourself a favour!"
2nd March 2022,2,"""Worst airport I have traveled from in recent years""","✅ Trip Verified | Long security delays, had paid for fast track but equipment failures still caused long delay. Totally disorganised, walked forever to get to the gate. Lack of catering. Worst airport I have traveled from in recent years."
25th February 2022,4,"""Communication very poor""","✅ Trip Verified | Departure of Manchester airport - very little mask wearing including by airport staff (probably less than 50%). Felt very unsafe. Arrival back into Manchester airport - suppose to arrive into Terminal 1. When we arrived, we were in a very small baggage collection area, baggage on floor getting in the way (this was not our luggage and I did hear this was from the day before). Took a long time to get baggage and then the security doors jammed. We were all stuck in this small area for about half an hour. No communication from any staff. Therefore running very late to get our transfer so when a tech man came and got the doors open, we were then released and found we were not in Terminal 1 and in fact we’re in the closed Terminal 3. Then had to go walk over to Terminal man1 arrivals to meet our transfer, another 10 minutes or so as have to leave one terminal walk outside and then get into the other terminal. None of this was communicated. Luckily our transfer did not charge us for the delay but this would no doubt cost them more money. Communication very poor. Dirty airport."
25th February 2022,1,"""Hugely inefficient""","Not Verified | Worst airport I’ve been to for a long time. Hugely inefficient, stupid layout for check-in, no seats to rest or anything, just an empty 3rd world hall. Even more stupid is the security checks. Long lines, antique equipment and lots and lots of manual labour."
24th February 2022,2,"""Very poor facilities""","✅ Trip Verified | Got to the airport early to finish off some work in the lounge, only to be told that the desk doesn't open until 2 hours prior to take off and there is no facility to accommodate me. Very poor facilities and my partner was charged £5 to drop me off. What a joke."
20th February 2022,1,"""waiting an hour an a half for bags with no updates""",Not Verified |  Absolute joke of an airport. Been waiting an hour an a half for bags with no updates. Departures last week just as poor. Taxi waiting and will leave without me I assume.
16th February 2022,1,"""it's so poorly run I would almost rather go to Liverpool""","Not Verified |  As a Mancunian I have to brave this airport anytime I wish to fly. It should be such a positive to have an international airport 25 minutes from my house but it's so poorly run I would almost rather go to Liverpool. Arrival is worse than departure. Departure is still bad but arrival is absolutely awful. What's truly amazing is that it always seems a surprise that there are people coming into the airport. Staff are never added to remove queues and there is absolutely no sense of staff pride in working there. I have been lucky enough to go to a lot of airports in my life, Manchester's is consistently and by some distance the worst run. The entire customer experience is designed to fleece people and waste as much of their time as possible if there were any local competition this place would be absolutely dead."
28th January 2022,1,"""every experience was awful""","Not Verified |  I have travelled via Manchester Airport a few times and every experience was awful. Each time I have thought it can only get better only for the next one to be even worse. It would be easier to list the good things about the airport than the bad because, yes, there isn't one good thing. Even their private lounge is dire. You'd think I would have learned my lesson by now. Well, I have. I will never, never use them again. "
28th January 2022,3,"""Manchester is one of the worst travel experiences I have had""","✅ Trip Verified | I recently traveled out of T2 at Manchester, with all the hype I was expecting a pleasant experience. Chose to travel there by train, got to the walkway and none of the travellators were working so it was quite a walk. Check-in was ok, security area was a bit small. From there you are guided to the yellow brick road of duty free winding round all the shops to get to the main area. Different food outlets on two levels and the lounges are at the back of beyond. Then came the time to get to the gates for departure another trek, again travellators not working and inexplicably it’s on two levels, no steps or a small lift down, the gate staff were disinterested, no directions as to seating for economy boarding or business, staff sat in a row of priority seats. Access to aircraft down stairs or very thin lift just to get to the skybridge. I have been to so called third world countries with better airport layouts. Manchester is one of the worst travel experiences I have had."
25th January 2022,2,"""things have not improved at all over the years""","Not Verified | Without doubt the worst airport in the world bar none. As a Mancunian I find this hard to say but as travelling overseas with work over the last couple of decades, I can safely say I have never been anything other than amazed at the lack of professionalism shown by the staff on security. The management must take some kind of perverse pleasure in watching people queuing. The norm is to queue until some member of staff starts shouting the next flight leaving so those unfortunates with the gate closing can get through. Surprised that things have not improved at all over the years but they haven’t."
29th December 2021,4,"""the queue snaked forever with no staff member knowing what to do""","✅ Trip Verified | Etihad had only four desks for check in, we arrived 3 hours before our flight to find the longest queue I’ve ever seen at MAN Airport. It took 2.5 hours to check in. Had bought fast track security in the new terminal, the security belt broke and the queue snaked forever with no staff member knowing what to do. We had no time to shop for goods for our holiday or buy food. We then sat on the tarmac for 2 hours as no bags had been brought to the plane. We missed our connecting flight as Etihad didn’t hold any of the connecting flights. Our son got covid and spent Christmas Day in a hospital in Abu Dhabi even though his only symptoms were a runny nose. Total shambles and they blame the passengers for turning up. Always been a terrible airport and has made travelling a stressful heading of cats experience. Disgusting place. Inadequate board members who are only interested in profit and not passengers or staff."
15th December 2021,4,"""past week was the worst I have experienced""","✅ Trip Verified |  Have been using MAN and LHR for transatlantic trips for 20+ years. MAN has always been very slow for check in and especially security clearance. This past week was the worst I have experienced ever. Stayed over in the airport hotel so we could enjoy a leisurely morning ahead of our 12.30 flight on Aer Lingus. Went to check in [doc check] at 9.20 a.m. (!!!!) with queue of maybe 15 people and 3 counters, looked good. Ended up taking 45 mins [staff break, general sluggishness then down to 1 counter as line swelled]. Entered security - unbelievable. Conga line was 4 layers deep and although 6+ lanes had staff, only 2 were open initially. When the doors had to be closed shut they finally opened more lanes but by then it was too late. Got through at 11.00 [yes 55 mins, which brings into question the published reports from MAN aiming for 92% of passengers through in <15 min??]. After a brisk 12 min walk (through the horrid commercial tack in T2) trying to find a restaurant, we see on the board we are asked to go to gate at 11.30 [~18 mins from now] hence no breakfast / relax. Thanks MAN - for a thoroughly lousy experience. We made it over the gate via the soul less A wing only to find that they would not in fact be boarding at 11.45, but 12.30. Aer Lingus staff seemed to be clueless and so many of them  sitting around doing nothing, and explains the lack of staff on check in desks pre-security. Overall very disappointing. Morning arrivals to MAN is not much better. On inbound leg, our flight landed at 5.45 am, and T2 has nothing open until after 7 am and even then it is a small coffee shop [all other shops have closed up], so be prepared to stand for 1h+ alongside a 200 yard queue of people waiting for Randox Covid testing to open [also at 7 am], as there are also no seats available. Car rental counters open at 8 on Saturdays, so no other options except hope for your early am flight to land later than published. Welcome to MAN. Typically [in 20+ years experience of MAN] security will take you at least 30 mins door to exit and check in seems to be also very slow, so the notion of being there 3h ahead of an international flight is actually very real [see above]. In my view this defeats the purpose of using a regional airport in the north. I can drive from LHR in less than 4h and the departing / arrivals is fast, professional, and reliable. Even more importantly, with multiple carriers, prices are MUCH cheaper due to competition so think very carefully before using MAN airport."
20th November 2021,3,"""what a mess""","Not Verified |  We went on holiday with Jet2 from terminal 2 at Manchester Airport, what a mess. On check in we were told to allow 15 min to walk to our gate as jet2 are based there, we are both in our late 70s and considered quite fit, although I have a problem walking a long distance, but do not expect such a distance at an Airport and therefore found the walk difficult both on the outward journey and on arrival at our inward journey. I feel that there are many people with the same problem as myself that do not fit the criteria for assistance. Therefore I feel the older generation that is a large portion of your business as been over looked. I hope that by bringing this matter to your attention something positive will come of it as we older generation are not quite giving up on life and holidays."
14th November 2021,2,"""Chaotic and lengthy security queues""","✅ Trip Verified |  Chaotic and lengthy security queues at Terminal 1 Security. This airport compares unfavourably with virtually every airport I have travelled to and from all over the world. Staff in Security are clearly under pressure and convey their frustration and annoyance in a rather hectoring atmosphere in their dealings with the public. Lengthy walking also between terminals since the powered walkways were all out of commission, and the distances are not inconsiderable especially if you, like me, had a hip replacement operation quite recently. This airports management need to take a long hard look at how their facility operates, there is plenty to improve, trust me."
2nd November 2021,1,"""I complained to Manchester airport and they did not answer""","Not Verified |  Complaining about the security at terminal 1 on behalf of my dad who's 87. The staff have no people skills especially to old people, my dad was made to take off his shoes after he forgot to take out his wallet they checked him again but buzzed. He then complained I have nothing in my pockets etc and then was made to go through the body scanner, he was mad with his treatment and he could not put on his shoes after as he has arthritis and his age. Avoid this airport. I complained to Manchester airport and they did not answer."
30th October 2021,2,"""Get more staff""",Not Verified |  Always the same. Waiting ridiculous times for hold luggage. Get more staff. For a sub 2 hour flight waiting one hour for luggage is unacceptable. It is usually waiting to get off the plane or waiting for luggage which lets this airport down. Will always choose an alternative airport if I can.
18th October 2021,1,"""Worst airport in the world""",Not Verified |  Worst airport in the world! Check in and security were not too bad but the New Terminal 2 is terrible. It’s obviously just a money making racket. Not interest in passenger needs. Very expensive eating places. Only Smiths available to buy any essentials. No Boots chemist only land side which is no use if you can only take hand luggage and want to buy toiletries at the airport. I would like to know which architects designed this terminal because I think a child could have done better. The ladies toilets are a disgrace. The water from the taps hits the back of the basins and splashes water everywhere so if you don’t realise you get all wet. Only two hand driers - a disgrace for the number of passengers that pass through. Hopefully will not have to use Manchester much anymore and will go to Liverpool when I can. It is a much better airport. What a waste of money this terminal is. Also the signs for driving into the airport car park are terrible. We have not been to T2 since lockdown and did not realise the road changes. So we ended up in the drop off area when we were actually trying to get to Multi storey car park East. Had to pay £5 for the privilege of driving through there only to return to the roundabout to see a small white sign with tiny arrows indicating where the car parks were. Good help any foreigners trying to find their way!
12th October 2021,1,"""does not care about customer service""","✅ Trip Verified |  Tui flight TOM 2623 landed from Palma at 15:47, my wife and I eventually received our two cases in T2 baggage handling at 17:20, a wait of 93 minutes, which, (considering there was only one other plane, from Tenerife, being unloaded at the same time) is completely unacceptable. The luggage when it eventually started to be delivered, appeared in dribs and drabs of 3-4 cases at a time with long periods of total inactivity, just what was going on? Needless to say there was no explanation provided for this prolonged delay, nor were there any handling agents available to enquire of. We were not the last to receive our luggage as there were 20-30 people still waiting after we left the baggage hall. I will in future choose either Liverpool or Leeds-Bradford to fly from as it appears that Manchester Airport Group just does not care about customer service, meeting acceptable service levels or communicating operational inefficiencies - I will vote with my feet !"
18th September 2021,2,"""Bullying rude security staff""","Not Verified |  Bullying rude security staff, horrible cramped queue in T1, shouted at and humiliated by a security man, left me in tears. I would rather not travel than use this horrible airport."
3rd September 2021,1,"""Barbaric treatment!""","Not Verified |  The worst experience of my life in T2! Arriving to my home country and city after a slightly delayed flight from Malta - first holiday in over 2 years to stand in a 2000 people deep, super spreader event queue for passport/border force control for almost 3 hours! There were only 4 passport control officers on duty! Herded like cattle, with no opportunity to social distance on a hot August day, sun beaming through large windows with no access to toilet or even water! So say customer service staff useless - how were they socially distancing the at least 5/6 flight loads of passengers? All mixing from our green to amber destinations - incredible! Barbaric treatment! Even though Manchester is my home town I cannot see my family and I travelling through this airport again!"
30th August 2021,1,"""The staff are rude""","Not Verified |  This airport has the slowest, worst and inefficient airport security system I’ve ever seen at any airport. The staff are rude, lecture you on hidden rules regarding what needs to go inside a tray or not. Twice I’ve departed Manchester in a month, both times it took almost an hour to get through security, with most people’s bags being set aside for secondary inspection. The equipment they use is either broken, old or incorrectly setup. There were more bags on the secondary inspection belt than the main one. A trash airport experience, I understand security has to be high - but I fly all over the world regularly, and this airport security is the worst I’ve ever encountered. Avoid if possible."
30th August 2021,1,"""a pretty dire experience""","Not Verified |  Extortionate drop off charges. 0 to 5 minutes cost £5! A real rip off and sets the tone for the rest of your experience at the airport. Mayhem at security, underwhelming departure lounge, poor sign posting, and gating areas too small so passengers including families with small children are having to queue up the stairwell. Overall a pretty dire experience."
21st August 2021,1,"""Very rude staff at security""","Not Verified |  Very rude staff at security at terminal 1, need retraining. Hall small, cramped, long queues. Some chairs in seating area ripped. Expensive parking. Will need to train staff at security."
17th August 2021,1,"""Awful security processes and rude staff""","Not Verified |  Awful security processes and rude staff. Recently had the misfortune to travel via Manchester airport’s T1 - out of the numerous flight journeys we’ve made worldwide, Manchester airport has been our worst security experience by far. They have the most pointless, inefficient system we’ve come across anywhere and nothing that makes air travel any safer. This is topped by the rudest, most unprofessional staff who should never be in a customer-facing role. Every electronic item has to touch the tray base 100% with not even any overlap, bags ‘lengthwise’ even if it fits perfectly inside the tray any other way, bags containing liquids can only be in their bags even if its only 1 chapstick in a slightly bigger bag - and there was a seemingly middle-aged male security staff who kept rudely shouting at my children and I even while we were trying to sort items as per their rules, leaving my children upset and worried. I was made to go through the body scanner and then frisked again by a security staff, not sure what the point of the body scanner was then. It took us around a 45-minute wait in the queue to get to the security and another 15 minutes to get through it. The whole experience was a nightmare like no other and I would rather drive longer to another airport than fly from Manchester again."
20th July 2021,1,"""it took 50 minutes to go through security""","Not Verified |  I would like to take this opportunity to warn other passengers of the stress and time it takes to go through security in Manchester UK airport. Was flying today from Manchester - Belfast and it took 50 minutes to go through security in turn meant that 10 passengers missed their flight. This is certainly not the first time I have had this issue at the airport. When queuing for security, I notified one of the security staff that my flight was boarding and they informed me that there was time and it would be ok. When I got to the scanner, the system broke down and had to be transferred to another unit. This airport is a shambles and I cannot believe it is allowed to continue. When finally reaching the departure gate to be told the flight had closed, the Easyjet staff were equally ignorant. Their single line was ""Security of the airport is nothing to do with Easyjet"". It is only unbelievable."
14th July 2021,1,"""One of the worst airports I have ever experienced""",Not Verified |  One of the worst airports I have ever experienced. Even if you arrive in time 2+ hours before the flight you still can miss your flight. They can't handle people. Security is very poor as well! I travel few times a month via various airports so I have something to compare.
17th June 2021,1,"""absolutely extortionate parking charges""","Not Verified |  Appalling. Ridiculous parking system, absolutely extortionate parking charges, and over-priced drinks. Rude, unhelpful staff and nothing that would pass for anything like ""customer service"". Painfully slow WiFi that they have the audacity to charge for, long queues for everything from check in, to security, to boarding, and the decor and ambiance of a 1970s prison. The worst airport I have ever had the misfortune of arriving in or departing from and an utter disgrace to the United Kingdom. If it were possible to give 0/10, I would."
9th May 2021,4,"""Mouse or was it a Rat?""","Not Verified |  Mouse or was it a Rat? Carrying on the theme of Manchester Airport being unclean: Every time I have to fly from Manchester I notice how appallingly grubby it is, (not to mention the travelators which are rarely ever all working on the same day!) with accumulated grime in many locations. But one visit stands out above all others - when climbing the stairs from the toilets near the departure gate, I was rather surprised to see something small and furry running on the step above, a baby rodent! Quite unbelievable to find a mouse in a UK international airport terminal. Two girls descending screamed and I immediately looked for a staff member, I found a 'large' bloke in a hi-viz vest sitting scoffin' his 'scran' who casually replied: 'Yeah, they're all over mate - the place is infested with 'em, they're in the roof!' Then continued to eat - never even got up to look or report it! I later googled images of young rodents, I have a horrible feeling it was a baby rat! Manchester Airport takes no notice of complaints - one employee told me in hushed tones to contact the local mayor Andy Burnham as according to him the council considerably subsides the operation. Maybe I will."
6th April 2021,1,"""It all feels very uneasy and unpleasant""","Not Verified |  On arrival you get hit by charges. Pay to park for the covid test, pay to drop off, pay pay pay. No idea where that money is funneled, certainly not in keeping the place tidy as the airport is sad and dirty. It's covid, so most of the departure area is understandably closed. However, it also means all departure passengers are cattled around three rows of seats. Despite the loudspeakers telling us every five minutes that masks must be worn at all times and that security check, many passengers aren't wearing their mask. It all feels very uneasy and unpleasant."
19th March 2021,1,"""filthiness, over-commercialisation""","✅ Trip Verified |  Unfortunately this is my nearest major airport, so I have little choice but to use it. But Manchester Airport never fails to set new standards for its filthiness, over-commercialisation, and rip-off charges at all stages - parking especially. As a major gateway to the UK, the airport creates a disgracefully poor image for the UK. Compared to other major regional airport in comparable countries - take your pick of modern, spotless airports throughout Europe - Manchester Airport is a national embarrassment due to slovenly and greedy management. In normal times Manchester Airport makes several hundred million pounds of profit per year - enough to not fleece passengers for car parking (or even just dropping off - there’s no way to avoid the charges), and enough to maintain basic hygiene. For me, there is no worse Airport in the world."
20th December 2020,1,"""horrified by the treatment of the security staff""","✅ Trip Verified | I am horrified by the treatment of the security staff. They kept me waiting for literally 1 whole hour just unpacking my whole suitcase, checking each one of my make up products, going over every single part of my suitcase, grabbing my toothbrush and swabbing it, as if they had never seen a toothbrush before. They just seemed to enjoy making a big deal out of absolutely every product within my bag, then said that products like toothbrushes and phone chargers need rechecking. I almost lost my flight due to their incompetence and rudeness. They did the same to a very old couple just ahead of me, the old lady having to sit down while his husband had to repack both their suitcases. Absolutely appalling behaviour from the staff at Manchester airport, I had already heard bad reviews and experiences by this was just a joke. I will try to avoid travelling from Manchester at all costs."
23rd September 2020,1,"""I was appalled by the rudeness of the security staff""","Not Verified |  I've been flying from Manchester since the mid 80's and always found it the best in my region for the choice of destinations. I lived abroad for a number of years and recently returned to live in the UK. This was my first foreign trip from Manchester in 10 years and I was appalled by the rudeness of the security staff. I'm used to travelling with hand luggage only. Normally I pop my case on, take out my laptop, clear bag with liquids in and place them in a tray. I have it all down to a fine art. Now this time I had to put my laptop in one tray, my liquids in another and my cabin bag in another. My mother also ended up with two trays, so five between two of us. We then had to queue for ages to get through the one and only metal detector in that area and the staff were shouting at everyone to move quickly. At the other end a snotty woman was shouting at people to pick up their trays and take to the packing area. That's all very well when you just have one, but five, seriously. When trying frantically grab things and condense into one tray so I can carry it to the crowded packing are with no space, she's shouting at me saying 'It's not rocket science!' I've never been treated with such rudeness. I then had my case searched because of a tiny pair of fold up nail scissors which have been all over the world with me in 10 years with no issues. Doncaster Sheffield airport is 20 min from me where the staff treat you with respect and I've already booked my next hol from there. You can get to many popular holidays destinations from there and it's clean, modern and friendly. Why would I drive for two hours to be treated like a piece of dirt by people whose wages I'm paying? Just because they work on security they think it gives them carte blanche to be rude and unprofessional. With a lack of passengers due to covid, airlines cutting back on flights and cancelling holidays the staff should be welcoming passengers not driving them away. I can't honestly see Manchester still operating 3 terminals this time next year. Terminal one is also grubby and dated. I used to live in Manchester and loved it but having been back several times in the last year I've experienced nothing but rudeness at both the train stations and now the airport. No wonder I've heard people referring to it as the 'Nasty Northwest' lately. Heathrow must deal with millions more passengers every year and it's much more polite and professional."
18th September 2020,1,"""I’d rather drive 4 hours to Stansted""","✅ Trip Verified | For years the security personnel at Manchester have been the worst in the world, rude, cocky, arrogant, confused, then after the lockdown in July they transformed they polite, knowledgeable and spoke to their customers (yes customers, our business pays their wages) live humans rather than like dogs. Then comes September, obviously fed up with being polite they are back, they all have different instructions have not got a clue and so arrogant and rude, I’d rather drive 4 hours to Stansted they should at least all bark the same instructions I’d sack the lot of them if they worked for me, absolute morons."
27th July 2020,1,"""Hope the pandemic causes a mindset change""","Not Verified |  Must be the worst airport in the world, security treat people like dogs. Lounges are always full. Its the whole attitude of the staff. They have had it easy for years. Now that crunch time has come they may start to treat people like customers, in a friendly and happy manner. We are going on our holidays. We do not want to be abused by staff from start to finish. Its a dreadful experience. We pay your wages, we are on a hard earned break and you ruin the start of it. Its appalling. As far as the lounges go the staff are a disgrace. You feel lucky to get in any lounge even though you have paid an annual fee. Hope the pandemic causes a mindset change. The only nice people at Manchester are Jet2 staff. What a breath of fresh air to get to the Jet2 gate and the staff are so lovely. What a change."
23rd July 2020,1,"""Utterly poor customer service""","✅ Trip Verified |  Security was absolutely shambolic. Travelling with family/children? Avoid like the plague. Especially security B. Post lockdown levels of passengers yet still a long queue as only one scanner open. By the way, security B is a maze of stairs and hidden lifts. I’m travelling alone with a toddler who will not leave my side during security yet it’s insisted I stand alone in the body scanner. Toddler leaves my side for no more than 5 seconds, and security staff grab her by the wrist and pulls her away from me in the scanner, whilst another coworker fails in his attempts at entertaining/distracting my toddler with a tray. Toddler freaks out with the woman grabbing her by the wrist and ends up getting extremely upset and clinging to my leg and screaming at the top of her lungs. I sternly ask her not to do that as she’s hurting and upsetting my already stressed child. She would not have grabbed an adult by the wrist and pulled like she did to my daughter, whilst my daughter panics and cries out for me. I ask if we can’t just go through the walk through scanner, and she says no - the rules are that if the body scanner is available I must be scanned in that, and that she’s just doing her job. So they finally decide to do a complete search instead. A supervisor turns up to hover but has nothing useful or comforting to say. When I tell her we were forced to go through the body scanner travelling alone with a child, the woman pipes up and says we weren’t forced to go through it. And says this repeatedly, contradicting me. However, I was certainly not offered a choice!! Meanwhile my daughter is begging and crying for her pacifier which is on the tray going through the bag scanner rolls eyes which I’d been asked to send through with the bags because it was bulging in my pocket. She pats me down. Then tells me she also needs to do the same to my daughter (having man handled her earlier). I explain to my daughter what’s about to happen (woman tries to tell my daughter she’s going to give her a tickle), woman looks to me for approval, and I tell her to just do it quickly and get it over with. A completely unnecessarily stressful experience with zero consideration nor respect for children. Utterly poor customer service."
5th April 2020,7,"""An amazing experience""","Not Verified | An amazing experience through Manchester, except security. Staff at security were shouting 'All liquids in bags' (super loud). Check-in and boarding was all good. Food was good too"
19th March 2020,5,"""a very grubby space""","✅ Trip Verified | Meet and greet parking location is nice and convenient but horrendous queues to drop off car keys in the terminal. Drab airport interior and this theme is continued around security processing with low ceilings and generally cramped queuing areas. Paid for fast track so skipped most of the lines, but a very grubby space. Gate areas are slightly better for space and light, but terrible seating choices and average washroom cleanliness. Not an airport to hang around in. On arrival, immigration kiosk queues were modest and baggage was quick. Baggage area toilets similarly weak appearance. Rather confusing system of automatic retrieval for car keys at meet and greet area but staff there to assist."
14th March 2020,1,"""Avoid this place like the plague""","Not Verified |  The airport security team is the most horrid experience in all my travels. You literally have to take almost everything out of your bags. Anything with a cord, any liquid, all electronics. Oh and boots off but not any other shoe. So bizarre. We had like 12 bins with all our stuff taken out and a tiny area for everyone to repack. The security ladies are snarky and absolutely rude! If I can avoid this airport in the future I will at all costs. I made a comment to my husband how inefficient this security process was. Well big mistake because one of the ladies heard me and proceeded to rip me a new one for 5 minutes in front of my children. I even told her to stop talking to me like that in front of my kids and she said she is concerned with my behavior and what I will be like on the plane if I’m told something I don’t like. Really lady! Get a life. Never ever had this experience. Avoid this place like the plague if you can. I am mortified with the way they treat people."
12th March 2020,1,"""It was complete chaos""","✅ Trip Verified | My partner and I have vowed never to use this airport again. I was expected to place my asthma inhalers in the liquids bag (they are powder) and put out my hair straighteners separately. No other airport does this. Security check staff were shambolic and incompetent, and also rude. The time from placing articles in the trays to leaving the security area was over an hour. My partner's trays were scanned and diverted to the additional check area. The member of staff asked the question ""has anyone interfered with this tray since you packed it"". Only the security staff had access to it! He then returned the trays to the scanner, one of which was again diverted. The tray with his coat was sent through. Another member of staff picked up the tray from the middle of the rapidly-filling conveyor and returned it to be put through the scanner again. This time the tray and contents were ok to be collected. All the time this was happening, two customer interviewers were completing interviews on their tablets themselves, without referring to customers. There were also Union people milling around with clipboards. It was complete chaos, with disgruntled customers hanging around waiting for their trays and the staff not doing their jobs. When one customer stated that no other airport in the UK goes through such measures, he was told ""no other airport cares about your security""."
7th March 2020,2,"""The absolute pits and a rip off""","✅ Trip Verified | The absolute pits and a rip off. I use MAN as my UK Hub every time I fly in/out, four times per year, in and out. I can almost excuse the deplorable Security Staff's rudeness. It must be a thankless task but they do give the impression of not caring how long they take. If they check a bag you get the full treatment at their pace. Camera out. Book out. Laptop already out. I tried to retrieve my handkerchief to deal with an incipient sneeze and actually got my hand slapped with the search wand. Really. Perhaps they wanted my germs? But that is not my chief gripe with this rip off. We pay a few bob in landing fees to use the place and they cannot even supply a trolley without stealing another quid off you. I know of no other airport that charges for luggage trolleys. It is not as though they are not making money from the forced march through acres of shops that create an obstacle course on your way to the gate. And to cap it all they are now removing any payphones that one can use to call friends and family to advise progress and arrange pick up. What a place. And they talk about a £1Bn improvement plan. Well I can tell them where they should spend that kind of money in providing a decent place to fly from. Seats. Signs and service to those paying for it. I can't say 'Never again' as sadly I need to use it to serve my travel needs."
7th March 2020,2,"""It gets worse every time""","✅ Trip Verified | It gets worse every time I travel from Manchester airport. Security checks vary - shoes off, belts off, watches, pockets emptied of everything or a combination of the above. Today my bag was taken off the track and eventually we got it without swabbing! A random selection apparently. The swabbing team seem to delight in the anxiety caused. Not surprised to find that many others agree with me. Not been to a worse airport security set up."
6th March 2020,1,"""The worst security wait ever at this airport""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst security wait ever at this airport. Travelled 000's of miles in many different airports in the world and this is the worst - one and a quarter hours in a cattle pen waiting to go through the security process. Appalling management. No contingency planning, no capacity for remedial action. Complained to customer services - in their response they said their target wait was fifteen minutes and they were implementing a programme of customer service training. I explained that this was not the point. In view of their waiting target they had failed by 500% and no amount of smiling at people would cure chronic management failures on that scale. Hopeless. Liverpool is now my preferred gateway to the North West. Very frustrating that Manchester Airport Group uses its customer service to insulate senior executives from the impact on customers of their poor management."
4th March 2020,1,"""Scruffy, lazy staff""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst airport in the world. Scruffy, lazy staff. And the rudest security staff imaginable. I've travelled a lot, but the way one is treated in the queue to security before check in is unimaginably bad. 2 men shouting at travellers, completely unacceptable."
29th February 2020,1,"""security procedure is an absolute shambles""",Not Verified |  The security procedure is an absolute shambles and extremely inefficient for an international airport that handles a lot of passengers every day. They were pulling a lot of bags to the side and it seemed that they would deliberately take their time and were showing no concern that people had flights to catch. The staff were very abrupt and somewhat rude. Terrible staff and airport.
23rd February 2020,7,"""Customs was very smooth and empty""","Not Verified |  Departures: Terminal 1 is acceptable excluding the drop-off and parking. First you go through the check-in hall which is fairly spacious but needs a do-over but it only gets worse from there. Next you go down a fairly small set of stairs into security. T1 security is a packed, stuffy, low-ceilinged hellhole of a room. Luckily I got through there fairly fast and into the departures lounge, which is the best part of the terminal - it is modern, open and packed to the brim with toilet facilities and shops, along with a travel-money stand, which is quite useful. Unfortunately there is a long hike through a department store to get to the gates. On the other side of the store the were some fast-food chains and a large window with a bench and table running across it. This is a plane-spotter's paradise. My flight was at gate 21 which I found to be downstairs, on a wall there was an illustration and some writing saying that there was free wifi for 3 hours, never used it though as I was on my mum's hotspot. We took a packed to the brim bus to parking stand 71, past where the FedEx 757 hibernates during the day to our Thomas Cook airbus A321. It was raining out (no surprise) and we had to take slippery, corrugated steps up the the narrow-body airbus which could have had something over it to make it less dangerous. Arrival: This time we got a jet-bridge and it was very fast getting off MT-231 and traversing our way through the terminal. Customs was very smooth and empty, and before we knew it we were out onto the carpark."
23rd February 2020,1,"""Most appalling service in all areas""",✅ Trip Verified | Most appalling service in all areas. Very intimidating security with the most stupid and nonsense procedures which don’t make a flight any more secure. It seems as if they employ staff who leave their remains of a brain at home when they come to work. Moreover the amount of shopping offers you have to work your way through till you are able to get to the gates feels like a violation of my right to choose with whay kind of marketing I am bombarded with. Will try to avoid this airport.
17th February 2020,1,"""airport is just a high cost bus station""","Not Verified |  Drop-off parking is just robbery wearing a uniform. I have always viewed this airport as a jewel in the crown of the North West, but they have just proved to be the same cowboys as every other rip-off airport in the UK. This airport is just a high cost bus station. Shame on you!"
12th February 2020,10,"""we had extremely good experiences""","Not Verified |  I know this is going to be surprising, but we had extremely good experiences travelling through MAN T1 recently. I was amazed at the difference from previous times using this airport. Security on departure was polite and friendly to the point of joviality. Both our bags were diverted for manual checks (correctly, as we had forgotten to take out certain items that should have gone in the tray) and these were done quite swiftly, with everything being pleasantly explained. On arrival (6:30 a.m.) there were no queues, passport scanners worked fine, and our priority bags were in the first 10 or so to be delivered from the A380. We were in the car within 20 minutes of leaving the aircraft. I have to give MAN 10/10 and say that I would recommend, based on this experience."
11th February 2020,1,"""no customer service skills""","Not Verified |  Disgusting customer service around the car park of Terminal 1. I was spoken to very rudely and in a patronising manner by a woman in a high vis jacket when I asked her for directions. Totally unnecessary and downright rude. Then on my exit out of the car park, I asked the man over the intercom a question about payment and once again I was patronised for absolutely no reason. These people have no customer service skills and are unnecessarily rude."
10th February 2020,2,"""like something from the 1980s""","Not Verified |  Terminal 3. Grubby, slow, what few staff there are are rude and uninterested, very slow security with sarcastic security staff. Toilets dirty, seating area cramped and badly organised, poor choice of food and drink outlets. Non existent wifi. Overall like something from the 1980s."
1st February 2020,2,"""I now dread using it""","Not Verified |  I have used Manchester airport many times in the past but I now dread using it. Queues are always awful, staff not interested, just an all round horrible start to a holiday, and having to pay to pick up or drop off is corporate greed at its worst. The management seem to bury their heads in the sand and always have an excuse blaming everything but their incompetence to run an airport. Hate it."
26th January 2020,1,"""staff are lazy and uninterested""","Not Verified |  This has to be the worst airport I have ever flown through. The staff are lazy and uninterested (particularly in the car park and security areas) and at times verge on arrogant. They would do well to remember that without the passengers they wouldn't have jobs. The whole set up is old and tatty and inefficient, staff standing around chatting and hugging one another while passengers are waiting to be processed. I long got the day when I never have to fly through this horrible place again. Take a leaf out of Leeds book, they actually know how to run an airport. Sort your car parks out bunch of arrogant robbing con men."
25th January 2020,1,"""experience fills me with dread""","Not Verified |  I have extensive experience of many airports around the world. I can honestly say that Manchester is by far the worst. It is worse even than all 3rd world airports I have used. The whole experience fills me with dread in the anticipation of what is come every time I have to arrive or depart. The facilities are old and tatty, the staff are rude and uncaring and the security staff have no consistency in the way they manage. Over the past 10 years I have seen a gradual and steady decline in standards. The Manchester Airport Group (MAG) have recently introduced pickup and drop off charges. They will not doubt defend that decision as helping to reduce vehicle traffic, or even under the banner of some environmental initiative. Well, I don’t believe them. This in my opinion is yet another cynical attempt to extract more money from travellers. Will it help to fund improvements in infrastructure or improve passenger experience? I don’t think so. I think it will just help to improve the annual bonus of executives. For many of us there is no option and we have to use Manchester Airport. But, if there is any other option I will always take it."
22nd January 2020,1,"""worst airport in the world""","Not Verified |  Just collected our dear friends from the Tenerife flight landed at 6.55pm Tom 2203, we had to go to the new terminal 2 multi storey car park, we could not even get in we had to quueu to get in. When we finally got to the barriers there were 4 lanes that all had to turn left to get in with no dedicated lanes we had to edge in bumper to bumper and side of car to side of car so close there was beeping/shouting and we could hear arguments at the barriers to get out too. You drive all the way round on the ground level to the disabled bays where are friends have to wait as they are disabled. Cars where trying to back out to exit and had nowhere to go as we where all coming in, they were forcing there way out because of the charges and time limits and even unconcerned about pedestrians with cases and children trying to find there taxis or lifts. We could not park our poor friends had to jump in the car as we gradually moved along, then we too had to queue to get out. It took longer to get in/out of this awful car park than it did for our friends to get off the plane collect their cases and get through security. The worst airport in the world and we've been to many. This system is not working, and wont work even when it's finished, its mainly due to the greedy airport owners, something needs to be done NOW but of course that won't happen until someone is killed in that airport car park. From What I saw tonight I'm afraid that wont be long. If you have a choice go to another airport. Ps. we flew into Manchester Terminal 2 on 3rd January after being away for new year, please be aware if you have mobility problems it's a 1 kilometer walk from the gate to security far to far away."
21st January 2020,2,"""it is appalling""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst airport in the world. When we arrived at terminal 2 on the 11th January 2020 at 20.15 we were appalled at the long walk after departing from Jet2. We also waited ages to get through passport control. After a lovely holiday we had to cart 4 cases to the west point for our taxi. We are in our 70s and our backs were sore by the time we got there, it spoilt our holiday. The queue was long and taxis all over the place, we spent nearly 2 hours in this airport, I booked good flights we only live 30 mins from the airport and we did not get home until 10.45. It puts you off. Something must be done, what about people in wheelchairs experiencing this horrendous state of affairs. It has put us off going abroad, we travel 4 times a year. I have spoken to my friends and they agree it is appalling please take note."
13th January 2020,1,"""the most unusable airport in the world""","✅ Trip Verified | T2 Dreadful place. As an older person who has stopped running marathons years ago, T2 is by far the most unusable airport in the world for people who are not ""disabled"" but have some mobility issues. I understand the theory of having to wind your way through duty free after the undermanned under resourced security area and the miles of cattle fencing for check-in. I was told off for not using it even when it was empty. (we are forced to check in mega early for these reasons). We wont mention the bars full of drunks first thing in a morning. After leaving the Aspire or Escape lounges which themselves are pretty poor compared to the rest of the world. The walk to the gates is several hundred yards at least, too much for families and the elderly and as yet the walkway has never been working. (its only short anyway) I have been there when the lifts were not working either. So unless you set off to the gate the instant is shows on the screens you will be late and incur the wrath of rude ground staff. The sit down on the aircraft is most welcomed IF you don't have to wind round steps and up steps to the aircraft. This is too much for some people and very definitely a security risk, that is another story. Don't mention special assistance, it takes forever, no staff, no chairs, wrong size etc, etc. plus it precludes you from having an extra legroom seat, and we are the people in most need of the legroom. Coming back is something to be feared, it is over 1 kilometer from the gate to the pick-up point and even for able bodied people dragging cases and children is a very long way. Landed at 14.05 today and it was over 1 hour 40 minutes before we were on our way and most of that was walking, blistered feet exhausted. It is an extra 30 minutes by car to Liverpool for us so we would have been home before we even left Manchester airport. I travel very regularly and have been to 73 countries in my life so I have some airport knowledge. Never again, the architects need shooting. I understand the available footprint and the budget constraints but the most terrible place in the world to travel from/to."
13th January 2020,6,"""somewhere I would prefer to avoid""","✅ Trip Verified | We were due to fly from Liverpool to Mallorca until easyJet cancelled their January flights, but we were able to transfer to flights via Manchester. We weren't thrilled at the prospect, having avoided Manchester for some years now on the basis of its size and overcrowding. In the event, things were much better than expected, mainly because both flights were at quiet times of day. Passage through security took only a few minutes and, though both of us had our hand luggage selected for separate inspection, the security staff were very pleasant and in no way officious. On our return, we were quickly through the electronic passport gates and actually back to our car in JetPark 1 within 20 minutes or so of landing. So, as far as the basic function of transit from car park to plane and back again was concerned, we had no problems at all. I would still say, however, that Manchester airport is somewhere I would prefer to avoid: some of the signage is confusing, many of the seats in the main central area of Terminal One were ripped and in need of replacement and the route from plane to terminal exit seemed to involve several staircases up or down. The sight of the extensive chicanes at security and passport control, not in use when we transited, was also a clear indication of what the airport must be like at peak times. As for finding one's way around the exterior of the airport, I can only be glad that all we needed was to access JetPark 1 and let the transfer bus drivers do the rest! All in all, though we actually got off very lightly, our enforced return to Manchester made us appreciate Liverpool airport all the more."
9th January 2020,1,"""Very poorly trained arrogant staff""","✅ Trip Verified | The queue was very short at security and my bags went through the scanner but I was delayed as I was patted down by a female security guard. The zip on my top had set off the machine. That was not an issue. The issue was with the security guard who when through my bag. He completely emptied my bag opened my medicine bag and removed all my medication, reading each label and was shaking it about. When I told him my medication was personal. He told me medication had to be declared as part of the liquids bag which is untrue. He then held me up for 20 mins as he swapped by bag 3 times! And put it through the machine 3 times just to delay me. I stood there laughing at the unprofessional approach he choose to take. Very poorly trained arrogant staff in this airport the machines are oversensitive. That week I had travelled from Dublin to London, Exeter to Manchester, Manchester to Exeter and tomorrow I will be flying back to Dublin. The only place I had an issue or was been patted down is Manchester. I suppose the have to justify their job."
8th January 2020,2,"""depressing, tired, dirty and uninspired airport""","Not Verified |  Probably the most depressing, tired, dirty and uninspired airport I have come across. The seating areas are miserable, limited and uncomfortable. The selection of food is limited, carb heavy and it usually necessitates a long wait for a sit down meal. The shops are a basic high street selection. What a missed opportunity. If this was an advert for Manchester you would skip a visit. The security area (unless you pay) is in a dingy basement and painfully slow. Want a luggage trolley? You pay for that. Want wifi for a little longer? You pay for that. Want to get picked up? You pay for that. Until recently, they even charged for those little security bags. Money-grabbing. Passport control, if you hit it at the wrong time, is woefully under staffed and the electronic gates seem like first gen. Even the layout is adhoc, you will be climbing and descending stairs trying to get to your gate. There is really no need for it. It handles around 27m passengers, less than Copenhagen which is far superior. If you can go somewhere else, do so."
8th January 2020,2,"""T3 is an absolute disaster""","Not Verified |  Far and away the worst airport in the UK. T3 is an absolute disaster! Starting with departures security, the queues are beyond long caused without doubt by the condescending personnel who are downright rude to everyone, without exception. I know this is a serious job, but other airports manage it with far more humility. After this torture you then pass into a both dated and limited (facilities) departures area, again queues for anything and everything. On return a 1 hour wait for in line for UK/EU immigration, just embarrassing."
2nd January 2020,1,"""The security is the worst""",Not Verified |  The security is the worst I have ever experienced. What is the meaning of fast track? The airline is paying the Airport (abt 20 pounds) for facilitating passengers using the Airport. How an earth can they arrange fast track and expect passengers to pay again? They are paid for a smooth and properly organised security check! Dropping off fee. Do they really expect passengers to haul their Luggage into a bus and drag it out at the actual entrance? Picking up at T3 An absolute disaster. Having to walk in rain and cold to the parking lot. Then pay £4.50 for two minutes?
26th December 2019,1,"""What a nightmare airport!""","Not Verified |  What a nightmare airport! Manchester is getting worse and worse as the management continue their programme of monetising every single use of the miserable place. Just about the only part still free is the scruffy toilets. Now they have messed up the short term parking at T3 by leaving plastic separators where you used to be able to nip in, park, meet your visitors and be on your way quickly. Nobody objected to paying for that but now they force you to drive round and round their car park and to add insult to injury they have removed the pay stations from the meeting area in T3. This leaves visitors feeling stressed, aggrieved and ripped off. For half an hour of parking in this national embarrassment we paid seven pounds! The staff who run this place ought to take some of their loot and jump on a plane to visit the beautiful, clean, spacious, well-run airports at Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban for some lessons in how an airport can be a pleasant place to visit. As a frequent business traveller I can also say that Security at Manchester is a horrible experience as the staff are rude, bolshy jobsworths. Any South African airport or Schiphol will show them how Security should be done. I despair, I really despair. What hope is there for the fabled Northern Powerhouse with this level of greed and incompetence at this important airport."
24th December 2019,1,"""wheelchair facility is shambles""","Not Verified | Manchester T-2 parking is worst for people with disabilities. The parking area has no wheelchairs or trolley. I asked for wheelchair assistance through a call and no one came for me for 40 minutes, I felt cold and my husband was getting vexed and upset as he is a wheelchair user too. By walking my daughter counted it to 480 steps from door to parking area and to check-in 540 steps. This is horrific and inconsiderate of Manchester airport. The parking attendants wheelchair facility is shambles. After check-in, my husband and I waited for 1 hour to be taken for security."
16th December 2019,1,"""It is by far the worst ever""","Not Verified |  Twice in the past weeks have I had what I would rate as the worst airport. The moment you arrive you are harried and barked at by staff entering Security, after managing to pass on fast track I was trying to sort out my Plastic bags to the Regulation 20 x 20 there was noboby else in fast track but the lady 'Marshal' was harassing me at 6am! Then you are treated as a child I have travelled internationally for more than 30 years and will actively look for alternatives if possible, even now I am dreading the assault course I shall face on wednesday on my return and the size of the passport queue. How many of the 6 auto machines will be broken, got into the US last month faster than returning to UK! It is by far the worst ever."
13th December 2019,1,"""filthy and the toilets stink""","Not Verified |  This is my local airport and I use it at least 4 times per month for a mix of business and pleasure. There is no element of the arrival or departure experience that is delivered with competence. T2 parking is miles from actual building, use public transport- even further away. Security staff surly and rude and call out items that are not a problem at any other airport. Every part of the building is filthy and the toilets stink. Shopping worst in any major airport. The main terminals dont have seating- do have plenty of places to ply you with beer. Food quality is shocking."
9th December 2019,7,"""staff at the airport could be more informed and helpful""","Not Verified |  So my friend (I do his UK travel arrangements) was diverted by easyJet from Birmingham to Manchester, what a joke. He arrived at Manchester at 9 p.m. on a Sunday night, after all the trains had stopped. I knew there is a National Express late service from Manchester to Birmingham so I arranged a ticket for him. (He needed to connect with his international flight on Monday morning, so I was running out of options apart from jumping in the car for a five-hour round trip and then work the next morning). Full marks to Manchester for having such good transport integration. My only feedback is, nobody in the airport could confirm to him that the bus service existed, and there were no staff at the bus stand to offer help and advice, so he was a little worried (I knew the service existed as the website sold me a ticket!). So (a) the staff at the airport could be more informed and helpful and (b) it wouldn't be hard for National Express to put up a timetable by the bus stand even if they can't staff it that late at night?"
8th December 2019,1,"""will only use if there is no alternative""","Not Verified |  I really, really hate this airport. There is no aspect of the experience there over the past two years that has been pleasant or helpful. On 25th November I decided to use the multi storey to park at terminal 1. I was dropping my son off with a guitar we had just bought, and wanted to make sure he got it past the check-in ok. I drove up the ramp to park and at that point, past the point of any return, and found a barrier blocking what had been the entrance to the car park, and a diversion sign. There were two staff members some distance along and when I drove up to them they explained that this was the first day of a new process under which only pre-booked cars could use that car park. (Good luck with that-my experience of pre-booking that car park has been that it is still very stressful trying to find a space.) They directed me to another car park, using a pre-printed card which they showed me but did not hand over. I could not find it and ended up parking at terminal 3 and walking with my son back to terminal 1, but I still had to pay £3 for 1 minute to get out of the car park I hadn't been allowed into, plus an additional £4.50 for the 21 minutes at terminal 3. So £7.50 for 22 minutes. This is nothing more or less than gouging in my opinion. The security process at the airport is appalling-it was more pleasant going through Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin before the wall came down. I've done both. I will only use Manchester airport if there is no alternative."
5th December 2019,1,"""A lot of shouting and incoherent orders""","✅ Trip Verified | I am a KLM platinum frequent flyer taking somewhere between 60-100 flights a year, to many places in Europe and most major continents. Manchester airport is the worst airport for a major city I have visited in the last 10 years. No airside transit between easyJet and Flybe even though it is possible to do so with other airline combinations. A security screening system which is totally over the top compared with any airport I have visited anywhere in the world. Even mascara is considered a potentional threat to the safety of the aircraft! An asthma ventolin inhaler loose in the tray was rejected as not in a plastic bag. When asked why this was a problem was told terrorists use them as detonators. Presumably outside the plastic bag they are undetectable, but inside, can be. All in all, a Mad Hatter's Tea Party. A lot of shouting and incoherent orders given by staff adding to the confusion in screening. A general surliness of staff adds to the unpleasantness I'm sorry the people of Manchester have to put up with the ""airport experience"". I will not be using this airport again. The attached photo is a collection of normal travellers items in baggage which were rejected and had to be re-screened. All were considered as 'potentially compromising the safety of the aircraft'. Judge for yourselves!"
4th December 2019,6,"""needs work doing to it""",✅ Trip Verified |  The airport is dated and needs work doing to it. The cost of parking is extortionate and clearly a way of making money out of the innocent people who have no choice to fly through here. The check in lines are huge as we fly with Qatar airways. The plane houses over 450 people and when I asked if they could open a new check in desk as 3 were open they said Manchester Airport doesn't give the facility for this to occur. The duty free options are over priced and can be seen as money making. It cost me over £17 for a 2 person meal in burger king something that you'd never pay out in the UK. The whole airport is centred around making money rather than the experience it's passengers have. T2 is dated and not really an experience anyone should want to go through. Invest some money into the airport and get it more integrated with experience rather than money making.
2nd December 2019,1,"""they had no idea on movement of people""","Not Verified |  Absolutely disgraceful for an ""international airport"". If you're flying from the new terminal 2 building you would do well to find another airport. The recently finished gates are a very very long way from check-in with only 2 quite short travelaters. If you struggle walking any length do get assistance. We've just landed and here's how it went. Touch down, add 15 minutes for taxiing to gate. Add about 30 minutes for the long walk back to your bags- passport control etc. Now add about an hour for your bags, remember they have to travel all the way from the plane too. We touched down at about 8pm and left the airport at 9.40. Whoever is responsible for the build and design of that terminal needs sacking and it's quite clear that they had no idea on movement of people. Manchester had never been great at moving people through the system but they just took a significant backward step."
29th November 2019,1,"""only two travellators along the whole length""","✅ Trip Verified | Terminal 2 now has new gates numbered A1-12. The entry to this section is at the end of the existing departure lounge and is about a ten minute walk from security, on entering area A1-12 you are advised that there is a 15 minute walk to the furthest gate, we went from gate A11, I have some mobility problems but have always managed at Manchester so did not ask for assistance on the way out. There was no official anywhere in the area, about 8 chairs in two well spaced lots and two small lengths of travelator, both of which were working. If you can't walk half a mile plus in 15 minutes arrange assistance at Manchester Airport, this is handled via your travel company and the people helping are great, friendly and efficient. On returning some of the gates are just as far away from the customs hall, then there is the ten to fifteen minute walk to the only pick up car park, a short part of this walk is in the open, this time you will be pulling your luggage. Gates A1-12 are badly designed no help available when you realise the distance to be covered to your plane, with only two travellators along the whole length, and only two places to rest. Again if you have the slightest problem with your mobility pre arrange assistance."
27th November 2019,1,"""treated with aggression and distain""","Not Verified |    Terrible staff attitude at the security lines. Shouting at passengers like cattle. They take things out of your trays and put them in another without telling you. They made my husband remove his jumper and he had nothing on underneath humiliating him in front of lines and lines of people. They interrogated him on why he had no toiletries. He said my wife has them shared as we are only away for a couple of days. He was told next time he must have his own! I collected the tray with my family's phones, tablets, money, jewelry, passports etc in to be told to leave them and come and supervise my 8 year old have a personal body search. I tried to collect valuables first and they shouted I had to leave them. I refused as I have previously read about theft from security trays in this airport. The guy shouted to everyone ""ok she's leaving her child to look after her things"". They then lost one of my boots which they later Found under a counter. My daughter's tray was also lost with her coat and bag in. It was found on a trolley and had not even been placed through the scanner. We had nothing removed and followed all the procedures. We were treated with aggression and distain. These people do not enjoy their employment and are using the security checks to release their frustrations and exerting meaningless power over toiletries and clothing. The airport is an embarrassment to the beautiful city of Manchester. I'm giving 1 star as I can't give zero."
26th November 2019,1,"""rude, officious, arrogant""","Not Verified |  Over the past year, I have travelled from Manchester airport 3 times, and there is a major attitude problem amongst the security staff there. We know it is a tough but necessary job and we perhaps make it harder by a), being there in the first place and b), by being human, but for pity's sake, there is no need to bully passengers with your silly little power trips. You get away with it because people just want to get on a flight, anywhere outside of your little bubble, and you probably wouldn't be so rude, officious, arrogant and patronising, and if you were, you would not get away with it. We don't want you to be there just as much as you don't want us there, but such is our world. Passengers go through the hassle of flying out of choice and you also have a choice, if you can't do the job with good grace might I respectfully suggest that you do yourself and us a favour and get another job."
25th November 2019,3,"""baggage reclaim was a disaster""","Not Verified |  I have previously been an advocate of Manchester Airport, but not any more. On my return to Manchester from Dubrovnik the passage through Customs and Security was adequate. However, baggage reclaim was a disaster. The baggage carousel was turning when we arrived so all looked promising. 30 minutes later, with the carousel still turning, no bags. Finally, two bags arrived and then the carousel jammed. Despite there being other empty carousels it took another 30 minutes for it to be fixed. And then the final insult. Collected my car from meet and greet and all seemed well. However the next morning in the light of day, I noticed a dent on my bonnet. Clearly I couldn't know if this had been done whilst i was driving home, so I asked for a copy of the photographs which are taken automatically as cars arrive at meet and greet. As the terms and conditions state that any damage has to be reported before you leave the airport, they refused to even investigate. How are you supposed to check your car on a dark, foggy, rainy night in Manchester I do not know."
20th November 2019,1,"""ridiculously long lines""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst airport experience I've had in many years, and that is saying a lot! Cramped and overcrowded spaces, dirty facilities, ridiculously long lines, unclear signage. The ""highlight"" was the security check - from start to finish, it took me about an hour. Extremely long queue, and then ridiculously exaggerated and histrionic security check. About 4 in 5 bags were pulled aside to be examined by understaffed and harried personnel. Almost missed my flight because of the security check. I hope to avoid this airport at all costs in the future!"
19th November 2019,8,"""things had improved a lot""","Not Verified |  I travel through Manchester Airport about once a year. Last year's experience was very bad, but I may just be lucky because this time things had improved a lot. Security at departure was quick and the staff were cheerful, even though it was 6am in the morning. The departure lounge was comfortable and clean, and the food and drink was fine. On return a few days later everything went like clockwork. The steps were at the aircraft door just a couple of minutes after the plane came to a halt, the automatic passport readers were all working properly, and the baggage handlers must have been on steroids as our cases appeared on the carousel just as we reached it. From touchdown to car park in 30 minutes. Must be a record!"
16th November 2019,2,"""one of the worst airports in Europe""","Not Verified |  Truly one of the worst airports in Europe. Hopeless info screens, useless live announcements, overcrowded public areas, pathetic choice of catering outlets, bad boarding areas. Totally unsuited to coping with traffic. The train is a long walk from T3 and the security checks are rubbish."
14th November 2019,2,"""like traveling all levels of hell""","Not Verified |  I arrived at MAN from CDG after transferring from an international flight. You get on a bus to transfer processing, go through security, and get on another bus to your terminal. The buses come every 10-15 minutes. Just so you know how it works in Manchester’s less than perfect world. I go through security. I’m scanned and frisked. The security people took out everything – infinitesimal amounts of gels, creams, liquids and brushes (really, are brushes weaponized now?) from my bag and told me to put them in a quart size container. I had to throw away a number of larger containers with tiny bits inside. Security kept saying “your airline makes us to this.” Right. Not DL or AF or any other airline I’ve flown during my millions of miles of travel. Then they tell me to go to T2 to get my connection. I go out the door and into the elevator. The lounges are above. I go there. And no one will let me in. I’m flying Business Class. A security worker sees this and says I am in T1, not T2. He says this happens all the time (probably because there are no signs). So, he walks me down to the transfer bus. And it won’t take me from T1 to T2. I need to go through security again. Again, scanned, frisked, my infinitesimal paraphernalia taken out and put in a bag. Now I find out T2 is only accessible from the lower level. Upstairs are the lounges for T1. Where's the sign? The elevator opens onto another sad little “bussing” room to T2. I get to a lounge in T2 and I’m told I can’t come in. I ask for a manager and she apologizes and tells me I can come in because I'm flying Business. And my name is on the “list.” The lounge has a few seats, miserable food, no bathroom, but thankfully a self-serve bar which I made good use of. Total transfer time: 2 hours. Never again will I fly Virgin, AF, or Delta through Manchester and neither should you– transferring through this airport is like traveling through all the levels of hell."
13th November 2019,1,"""An awful start to my journey""","Not Verified |  The airport seem to be employing rude and belligerent 'thugs' in stab vests in the parking areas. The parking area is confusing at best, but to be shouted at and made to feel threatened by a bully is disgraceful at a modern airport in the uk. An awful start to my journey."
4th November 2019,2,"""officious, pedantic and unfriendly""","✅ Trip Verified | Security at this airport is the most officious, pedantic and unfriendly I have experienced anywhere. This inflexible adherence to unnecessary detail - in what tray to put my belt, where my boots, where my jacket etc is also inefficient and slow. Above all, it lacked any human warmth; passengers were being grilled. I have used a lot of airports; this is a new low."
4th November 2019,1,"""one of the worst airports""","✅ Trip Verified | My wife was unfortunate enough to develop pneumonia whilst on a cruise last week, we were told by medics as she was struggling with breathing she should use a wheelchair. As we arrived at Palma airport I asked for some help, within seconds a wheelchair arrived a trolley for the luggage and an assistant took my wife's chair straight through to check-in even though we were very early they accepted our cases and put us both on a golf buggy and took us to a designated disablement section, it was an extremely smooth and sleek operation. it could not have been easier. We then landed at Manchester T2 What a difference, one bloke on his own trying to help 8 wheelchair-bound passengers, I asked another assistant if someone could help as I had two suitcases and two rucksacks and a wife in a wheelchair to be told sorry its not my job mate. So my wife had to walk slowly holding onto the luggage trolley which incidentally cost me a pound to use. The taxi phoned us to say he had arrived but it turned out to be a ten-minute walk to the pick-up point, I had to leave my wife trying to walk slowly behind me who eventually couldn't go any further so I had to go back and get her a wheelchair. When we eventually got to the barrier the driver needed to pay more as we had gone over the half hour limit. This has to be one of the worst airports in the world"
2nd November 2019,3,"""For an international airport its a disgrace""",✅ Trip Verified |  We were at terminal 2 and the walk to the gate was far too long as we were right at the end both going and coming back after a long haul flight. We are two pensioners and it was ridiculous. On return we had to queue up for ages and ages to get through security. We noticed people with none European passports just sailed through. For an international airport its a disgrace. Also a lot of the travelators to and from the station were not working again for pensioners and an international airport its a disgrace. We have travelled tens of time from this airport but it is getting worse.
1st November 2019,2,"""low-down third-world grade airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Awful, low-down third-world grade airport, with matching travel experience. In fact, it does not even give justice to third world airports that I have experienced, as these have not yet cottoned up to the idea of charging for dropping and picking up passengers. It pains me to give this shameful verdict on this, my regional airport that I have to endure as a frequent traveler. The unpleasantness starts from the approach to the airport, to the shambolic check-in areas, security and baggage handling. It fills me with a degree of shame when I conjure in my head the experiences I have at other international airports. How did we come to this?"
31st October 2019,1,"""Absolutely humiliated""","Not Verified | Absolutely humiliated at security! I was pushed on without my mum and dad had to go by myself while my parents were behind, bag got searched in front of everyone, my parent's cabin bags were both checked in front of everyone, my mum was left standing with no shoes on, security staff rolled eyes when asked to get shoes! Absolutely disgusting being treated like animals in this airport! Security needs more room!"
29th October 2019,2,"""airport has gone from tolerable to awful""","Not Verified |  This airport has gone from tolerable to awful. Several pounds are demanded just to drop people off (shocking). Access is awful, organization is awful and with brexit looming the signage and passport control is awful. Huge queues of disgruntled passengers failing to get through automated passport reading gates (because they dont work properly) just adds to the delays. Our supposed friends from the EU treated like 2nd class citizens with signage referring to them just as OTHER while the UK queue has ""Its new friends"" depicted by signage comprising a picture list of national flags, including USA, Canada Australia and other ""anglosphere countries"" and a few others such as might have agreed odd trade deals with us like Japan, South Korea etc. The whole thing feels like one would experience in a third world country where by default chaos and confusion reign."
28th October 2019,3,"""will now look to other airports""","Not Verified |  Drop off and pick up charges are disgusting, these charges are only likely to increase over the coming years, I will now look to other airports to travel from."
27th October 2019,10,"""Staff were friendly, courteous and efficient""","Not Verified |  Terminal 1 staff could not have been better in dealing with my son and I. My son had toothpaste he forgot to declare and I had cough medicine I'd overlooked. Staff were friendly, courteous and efficient. Friday afternoon, 25th October."
26th October 2019,1,"""Manchester Airport is dreadful""","✅ Trip Verified |  I have been using Manchester Airport for over 20 years and each time I promised I would write a review on this dreadful place. There is very little I can consider as even pleasant about this airport. I have been a KLM Platinum frequent Flyer for the last 8 years and do over 40 flights a year in and out of Manchester to Amsterdam and then onwards through to Asia/US/Europe etc. For the convenience I use Manchester and mainly because of its rail connection between York and the airport (even this has its moments of despair but that's for another day) From the moment I step of the train I see nothing but faces (station platform through to airport security) that are really not interested in what they do and far less interested in people travelling through, in fact ""passengers"" are their nightmare. The Northern rail staff are horrendous, rude and ignorant. Do you know there are no ""TV Screens"" anywhere displaying the departures of trains until you have actually gone through the ticket barrier and entered the platform zone before one can find out the times and destinations of a train ... pathetic, and try asking any of the station staff for that information is as if you have requested them to give you £20. Passing through the ticket barrier on the 24th Oct at about 09:00 hours I counted 10 staff members on the inside of the barrier stood in pairs, my ticket was ""rejected"" by the barrier sensor so the gate remained closed, I tried to draw the attention of a staff member of my predicament, first think I was asked, do you have a valid ticket? Yes Sir I do. ""Let me see it"" by all means Sir, he scrutinised my ticket and said ""Is in order and should work"" Well well well what a surprise, I was instructed to try it again. Nope the barrier remained closed, he called a colleague who also checked my ticket and would you believe it they had to bring in a 3rd fellow with a ""magic key"" to open the barrier, which did not work, and I had to use another barrier and try my ticket again there to no avail, before a new key was introduced and I was eventually allowed to gain entry to the ""railway side of the platforms"" My principle terminal for KLM is T3, probably the longest walk from the station and I mean walk because the travelators' scarcely work, over the past 3 weeks (I have has 6 visit's in this time in and out) there has been a group of ""engineers"" working on them and just yesterday I returned, no engineers and the travelator heading out was inoperative. Just a word of caution on this walkway from station to T1&T3 when it rains the floor is a hazard but to the leaking arch roof. The elevators to get to down from the walkway to the level where T3 pathway are so slow when there are so many users about, I have found an alternative route via T1 arrivals but my word its a straggle. Depends on airline I suppose for check-in but I generally use KLM/AirFrance with a priority pass through ""security"" thankfully but this is another experience in itself, miserable people employed to ensure you don't have liquids, gels, electrical stuff etc. I'm done moaning as I have better things to do but I'm back in to T3 again on Monday 28th Oct with KLM and returning (Airfance 7th Nov) and do you know I'm expecting the same shambles as I have seen for so many years already. Manchester Airport is dreadful"
