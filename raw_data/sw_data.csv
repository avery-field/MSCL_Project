Date of travel: March 2022,10,No way these 5* reviews are frequent fliers,"I’ve flown a minimum of once a month with Southwest for the last year. At this point the savings are not worth the absolute madness the yo-yo delays and last minute cancellations cause. This airline has far  too much uncertainty for anyone looking for reliability. Unless you are super flexible with departure and arrival time (by hours or days) , don’t waste your time and sanity on Southwest."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Too many cancelled flights. Southwest is developing a reputation of cancelling flights. 20%. Costly and Ruins a day.,Too many cancelled flights. Southwest is developing a reputation of cancelling flights. 20%. Costly and Ruins a day. Dont book with Southwest thinking its going to go as expected. They have more cancelled flights than any other airline.I purposely booked non stop from Chicago to San Jose. Renting a car to drive to Chicago from Milwaukee only for the flight to be cancelled. Many other people around with cancelled Southwest flights. The weather wasnt bad. Other airlines were not having problems. It backed up at every Southwest terminal. They tried to get me on another non stop but they had so many other cancelled flights that the one they tried to get me on was completely full. I was 10 hours late arriving.Not Cool!!!
Date of travel: March 2022,50,Awesome Airline- we fly with a friend or family member for free through 2023,Almost too good to be true- We love Southwest! We have been flying with a friend or family member for free for years with their Southwest Companion Pass. They have lots of destinations with direct flights. Staff is always friendly.
Date of travel: March 2022,30,Very confused staff,One of our party required assistance to board. We set everything up when we purchased the tickets and were told to check in at the service desk for a pre-boarding pass. When we got to the service desk the person said we were already set up and didn't need a pre-boarding pass it was on our phone. When we began boarding we were told by the person checking tickets that we could not pre-board because we didn't have a paper ticket.
Date of travel: January 2022,50,"I always pick Southwest even if there are cheaper options available, they are AWESOME.","I never thought I would be the type of person to pick a flight based on the carrier, but after so many bad experiences with other airlines I finally discovered Southwest and now I don't even consider other options if there is a Southwest flight available!Southwest has by FAR the best customer service and they seem to actually care about the customer and experience. They don't nickel and dime you like other airlines, they do what they can to make the flight affordable but still retain excellent service. No idea how they pull this off, but they are an airline I can trust. Thank you!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Really disappointed,Southwest it’s pretty ridiculous that we go on a 2 hr layover in Denver when the weather was 100% clear skies. Then when we do leave it’s 30 minutes after the time we were supposed to leave for the delay. The thing that’s really upsetting me is that I was A1 for the first time in two years I have flown over 750k miles since COVID with your company through my work. Yet the 1st time I get A1 you make me miss my board group and I did not get the preferred seat I was hoping for but it’s ok I’m glad you did not make me miss another flight for the 10th time in 2 1-2 weeks. You get a great big f on this one South West at least be better about telling people the truth instead of saying we will make up time in the sky when we lost another 20 minutes in the sky.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Where are our bags Southwest Airlines? One hour wait?,Have been waiting almost an hour since we landed for our baggage. Everyone is tired but this is ridiculous and no body is here to help inform us. Another flight has landed after us from Seattle and those passengers are already gone with their bags. This is ridiculous and seems to reflect you get what you pay for. 2 Free Bags but your vacation with start off with a huge disappointment.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,The worst experience I have ever had,"I had a flight to Philadelphia on Saturday, March 12th, and my final destination was State College, my friend and I were going to drive there on Sunday. My flight was overweight and since I was one of the last people to check-in they simply just removed me from the flight without asking, which they did compensate me for. It wouldn't have been a problem if I didn't have a checked bag. I asked if I could get my back and the lady at the Southwest terminal desk was extremely rude. She was short with her answers and didn't give me much information at all, just said that they would call me once my bag got into Philadelphia and they would ship it to me. Two days go by and nobody calls so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I called from 8AM to 11AM and nobody was able to assist me. Two people told me my bag was in Philadelphia and two people told me it was in Fort Lauderdale. I went to the FLL Airport and they said it was not there and that it was in Philadelphia. I called the Baggage Claim Customer Service number for the millionth time and they just keep leaving messages to the Philadelphia Baggage Claim office but nobody is reaching back to me. I got to my destination on Tuesday, it's been four days by the way, and called again. Now the lady is telling me that my bag can't be located. It wasn't scanned into Philadelphia and obviously, it's not in Fort Lauderdale since I went to check. I have never ever ever had such a horrible experience with any other airline. I have probably over $5000 worth of stuff in that bag and nobody is being helpful. The Philadelphia Baggage Claim office will not answer the phone, won't respond to my messages or anybody elses. This is the most stressful flight situation I have ever been in and you know I will NEVER be flying Southwest again. Worst airline of all time."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,What is going on?,Three canceled flights in three days. I need to know how you cancel a flight and the luggage still arrived on time? 198 people behind my wife that are just as irate and unlike us it wasn't there second or third day. I fly Southwest often because they were the most on time airline.  Apparently things have changed and they don't care about customer service any longer!!!
Date of travel: March 2022,20,SWA ain't what it used to be!  ugh,"My original flight was delayed 5x which of course impacted making connection.  Rescheduled in the airport - two options provided next night leaving late make a connection get into SD in the wee hours or two days later direct flt at 6:20 AM.  to reduce risk took the direct but went to check in & they forgot to provide a new confirmation #, called & the call wait time to get a new conf # was 55 mins! Then another 30 mins to get the new #.  needless to say C class.  The stress & anxiety SWA has caused me last several flights SUCKS.  I remember when I was their biggest champion.  They are falling fast"
Date of travel: March 2022,20,Horrible experience,All the flights were delayed. My flight was at 9:35pm and departed at 10:10pm. I arrived to Dallas at 12:00am and it took the plane 20 min to find a gate. Inflight service was not good either.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Nightmare,Where do I begin. My round-trip flight was literally delayed both directions. I was three hours late arriving to my destinations on Saturday and was 3 1/2 hours late on my return home to Nashville. Absolutely the worst experience I’ve ever had with any airline. I thought frontier was bad Southwest is the worst.
Date of travel: March 2022,20,Another delay,Another delay on Southwest. This seems to happen more often than not with this airline.  I would suggest seeking alternative arrangements when making travel plans.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Southwest  doubled charged my credit card by $1800,"My Credit Card company sent me an email saying I had gone over my card limit when I knew I had not.  Checked card activity online and discovered SW had charged me twice for three round trip tickets to Florida booked two days ago.  Unable to reach anyone at Southwest by phone to get the extra $1800 removed off my CC.   Customer service non existent !  At the end of the two hour wait times on their customer service number, the call disconnects!   Not sure what to do next."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Terrible Experience,"I have always flown Southwest everywhere I travel. After today, I will never fly with Southwest again. Ive had a trip planned to Las Vegas for over 6 months now flying southwest round trip. 30 minutes before we were set to board our flight we get a notification that our flight is canceled!! 30 minutes!!! I get things happen but only giving a 30 minute notice is absolutely absurd. I live an hour away from the airport and had to have my daughter drive an hour all the way back to come pick us up. After waiting in line for over an hour to see when the next flight was available. The only flight they had available was tomorrow at 7:30pm. I’m extremely disappointed in the lack of communication and customer service with Southwest. My sister was going to to book flights today with Southwest for 7 people but after our experience today, she has decided to use a different airline."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Delay after delay,Pathetic. Workers not showing up? How pathetic. This airline is no longer a crowd favorite. Just another greedy corporation with only the bottomline on their radar. Cancelling flights at a whim and delays almost everytime i fly now- no wonder their flights are full. This is on purpose to save fuel and labor costs all at the expense of their customers.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,"Never Again, Worst Airline","Looking forward to spring break on the big island, exploring volcanoes  but Southwest is ruining it. Several times an hour we get a text that our flight is delayed again. No explanation.  No customer service reps available.  No options being presented.  Now paying g for a resort and rental car that we can't use. This is apparently common and the airline doesn't care enough to offer any assistance. I am furious! They have my money and failed to meet their contractual obligations.  I want compensated."
Date of travel: March 2022,20,"What Once Was, Is No Longer","We have been using Southwest for over 20 years. I don't know what has happened (yes, the pandemic is a factor, but doesn't explain it all). We flew from Baltimore to Steamboat Springs, and were delayed  over two hours. Fortunately it did not affect our skiing plans, but it threatened to. My daughter regularly experiences major delays from Columbus OH to Washington. Another daughter was running the Boston marathon a few months back and she almost did not get there in time to pick up her packet.Then leaving Steamboat, we were delayed two hours again. At first, it was only an hour and a half, but it seemed unlikely that we would make our connection in Denver. Finally, and I hated wishing this, the connection was delayed, making it very probable we would make the connection. When we called customer service, I was on hold for Two hours, and the customer service rep couldn't care less. When I explained my dilemma about the connecting flight, and that I was planning on taking the flight from Steamboat to Denver, and then perhaps changing airlines, she explained I would no longer be able to cancel my flight because I ""chose"" to risk the initial leg of my trip. I told her I didn't have a choice when Southwest ""chose"" to delay one flight while not promising a connecting flight. She also told me there were no connecting flights the next day out od Denver, and yet when I got to Hayden (the airport servicing Steamboat, I was told there were sets on a 5AM flight the next morning. The airport  personnel were consistently sympathetic and helpful. The customer service people were the worst.Once at Hayden, the flight to Denver, again kept delaying, 10 minutes at a time. My experience is that they are not honest, definitely incompetent, and the Southwest App is totally dysfunctional, sending out the most inaccurate information possible. At this moment, I am sitting at the gate and watching our arrival time at Denver get later and later, and yet the APP keeps sending me messages that my flight out of Steamboat is 6:49, while the gate tells me we will not leave until 7:23, and the plane is not here at 6:44. Really?!!  This is no longer a one off at Southwest. This is the new normal. Friends, family and I have had better experiences with other airlines. Don't get duped by their free baggage. It is no longer worth the guaranteed hassles. And if you take Southwest, build in an extra day if you have plans that are time sensitive. Their in flight entertainment and free baggage is the only plus."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Help me understand…,"My family and I were traveling to the OBX. We were supposed to arrive in Norfolk on Saturday. 12 hours before our flight departed, Southwest canceled our flight and rebooked us for 4 days later. We would miss over half of our trip that was already paid for. I scrambled and ended up just booking another ticket to the same place that was supposed to be our layover. I booked the exact same flight number for triple the price. How can they do this. I used to love Southwest but they are in a world of mess right now. I won’t be flying them again anytime soon."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Worst experience on an airline,"After a lengthy de-icing, we were ready to go 1/2 hour after our flight was supposed to take off.  A random passenger had a panic attack, demanding to leave the boarded plane.  Southwest shut down for an hour before de-icing again and again, bringing everything to a halt to assist another passenger to get something out of the cargo hold.  We're now ready to take off at the same time my connecting flight is supposed to leave.  Customer service reps come aboard to declare that connecting flights are canceled.  Overburdened customer service reps can't manage the flood of people who are booted off the plane.  Southwest decides to go ahead and fly all the checked luggage of booted passengers to Atlanta, the first leg of the trip, leaving the booted passengers with a promise that they will ship their luggage to them.  Absolutely grotesque experience.  Poor to no communication, time and customer management.  They shut down an entire flight  for the needs of a single crybaby passenger and stiffed the rest of the people on the flight.  What a horrible experience?  No apologies, restitution, etc."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Worst airline ever,The worst airline I ever flew with in my life… I’ll give Spirit a 10 compared to Southwest if they wasn't sold out… Everyone at this airport is so disrespectful and rude I ask to speak with a supervisor and this lady that works here said for what your only gonna be venting and nothings gonna change.. Missed our first flight and the lady booked us for the next morning never told us we were gonna be on standby so now where here and there telling us there’s no guarantee where gonna make a flight anytime soon.. And the levels of attitude here is ridiculous..People will feel alot better if people didn’t bring there problems/ attitudes to work NEVER WILL I EVER FLY THROUGH SOUTHWEST EVER AGAIN
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Slowing becoming one of the worst companies to fly with,Late to EVERYTHING! One of the worst companies to fly with...and always has some excuse on why they are late!
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Horrible,"I am pissed. We have been at this aiport since 6pm, our flight to raleigh was delayed 3 hours and then they get here at MIDNIGHT and the co pilot says he is TOO TIRED? Are you kidding me? They wouldn’t even give us hotels or vouchers for clothes or food, we came from Cancun we are in t shirts and shorts it is 20 degrees here and we can’t get our bags or any belongings. They yelled in my face and were absolutely rude back to me, they gave us vouchers for “flights” and rebooked us on one of the worst flights that flys accords the country in the opposite direction snd we don’t get back until nearly 4pm tomorrow. No class, no help, and they obviously don’t care about how we feel and how we are going to be living the next day. Absolutely ridiculous we did not get vouchers for clothing or food or not even a hotel stay. Just because the co pilot was “too tired.” Like you knew 3 hours before getting here you’d be flying out at 12 am you could have said that a lot earlier and compensated everyone accordingly. Appalled and if customer service doesn’t help further I will be raging."
Date of travel: March 2022,50,BEST AIRLINE EVER,"Never had a bad thing happen to me flying Southwest. Could instantly feel the LUV when walking on the plane,, was greeted by the awesome Captain John Rummel with a huge smile and then was followed with delicious snacks. Southwest allows you two free checked bags & follows boarding group system. You can tell they have respect for their passengers and their time & love to celebrate each one when entering the terminal! I live and die for Southwest.. will never not fly with them!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Open seating,I really did not enjoy the open seating. It took way longer to board the plane to try and find a seat. Both flights were delayed not due to weather. It was super hot and dirty.
Date of travel: March 2022,20,Passive aggressive pilot??,"The pilot informed us that if we did not wish to wear a face mask, the option was to exit and drive yourself to Dallas while smoking of we wanted. Having a bad morning perhaps? The company should give him the option to stay off the PA system when he cannot portray the Southwest Airline image."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,I’m in Hell,I have been sitting on this plane in the ground longer than it was suppose to be on the air. It’s so hot on this plane. It’s the never ending trip. We are just sitting around doing who knows what. Did I mention it so hot on this plane. Never again southwest. Never. Again.
Date of travel: March 2022,50,Veronica is the best!,"We were traveling from flight 2WEAY9 Baltimore to Miami for a cruise. Ms Veronica made our flight delightful. Her welcoming informational speech had the ENTIRE flight laughing & put everyone in a relaxing mood. “Outside” Wing seat for the smokers, if you can light them, you can smoke them. & whatever we leave on the plane will be sold on EBay & split 3 ways, so make sure you have ALL your belongings before getting off the plane. Ms Veronica definitely deserves a raise!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Terrible Baggage Service - horrible customer experience,"Horrible baggage claim service!  Southwest must cut corners on personnel unloading.  Waiting over 30 min and weather is fine.  Terrible, terrible service."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,booked non stop. . .,flying coast to coast we booked non stop and SWA changed our flights not once but twice.  We now had multiple stops making us miss the entire first day of our vacation. SWA used to be an outstanding customer service airline but it has gone downhill to a terrible customer service airline
Date of travel: March 2022,20,Dropped by SW,Got notified by text my outbound flight from Lubbock would be late then got told the connection would be tight but I could make it. In Dallas missed the flight to Houston by three minutes and then the gate agent gave me a look like it was my fault and even though she gave me 200 credit for FUTURE travel ( not likely) and a hotel for the night (Motel 6 brother). They failed big time! No service after they screwed up and they screwed me with no sleep in a bad hotel and had to pay Uber to and from the roach motel. SW sux!
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Southwest Airlines,"I fly a lot on Southwest Airlines to Reno, NV. from Las Vegas, NV and vice a versa. I am an A-List priority customer, which I pay for, and what happened is unacceptable. I waited in the priority traveler line for 10 minutes in Reno. After 10 minutes the customer service agent decided to tell us there were only two counter agents and they would not help us unless we moved to the regular check in line. That is fine but why did she not tell us sooner. She saw us standing there and did not say a word. And then she told us to check our own bags. As usual customer service at Southwest Airlines is BAD. Their employees need to take a customer service class. This is not the first time."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,BEST AIRLINE IN US,"This is the best airline I’ve experienced in the United States. I’ve flown multiple airlines including jet blue, American, United, Spirit, Allegiant. Southwest by far had the best prices, services, and perks. Two free checked bags, no fees to refund or change flights, free in flight snacks and drinks, and courteous customer service (which is pretty hard to come by). If you can fly southwest, I definitely recommend it!"
Date of travel: February 2022,40,Good airlines,"I like everything about Southwest except their boarding procedure. I really don't like to have to pay extra to insure a good boarding position. One time I didn't purchase the Early Bird, clicked to sign in at the exact moment I could and still got in the C group."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst experience in air travel,"""This seating process has always worked for us."", claims the lady at the gate. Meanwhile, all the passengers are complaining about the process and how strange it is. This after so many years of this ridiculous process. I promise you, gate lady, I'd never fly your lousy airline, if I didn't absolutely have too. That's backed up by multiple other customers at this gate alone. Keep turning a deaf ear. You revenue will see show it."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Poor customer service,"Great price for airfares, but you pay for it with their customer service. They are lazy, do not take time to help their customers, and are selfish with their time. I was recently in Dallas airport and called the desk because their agent had made a mistake with my ticket. I accidentally left my AirPods at the desk. I boarded my plane and noticed they were missing. I quickly checked the location and called the desk. I explained I was already on the plane, so that I couldn’t get off. We had about 75 people still boarding, and the door was still open. The agent at the desk, Kristen, said if I have time, I will walk them to your gate. (This was at gate 4/6, and I’m at gate 10, not far at all) of course, she did not have time, and now I’m being told I have to pay for FedEx to have them shipped back, and that’s if they are found. It’s so sad that they encourage laziness and the lack of customer service."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Going Down Hill,"Southwest has historically been one of the best airlines around from service to pricing.  I truly appreciate that the cost of baggage is still included in the pricing an I don't mind the open seating policy. However, the past 6 trips I've taken, have not been great and I've had to reach out to customer service. They removed the ability to speak with a live person so all service issues are done online. Upon submitting your request, you receive only a thank you confirmation letter, but not a copy of your request. Pro tip - take a picture of what you write before submitting. Then. it took well over 10 days to receive a response, in which I then played a game of cat and mouse via additional requests through their website.  The entire experience took over 3 months to get resolved. The few times I've encountered staff at the Denver airport and a few other destinations have been anything but friendly.  United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta tend to be more expensive and less inclusive, but despite the challenges they've had, their overall service experience has been great. I really hope Southwest can turn a corner or we will limit the number of times we fly with them in the future."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,"Awful, awful, awful.","Horrible experience. My husband and I have flown with several airline companies and never had such a dreadful experience. They switched boarding gate destinations 1 minute before the plane was scheduled to leave. Several people (including us), were running around trying to find the correct gate. When we confronted the gentleman at our original gate, he callously said “oh yeah, I forgot to tell you they switched the gates.” Oh, also, the snacks they gave out were expired. I didn’t need a snack anyways, but don’t pass out outdated food.My advice1) always use the designated APP to check departure gates. What the gates display is not accurate.2) never fly Southwest."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Cancelled again,I have been a long time customer and A lister of Southwest Airlines but in the last year they have become unreliable.  They notified me this morning that my direct flight has been cancelled due to weather.  The flights all around it are still going and the weather at both locations is fine.  It is too early to claim that the origination flight is the problem.  This is another example of the post covid era Southwest that cancels flights when they don't have enough passengers.  It is time to reconsider my prior loyalty.
Date of travel: February 2022,20,Cancel culture airlines,"This airline use to be a reliable source of transportation, now its book a flight and hope that it leaves on time or doesn't cancel. I am a A list customer and fly this airline 15-20 times per year and it keeps getting worse. Customer service is the worst, hold time 45-60 minutes, no compensation for lost hotel charges, no resolutions to getting to your destination when Southwest cancels your flight.  They change your flight times on future flights with NO notice. Companion pass is becoming no longer worth it.  Time to change."
Date of travel: February 2022,30,Safe travels Hawaii check point in Oakland.,"Bad experience!  No one was manning the booth at 3 pm. Flight was at 5:20pm. At least 700 people in line. Get your act together. At least 1/4 of the people were turned away!  There were 3 large flights leaving for Hawaii. Honolulu, Maui, and Kauai. How do you think 2 workers can process that many people?? What fools!!!!! Everyone was in line for the wrist bands so no food for the flight because of you morons. Pass it on to your boss. Some of us are flying with children and we can’t properly take care of all our needs when we wait in line for 2.5 hours then get turned away.  We were there and you were not. If you have that many people flying you need to plan better. Very poor service."
Date of travel: February 2022,50,Best Airline Experience,"I had never flown Southwest until this month.  We actually missed our flight due to multiple factors.  Since so many people were missing flights that day, Southwest was actually able to get us on another flight to Florida, hold our luggage and called me directly as they would hold it for me.  We were happily greeted by all crew and a thank you to Julia for holding my luggage until we arrived from Destin to Pensacola.  Simply a class act. Thank you!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst costumer service EVER,"Hopefully you don't need to speak to someone in ""customer service"".. The people on the other end of the phone can only sight policy and have no skills to help with problems related to the company. They refused to transfer me, then hung up on me when I challenged the ""resolution"" given.. For such a large corporation you would think they would prioritize costumers and costumer service. THE WORST!!"
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Flexible Airline,"Great airline with extremely flexible cancellation policies that do a great job rebooking and are dealing with the pandemic better than the other airlines I've flown. One of my flights was delayed several hours due to weather and while the o.ther airlines did nothing, Southwest offered me a $100 voucher. They have been dependable with quick changes due to COVID-19 travel plan changes in my life."
Date of travel: February 2022,40,Good Flights,"I used Southwest for a recent vacation of mine. I flew from BWI to New Orleans and then back a few days later. Both flights took off on time and were mostly smooth with a few bumps here and there. For the flight to New Orleans, I checked in 24 hours in advance and got a window seat. For the second flight, I forgot about checking in until several hours later and got stuck in a middle seat. No screens were available, so the only option was inflight entertainment on your own device. The seats were comfortable."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Absolutely aweful at scheduling.,"If you are planing on your flight being on time, forget about it. Technology gets better, but the people that work for airlines just keep getting dumber. It’s actually slower to travel from SC to FL now than it was 20 years ago."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Just as Trash as always,You have to pay for every service on flight (including Wi-Fi ) Was late to my connecting flight. And it’s open seating so if your last good luck. your going to be stuck sitting between two humongous gremlins.
Date of travel: October 2021,50,southwest,We always fly Southwest. Staff is friendly and helpful. Flight attendants are also friendly and fun.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Fully loaded plane delayed over an hour to transport a crew member on our plane,"The plane was fully boarded and on time then waited over an hour without a glimpse of a flight attendant.  No water, nothing.  Captain announced we were waiting on ""baggage"" several times.  Passengers yelled to stop the piped in music, but there was no-one to respond.  Eventually a  uniformed  crew member entered the plane, apologized for the wait to passengers at the front, and proceeded down the aisle to the rear to find an open seat.  Suddenly we could take off!.  When we landed pilot doubled down saying we should be happy they waited for our baggage. If they HAD to wait for traveling crew member better to delay flight and board AFTER he arrived.  Quit lying and treat us as paying customers.  NEVER AGAIN."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Earlibird Check in,"Southwest sucks. I purchased early bird check in and 36 hours before my flight can I check in? No! So I call support. Can you guess how long I've been on hold? Yes that's right, over two hours. Maybe by the time I've been on hold for 12 hours ( which is the number of hours I bought with Early bird check in ) I WILL GET SOME SERVICE."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Southwest and canceled flights,"With SW’s cancellation of so many flights, their customer service has tanked. Our travel plans out of country changed significantly when they canceled our flights and redirected us on routes that included multiple stops and overnight delays!  They could not, or would not, accommodate us on other airlines. We had to book else where at greater cost to us. They do not “partner” with other airlines.  Their response, “Whoops, sorry about that.”  Lesson … Fly cheap…get cheap. 😡"
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Great airline,"Great airline! Staff was very nice, drinks were good, the seats were pretty comfortable. One compliant I have about the airline is the in-flight bathrooms. They’re not the cleanest. But overall, great airline 5/5"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Canceled Flight No Other Flight Options & Berated by Southwest Customer Service,"My flight was canceled less than 24 hours before departure this afternoon (Chicago to Miami).I called customer service and there were no other flights to Miami for the next two days, so I ended up booking with Frontier and had to pay for a much more expensive flight to get to Miami.I called Southwest customer service back and was able to get a refund for the flight. I inquired about receiving a LUV Voucher to make up for the much more expensive flight I had to pay for and the tremendous inconvenience of a last minute canceled flight. The customer service rep responded, ""I will not haggle with you, your flight was canceled due to weather."" Funny that I was able to book a flight with another carrier for the same time. Weather is a poor excuse when other flights are still leaving and accusing a customer of haggling is very rude.Worst customer service experience ever. I have received vouchers in the past from Southwest when my flight was canceled, so I know they certainly offer them. That is called good customer service, not haggling! Yikes - very disappointed with Southwest. Southwest is my go to carrier but I will strongly reconsider ever flying Southwest again."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Please sit down and don’t block the aisle,Attendants allowed passenger on the aisle directly across from my aisle seat to stand with his back side in my space for the entire flight. Get up and stretch for a minute and then sit back down. Common courtesy. Get a clue.
Date of travel: February 2022,30,"Beautiful planes and seats, but schedule has become unreliable","If you have been traveling for a long time, you may recall when we all welcomed the expansion of this little Texas airline. Getting future credits for self-canceling your flight, free checked baggage, friendly flight attendants (filled with humor), and the ability to bring your golf clubs and skiis was unheard of. In Minneapolis they took off from Terminal 2 which was new and much easier to navigate. I’m sure you are over-familiar with businesses closed during off peak times and other non-sense blamed on the COVID pandemic. You may recall just a couple years ago Southwest had to ground many of their brand new 737s on account on an auto-pilot software glitch which had taken down a couple on non-Southwest planes worldwide. For whatever reason Southwest has parlayed this into a reason to change your flight time to simply unreasonable changes such as from the morning to the afternoon. I was keeping my fingers crossed today when I booked (for my last time) two round trips for leisure hoping not to have to cancel again due to losing a day or two of vacation because of erratic changes. I’m not a big airline kind of guy; I swore I’d never fly American again after they stranded me in Miami and United when they changed a gate at the last minute and I missed the flight (amongst a million other transgressions). Things had been going great on Southwest for about ten years until the “switcheroo” flight changes. The downsides are getting to be too many wrestling for check in times and seats. The flight was delayed today for no explained reason. The plane was a brand new 737 and the flight crew was nice for the cattle call. Their prices are so cheap now that they are back to the Greyhound bus mentality where anything goes and no entertainment  or music. My suitcase took an merciless pounding and the outer pockets unzipped and shoes gone (TSA?). After these flights I will have used my dollars from previously canceled flights and my frequent flyer miles and calling it quits. Nice airline, inexpensive with nice seats, but unreliable schedules and cancellations."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,HORRIBLE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS,"Don’t fly southwest, odd flight attendants, very rude, late flights, horrible seating options and space. Avoid at all costs!!!!!!"
Date of travel: February 2022,20,Poor service,"I traveled with a large group of 60 returning from a ski trip. Our boarding passes were completed by our trip leader and were passed out to each of us at check in. However, we then had to use the kiosk to get baggage stickers.  It was not real easy to use, but I got lucky and an attendant did it for me. Many others were not so lucky and after they did it wrong, someone had to fix it. Then to figure out how to attach the baggage tags: peel here, stick to there,  don't stick here!   Then we had to go through another line to have the baggage weighed. Dragging skis, a boot bag, a checked  bag, and a back pack through the twisty line was miserable. Finally completed that, then I had to drag them over to the bag drop. Now on to the tsa line. That is always a fun thing, but it went as smooth as can be expected.After a 5 hour layover in Denver, we had to sit on the hot plane for 2 hours because Of a shortage of staff to load the luggage, then they needed to get some people off because we were too heavy. Whatever!I have traveled on Southwest for several years with little problems, but this one takes the cake.The pilot was nice and kept trying to explain what was going on, but I don't think even he knew."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Avoid at all cost,"Open seating, you and your significant other will get split up. They will also split you up in boarding classes as well. Out of 1000 flights in my life this was literally the worst experience of my life."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,DO NOT FLY SOUTHWEST,I had 4 flights on Southwest Airlines in the last two weeks and none of them left on time. When we did arrive on 3 flights we sat waiting for the gate to open up. I'm currently writing this on my last flight waiting for an hour for the gate to open up. You will never get anywhere on time if you fly Southwest so fly anyone else. Southwest is struggling to get to a mediocre level at best.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Southwest Scammers,"Another week has gone by and SW has not contacted me as promised.  You see SW are liars.  They say they do not have secondary venders on the net selling their airline tickets.  I know because I bought two of them on line.  How did this third party get SW tickets to buy?  Because SW has third party venders we need to be aware of.  And the fact SW double billed me through my rapid rewards account.  Why is SW lying about this?  I can see why they won’t contact me, because they are scammers."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Unfriendly travel fund policy,"Just tried to use travel credits and found the airline to be very inflexible. The one-year expiration is somewhat reasonable. When trying to book a flight after the expiration window SW says they will deduct $100 off your travel credit and extend the deadline past six months. Fine, let me do that! But no, we have to wait until the one-year expiration is over, then call back to try and get the flight. What are the odds that flight is going to be available a month from now? Southwest is great at taking your money"
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Expected Better,"Southwest has recently started flying out of O'Hare.  We typically fly United or American, but our friends wanted to try Southwest and I've heard relatively good things about their service so decided to take a chance.  Let's just say we'll probably stick with United or American the next time we fly. The boarding to Cancun was on time and it looked like we'd be heading out a little early but it was icy so de-icing was required.  The other airlines have de-icing trucks come to their planes... not Southwest.  We had to trek all the way across the tarmac to be de-iced.  OK, no problem. 45 minutes to do that, but their tickets were a little cheaper so I guess that's the trade-off.  But, instead of traveling to the runway after de-icing, we traveled all the way back to the gate.  Strange.  Only to find out that they were kicking off a family of 4 because the father (a doctor) asked for some children's tylenol.  Apparently, his small son (maybe 2 years old?) had Covid a month ago, recently tested negative (had the paperwork for proof), but the child had a lingering cough.  The parents forgot the medication in the checked bag and asked for the children's tylenol. BIG MISTAKE.  The flight attendant decided that the child was sick and should not be on the plane and kicked them off.  Seriously.  The family was very gracious and left without a fuss.  Which then delayed us another hour because their checked luggage had to be found and removed.  Then, the first officer timed out because of these delays so we had to wait another 30+ minutes for another pilot to arrive.  THEN, because of all the delays, we had to de-ice AGAIN which also cost another 45 minutes of delay.  In all, we left about 3.0 hours past our scheduled departure time.  Totally understand the need to de-ice once but kicking a family off because a father who was a DOCTOR asked for children's tylenol so his son could stop coughing is just ridiculous and uncalled for.   During the flight, over the loud speaker, we were told approximately 10 times to wear our masks over our nose and mouth... got it.  We almost missed the 9:00pm (last) ferry to our destination and our driver had to drive crazier than normal so we could reach our destination that night. On the flight back, flight 1512, again 10x over the loud speaker ""wear your masks over your nose and mouth""... got it. When the flight attendant asked if I'd like something to drink and I ordered hot tea (because the plane was a meat locker), you thought I was asking for something way out of normal.  The response ""I guess we could make that for you""... with a big sigh.  Did I detect a roll of the eyes? Maybe. It's hot water with a tea bag.  And, the plane was so cold (my hair was blowing and I didn't have the vents on), I eventually switched with my husband so I could sit by the window in the sun so I could warm up a little.  When we arrived at O'Hare and were waiting for luggage, a handful of bags came and then nothing more for at least 30 minutes.  Eventually, airport personnel came over and said the luggage would be there in awhile because it was ""dropped"" on its way to the baggage area.  Dropped?  Dropped on the tarmac, dropped at a different terminal??  I didn't ask and it likely wasn't Southwest's fault (maybe), but that was the last faux pas I'm willing to put up with for awhile that is related to Southwest Airlines. p.s. no tv/entertainment options and no charging for your phones either."
Date of travel: February 2022,50,"Even when things go wrong, southwest commits to making it right.",Flight originally was for Pittsburgh to Memphis. Due to bad weather my flight got cancelled 3 times. I ended up getting a flight from Pittsburgh to Nashville and then driving the 3 hours to Memphis. Long story short poor wait times on the phone but eventually I just sent customer service an email and they happily refunded my money back for my flight. I honestly love flying with southwest bc everyone is so kind and their customer service even when it’s the worst it’s ever been they do everything to try to make it right.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"No Flexibility from Southwest on Extending Travel Funds due to Covid, which Delta has graciously done for customers",We travel with Southwest 95% of the time and spend a large amount of money on airline tickets.  During COVID we did not travel and have been very limited in our travel to date.  We have several hundreds of dollars in travel funds that expire this month that they are unwilling to extend for us to use on another flight.  We have been calling and emailing for more than a month and finally got a call back today advising us there is nothing they can do.  Delta extended travel funds  for customers with no questions asked.  Very disappointed in Southwest and will look to other airlines going forward to service our travel needs.  Shocking that they will not be flexible with what the world is going through with Covid.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Ian Miller,"I had the worse experience of my life on a southwest flight 1006. The flight attendants were rude. The air conditioning is barely working. Extremely hot and uncomfortable. The plane was ready to leave and we got on the runway and they found out then, only then the plane had a maintenance issues. We spent an hour returning to the gate. Then they made us sit on the hot air plane for an hour to find out the plane wasn’t fly able. Then they made us reschedule our flights. Absolute mayhem, first and last time flying south west."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Delays,Too many delays. Once they delayed the flight twice .. then they announce you are all in the plane. Then you sit there and wait again.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Lost luggage,Not only did they lose one of my three suitcases but for the past three days I spent 9 hours ON HOLD!! Nobody answers. Very frustrating. This is my first and last time I travel southwest. Always what is cheap ends up being very expensive. Very lousy service!!!
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Took advantage of pandemic,"This is the most greedy airline I have ever encountered. I lost several hundreds of dollars due to their unwillingness to accommodate people who are concerned about COVID. They were not willing to extend travel credits when someone in our travel group had COVID. They wanted $100 per ticket to extent the credit for 6 months. We ended up just taking the loss and booked with another airline. Their “customer service” people are not empowered to actually serve the customer. Okay f you try to get any help, your option will be to write a letter to their corporate office; maybe they will reply, not likely.  I wonder how much profit they made keeping people’s hard earned cash???"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Could it get worse!!!!!!!!!,"This is the last straw for me. I booked my tickets KC-DENVER -Steamboat back in November- paid for early bird. So today--the day before my trip--SW cancelled the DEN-HDN leg of my trip. I booked online (because we had unused tickets to offset cost and  according to SW, I HAD to rebook online).  So I did.  Then I checked in when I was able to . SURPRISE!  My Early Bird is gone..and we are in the ""C"" seating. C20--the last one to board.   you have GOT to be joking. This is the LAST time I fly this sorry airline."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Free luggage free for all seating,Great price. Friendly staff. The WORST seating. My wife and I were in different load zones. The plane was full and everyone on the plane left the middle seats empty. My wife asked a husband and wife to sit next to each other in the same row and they got angry. I politely asked an isle person if they could scoot over and the 20 something punk declined and said he would need to use the bathroom. This happened again and I got pissed. Another young jerk who may have to use the bathroom. I told him I will be sitting in that middle seat and he got up and let me in. During covid forcing people to sit next to complete strangers...? It's just stupid and asking for trouble.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Southwest are liars,"SW is a dishonest company.I can say that because all they do is lie.  SW said they would contact me within 10 days, they lied its been over 90 days.  Then they lied about not having third party venders on the net selling their tickets, I know I bought two tickets to Orlando when SW said they had none.  Liars, Liars, Liars"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Dishonest company,"This dishonest airline refuses to contact me as they promised.  They ruined our families vacation with their cancelled flights.  You know the ones with all kinds of excuses.  SW actually cheated me out of air fares by using a third party parties on line.  SW said they don’t work with third parties, yet I paid with a credit card to a third party.  SW ARE LIEARS AND CHEATS.  They said they would contact me within 10 days, they lied, it’s been 92 days.  How many times do they get to cheat and lie."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Do not Travel With Southwest,"The airline allowed one of the flight attendants to get very hostile with me and she even hit my Gucci handbag a few times after a few words. When I confronted the employees about the behavior during the layover, they completely dismissed what I said. I am also expecting (showing) and was traveling with a small child. The woman’s behavior was not provoked and I am very upset she dented my new bag."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Stolen Funds,"I have been flying Southwest exclusively for more than 2 decades and will not be using them again.  I have always appreciated their cancellation policy and the ability to use funds at a later time; however, it is this policy that has cost me hundreds of dollars.I purchased a flight in December 2021 for travel in January 2022.  Due to the rise of Covid, I canceled the flight and decided to rebook for April 2022.  When I went to book, it said my $300+ in travel funds is no longer valid.  Even though the majority of the purchase in December (a month ago) was paid directly, a small portion was previous travel funds.  Now the purchase I made a month ago is only good until 4/13.   To add insult, the new travel dates I have are 4/23-4/27, but I was told by customer service that it's unfortunate my travel is after the date.  You would think years of loyalty would have some impact.  At the very least a sympathetic ear instead of the rude, scripted response I received.  Don't believe the large advertisements that you can use your funds for 12 months.  As I was told, I should have read the small print instead of the billboard.So I am out hundreds of dollars and they are out a twenty year loyal customer."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Flying out,"Worst customer service rude. They say bad behavior won't fly, but they have the bad behavior. It your looking for good customer service it's not in Miami southwest."
Date of travel: February 2021,50,I love southwest and everything they do!,Every time I fly southwest I feel like family. They truly like to have fun and get my family back and forth safely.
Date of travel: January 2022,50,They rarely cancel,"One thing I've learned through my travels...I have to give southwest props... no matter the weather or staff shortage, southwest never cancels a flight! They will push it back a lil but never have they canceled on me the past few years... even when all the other airlines were on the news for mass cancelations... NOT SOUTHWEST!"
Date of travel: January 2022,30,Airport Agents need better training with new Covid 19 Policies,"The only reason I'm writing this review here is because the link to my Southwest survey has expired otherwise it would have been there. It's my fault for not reviewing them sooner but when you're on the move like me, you have no choice. So I was scheduled to depart Fort Lauderdale on Jan 4, 2022. The flight was 1pm to MBJ.  I arrived at the airport long before my schediuled flight and was in line to check my bags. Protocol was for agents to check for certain documents to enter Jamaica including a COVID 19 test taken within 3 days (72 hours) . The agent at the desk informed me that my COVID test was taken too early even though my test was taken approx 2pm Dec 31, 2021. The agent (don't want to write an incorrect name but I think it was Jeto) was adamant I would not be able to board the flight and even got confirmation from his supervisor (Ingrid) , that I  did indeed take the test too early. They instead advised me of an area in the airport at terminal 3( which was probably 20 minutes walking distance away) where I could take a test and then try to make it back to check in for my flight. The agent told me I should just come back and see him. Now since I felt I had no choice and was not being allowed to proceed, myself and my 4 year old child walked all the way down 20 minutes outside with large luggages and bags to find this testing area. When we arrived there, the line was miles long (exaggeration) and the line was barely moving. We waited in line more than hour and half to get a COVID test done. While I was in line I got an email from Southwest that the flight was delayed from 1 pm to 1:45pm ( now I figured I had more time to make my flight)  I paid $59 for a COVID test ( the initial one I had done was free)  Myself and my son basically ran back up to terminal 1 to check in and possible catch out flight. When we got there (now with the new COVID results) the agents that I was speaking to previously had left. I instead went to who I saw, another agent, who said she might be able to get me on the flight but my bags might not make the flight ( at this point it was better than nothing) Just as she was about to process my documents, she spoke to thr agent next to her and I'm not sure what happened but then both agents decided I would not be able to be on the flight so I should come back the next day. You can imagine how my jaw dropped especially since I had a young child and we hadn't eaten because of  all the up and down. At this point I started to ask for a supervisor which didn't come right away. But the agent insisted there was nothing that could be done but book another flight for the next day or be on standby for the next day. I was tired, frustrated and fed up. I immediately moved to plan B which was to get a hotel since I had a little one who was getting as tired and impatient as I was. When I composed myself I insisted on seeing the supervisor again. Her name was Erla. I explained everything from the top and she decided to reimburse me for the inconvenience. I got a $200 flight credit and reimbursement for hotel and the $59 COVID test. I would rather to not have gone through the inconvenience but it was out of my scope. Myself and my child ended up staying at a hotel about 10 minutes away,  having to pay an Uber, buy food and all (with no compensation for those).When I came back the next day  I went to see Ingrid the other supervisor to ensure that I was indeed on a flight. She handed me off to Tamique who seemed very bothered by me to the point she even misplaced my passports and was insisting she gave them to me. (She eventually found them and didn't even apologize) She did her protocol check of documents including checking my now most recent COVID 19 test and confirmed me all set for a flight at 1pm to MBJ. After, she handed me back over to Ingrid who made some adjustments to the cheque I had received from Erla the day before. (I have yet to lodge that check btw and hope all goes well or I will be forced to contact Southwest). When I got to the gate, and was about to board (because I was considered Family Group I was sent back to the desk at the gate) The agent there told me she had to check my documents including my COVID 19 test that was cleared earlier by Tamique. At this point I thought this trip was definitely the worse I've ever been on and I had to do it all with a 4 year old. This experience won't get me to stop flying Southwest because they still have the best deals around. But I was extremely disappointed to have to go through this experience."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Mr,Has to be the worst airlines when it comes to flying….always have a delay or flight is canceled and rescheduled for hrs later….horrible airlines
Date of travel: October 2021,10,SW are crooks,"SW is not an honest company.  They lie and lie and lie.  They say they do not have third party companies who sell their tickets.  They lie.  I have proof and sent it to them.    They also said they would contact me within 10 days, they lied again, its been over 80 days.  SW said they had no flights to Orlando from St. Louis and they lied.  A third party  had tickets, WHY?, because the liers deal with third parties to sell tickets.  This is one dishonest company."
Date of travel: August 2021,40,Not as great as it was,"While I love flying Southwest, you can tell the pandemic has taken a toll on staffing and plane availability. Flew nonstop both ways for a quick trip to MegaCon last August. Plane to Orlando (737-800) was delayed 15-20 minutes (no biggie), but return flight (737-700) was delayed an hour. They had the flight crew ready, but they said something about the plane going through customs (it flew in from Montego Bay). The airport crew ended up towing the plane to the gate by the original departure time, but as soon as the plane was there, crew wasted no time getting onboard and prepped. Then we were in the air 30 minutes later. Flights were full both ways."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Only when no other airline works.,"Why can't seats be assigned and guaranteed. People don't deserve being treated like cattle. It is simple and reasonable to do.    Bad booking, bad boarding , substandard.  I have flown tons for decades. SW is at the bottom.  AVOID"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Southwest Vacations Terrible Customer Service,"So my friends and I booked a Las Vegas vacation through Southwest Vacations for Jan 2 - Jan 4.  Our flight was canceled, which with all the cancellations happening we weren't surprised.  I called Southwest Airlines and was told that since I had booked though the Vacation portal I had to deal with them.  I waited on hold for over 6 hours (after being hung up on once and transferred to the wrong number twice).  The person on the phone said my airfare was approved to be refunded, but they would have to contact the hotel since it was day of.  I don't really get that part since it was Southwest who canceled my flight, but he told me it was standard protocol and I would hear back by end of day the next day.3 days later I still hadn't heard anything, so I called again.  After waiting on hold for over 2 hours I was told that they still hadn't heard back from the hotel on the refund.  Could I please call back in another 2 days.  I called back 2 days later, and after being on hold for over an hour, the guy answered, told me his system was locked up and I would have to call back.  So I tried the chat option, which they tout on their hold line is a great option to get service.  The person on chat told me they were still waiting on the hotel.  So I asked when the airfare portion was going to be returned and they responded that they couldn't help me with that, I would have to call.Every day I try to call or chat and I keep being told they are waiting for the hotel to get back to them, they can't tell me when the airfare portion is being refunded and to please be patient and wait for 2 more days.  It has been 8 days since my first call and still nothing.  At this point I don't even think they have contacted the hotel, I don't think they are going to refund my airfare and I think they are waiting for me to give up.I am a BIG Southwest fan (and we did get some LUV coupons because of the cancelation, from Southwest directly) but the Southwest Vacations part of the business is not going to get any other business from me. It just shouldn't be this hard to get my money back when you canceled the flight.  And no one will escalate my calls, they just tell me the supervisor can't help me."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Terrible experience,"Southwest has become the dog of the airline industry.   Flight delays and cancelations started before covid and now are just part of every trip.  In the last year alone I have had a major delay each time I have flown.  As an A list member you would think they would at least try and help, 54 minute wait is there answer."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,DO NOT BOOK WITH SOUTHWEST,"I purchased an extra seat ticket for my boyfriend going to and from Las Vegas. In total I spent about $700-$800 on just his extra seats. I was told that in order to receive a refund for the seats I have to call after the flights were taken. I called them today and now they are telling me that they will not refund me my money but instead give me a voucher. No where on the website was this mentioned that my money wouldn’t be returned, this is the first time I am hearing this. I’m so upset, if I knew this I would have never booked with Southwest. I was so happy to finally find an airline that works with Plus Size customers but now I feel played and ripped off. I just want my money back like promised on the website."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,BOOK ANYWHERE ELSE,"I had the absolute WORST experience I've ever had with Southwest. Was supposed to fly from Florida to Denver, CO.  Expected a layover in Dallas. That layover turned into a 2 hour layover. Then the flight was canceled. So we had to stand in the long line to book and RUN to our next flight.  This flight now was an extra 2 hours from Dallas to Chicago so we could get to Denver. We made sure to ask the lady at the counter who changed our flight if our luggage would be transferred over. She assured us that it would as long as it had a transfer tag (which it absolutely did as we were taking connecting flights originally.) We then wait in Chicago for 2 hours and our flight is delayed AGAIN. Only 20 minutes but as we board at 9:20pm instead of 8:55pm, as everyone is seated, we are told they are short staffed in loading the luggage and so we wait again. A WHOLE EXTRA HOUR AFTER BOARDING. WE FINALLY ARRIVE IN DENVER AT 1 AM. JUST TO WAIT ANOTHER 2 HOURS IN LINE AS THEY HAVE MISPLACED OVER 14 PEOPLES LUGGAGE. INCLUDING OURS. WE THEN WAIT FOR 2 HOURS AND FINALLY LEAVE AT 3 AM, 12 HOURS AFTER WE WERE SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE IN DENVER.  WITHOUT OUR LUGGAGE.  WE ARE TOLD TO COME BACK THE NEXT DAY FOR IT. WE ARE GIVEN A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL AND CHECK ON THE STATUS OF OUR LUGGAGE . I HAVE NOW AND CONTINUE TO BE ON HOLD FOR EXACTLY 3 HOURS AND 14 MINUTES. TRASH AIRLINE FLY LITERALLY WITH ANYONE ELSE. WHAT A JOKE."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Excuse after excuse,After more than 2 hour wait departing fir a 45 minute flight to Vegas the pilot cones on and says some bland excuse of why we are still waiting to take off. In the meantime Spirit and Frontier airlines left on schedule. I own a 1000 shares of this companies stock and it used to be a good company but my last two flights have been a joke. I'm flying Spirit next time.

Date of travel: October 2021,10,Southwest are thieves,"Thieves, SW double billed me 78 days ago.  SW said they would contact me within 10 days, that was a lie.  I have serious losses because of their cancellations due to incompetence with supervision.  Caution, SW uses third party companies to sell air fares.  SW said this was not true until I sent them receipts proving it.  Which means SW tells you their flights are full, they may be lying.  Then if you go to a third party on the net miraculously they have seating.  Beware SW is NOT an honorable co."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Buyer beware,"Our flight back home was canceled the only options we were given were much later times with multiple layovers. When we called it took 2 and a  half hours to speak with a rep who failed to fix the reservation. So, we had to call back a second time and again wait on hold over 2 hours. Then they did not honor the ""early bird"" we paid for and we got bumped all the way to the back of the line on the new flight. Terrible service, very high likely hood your flight is canceled. Service is horrible. I have no positives about this airline. It is trash. Never fly with them again ....my advice book with a major airline southwest is not worth the headache."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Southwest Sucks!  Can’t trust them! Keep canceling our flights and won’t take calls!,"We scheduled 6 nights in Denver for family ski trip 6:45 am flight.  Night before at 7pm, they cancel due to weather. So they put us on the same flight next day 2 calls holding 65-75 minutes each!).  Again, 7 pm cancelled again!  This time 84 minute wait!  After holding 2.15 hours, we called on 2 other phones and holding.  The other wait times were 120 and 124 minutes.  The first call is holding 4 hours 19 minutes, and the other 2 calls Other 2 hours each…no one there is answering to rebook us.  We had to prepay for hotel, epic ski pass, ski rental, etc, and are out $850/dat and they don’t have courtesy to answer!  We spent 3 hours earlier trying to reschedule rental cars etc for the change…  now we have to do again, not sure if they will honor our tickets and get us out there!  Poor college son came home for this, with limited travel days!  SW is now our least favorite airline!  Here’s a phot of our current call wait times!"

Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst way to finish a fantastic vacation courtesy southwest,"Don't know how much unplanned a airline could get than southwest. Flight#1823 on dec 30th, 2021. First crew didn't show up on time. Once crew show up then discovered plane is low on fuel. Then discovered fuel trucks are not available.  6pm still sitting in plane for a flight that was supposed to take off at 4:30pm. What a great way to end a wonderful vacation of  Maui. All credit goes to southwest."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,SW out of San Diego Airport,"Just recently traveled back from SD to Chicago via SW.  The SW terminal at San Diego airport was horribly crowded - no place to even get a 3 or 4 foot distance from scores of other people, no place to sit, and no ventilation - it was deplorable.  A great number of people around me were also complaining - there were even women loitering in the stalls in the bathroom, on their phones, etc. to get away from the thick crowds.  I would seriously avoid this airport/destination until its relatively safe to fly again, no matter how safe they say the airplanes are themselves.  People were eating for over 1.5 hour just to keep their mask off."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Southwest Seats are EXQUISITE TORTURE,"Flt 185 from SRQ to DEN on 12/28/2021.  I sat in Seat A3.  The seat was EXQUISITE TORTURE for me.  I could never choose to fly on Southwest again.The seat back:  appeared to have a vinyl cover that was full width, but beneath the cover was a much narrower hard metal rectangular frame (maybe 15 or 16 inches in width) with practically no cushion at all.  Beyond the edges of the metal frame the vinyl cover was merely over nothing at all, just blank space.  So my back was being pressed into a hard rectangular metal frame the entire flight.The seat bottom:  Was raised and full in the rear of the seat, and pressed flat and worn out towards the front of the seat, which necessarily pushed my bottom forward towards the front of the seat - I constantly felt like I was falling out of the seat and had to push my bottom back, which then resulted in my back being crunched by the barely-cushioned, extremely narrow metal frame sticking me in the back the entire time.THEN, the aisle is so narrow that the very decent flight attendant could not help but bump into every passenger as she walked up and down the aisle.  This prevented me from getting any nap during the flight, being bumped in the shoulder.  I watched, and noticed that she bumped into most shoulders as she walked down the aisle. I attempted to walk the aisle myself and was unable to avoid bumping passengers shoulders, etc.I recently flew in a economy seat on United Airlines and experienced NONE of these problems.  It was reasonably comfortable on United.  Sorry, but this flight experience really soured me to any possibility I would ever fly Southwest again."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,The worst airline with the worst delays,"Me and my wife has been using south west to travel all year and time and time again it’s almost guaranteed their flights will be delayed. Any time we use south west their flights are 4-5 hours delayed. It’s almost ridiculous how bad their scheduling is. If you use south west, don’t make any plans on that day of your flight. Because it will guaranteed be delayed."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,"Late planes, no flight attendants","When you book a ticket, you expect safe, on time carriage. What Southwest gives is late planes where they have no attendants and believe communication should be on the down low. If you don't tell people, maybe they won't notice. Well, you're not the media. We notice. We notice your flight still says on time when it is 16 min late. We notice the time of arrival goes up each minute making it look like Southwest has no idea where their planes or personnel is. I've flown well over 300 times on Southwest and what they're doing now seems like a beta test of what they can get away with. Sorry Southwest, you've lost my business. I would advise anyone that wants to make it to their destination pick another airline. Southwest doesn't seem to treat air travel seriously."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Best Experience,I don’t know how to express my experience with Fares Match Travel Agency in the United States but believe me; they offer such affordable deals for Southwest Airlines Booking. I want to say thanks to this agency because of its excellent services and the best deals.
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Frequent Southwest traveler.. until 2021,"I have been flying and committed to Southwest Airlines; unless unavailable. In the last few months of 2021 this is a few things I had to get through (while traveling with an infant).10min before our scheduled flight to O’hare from Austin, Southwest canceled and rerouted us from Austin to Dallas. This added 4hours, and an unplanned stop, to the entire trip. Not to mention; the first flight to Dallas was completely full and I had to run 4 gates down with a baby and a stroller, plus luggage.We were flying from O’hare to Austin the flight got delayed 3 hours due to an oil leak from the plane. This experience was understood but annoying.Flying out of Chicago there was an over hour long line to simply check into our flights. This isn’t completely the airlines fault but there were only 3 workers checking flyers in. They even let a couple of guys cut in line ahead of my daughter and I.. These aren’t the worst or best experiences I’ve had with the airline in over 10years but I definitely plan to take my business elsewhere.Bonus: fly with no booze . it’s not worth is"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,First & Last Time Traveling on Southwest,"This is my first and last time flying on Southwest. I have never dealt with an airline that goes back and forth with delays. It’s either you’re delayed or not. Also, specify the reason why you’re delayed. I’ve had to shift my plans multiple times in order to make sure I was going to make it to my flight on time. I ended up sitting at the airport for over 3 hours and no one was able to provide an answer as to why it was delayed. I would not recommend Southwest to anyone."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Thank you to the entire OKC crew,"I would like to say thank you to the entire Southwest Airlines OKC crew. I was very late for my flight on 12/23 and everyone was very nice and accommodating, from the above-wing staff, to gate check, to baggage claim. All of our bags made it, even though we checked in just a few minutes before the doors closed. No one complained or reprimanded us. The staff on the plane were also very courteous and allowed us to board. They could have closed the doors and put us on on the next flight, but everyone waited for us and treated us with so much kindness. Everyone was courteous and we were able to make it to our holiday trip with not so much as a hiccup. Thank you for making our family vacation possible! I’m so glad we made it!!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Southwest Airlines App,"The airline is wonderful, great people, great service. Just very surprising that their app is so useless. Does not track boarding time (AA does), does not show inbound flight info (AA does), and does not show gate information (AA does). American has a great app, but lousy service, SW has great service and a lousy app. Guess you cant have both 😔"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst experience in 16 years of travel,"After canceling my flight halfway through my connections to visit my family during my two weeks a year I don’t work, they rebooked me for a flight the following day to another city a 3.5 hour drive away. Said their hotel was full but that I was, “Welcome to sleep in the airport.” I spoke with an agent to make sure my bags would arrive with me since they were sending me somewhere 350 miles away from my planned destination, and they assured me it was taken care of. I arrived to the city and my bags were not there. I had to get a car to drive to the original destination which of course they didn’t compensate me for. It’s now been 3 days and my bags have still not arrived. I’ve been told by 4 different agents on the phone they’ll, “Call me as soon as they have information,” and they still have never reached out. I had a medical appointment I was also doing while I flew here and all the documents I needed for the appointment were in my bags so now I’m screwed. No one knows where my bags are, I have no clothes, toiletries, or any other items Im missing- and have received zero compensation for this disaster. A true disgrace of a company, and the worst travel experience I have had in 16 years of regular travel. I always fly United and American I should’ve know when I saw the cheap Southwest ticket it would come with the cheapest and worst trained staff you could imagine. CHOOSE ANYONE ELSE."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Always pleasant.  Always comfortable.,"Our flight was cancelled and could not be rebooked.  However, the customer service was excellent.  I received vouchers for the inconvenience of taking another means of transportation to Louisville, KY from out of Chicago, IL as my stop over.  I appreciated the call back from the customer service representative to make sure I received my email with my vouchers for future flights.  I am ready to go again."
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Always accommodating.  Always pleasant,"I enjoyed my flight, as usual, on Southwest Airlines.  Considering the COVID situation, all of the employees are friendly, knowledgeable, and go above and beyond to make sure everything is clean and sanitized."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,What happened to southwest airlines,Long and short of it the service was poor we were late 2hrs leaving arrived with lugage missing on arrival. It was sent to Baltimore. Day two no luggage. It was lost at Baltimore again . Maybe they will find it today they said but don’t hold your breath. Heading to target now to get clothes for today. Last week we flew southwest from Phx to Vegas it took 10 hours yep 10 hours. Time to rethink our travel choices
Date of travel: March 2021,10,DO NOT USE THEM!!!!!!!!,"This business is unethical and completely unsafe as far as any sort of reliability in your travel plans and finances.  They will lie, and cancel or change flights whenever they feel like it.  HOW THE HELL IS THIS LEGAL.. How is it legal to have in fine print that they are not responsible to provide the very service you paid for?? Any other business could be successfully sued and individuals would go to jail and or be fined. That is fraud and theft.  If you charge for a service you must provide it.  If you charge more for a time you must provide it.  Why are all these criminally unethical airlines being allowed to get away with what no other entity or person would be??   Customer service?? A joke.  I was hung up when asked to speak with customer relations.  I was told I had a year to use my canceled flight credit.  Then later I was told it was a year from purchase, not the date of the trip or even the cancel date?!  Well then it's not a year is it, it's however many months left from when you bought it.  Considering most of us buy tickets months in advance of a trip and if you have to cancel due to illness (during Covid) or any time, it is likely rigtht before the trip.  And thus if from purchase date, you do not have a year!  Now I'm being told I can request an extension for $100 !?!?!   Excuse me? I will never use this airline again.  I hope they go out of business."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Not happy,"I have never dealt with such rude people. Our flight was canceled as we went through security. We were finally rebooked on a flight that was 2 hours away from our destination, now we have to spend money on a rental to get to our vacation destination. When we tried to ask questions the lady was just rude and hateful. I will never fly Southwest again. I would rather pay more and get quality service."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Horrific,"Southwest has really changed.  I’ve flown with them for 20 years, and the last few flights have been some of the worst I’ve ever seen. The systems are constantly down, meaning you will  to wait 30-40 minutes just for check-in. The employees are insanely difficult and rude. They changed boarding policy, yet made no announcement about the change in policy. The planes are often delayed. Be sure to arrive 30 minutes earlier than usual, and be ready to wait. Or, just get on a different airline."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,To fricken change oxygen tanks. Guess they dont have anyone qualified. Hasnt passed okay.,To change oxygen tanks. Guess they dont have anyone qualified. Hasnt passed okay. Its been over 1 hr. My first & last time flying swa.
Date of travel: December 2021,20,What’s going on with Southwest?,"Up until recently, I’ve always had good experiences with Southwest Airlines.  Needless to say, my recent trip leaving from Chicago (ORD) was a nightmare.  The employees at the check-in/ticket counter were just downright rude.  I understand there might be an employee shortage, but gives no right to treat customers like pure dogs.  In addition, they were trying to charge me over $300 to take a flight just a few hours before my original flight, due to a dental emergency and I even had a doctors note!  Very disappointing and I will think twice before ever booking through Southwest Airlines on future trips.  With this type of service I might as well book through Bare Fare Spirit… at least I know what to expect!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE,"worst airline i ever flew with. doesn’t care about customers flights are continuously delayed and canceled for no reason. i flew from san diego to new orleans with a layover in las vegas but i wasn’t told that my flight from vegas to new orleans was canceled until i got to the airport. they says the flight was canceled due to a “storm in new orleans” but it’s literally no rain in new orleans whatsoever!! just lies!!  no one seemed to care at all, no hotel vouchers or anything after rebooking my flight for the longest flight for the next day. i’m literally sitting in the airport now and have about 12 more hours until my flight. beware!!! do not book southwest if you would actually like to make it to your destination"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Complete disregard for their actions or customers,"I have been a long time flier of SW, however after their recent debacle cancelling thousands of flights that left me stranded with no way to get to my destination, nor even fly back home to abort my trip for 3 days, I am done with them.  They promised to  pull our bags for hours and never did.  Finally at 10:30 pm they said they weren't going to pull them.  We had to rent a car and drive 15 hours to get to our original destination where they claimed our bags would end up.  No bags for days... and furthermore NO response from SW after over 2 months of filing a claim and attempting to follow up multiple times.  They make it impossible to contact them, and they ignore your emails.  I am out over $700 for a car and fuel and tolls, not to mention my vacation and activities were ruined, and we had to get by without our bags for days... including a cpap machine and meds.... and they still have not tried to resolve this situation.  I'm done.  They suck and I'm going to file complaints everywhere I can.  They do NOT care about their loyal patrons one ounce.  SOOO DONE!!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,40,It was a great airline with good seats and everything.,It was a good airline. The plane was comfortable. The only problem was that we had to get priority boarding otherwise we would not be able to sit together.They gave great snacks.
Date of travel: December 2021,20,No integrity,"Absolutely worst. Nonstop flight delays causing missed connecting flights. Rebooking had to be done next day, then had ticketing issues causing a missed flight. HD to watch all the passengers get on while at the ticketing area at the gate and the doors closed and the plane left."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,A once great airline just keeps getting worse and worse...,"It's amazing how far and how fast Southwest has lost its customer service and pricing edge.  Simply stated, this airline is an abysmal mess right now.Delayed flights are the norm and expectation, long waits for customer service from check in the retrieving bags.  They simply can't seem to get ahead of their mistakes and shortcomings.  It's a perpetual spiral downward and I've now had enough.My last three Southwest flights were significantly delayed or canceled outright, leaving me stranded and frustrated.  Trying to get ahold of someone to assist is impossible.  And waiting 45 mins for my bag is simply unacceptable.And they no longer have the pricing edge.  All the other major airlines now match or regularly beat them.I'm done Southwest."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Southwest Airlines,Got on the plane to watch a movie and the WiFi was broken AGAIN. The flight attendant could not of cared less. They advertise free WiFi but deliver about 60% of the time. This has happened to me numerous times before. For the prices they charge they should fix the damn WiFi. As usual their customer service is bad.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Check in process is broken,"Even if you pay extra for early bird check in, you will still get notifications from your app that you need to check in for your flight. In addition, every time you log in on a computer you have to check in again as though you never checked in to begin with. Talked with customer service and they said even if you check in 20 times you still have to check in for your flight every time you login, and that is how it is designed. Sounds like someone needs drug tested in Southwest management!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,I hope they go out of business! They should re-examine they're business model at the very least.,"At this point I would pay significantly more for another airline to fly. If ANYONE REPORTS YOU FOR  ANYTHING THEY deem uncomfortable they will delay your flight with no reasonable excuse, the. You'll be at their mercy for whatever flight they can get you on! I have been done for a while.... but this is the final straw,  if you book them, prepare for a delay, and a super long layover that doesn't make sense(like going from oklahoma to Saint Louis, to Chicago, then finally to San diego, over a 10 hour period! Ps stuff  like this happens all the time!"
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Extremely Frustrated,"Flew down for Thanksgiving to visit grandchildren for a week.  The flight down was very typical of SW, stand in line, when your number is called, walk through and find a seat on the aircraft.  Prior to my flight, I took my luggage to be tagged as well as asking for a paper ticket.  The ticket did not show my TSA # and I thought that was curious because when I flew down to Baltimore, it did in fact show the TSA#.  I have purposely renewed my membership through the system due to not having to take my shoes off, coat, jacket, the entire ordeal going through regular security.  The agent asked for my information, I gave it to him, he looked it up and validated that I was indeed signed up with TSA approval.  He said he could do nothing about their error and I would have to go through regular security.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, which I did, he said this happens to about 10% of people and was very flippant, stating he could do nothing to rectify the matter.  I'm 78 years old, really don't like going through regular security, go through scanning, strip half my clothes off, belt, jacket, boots, then have an agent after going through the machine, asking me to spread my legs further apart when my feet were on the yellow designated area, pat me down, holding my arms up, make me take the lining out of my pockets , , , , , , this is why I buy and go through fingerprinting for TSA approval.  The entire incident turned me off with SWA.  I was sincerely going to open up a credit card with SWA, but if this is the way they treat a senior woman, who clearly had a TSA approved number, they can take their credit cards and . . . . . . very upset what I had to go through."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Fed up with Southwest,"Just had to listen to the rude Southwest agent tell me why I could not take a earlier flight ,that was not full, to Lubbock. Now I have a 5 1/2 hour layover. Just excuse after excuse from this b#$%@. Flyany other airline!!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,FLIGHT CREW IGNORES MASK REQUIREMENT - CREW NOT WEARING MASKS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FLIGHT,"Southwest flights are Infectious disease hotspots- crew does not wear masks, they lean over passengers unmasked. Throughout my flight the crew neglected to wear masks- on a full flight over the holidays. The advertising is all about Covid pandemic protocols, but in reality SW Air is entirely careless."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,No care for families,"Spoke with a reservation agent regarding booking a military flight for four round trip tickets on Dec 12 for Dec 24.-Jan. Was told that paris would not need a seat so we proceeded to talk about purchasing three seats and were asked for our card details so it can be placed on file. After giving our details the gentleman made the purchase without any consent of the purchase being made at that moment or anything. My husband had to look at our account to see that money had been taken after asking the gentleman why would he not notify us he then proceeds to say that he never really took our son into account(put him in the system) and now he need to make a separate purchase because he infants does need a seat and that any 2 and up has to pay for a seat, although in a previous conversation he had said 2 and under. Not once did he apologize for charging our card without approval nor for neglecting to tell us our child did need a seat at the time of purchase when being told originally that he didn’t. We are in the holiday season when tickets can be pricey and I feel that we should’ve been given a option as to which airline would accommodate us better instead our money was taken and now we have to week 7-10 business days to get the money back and by then all the airline seats will be sold out or higher due to this inconvenience. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was switched to a department without briefing them of my case and without any notations being place on my account. And the Supervisor didn’t help either it was either get a refund or pay full price for my sons ticket(a seat that he will not sit in) no discount, no taxes dropped for making me have to do two purchases when being asked if 4 tickets needed to be purchased and/or no comped seat for the child. Completely unprofessional experience and I never intend to fly with this company again. There’s no respect for the customers and they don’t believe in satisfying the customers even when the customers are looking for a resolve."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,GIMMIC FOR MORE DOLLARS,"I always fly Southwest.  Ok so this time I buy a ticket and I noticed they say you can have early bird for an additional $20.  Man what a ripoff.  I have always checked in 24 hours on line prior to flight. With that I get swift TSA line and everything is smooth.  Now I paid an extra $20 and checked in day before flight however, it no longer comes with the quick and easy TSA check.  So I paid for nothing all the while Southwest is laughing their asses off all the way to the bank.  Its a Gimmic if you ask me."
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Good and bad,Good = 5 stars for fares and free checked baggage. Friendly employees.Bad = 1 star for boarding process. It's asinine. First ones on put bags in middle seats while filling the windows and aisles so last ones on are unable to sit with their family. Just assign seats.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Pandemic ticket expiration dates are deceiving,"I am so disappointed with Southwest. I was recommending them to friends, but now I am telling them not to fly with them because they are not willing to help their customers and unethical in their policies. If your Southwest ticket was affected from the pandemic and the expiration date was extended to 9/2022, beware as once you buy a ticket now with your travel funds from the cancelled pandemic flight, and then decide that you have to change that ticket, your expiration will be only about 15 days from the day you cancel the new flight. They say that this is in the fine print, but why are they making the expiration date so much earlier anyway and who reads the fine print. This is so deceiving because you think you are going to still have until 9/2022 to use it. I cancelled my flight in mid October and expiration date was now changed from 9/2022 to 10/23/21. I've called and asked to get it changed back to the 9/2022 expiration date, but this is the response I received, ""It truly saddens me that we are not able to honor your request on this occasion. Your situation falls subject to our policy that must be upheld in order to maintain the integrity of our operation, and I am deeply sorry that I am unable to do more."" The sad part about this was that I spent more money when I bought this new ticket only to have it expire in less than a month and lost about $215. Why are they talking about integrity? Anyway, I hope this helps someone before they don't want to fly Southwest anymore."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,good job again,"Southwest flight 5855, Phoenix Sky Harbor to Chicago’s Midway to Buffalo, September 27thNot willing to pass on the chance to criticize the airline industry for their poor customer service I couldn’t find fault with my flight to badly. With all my anger vented due to multiple time changes again and a nonstop flight now a one stop flight for the same price I originally paid for well before I set foot on the plane in Phoenix.  The airlines who’s boarding policies, I quite literally hated turned into something I again hated. The first come first serve slugfest of a seating arrangements dictated by the airlines by having them decide who gets in line first. They’ve taken every aspect of where your seated out of your control sort of makes you feel fortunate, you’re not seated in the cargo hole My ticket guaranteed me a seat, sort of, on an airplane, one of the airline's choice at a time the airlines decides flying to where ever they like to eventually getting you to wherever you needed to go, usually not on time.  You maybe able to sit with your family maybe next to someone completely objectionable they decide while not being amused by the total lack of entertainment, or fed more than a bag of semi tasteless mix that unless I was on a plane, I would never eat, all for the low, low price of $500 plus of course milking me for advanced boarding fee and checked luggage. A nonstop flight is far more expensive than a one or multiple stop flight, so why when the airlines change from NS to 1S or 2S do they not refund the difference or maybe just give you credit or a voucher and then make it nearly impossible to use it. Dose all this sound like 5-star service to you, me neither."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Lost my bag, and bow won't pay.....","I have flown SouthWest with little issues until my final flight when I checked a bag I bought in Texas. My husband had been there for military training for 5 months and was getting ready to come home so he was sending uniforms and things he did not need until he returned home. I also went shopping while there for my kids, and we bought things from ikea we could not get back home. Some receipts were in the bag with the things as everything was together. Some things I have had and do not have receipts for. Some things were gifts and I don't have receipts either. Of the about $1,600 in the bag, including the bag SouthWest agrees to give me $801. They said this is what I had receipts for and they will not accept screenshots or anything else for the claim. The bag that they know my things were in, they will not even cover as I bought it in Texas and the receipt is in the bag. This has been ridiculous.  I would not recommend SouthWest and have been doing my monthly travel with other airlines as SouthWest has been unprofessional and are not willing to pay for what they lost. And now to speak to a representative I have been on hold for an hour so far. Good luck to anyone flying SouthWest."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Excellent,"We chose Southwest because of the price and the 2 luggage allowance.  Check-in was a breeze, customer service was great.  They were very informative during Covid travel and what paperwork needed to be filled.  I will definitely use Southwest again.  Boarding was very well organized.  We purchased a roundtrip ticket and the return flight was just as a breeze as the departure."
Date of travel: November 2021,30,Quick flight,"Easy flight from Bos to BWI. No delays, quick boarding, friendly flight attendants. Forgot there were no TVs but it was fine for the short flight and they had a good selection of movies available on personal electronic devices. Booked a Thanksgiving flight months before so I got a great price."
Date of travel: November 2021,40,Decent Flights,"Southwest featured a good price and nonstop flights from Baltimore to Las Vegas and back a few days later. Both flights took off and arrived on time. We checked in 24 hours in advance and were able to get seats next to the window and each other.  Boarding was quick and easy. Snacks were a basic drink and snack. No screens were available on board; however, you could connect to Southwest's Wifi on a portable device for free entertainment. They had a small selection of 2021 and older movies to choose from. It's not the best selection that I've seen from an airline, but it still did the job for the 5 hour flights."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Mr.,"I was supposed to leave at 6AM and arrive at 3:30 PM.  After I was at the airport SW changed me to multiple connecting flights arriving the next day. To add insult to injury, they also changed my boarding number from group A to C31.  I will do my best to never fly that lousy airline again."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Southwest sucks,4 out of the 5 Southwest flights I’ve been on have been delayed. Very unorganized. Would not recommend
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Katherine went above and beyond,"I requested an upgrade to one of the A1-A15 slots.  Katherine, who was working the gate, was happy to help, but the computer kept erroring out.  For an hour she tried to help me but the computer issues never resolved.  Throughout the entire time, Katherine made the effort to keep me informed and tried repeatedly to help me.  I was sitting close to the gate counter and was able to watch her as she navigated ongoing computer issues.  Never once did she lose her cool with a single customer, she was the epitome of grace and patience.  When I went back to the counter to thank her for trying to help me, she offered me a preboarding position - I am a slow walker because of a knee issue - which I accepted and was so very grateful for.  I have flown SW for years and since the first of the September have taken 4 SW flights.  Katherine, in my opinion, is the example of all the SW employees I have encountered.  Pleasant, helpful and patient during trying times as we emerge from the pandemic.  Great job Katherine and great job SW."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,"Wow, what an Agenda","They really empowered their flight crew to threaten and single out customers during the holiday. I'll still fly Southwest several times a month, but Damn! It was so uncomfortable on this one hour flight, watching them go person to person and getting on the overhead speaker every 5 minutes. The EXTREME measures had me wondering, are these guys purposely trying to piss off half the people on this plane? I know they have been getting lots of attention in the media lately and feel like they were really trying to piss people off. It was really quite disgusting, childish enforcement. They even praised themselves at the end of the flight, which my 9-year-old thought was cute..."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Southwest Sucks,"For a hour no one was working the baggage check in.  Employees kept walking in and out of the employee door. Finally thay all came out at once and then when I tried to check my bag, I had to go back to a computer that were all shut down while the employees wandered around, just to get MY OWN check in ticket. Then they had one security gate open, one for a thousand people.  Then my bag got rejected twice because of a bad bin. I hate find your own seat bs. This airline sucks."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Cancelled flights,My return flight was cancelled via text message with 24 hour notice.  I was able to reschedule departure at another airport but I had to rent a car one way to arrive at the alternative airport.  Southwest refused to refund the rental car.  Something is wrong at Southwest because it was always a reliable airline.  In my mind airlines have to be safe and reliable to operate.  Unfortunately Southwest doesn't seem to be reliable anymore.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Not Worth It Anymore,"I used to fly Southwest religiously because they have the best airline benefits IMO. But with the COVID-19 regulations they have seriously fallen short as far as customer service is concerned. It’s frustrating that there is no alcohol service anymore, and the flight attendants have become so incredibly rude. The flight I was just on, one of the flight attendants either had a problem with staring or a problem with me. It’s become very obvious that the majority of the southwest staff has no interest in going above and beyond or even in pleasing guests period. I’ll be taking my money to Delta unfortunately. The seats are more comfortable and there’s complimentary screens with movies."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Military disrespected,"The Southwest policy regarding early boarding for military personnel is a farce. They only allow you to board early if you're in uniform, even if you have a military ID and can show them travel orders. Southwest knows the military actively discourages its personnel from wearing uniforms during commercial travel due to OPSEC (operational security) concerns, as doing so attracts unnecessary attention and poses a risk to the service member and those around them as targets of opportunity.Southwest exploits this and its attendants are not afraid to scold you openly for not wearing your uniform (as if Southwest has any right to dictate under what conditions military personnel ought to be in uniform) and will not allow you to board. This is both embarrassing and highly insulting to military personnel whose service enables Southwest the freedom to enterprise as a business and make a profit. In conclusion, I will be flying with any other airline than Southwest until such time as they change their policy and will actively discourage friends or family from using them due to their disrespectful and exploitative business practices."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Poor management,They changed our what gate we were going to be at like 3 times having us go back and forth across the airport. The wifi didn’t work on the plane.  Then we were stuck in the airplane for nearly an hour before the let us move to the gate. I freaking hate southwest.

Date of travel: November 2021,50,Travel from Upstate NY to Austin TX,"I have to admit after years of flying SWA with great results these last few months had be nervous. We had made our reservations in August-and then the great melt down of October came. As we came to see-it was not just SWA-lots of other airlines experienced the same issues. This post pandemic or ongoing pandemic world is a whole other set of rules and circumstances. I wanted to report in our experience. Our flight down to Austin thru BWI was flawless and we arrived 30mins early! Can't beat that. Whew. Full disclosure we always take the earliest possible flights on whatever airlines we travel as when connections are involved and they always will be for us-you just never know what will happen. Flight home left exactly on time and again going thru BWI. We were not even 20mins into the flight when the Pilot came on and asked about Doctors, Nurses EMTs on board. Something was going on in the back of plane but I sure did not want to turn around and look. One of the Flight attendants who had been in the back came up front really quickly and grabbed all the emergency equipment from the overhead. We knew this was not good at all-I looked at my husband and we just shrugged our shoulders as there but for the Grace go all of us! Sometime later, the Pilot came on and explained we were diverting to Memphis TN so medical personnel could come on board and take passenger to nearest facility. They kept us apprised the entire time. Touched down in Mempis, emergency personnel on board immediately and took passenger and family off-how scary and sad for them-can anyone imagine? Fueled up, did some sort of paperwork and off we went. Meanwhile we knew we had missed our connection and I was trying to decide what we needed todo-rebook mid-flight-bought the extra internet so could do that -then, ding goes my phone with a text from SWA alerting me/us that we have been auto rebooked on the next flight! Could not have asked for a better outcome. We landed little over an hour late, not bad! Had plenty of time in BWI now we had lunch and had a very uneventful flight home. I think we were maybe 3 hrs or 2.5hrslate?So no big deal as this was the final destination.So in summary-I had a nightmare flight in July on another major airline across country that was not handled at all-in fact had to buy a ticket home on a different airline and then fight with that original carrier for almost 90 days to get my refund on a flight they cancelled due to no flight crew. Air travel has really not been any fun for awhile and now with all the mandates and flights booked to full capacity and little staff-its really hard. I am writing this review to say that I think SWA is working on its issues and that we were thrilled at how our situation was handled. Reading prvevious reviews of missed vacations and so on -again I can relate. What any consumer can hope is that the airline realizes and is working to fix problems the best they can. Many thanks to SWA for dealing so well with a situation that was entirely one not of their making. And my faith humanity was restored as they wheeled the poor passenger off the plane and I did not hear or see any grumblings from a fully packed plane -as I said there but for the grace go any of us."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,You get what you pay for,"This is my 4rth flight in last few months.  One item that constantly is consistent is how the flight attendants  don't give a care about passengers.  Two flights I closed my eyes and missed when they asked for drinks.  Tried to get attention when they brought drinks for others.  Short of standing up and yelling at them I could not get their attention.  This flight same mistake I closed my eyes.  But heard him get my neighbor seat persons order.  He never looked at me.  He then went to seat behind me and I turned around in seat and looked directly at him.  patiently waited for him to get that persons order.  He looked directly at me, twice.  When that person finished he did not ask if wanted or care.  He immediately went to seat behind me.  Southwest flight attendants  really do as little as they can get away with.   This is one of many crappie things southwest does.  After being a constant fler for a long time on Southwest I will finish this flight and try to find carrier that has better staff.Spent my life protecting my country.  It is staff like Southwest has that makes me wonder if it worth.  My effort is worth it but I wish we not have to protect people like this.Picture below is today's staff but it has been others also."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Harassment and threats,De-planed after a large and dangerous fuel spill. Re-boarded only to sit for another hour plus and was singled out multiple times by flight attendants and gestapo over mask “wearing” and not sitting still like a good little boy. I get a better experience from spirit.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,My flights have been canceled twice and delayed every time,I do not recommend this flight service to anybody it is terrible and is always delayed and canceled.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Questioning Southwest’s policy,"I have no problem with the flight or personal service I received.  I am however very concerned about the wishy washy vaccine requirement and how the company is cow towing to appease some of their employees. I am even more gravely concerned about the many instances of ground and flight crews displaying or actually speaking disgusting and disparaging political views… without reprimand or repercussions.  When your ground crew paints on the exterior of the aircraft “let’s go Brandon”, or when a pilot says that over the intercom… it is inappropriate and offensive!  Until I hear that Southwest is actually handling these issues with proper care and diligence I will not be flying with them. There are many other airlines to choose from."
Date of travel: May 2021,30,A Little Scary in Covid times,"Southwest insists on their traditional system for boarding which forces all of us to stand jammed together in a tiny space in our assigned boarding order.  We were stuck like this for way too long, no chance for social distancing in Covid times.  There has got to be a better way.  On board it's a cattle car, jammed full.  You just get through it and hope you don't get sick."
Date of travel: November 2021,40,Good Experience on Southwest,"Southwest Airlines Flight 1941PHL-BNA6:00 am-7:10 am Boeing 737-700I recently took this flight from Philadelphia to Nashville at the start of a weekend trip, and found it to be a generally smooth, positive experience on Southwest. The only negative was that we were a bit delayed getting into Nashville due to having to de-ice in Philly, but it was outside of the control of the airline, and they handled it as best as they could.We arrived at PHL around 4:45 am for our 6:00 am flight, which was plenty of time since we were traveling with only carry-ons. We parked in the parking garage attached to the airport, which was quite crowded and somewhat difficult to find a spot in. This has become the norm at PHL since they never re-opened the economy lot after closing it at the start of the pandemic. However, less than five minutes of circling around was enough to find a spot on the 1st level, which is ideal for departures, since you can walk directly across to the security checkpoint from the garage. I would recommend trying higher floors of the garage right off the bat if hoping to find a spot more quickly.There are always a lot of flights to leisure destinations departing first thing in the morning from Terminal E where Southwest operates from, and that day was no exception. The shared Terminal D/E security checkpoint, which is pretty large, was crowded. Half of our group has PreCheck, while the other half had to use the regular security line, and both had a wait. The PreCheck line was less than 5 minutes long and we were through quickly. The regular line was much longer, and probably required 15-20 minutes to get through that morning. Southwest’s gates at PHL are all at the very end of Terminal E, so there is a bit of a walk to get to your gate after security as well. We made it the gate with about 15 minutes to go before the scheduled 5:30 am boarding. We had boarding positions A54-A58, which we had gotten when checking in for the flight at exactly the 24-hour mark. Boarding started right on time, and we were on the aircraft quickly to find seats. One of the only things we dislike about Southwest is not having an assigned seat, even though we almost always have good boarding positions and have never had an issue finding seats together. It just adds a little bit of stress that isn’t present on other airlines. However, it does seem to speed up boarding, since everyone is eager to get on ASAP and figure out where they’ll be seated. By the time we boarded, most of the rows ahead of the exit row were starting to fill up, but there were tons of options further back. We ended up with a really ideal spot for our group of five, in the one exit row where there is a row of only two seats in front of a row of three, where the window seat in the second row has the best legroom on the plane. We grabbed those five seats and settled in. Even though all five seats were considered exit row, only the two-seater and the window seat behind it seemed to have extra legroom.In-flight service on this flight was good, and I thought the flight attendants were friendly and attentive. Their announcements were pleasant with a little bit of humor mixed in, but nothing over-the-top or annoying. We departed the gate right on time, and they made an announcement to let us know that the plane required de-icing, so that would delay our takeoff. I was surprised to hear that we had to de-ice in early November, but I guess it had gotten below freezing overnight and there had been some precipitation. It was a little frustrating since I could see that not all planes had to de-ice, so we just seemed to get unlucky that day. The de-icing pad is on the exact opposite side of the airport from Terminal E, so it took about 10 minutes to taxi down there. Once there, we parked next to two other planes that were about to be de-iced, and luckily the de-icing did start within a couple minutes. The pilot said that only the wings needed to be de-iced, which would save us some time as compared to having to do the full aircraft. I think they were a bit optimistic in telling us it would take only a “few minutes” to de-ice, since it was over 20 minutes, but it didn’t take nearly as long as we’ve had on some previous flights in Philadelphia. After that, we had to taxi all the back to the opposite end of the airport to take off, but I appreciated that it felt like we taxied down there at a really good clip to help make up for the delay, and we took off immediately when we made it to the runway.Wifi was available throughout the flight, and features a variety of free movies and tv shows to stream, and you can also sign-on to get access to iMessage and Whatsapp for free using the wifi. I also like that you can see a map of exactly where the plane is throughout the flight using the wifi. The only other amenity that would have been helpful to have is an outlet to charge your phone during the flight, which was not offered.Beverages were offered a little bit into the flight, with an easy-to-read menu on the cards in the seatback pockets to make choices. I always find it interesting how Southwest takes drink orders without using a drink cart, prepares the drinks in the galley, and brings them back on trays. That form of service actually is surprisingly efficient, and it actually makes the service feel a bit nicer and more personal than when it’s coming from a drink cart. There’s also the benefit of the aisles not being clogged with drink carts at any point. We were served our drinks quickly along with their standard snack mix, which is similar to Chex Mix. I really had no complaints about the flight itself, other than the fact that the delay due to de-icing ultimately got us into Nashville a bit late. We arrived at our gate 20 minutes late, which wasn’t a big deal for us, but could be stressful for others who had short connections in Nashville. It was nice that the flight attendants starting announcing the gates for the connecting flights shortly before we arrived, and they also let people on some of the tightest connections know that the ground staff said that those flights would be held for the incoming Philly passengers to get there in time. As we taxied to the gate, they also made an announcement asking passengers who didn’t have a tight connection to stay seated so that passengers with tight connections could get off first. Most passengers seemed to follow this, although the number of people who jumped off right away seemed a little large for all of them to have tight connections.  Overall, we had no real complaints about this flight and thought Southwest did a good job and offered good service. I’m sure we’ll be back on another Southwest flight sometime in the near future and I won’t mind at all."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,It’s falling down,"I have flown SWA for many many years both for business and personal (25+).  Throughout, (until the last 24 months) I have praised the company and the consistency of qualify, support, timeliness and professionalism.  Wow, how things have changed.  I have not had a SINGLE flight (out of 20 this year) that hasn’t been delayed significantly or even canceled.  I’m sitting in the airport right now once again experiencing it - and after this informing our travel team not to book me in this airline anymore.  So ver disappointing to see how badly the airline had fallen down, and how little they seem to care."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Roger C,"SWA Canceled our flight to Vegas 3 hrs before take off (6:30am) via text 11/1/21. We were advised to jump online to re-book, by the time we did there were no flights available. We were meeting friends , pre-paid hotel, had Lionel Ritchie tickets and this was a vacation we had planned 10 months in advance. We never got to go because other airlines same day booking were astronomically high. We missed our concert, vacation and friends because of SWA employee no shows, this was the reason for cancellation. We complained to SWA and their response was a $150 voucher 😂😂😂, after losing out over $1500 in hotel fees and concert tickets. BEWARE OF THIS AIRLINE trying to make amends at faults of THEIR own.. THEIR customer relations dept are horrible and would not recommend flying with them ever. They can take that $150 voucher and wipe their A_ _ with it. ***LAURA SANDERS- SWA customer relations department****"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst customer service I have ever seen.,"Had a family emergency and had to get step daughter down to us.   Due to the website constantly giving error messages so I could not book through it.  I call southwest customer service,  which isn't even them it's a subcontracted company.  That straight lied to me.  Ticket was $98 they said $179 that the site must be updating.  The site price stated the same for the entire time until day of flight.  Cost me almost a 100 dollars more and 2 hours of extremely unhelpful service to be extremely over charged.  No on in my family will ever waste money on this joke of a airline again."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Don’t fly with Southwest if you have a connection.,"Don’t bother flying with this airline if you have a connection. If anything comes up and your plane doesn’t arrive on time for your connection, you are screwed. No accommodations or relationships with other airlines to catch another flight, leaving their passengers high and dry.  I am stuck in some random city until the next day and I have to foot 150$ hotel bill, through no fault of my own. Incredible, I will never travel this crap airline again."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Southwest Airlines,Poor customer service as usual. The boarding process is a joke with their compact line areas. Worst in the business. While on the plane from Reno they always seem to have the excuse that there is going to be turbulence so there will be no in flight drinks or snacks. This flight was one of the smoothest so I feel they are going cheap and not offering complimentary services. They pride themselves on no baggage fees. That is good but over the last few years their baggage handlers have destroyed our luggage. Do to my location I do not have many options to use a different airline. They are the Walmart of the skies.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Continue slide downhill,I travel about 20 times a year. Post covid this airline continues to go downhill. On flight 601 right now and the flight attendants somehow are still seated an hour after take off. Any semblance of service has disappeared. The last remaining duties - safety. Can't imagine the current flight attendants being any help in an emergency. Sad to see Southwest service in such dissaray.. And Southwest received $14billion + in bailouts and profitable Q1 20221? Wow
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Horrible airline,First the airline changed our nonstop flights that we booked to one stop. Then the early bird extra fee is worthless never napping a good seat. Finally the flight attendant blocked off 2 of the premium front row seats. Nashville to Philly Nov 10 630PM. Will never fly Southwest again.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Lied about a refund for my infants ticket and the rudest flight staff EVER!!!,We had to schedule a oneway flight to Atl due to our infant getting sick 3 days prior. When my wife booked the flight she called to give infants information. She did not have a birth certificate on her person and the agent said just pay for her ticket and we will refund money when you email a copy. After the horrendous flight in which there wasn't even an available seat for my child to sit in they only want to give us $150 credit for a future flight smh. Not only will i not use that credit at least give us a credit for the same amount you agreed to refund us.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Southwest Hotels - Travelers Warning,"If you're thinking about using Southwest Hotels, this is your warning for you?I thought it would be more convenient to use Southwest Hotels and now they are literally holding my money hostage. I planned a trip for my pregnant wife to New Orleans for her birthday on August 27th. We got to the hotel (hotel staff was awesome) and then Hurricane Ida hit New Orleans and we were evacuated. I called Southwest Hotels and they told me I would be refunded once I checked out. I thought that was the end of it, but I was very wrong.I called them 8 times asking where my refund was and each time I got another run around answer. At one point, they told me it would be refunded within 24 hours and when I didn't receive it, I called back and they ""had no idea what I was talking about."" I called the New Orleans hotel myself and they said they credited Expedia the day we checked out. The gentleman I spoke to was very nice and warned me that Southwest Hotels has done this before.When I called Southwest Hotels with my newly learned information, they again had no answer. This major corporation received my payment and the refund from the hotel. They are literally making money off of a Hurricane.It's now 3 months later and I still haven't received a refund. The only thing I can do at this point is warn others and hope you use someone other than Southwest Hotels.Note: Southwest Hotels uses Expedia. Avoid the middle man and just use Expedia yourself. It will save you a big headache - heaven forbid a  NATURAL DISASTER hits."

Date of travel: November 2021,10,Disappointing,Multiple people has masks below their nose. The couple next to me had their masks off for the entire flight and the flight attendants did nothing about it. I’m usually very happy flying southwest but this was incredibly disappointing.
Date of travel: October 2021,30,Packed flight!,"Flight was totally packed. Boarding all the people created too much closeness in this time of Covid. Wish there was a way to board plane from the back forward, to prevent so much contact with so many people."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,"Not great for accompanied flights, no assigned seats","It was our first time experiencing a flight with Southwest. We chose this specific flight because it was later in the day so we were able to enjoy more of our trip in the morning. It was also the more expensive flight choice for that specific day. I will say that the seats had more cushion and were more comfortable than other carriers we’ve been on with thinner seats. The flight crew was fine, even one made a few jokes over the intercom. Snacks were given out but at one point they ran out and you were given less snacks than others. The worst part was the seating arrangements, I did not feel very accommodated. I did not realize there were no assigned seats on southwest when I booked this. We were only given a number on our boarding pass and before boarding you are to stand in line in your number range. If your number is higher forget about sitting together with your party. Once we boarded the plane, all of the window and aisle seats were taken leaving only the middle seats for us to sit in. When asked for any open seats we were told the flight was full. My husband and I were traveling home together and it would have been nice to sit next to each other and even have someone to lean on to take a nap. I had to sit next to two men with long legs and personal space was an issue. This was a 5 hour flight and sitting next to your party would have made it much more comfortable.I would recommend southwest for solo fliers and people who don’t mind not choosing your seat. Not recommended for accompanied flights."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,They lost my luggage,"The airplane smells like someone farted and they lost my luggage and didn’t honour the travel protection plans I paid 33 dollars For. One of the worst airlines I ever flew, never again."

Read complaint photo below. Wouldn’t accommodate me at all for food and hotel fees instead offered a 150 voucher for a 300+ overnight stay. Yet on the delayed flight they gave us for the next day offered a man 600 voucher to give up his seat because the plan was 132pounds overweight. Me and my husband were greatly disappointed by southwest. I wouldn’t recommend them they are going downhill. Unorganized, unprofessional and plain disrespectful."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Love flying Southwest,"I love flying Southwest. Their pricing is right. Staff is friendly. Most of the time they are on time. Unfortunately, on this trip, my return flight was cancelled and they rescheduled for the next day, which didn't work with my needs. I have found this to be extremely uncommon."
Date of travel: October 2021,40,Baggage stolen?,Arriving at Love Field and then to Fort Worth I found two controlled substance prescriptions missing from my luggage.Other than that Southwest real efficient and trip wa as smooth as floating in the Dead Sea.any suggestions about the prescriptions?
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"unorganized, seats in front of us were in recline position during take off and landing.","We flew southwest because we had the points on our CC.  This company used to be known for it's business acumen and leadership, well that was short lived.  The boarding is unorganized,  the flight attendants were oblivious... We took off with the people in front of us and beside us in the recline position.  You cant get away with this on any other airline.  People were trying to clean the plane and in the way of customers still un-boarding the plane. I'd rather pay for bags if it comes with guest relations and know what seat I'm paying for."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Mask mandatory,"I was traveling on flight 6190 from Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore Maryland, and as I was boarding like all flights we as passengers are mandated by the federal law to wear fask mask, by federal law, and the flight attendants and captain tells us several time to please wear mask over nose and mouth,. During the flight I noticed several time that the flight attendant/ attendants did not wear there mask correctly and at times did not wear at all and let the mask hang on  one of her ears while she was on her phone NOT eating or drinking for a long extended period of time,Now if we as passengers have to be told many times to please wear your mask even between sips and drinks for the safety of all passengers and flight crew.  I was extremely disappointed and very aggravated that flight crew was complaining of the passengers when there were clearly not following the federal law of mask wear.I will not  fly with southwest again nor will I recommend to my family or friends and reader of this review to fly southwest during this time of mask mandatory.  I will choose other airlines because I never saw so much neglect from the flight crew as I did on my flight. If we have to wear masks so do they no excuses."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,What in the world has happened to SWA????,"I have flown SWA for many years. And did so gladly. Flights were generally on time, service was top notch for economy class and flight attendants were fun and very customer service focused. The last few flights I have been on SWA, the on time service is abysmal, the service sub par and the flight attendants surly and indifferent. It now entirely reminds me of UA and AA. In fact, UA and AA are better!! This airline needs to return to its roots and the ethos of Herb Kelleher. It has lost its way and I will now use it solely as my last resort."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Ms.,"My return flight canceled they said due to fog in California. I am just trying to get from Orlando to Dallas. I was told no compensation for extra expenses I have to pay for food, possible lodging, extra time my car sits in the parking garage in Dallas. If my next flght is canceled which is the last one of the day I have to pay even more. The seats on the plane are cramped and customer service the worst. Would not recommed Southwest to anyone. That if you want to get where you are going, but if you have all the time and money to waste and like hanging out in airports and sleeping on the floor they are just the airline for you. Corporate doesnt care."

Date of travel: October 2021,10,Horrible experience and Southwest lied,"Southwest has been horrible. For work, I flew from Las Vegas to Dallas for a connecting flight and was suppose to fly to Tampa. The connecting flight got canceled due to ""weather"" which Southwest lied. I was stuck in Dallas airport for two days without any luggage. Southwest could not get me back to Tampa so I had to fly to Atlanta and rent a car for $569.00 to drive back to Tampa. In the process, my Macbook screen was shattered by Southwest and it was in my luggage. Southwest denied the claim because it was past the four hours and they do not do claims on ""electronic equipment"". I couldn't report the damage within four hours because my luggage made it to Tampa without me since Southwest could not get me home. On top of everything, my zipper was broken, lock cut off my suite case and laptop screen broken. Southwest maintained it was ""weather related"" even though no other airline canceled their flights. Southwest refused to help in anyways, lied saying it was weather related, and never was able to get me to my destination.This trip with Southwest has caused many issues and I will make sure my organization will not use them again."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Not the Southwest they used to be.,"Very disappointed with the trip to Vegas.  The flight on the way out to Vegas was rough with one of the rougher landings I have had.  The return flight was delayed due to not having the copilot then when we arrived “late” for our layover, we stopped away from the gate and sat for 10 more minutes then up to the gate and sat another 15, the pilot stated they couldn’t get a crew to operate the jetway.  We arrived in the airport rushed thru a meal and arrived at the gate just before the arrival boarding time to be told the plane was there but the crew wasnt.  Located past our gate was 6 other southwest gates and ALL were delayed.  Things happen and that is understandable but when it’s a majority of your flights, I will be going back to American and Delta until this gets sorted out.  Poor customer service, communication. Definitely a black eye for southwest that wasn’t just our flight.  Come on Gary, you guys are better than this."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Liars with HORRIBLE customer service,"Avoid this airline at all costs. Our flight was delayed 5 different times, and they refused to issue a refund because we had already taken the first leg of our flight(which was 30 minute flight). I begged them to refund half the cost so we could book on another airline but they refused. On top of everything they showed absolutely zero sympathy for our situation. When I suggested taking another flight they told me I shouldn’t expect any flight to be on time. They told me flights are unpredictable, and just because I booked a ticket with a certain take off time doesn’t mean I should expect it to take off then.  If they’re going to do such a bad job scheduling their flights the least they could do is have decent customer service....."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,What airline - do NOT book,"This is the first time I've flown Southwest and will certainly be the LAST. Their idiotic boarding procedures delay the departure and make sure you're not sitting with anyone from your party, in addition to having you store your baggage rows behind you.  Least organized, unhappy and least entertaining staff ever. I can't say enough bad things about Southwest. I am disgusted and traumatized by this experience."
Date of travel: September 2021,20,"DO NOT BUY THE EARLY BIRD CHECK-IN, IT'S A SCAM!","THIS WAS THE LAST STRAW! THE EARLY BIRD SPECIAL IS A SCAM! When Southwest Airlines first came out with the early bird special to purchase for early check-in, I thought it was a great idea. However, it sucks or is a scam. Seven times out of seven, I got in the worse boarding positions; only the very first time was I in ""A"" boarding category. My boarding positions were as follows (when I used the early bird check-in): A36, B15, B22, C1, B7, C10, B30. I will no longer purchase the early bird special. as it (clearly) does not check you in early for good boarding positions. Oh, as a side note, the last 3 check-ins I did without the early bird special, when I did it myself, my boarding positions were: A5, A8, A12. In case nobody knows, seat are not assigned, just boarding positions. So when they announce that they are boarding ""A"" passengers to board the plane, then A1-A36 passengers enter the plane first and get the pick of the seat, then B1-B36 and then C1-36. So you can imagine how bad the seats left over were, if you're in the ""B"" and especially the ""C' categories. Don't buy the early bird special, it's not worth the extra money, especially when they cannot even guarantee that you'll be in the ""A"" category at all."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,A Travel Nightmare,"Southwest managed to lose my luggage when I had a wedding to go to the next day.  The flight was late getting there.Return flight was to leave at 1:30 p.m. but kept getting delayed.  11 hours later, we lined up to board and pilot walked off the job.  Struggled to get my suitcase and was stranded in Las Vegas for 30 hours with no sleep.  Tried to rent a car, but due to the Raiders game and other events in Vegas, they were sold out.  Spent money on a shuttle, hotel, and finally a rental car to get home to Reno.  No reimbursement for any of these unexpected expenses.  When I got my suitcase back, it was busted open.  BLACKLISTED SW AIR FOR LIFE."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Loyal customer no more!!!!,We’ve flown for over 15 years exclusively! Their lack of customer service and chronic delays are terrible before Covid and currently!!! Done! Get your crap together SW!
Date of travel: October 2021,10,You Lost a Loyal Customer,"Our flight from Hartford to Baltimore was being delayed. I expressed my concern about missing the connecting flight to Sarasota. The gate person checked and told me that flight was also delayed and I would not have a problem making the connection. Our plane landed in A wing , the connecting flight was im Terminal B. We frantically ran to meet to the flight. When we got there the plane was still attached to the airport but we were denied access. We and several others discovered that unknown to us Southwest had rebooked us for a later flight landing after 10 pm. They refused us all access to the plane. When we received our new tickets we were stuck in C group. I asked to have my A status added back on but was told it would cost be $40. I was not the one who rebooked or changed the flight, Southwest did. Now that you inconvenience me you want to get another $40 out of me. Thanks Southwest for putting a loyal customer in the back of the plane. Thank you for the travel vouchers that we don't plan to use. The late night flights are always cheaper sometimes $100 less and you got my $40 for A listing. I am cancelling my Southwest credit card. Next time I will try your new competitor Avelo that is flying into Sarasota from Tweed or just go back to Jet Blue. Thanks for the inconveniences and terrible treatment of loyal customers. All of those that got denied access to your flight  vowed to never fly with you again."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Horrible Customer Service!!,"Bought my Daughter a plane ticket for Christmas. Realized I put in my name not hers. Called and had to wait 45 minutes, and was told couldn't even change the name!! And if I canceled ONLY I could use credit! You mean to tell me, that you cannot change a name (just the first name at that). I have traveled on Southwest a total of 6 times in a year, and you can't change a name?! You have lost a long time rewards customer and I'll make sure no one gets a referral from me! Here thought I was doing something nice and making sure my family was together for Christmas!"
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Liars and Very Unorganized,"Flight was for 8.45. AM 10/27/21.  They texted me at 10 PM 10/26 to tell me flight was cancelled and changed and new flight to another city was 7:15AM.  I saw the message at 6 AM and got to gate at 7:08 AM and plane was still at gate but they said door was closed and we could not board.  But they put our luggage on board, so bags do fly free, but people don't.  They said Texas was closed due to weather, but when we were trying to call resort and change everything while still at airport, Dallas was loading at another gate.  Go figure!  SW has had a lot of issues past several months and can not be relied upon.  TERRIBLE.  Luggage is gone, we did not get out of town for vacation and NO BODY AT SOUTHWEST CARES.  WHAT A GREAT AIRLINE!  Trip Advisor ask's when we flew.  The trip was scheduled for October 2021 but SW cancelled on us without giving opportunity to solve problem and help us.  Don't know if I will be flying SW in future."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Great care for low budget,"I had never flown Southwest before, and I did not know what to expect. Although I am still not used to not picking a seat before I fly, I found the queue system at the gate to be a pretty organized affair, more so than other airlines where people push and shove to get to their assigned seats (which I never understood to begin with). The plane seats are first come-first serve and you board by the boarding group and number on your ticket, which is actually very organized. If you really want to be first to pick your seat, then you should pay extra for pre-boarding, but we we had good seats for both our flights. The attendants were friendly and professional and although our flights were a little delayed due to weather, we were never majorly inconvenienced. The plane was clean and the seats were surprisingly comfortable for a short flight."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Horrible,"Short of the plane crashing, really couldn't have been much worse. Might have preferred that as opposed to being subjected to the insanity that was this trip."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Legal Theft,"Southwest Airlines has a terrible business model where if you purchase a flight six months in advance, then cancel within a week, you are unable to receive a refund for the flight. You are required to pay more money for a more expensive ticket in the first place on the chance that you may need to cancel in the future. Otherwise, you will only receive a credit that you can use with Southwest Airlines towards another flight, but it can only be used within 12 months regardless. If you don't need to fly that often, you are basically paying hundreds of dollars for a service that you never received. Not sure how a business can get away with that."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Southwest has gone downhill!,"This is now my second flight on Southwest in the last 30 days. Both have been round trip from Miami (MIA) to Greenville, SC (GSP). Both times flights delayed both ways by over an hour. I don’t care what metric they use to determine “on time”, all I know is the times I booked were an hour late! Each time each way. I think it’s time to give up on Southwest ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Zero communication,"Extremely late taking off, 40 minutes at this point and still waiting. They haven't communicated why. They offered 3 people 1,200 to go on a later flight and someone got back on after getting paid. These people are idiots. I've flown united and delta who have communicated why the delay is happening. If it's an airport delay or employment delay because of hours. Southwest is the new Spirit airline two thumbs down"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Do not fly until they figure their stuff out.,"Has to be the single worse two months of experiences I've ever had with an airline.  I flew them six times over this course and every single flight was delayed by 2-4 hours.  In addition, when they delay flights, they don't delay it once, they constantly change the new flight time 3-8 times so I'd you're trying to schedule hotels or transportation you're basically screwed.Calling into customer service was useless, even after waiting the hold time for them to call me back, when they finally did call me back, they still had me on hold and waited despite ""having a representative ready"". I never got to speak to someone. Speaking to a support employee in the airport was also useless. They blamed the delay on air traffic control, which is interesting that air traffic control seems to be delaying just southwest flights in a way that no one could foresee. I also asked how it when I would even know if the flight would take place tonight, to which I got another shoulder shrug. Finally, asking if there's any other route for support I could go, they sent me back to the customer support line, which now has over an hour wait and I doubt will answer my call again.Now I'm sitting in an airport, as I do everytime with Southwest, not knowing if my flight is going to take off tonight and unable to get any assistance from anyone in Southwest.Avoid until they figure out how to run an airline."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worse Airline,"Never again will use Southwest airlines, our flight from San Jose ca to Santa Ana on 10/22/21 was delayed 6  times from 8 am to 4pm canceling it later and sending it to Long Beach at 4:15pm, on our way back to San Jose on 10/23/21 it was delayed 3 times from 8pm to 10:44pm canceling it and rebooked it on Monday 10/24/21 and just saying sorry for the inconvenience, fck, you guys are the worse airline 😡😡😡😡"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Can't stand Southwest,"Difficult-to-navigate website, hate the inability to select seats in advance, unbearably bad (and constant) ""humor"" from the flight crew. The only reason I fly with this airline at all is because it's the only one that offers direct/nonstop flights from Oakland to Albuquerque. But I'd switch in a New York minute if any other airline else offered the same. And I'm tempted to just suck it up and fly nondirect with another airline, just to avoid these clowns."
Date of travel: October 2021,30,Oct Las Vegas Bingo Trip,"Our flights there and back where delayed, by half hour too LV and one hour going home.  The flights for some reason felt long.  The seats also seem smaller and  hard. Overall it felt a bit cramp for space.  The staff was very good on both flights,  no issues.  I hope they get the cancellation issue cleared."
Date of travel: October 2021,40,Not as disappointed as I could have been...!,"During the Columbus Day holiday weekend, almost 2,000 Southwest flights were cancelled. Covid and personnel related. So I was relieved my flight was not cancelled to South Carolina. Still delayed - aren't they all these days? Once we were ready, the crew got us onboard with little fuss. Not a full plane, Drinks and a snack available. Overall experience not good, not bad!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Services level,"You get what you pay for. By far the most incompetent, basic, rude, disorganised, airline I have ever experienced. Their stay reflect the training and pay scales they have."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Do NOT fly with Southwest,"I frequently fly for work and have come to dread having to fly Southwest Airlines.My flights with them are habitually delayed/canceled. Today for the first time I voiced my displeasure with being delayed for 3 hours and having my boarding position pushed back 50 places. For those of you who don't know, seating for Southwest is ""fist come, first served"" so boarding positions are rather important. I requested to either have my original position returned/restored or to get a free upgraded position. (Upgrades are almost always available, but you must pay a fee) the customer service representative refused to help me, saying there was nothing she could do. When I requested to speak with a supervisor she said she would call them once I stepped away from the counter. I requested to witness her calling the supervisor before stepping aside, at this point the customer service rep threatened not to call at all if I didn't step aside immediately.... This is abhorrent behavior for a Customer SERVICE rep. threatening not to help someone. So I stepped 10 feet away, watching/waiting for her to call her supervisor. After 10 minutes the rep walked 20 feet away and brought over her supervisor, who had been there the entire time! Dispicable, absolutely dispicable customer service. Garbage airline, rude representatives.DO NOT FLY WITH THEM"
Date of travel: October 2021,40,Service recovery,"We were stranded in Tampa FL for 3 days as a result of sickout organized by pilots over vaccine mandates resulting SWA flight cancelations.  Luckily, we're able to book on United Airlines with a steep hike in their airfare.Incurred hotel, food and trnsportation expenses @ this time. Called SWA and Spoke to Shanna #91.  She went above and beyond customer service.  More importantly, she was kind, polite, apologetic and  fixed all my concerns/issues.Due to her service recovery and her prompt effective response to our issues, will be using SWA for future travels. Thank you"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,So much for Southwest taking care of you when thing go wrong. Now I’m out $2000 because of Southwest meltdown!,"Southwest, on Mon. 10/11, My partner and I got dropped off at PWM at 4:15am for a 5:30 flight to JAN via BWI. I was 40 miles from home. Ride gone.  Agent informs me my flight to BWI is canceled and they won’t be able to get us to Mississippi, not just for a day, but for four or five days!   Nothing out of any other airport within 300 miles. We never got a phone call, txt or anything about the cancelation! The agent even suggest we drive the 1400 miles. At first, agent lied and told us the plane didn’t get in the previous night from BWI. When I informed her that tracked it myself on Flightaware and confirmed it landed the night before, and physically saw the plane at the gate while coming off the highway, she then tried to tell me the crew timed out. Regardless, we weren’t getting there for almost five more days! Nothing could be done! Just a “sorry”We needed to be there on Wednesday morning for an important function! We had expensive prepaid non refundable hotel rooms, another $400 prepaid rental car due to be picked up in Jackson that afternoon.  Had I not made it, I would have lost all that prepaid reservations, too! We scrambled, and had to buy to last minute tickets on Delta  for $950 each! Plus, $80 to race over across town to catch a bus to Boston, 3 hours ride away, for a 10:00am flight! Particularly stressing, as I was just laid off from my job! But I had to make this trip! People depending on me to be there! Had no choice but to spend almost $1900 dollars to get where I needed to be!  I felt like I got robbed! We were on hold with Southwest Reservations three hours to Boston until we lost phone battery, Delta got us to JAN a few hours later than planned. We tried calling Southwest for two days, but gave up trying to call  about refunds after the first two days. We would call and have the automated answering service telling us it wowas an 8-15 hours on hold! Now we’re hearing Southwest is giving folks like us a “Goodwill Gesture” $250 travel voucher? No thanks! That’s a joke!  We want our $600 back in full at minimum. Our $1360 extra costs to buy new tickets with DL would be a nicer Goodwill gesture.  We’re not going to be using a voucher anytime soon after this, and without a refund we’re out $2000 to fly two people from Maine to Mississippi. We could have gone to Hawaii for that rate! When delays are not a day or two, but up to five days later, you guys need to start paying to rebook folks on other flights who are counting to get somewhe I’ve had to wait over a week until we just got home tonight because I haven’t had time to be on hold during my travels for 8+hours!  I never felt so glad to be on Delta back to PWM from JAN yesterday. They use to be my preferred, but we’d been using Southwest almost exclusively the last five years."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Undeniably THE worst US Based Airlines for Customer Service,"Without a doubt SWA is THE single worst airlines when it comes to customer service.  If you ever call the 1-800# you will be put to hold forever; if you take the call back option, they will get an automated call the inevitably will end up with ""thanks for call SWA, goodbye"" without ever getting to talk with a representative.  Having flown multiple international and domestic flights, I can assure anyone reading this review that you will end up with nothing but frustration if you ever take a chance on SWA and oh BTW the prices are not that great either."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Southwest Steps UP,"Any company can get GREAT Reviews when all is going well but a GREAT COMPANY - when things are NOT GOING WELL Steps up and makes things GREAT I flew Southwest in the mist where everything was going wrong from them, BUT they all stepped up and made things GREAT - has two amazing flights with two amazing crews who DID NOT MISS A BEAT --- With all the pressure on them they did not miss a beat - AMAZING and Thank you   -- CP Kazor"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Canceled flight at last minute, refused to book me another airline, then Canceled entire itinerary by mistake!","Agent in airport said she would not book us on another airline nor would she be able to pay for hotel for the night. We had to pay for Hawaiian Airlines flight to get to our destination.  Then I found out she canceled our next flight also, by mistake,  though I had asked her to make sure not to cancel it. The agent on the phone the next day said he couldn't rebook our canceled flight without us paying again!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Unexpected Excellence in Customer Service,"We traveled from Rochester, NY to Austin, TX last night stopping in Baltimore.  When we landed in Austin at 11:00PM, I realized that I had lost my keys somewhere. We had to rent another car to get home.  Luckily, I had a TILE Tracker on my keys.  The next morning, the Tile Tracker showed that my keys were at Southwest Airlines in Baltimore.  I was frustrated when I called Southwest Baltimore because the phone was always busy.  After calling non-stop for an hour, Stacy answered the phone and after a brief search, she located my keys.  She took the initiative to suggest that I set up a Fed-Ex account on line so she could send me my keys for a 1 day delivery.  My keys are coming tomorrow.  Stacy went out of her way to help me out.  She went the extra mile and  provided excellent customer service.  Thank you again Stacy.  You are my hero."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terrible on time rating.,"Today, flying on Flight 105 from Las Vegas to Burbank with connection to Sacramento is totally delayed.  SW gate agent and pilot explained that it was a new operational design in use. Obviously, it doesn't work.  Probably going to miss my connection to Sacramento as our plane is still at the gate.  Terrible service, terrible system.  Will not fly this ""slow"" airline agsin."
Date of travel: October 2021,40,30 minute delay in getting out,"We flew in the weekend we heard there were problems and lots of delays. So thankful that our flight (first flight of the day, direct flight) was only delayed 30 minutes. My husband was worried we wouldn't get home and should cancel our flight and drive 1200 miles home but our flight home went great and was on time."

Date of travel: October 2021,10,Delayed Flights,They constantly delay their flights. This time the pilot wasn’t even in the airport and they delayed this flight at least 5 times. Unprofessional. The ticket cost $600 for a flight that was only an hour. Do not recommend.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,I hate Southwest Airlines,I made a rez from Kona to Oahu. Got a great $39 fare each way. Needed to change the departure date by one day. No charge. But when I re-entered the return date they charged me $40 more for the same flight! Not nice!
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Horrible last min cancellation,"Normally happy with SW, but they just cancelled my international 7am flight at 4am, and auto rebooked me to late tomorrow which means I loose $1000’s worth of vacation spend. Ridiculous that there is not a least a 24 hour notice on this."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,SW hurt a lot of people with their mismanagement,"SW hurt a lot of people unnecessarily.  They cancelled our flight then lied to us about other flights that day.  Then to top off everything SW refuses to answer their phone in a reasonable time.  120 minute wait and ten they disconnect you.  My confirmation number was 2JTQZQ if they give a damn.  I lost a lot of money on a house cancellation.  I think I’m going to take SW to small claims court over the money I lost.  Want to hear the excuses they gave.  THE WEATHER WAS BAD IN FLORIDA, COULD NOT FIND ENOUGH FLIGHT ATTENDANTS, COVITS, TRUMP, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS UNION AND PROBABLY MORE TONIGHT.  I HOPE THE FAA FNES TESE CLOWNS."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Changed my flight without notifying me, found out when I had to changing my flight.","Purchased two tickets for non stop flight, later SWA secretly made change to our flight to two stop flight. Without knowing my flight has been changed by SWA, imagine with 88 year old disability mom , how tough the journey could be worse than this. Another big issue could even worse, what if I missed my flight for no show, SWA definitely will take my money for no show simply because I have no proof that SWA didn’t notify me!Luckily I had to make change to my flight due to waiting for covid booster shot to discover SWA secretly changed my flight."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Poor Customer Service,"Southwest cancelled a flight we were checked in for 4 hours before departure with no good explanation. Southwest Airlines was unable to offer an alternative flight home. We had to rebook with another airline with the soonest flight being 2 days out. We incurred costs exceeding $1,000 due to this cancellation, and they send an email offering a $100 “I’m sorry” voucher towards future flight? We will never fly this airline again and will not recommend to anyone we know."

Date of travel: September 2021,10,Too bad to see me favorite airline treating their employees this way,"I have been a loyal customer to Southwest Airlines, but now based on recent events and knowing how Airline treats they own employees, giving them ultimate or loose their job and then on the top of everything LIE to their customers about the reasons of their flights cancellations - SHAME! Such a shame! This matter has to be fixed or they will loose thousands of customers including me :("
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Employee called my son ""an idiot"" and I receive a form letter as a response","I was feeling very bad about the flight attendants dealing with bad behaving clients until our experience this summer on a Southwest flight.  My son was helping me with my bag and was having trouble getting it to fit in the overhead.  My husband says to the flight attendant, ""he probably can't hear you because he has his headphones on"" and the flight attendant says, ""well, if he wants to look like an idiot in front of everyone, that's his choice"".  1) It's unacceptable to call anyone an idiot, especially a supposed customer.  2) I'm guessing this flight attendant is the real idiot because he assumed we were not traveling with this man with his headphones on, not realizing that he's our son.  If I think that the flight attendant is willing to call another customer ""an idiot"" to a customer, what does he call me to other passengers when I'm not listening.  I wrote a fuming email to Southwest and basically received a form letter:Thank you for contacting Southwest. I apologize that we have not met our intended timeframe to respond to your emails, but I appreciate the opportunity to follow-up with you.Customer perception is very important to Southwest, and we expect our Employees to deliver topnotch Customer Service at all times. We hire people who we trust to make a great impression on our Customers. We believe our Employees play an integral role in our Company’s success, and it is up to them to set our airline apart from the competition. Southwest Airlines has long been recognized for the quality and character of our Employees, and as such we take allegations regarding Southwest Employees' conduct seriously.  I apologize that we left you with less than stellar memories during your August 30 travel between Milwaukee and Washington D.C. Rest assured, I have identified the Employee involved and shared your feedback with our Senior Leadership.All in all, it is obvious that we have not scored a very ""high grade"" with you in regard to this situation, and it saddens us that you are questioning your future patronage of Southwest as a result. We hope that you will forgive us for such an atypical Southwest experience and give us another opportunity to restore your trust in us. We would love to see you onboard again soon.Time to cancel the Southwest credit card that I have in my wallet and find another airlines!!!!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Employees Don't Care About Clients!,"The Southwest staff are using passengers as pawns in a game with management. Flights were canceled all over the US as a result. Luckily mine was just delayed. Funny how the staff states that ""you all need to follow the rules or we'll kick you off the flight"". Then they play games when they have to follow rules. If they don't want to work there are millions of people who would be happy to take the job and the rules that come with it."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Terrible fiasco!!,"As much as I've flown Southwest in the past, I'm changing airlines to United.  From the moment I heard on October 9th about the delays and cancellations (over 800), then on Sunday October 10th (over 1,000) delays and cancellations I wondered if we would even make it back on October 11th.  Our time for departure changed at least 6 times and we were lucky that we had a plane and were able to get back home after only a 45 minute delay.  What I heard from other passengers was a nightmare and delays of more than 2 days.  Some gave up and re-rented cars and drove home.  The airline blamed the problems on things that shouldn't have mattered and were not transparent at all.  I'm tired of sitting on pins and needles when I fly so I'll find a better carrier."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Project Engineer,Worst airlines ever to be imaginable! They treat the customers like they’re cattle waiting to be slaughtered. Have absolutely no respect for anyones time or money. They wouldn’t even provide explanation for cancellation and didn’t bat an eye. Truely utter disgust for this company and it employees. You should all be ashamed for working for such an awful company!!!! Absolutely dreadful the way they treat the customers. Made me cry when they talked to me even. One of the worst corporate companies in this day and age. So sad that it’s come this low!!!

Thousands of dollars spent for what turned out to be for only one night at my destination. This seems like a crime!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Not what they once were,"Maybe it's the pandemic,  but my most recent experience on Southwest was atrocious. I'm used to a friendly experience with your average middle class crowd. This recent flight was full of vagrants who had no idea how to act on public who thought they could bring their offspring to terrorize every one else on board. I'm guessing they banked their unemployment checks because most of this flight looked like they had no public decency. The whole plane smelled like BO. The poor flight attendants had to deal with so much BS."

We waited. No stewardess came. The passenger I was sitting next to pushed the call button, and asked “ the steward” for said Diet Coke.He was SO hateful, and immediately snapped back to her, that they would NOT be serving drinks. I chimed in, that they did not announce that they wouldn’t be serving.He turned around, and went to tattle. Next thing, we know the stewardess announces that they will Not be coming around for drink orders, however he brought the sweet lady her Diet Coke.And we ask ourselves why there are so many irate passengers?SouthWest?  You have problems!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,My stupid flight was delayed,"My friends and co-workers insisted of Southwest because alligent airlines are horrible but I'm very disappointed in my recent flight.

His bags were checked in while his flight was cancelled. He spent hours on hold trying to re-book. He already has the cost of 4 Uber trips incurred from the actions of the airline. Dishonest  and not transparent in reasons provided to national media for mass cancellations.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Absolute disaster of a company,They send an email out at midnight knowing most people won’t see it till they wake up and cancel your flight then they offer absolutely no help at all about rescheduling your canceled flight cause they have a lack of workers then blame it on everything else’s but their own incompetence. I hope nothing but the worst for this company and their CEO needs to be fired. That person is an absolute joke of a person.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,SWA completely abandoned us this weekend.,canceled flight night before.   did not book us on another flight.  hold times to speak to representative over 3 hours.   I know things are disrupted right now - but this was A TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE.   I'm especially disappointed that there was ZERO transparency.    I've been an A List customer for many years - but i'm not sure i'm coming back.
Date of travel: June 2021,30,complicated,"The flight to Vegas was bumpy but, otherwise uneventful. The flight back a week later was Canceled we did not receive the notice until we got to the airport, That was my own fault (it's Vegas who checks their phone!) We were compensated later and will be flying with them again. We did get home two days later exhausted but, glad to be home."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Unbelievably disappointing!!,"We arrived at the airport for our flight only to find out, with NO prior notification, that our flight was cancelled.  The person who ""helped"" us was extremely rude and did not care at all the snowball effect of all our plans were very costly to my family.  We overheard another ticket person being nice and accommodating to the person she was helping, and I pointed out to her that I just heard they were helping recoup some of the cost for the other customer's.  The lady assisting us just said I cannot do anything else.  So we are out hotel stay fees, rental car fees, dog boarding fees, and transportation to the airport fees.  WOW Southwest has really gone from the friendliest airline to the unfriendliest.  I could just CRY!!!!!  So now I have been holding for Southwest corporate for over 2 hours ---still holding.  Very very disappointing."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Thank you Southwest,"Southwest Airlines is having all kinds of trouble right now. I wish I could send them my support. They have been absolutely amazing, supportive and understanding when we have flown with my autistic grandson and his service dog. Even when we fly alone their attitude of friendliness and gratitude is heads and shoulders over other airlines. This was reenforced recently when we had no choice but to fly United. They acted like we were lucky they gave us a ride.  As they say they know we have choices and we choose Southwest. #southwestairlines"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,No customer service,Cancelled our flight and spent 3 hrs on hold trying to reach an agent.  Flight delayed 3 days with no compensation due to Southwest labor issues.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Late night cancelation and rebooking my trip without asking me what day would be best. I hate u,Sw is mad annoying. Canceled my flight 6 hrs b4 take off... in the middle of the night.  Been on this phone waiting for 1 hr and 23 mins so far and not 1 customer agent to pick up. This is my last year traveling with you. Twice in 1 year you've really missed my trip. If I ever miss my grandpa funeral oooo you'll hear about it
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst Experience,"The airline delayed my flight in and moved my flight out by more than four hours each direction. The airline was not helpful in trying to rectify this mistake by allowing me to change my flights to better time, or in enforcing federal mask mandates. Several people on the flight did not abide by guidelines and the airline did nothing to address it."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Stranded family of 12 with 30 min notice,"Never using them again perfect weather all the way home no excuse other then crappy company. They were the only company that was canceling flights. Yet we’re trying to blame ATC, Stranded our family with only 30 min notice un-helpful and horrible ,save ur family and yourself time and do not use this airline. Lost our business for life embarrassing customer service no refund and to switch to another airline was going to be charged $5,000 in fees by southwest. Take it from us again southwest at all cost."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Flights canceled because of short staff,"I am in a wheelchair and I have been at the airport for TWO days now, the first flight was cancelled because of “weather” I checked and called my friends at my destination city and there was good weather there, then I tried to get in the standby list for the flight the next morning and the plane was full, then the next flight was at 4:45 which they also cancelled because they didn’t have enough crew members. I have now been in line for a total of approximately 4 hours between the two days I have been at the airport AND my luggage is already in Miami."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,CANCELLED ONE HOUR BEFORE FLIGHT,Email hit our phones when we were at airport.No explanationNo apologyNo helpNo flightsAutomatically booked us two days later on ridiculous late night flight.Flying delta tomorrow.SW Phone was 2 hour hold!Horrible customer service No one even tried to apologize or help.Sooooo disappointed in an airline we’ve flown for years.Really let us down.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Wedding Anniversary ruined because of Southwest Airlines.,"My wife and I planned our 3rd wedding anniversary trip months in advance. The first change was instead of having a direct flight from Columbus, OH to DC it got changed to a layover in Chicago. Then that got changed to a layover in Orlando. When we got to Orlando on Saturday 10/9/21 our flight to DC was delayed from 11:50am to about 3pm because Southwest didn't have any pilots to fly the plane. At 3pm the flight from Orlando to DC got cancelled. At this point we already paid $1300 for an Airbnb in DC but Southwest didn't have any flights to DC untill Tuesday. We decided to get a flight from Orlando to Columbus on Saturday 10/9/21 for 7:50pm at that point I asked the gentleman working the desk at 101 his name starts with a J if that flight would be cancelled as well? He responded with "" I don't have a crystal ball I can't tell the future"" fantastic answer. Great training and hiring on the part of Southwest Airlines. After that we asked about our bags he said once we get back to Columbus at almost 11pm we have to go request our bags for a call back from DC and that it will take over a day to get our bags because according to him ""they are behind with cancellations and they won't go looking for just our two suitcases I guarantee it"". Once again the customer service and the way he talks to us is award winning, Southwest must be proud of the way they interview, hire, and train. We only received a 50% refund from Airbnb so we lost $650 and our wedding anniversary trip was ruined because of Southwest Airlines."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Garbage airline,Complete trash airline and service. Every one of my four flights delayed with no help from employees. Will never fly this Spirit+ airline again
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Completely Unreliable!!!!!!,Cancelled my flight at the last minute and could not rebook me for 2 whole days.  Impossible to get an agent on the phone.  Had to cancel the entire vacation because of Southwest airlines incompetence.  COMPETELY UNRELIABLE!!  In my opinion one star is too many.  Would rate them with a negative number if I could.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Delayed flights and Cancelled Flight,"The flight out of Love Field was delayed, which caused me to miss my connecting flight in St Louis (to Des Moines, IA). (October 8th, 2021). Ended up having to pay for a $175 hotel room where I slept for 3 hours, only to arrive at the airport at 3:30 AM, check-in and be waiting to board a flight to LAS (Las Vegas), where I was then supposed to catch a flight back to Des Moines finally. They cancelled the LAS flight, leaving me stranded for the second day in a row. They refused to help cover the cost of the hotel. They refused to help cover the cost of a rental car, because at this point it made more sense to drive 5 and a half hours home.Unless someone from Southwest makes this right with me very quickly, I will share my horrible experience on every travel and review site on the entire internet. This is unacceptable. I have incurred over $400 in additional expenses and lost an entire weekend due to mismanagement on the part of South West. No consumer should be treated like this. This is willful negligence on the part of South West  and I think consumers should be able to seek financial recourse through litigation if the airline doesn't make a good faith effort to make things right."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Southwest destroys family vacation,"Southwest cancelled my sons flight for his family vacation with his spouse and 2 children to Orlando on Oct 8, 2021. All the other airlines were flying into Orlando with no issues. The airline would not give them new flights and told them to call customer service which had a 3 hour wait. They lost the money for their hotel room and could not rebook their flights . Apparently Southwest is cancelling 27 flights per day randomly and telling their fliers to go to hell."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Would not recommend Southwest,Was on hold for 3 hours and they never answered. In the fine print their last deal was good until 10/11 but it stopped working on the 8th. Couldn't even get ahold of anyone to fix the issue. Seems like it was a website issue but couldn't reach anybody.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Flight Cancelled 8 hours before scheduled departure,I have been planning a surprise trip to Walt Disney World for my mom since November 2019. It was originally suppose to take place May 2020...due to COVID I had to rebook for October 2021. I am UNDER 8 hours away from my scheduled departure time and I received a text message saying that my flight was canceled and rebooked to depart at 715pm....that is an ENTIRE day lost at Disney. I already lost out on ALL my flight money for my original booking in 2019 due to not using my tickets within a year of purchase. I have been on hold for an hour waiting to speak with a representative. My flight that was canceled out of Milwaukee tomorrow is the ONLY flight that was canceled. This is NOT acceptable.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"If you need to get somewhere, DO NOT FLY SOUTHWEST","Not sure what the cause is for @Southwest earning the most unreliable way to fly award! The last few time I flew Southwest, my flight has bred delayed, sometimes more than once, or worst, completely cancelled.Today’s horror show went like this, and mind you, it was absolutely beautiful weather:1. 4:45 takeoff from Islip, Long Island to Miami.2: Flight delayed to 5:20.3. Flight delayed to 6:10.4. By taking the 6:10 flight, it gets me into BMI three minutes after my connecting flight departed.5. I call Southwest to make certain my connection would wait, woman says “sometimes”.6. I ask if they don’t and I get stuck there, what time can you fly me out in the am? Silence, then she says, they’ll try to get you out as early as possible… 7. I say, can you book me on the earliest flight out, she says it’s booked! 8. I say how about the next one out… she says it’s booked!9. I ask if there’s a chance I could be stuck at BMI the entire day? 10. Silence and then a inaudible YES!!!!  11. I cancel the flight!12. Here’s the kicker, o ask the nice lady to convert the cost of the tickets into a credit I can use later… she tells me, because I did use a voucher from a previous cancelled flight almost a year ago, I have SIX days to use them or I lose them! 13. I say they’re no longer a year old, I just cancelled today’s flight so I should have a year to use them.14. She says yeah, that doesn’t make much sense, you (I) should call Corporate! I’m on my way to LaGuardia, flying to Miami, nonstop! @Southwest is a hot mess, completely dysfunctional and I’d suggest flying ANY other airline! They are horrible!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Cancelled flight disaster,So I booked a flight to Miami and because of family issues I had to cancel I went online and cancelled the flight 24 hrs before. I logged out and back in to make sure it was cancelled and it was. I don’t normally check email so I didn’t think to check that for a conformation that the flight was cancelled. Today I logged on to book a flight I should have had $250 credit on my account however it only shows $40. I called SW and she said you never cancelled the flight and the I was just out the money which is weird because the $40 credit I did have was from that flight. I usually fly 3-4 times a year and don’t even think to fly other airlines but after this I will never fly southwest again.
Date of travel: September 2021,20,The worst Southwest Flight Attendant I have ever seen,When I boarded this flight from Dallas to Salt Lake City I was greeted by the most unhappy horrible Flight Attendant I have ever seen on Southwest. I am normally a big Southwest fan but not on this flight. This Flight Attendant I think her name was Melissa was the most unfriendly dictatorial Flight Attendant I have ever seen. When she was doing the initial announcements it was you will do this and you will not do that and you will OBEY our Commands. She acted like she was queen of the plane and the passengers were her subjects. I hope I am never on another flight with her. In fact if I knew she was on the crew I would choose another flight or another airline. She was horrible. I'm sorry to be so critical of someone but she certainly earned it. Someone needs to remind her where the money comes from to pay here salary (the passengers) or encourage her to find a new job.The good news is on the flight back the next day (flight 5417) the Flight Attendants were great which is what I have come to expect from Southwest.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729156-r813328312-Southwest_Airlines-World.html#
Date of travel: October 2021,20,"Cancellations, Delays, Fully packed planes","The service is starting to feel like a shuttle bus/public transportation. It does not have the same level of flying experiences anymore. The practice seems to be to offer multiple flights and times, have people book it and be locked in plans they've set, then cancel whatever flights were used as bait and not going to operate anyway, then forcible have people change their flight to all be stuffed on the same plane. Staff was great, none of this is their fault and shouldn't affect them. This is just bad planning and airline practices. I won't use a service I can't rely on, as I do not have time to spare when making plans. I also did not get refunded the correct amount for my rebooked flight that I am also going to have to deal with. This appears to be an obvious move, because even without submitting a complaint, I was sent a voucher for future travel. Getaways used to be fun and spontaneous, but now it's like being herded like a factory farm cattle, all stuffed into one plane. I'm not sure how it is for other airlines, but definitely making me rethink using SW again. My flight back to LAS was delayed, please do not announce a 10 minute wait that is like an hour in reality. Just say it'll be an hour and I'll go have a drink instead of standing in line for nothing."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Hawaii 2021 return,The experience flying back to Phoenix was an alright one! Flight attendants Kelsey and Nicole made it worthwhile by making sure all their passengers including me and my family were taken care of! They provided one of the most exceptional services on this flight! These two flight attendants and the ones going to Hawaii should get a raise in their salaries! They are so exceptional!
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Hawaii 2021,"It was really a wonderful experience getting to fly to Lihue,HI! The flight attendant Jacoby made the flying experience and time go by so fast with his giggles and jokes! He was so hilarious! I am so glad I had such a wonderful time flying to Hawaii! Next time though I recommend flying actually from Phoenix, AZ as it is much more better for me."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Ruined 20th Reunion,"Southwest completely ruined my 20th college reunion that I had planned for 6 months. They canceled our flights 90 minutes before take-off and rebooked us 24 hours later, arriving 3 hours after the event we were looking forward to. Now they are holding me hostage with all of my “miles” and so I’m left with no choice but to fly with them again for my next trip they will surely destroy for no given reason.Get it together, Southwest. Everyone else is."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Family friendly,My son had such a long morning of traveling and had been up since 3 in the morning on car rides and flights and was having a rough time when getting aboard our last flight of the day. One of the flight attendants offered to let him sit in the cockpit and get a picture when we landed. My 3 year old remembered and got so excited. The pilot was more than happy to let him sit in the cockpit and even offered to take a few pictures for me on my phone. My son was so happy and we just had such and amazing experience! Would HIGHLY recommend! We’ve always flown southwest and always had a great experience but this one today was the absolute best experience!
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Anniversary trip went wrong,"Flying home from Savannah our flight got delayed because of a mechanical issue and a miscommunication between planes. We were over an hour and a half delayed. My husband and I asked many times about changing flights or having them communicate to our connecting flight so that we do not miss the connecting flight from Nashville to Denver. The southwest staff in Savannah said there is nothing she can do. She told us that we could not change flights and that she cannot communicate to the other plane to wait because it is just 2 of us. We desperately pleaded because we needed to be home that night. The clerk said, well it will get there 10 minutes before your flight leaves and maybe they will wait. She provided no other assistance to help us make it, despite us asking. We missed our flight because the plane did not wait 17 minutes and then we got stuck in Nashville overnight due to there being no other flights going out to Denver from Nashville. The supervisors with southwest in Nashville told us that we could have been scheduled on alternative southwest flights in Savannah to make sure that we got to Denver that night. They apologized and then made us go on our own goose hunt for a different flight. They gave us a hotel voucher for a hotel that had no open rooms, so we had to come back to the airport to get another hotel voucher. They did not refund us or provide accommodations for food to assist us in anyway. The staff with southwest were very unhelpful. We used to fly with southwest a lot, but now we will reconsider before ever choosing southwest again."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,No Refund Policy or Credit for Person who purchased tickets,"I am so upset.  I purchased tickets for myself and two other people.  I purchased them early and they were about $500.  I needed to reschedule the flight and purchased the three tickets for less.  I was not refunded the money, but received a credit for only my ticket.  The other money was credited each person on the tickets.  I called and they said they could not credit or refund me the monies even though I purchased the tickets with my credit card.  Also, they said that the other two passengers could not purchase a ticket for anyone other than themselves.  I think this is a stupid rule.  I do not know what they are accomplishing with this rule other than gifting money that is not theirs to gift to the other flyers.  I wrote to them and they gave me a ""LUV voucher"" for $150.  What the !#@# is that?  I'll tell you what it is not.  It is not even close to the monies they need to refund or credit me.  I will never fly Southwest again, even with the stink'in ""LUV voucher""."
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Worst seating arrangement,It was first flight for my 4 year old son. I wanted him to have window seat. But seating arrangement is worst. I was not aware family could board early. When I boarded everything left was single seat in middle. I have to beg someone for two seats together. Very dissatisfied.. my son didn’t have the flight I wished for. It made me feel bad for not boarding early.. this is first time I am seeing something like this.. other flights just have seat number in your boarding pass
Date of travel: September 2021,30,Onboard Entertainment Never Seems to Work,"I love Southwest Airlines.  They have been doing the best they can during the pandemic.  I do have a few issues that they could probably work to improve...even with the current state of things...especially on my confirmation 2TMCT5.1) Could you please do something to beef up your Wi-Fi for the in-flight entertainment?  50% of my flights (including the last one from Savannah to Dallas) start buffering halfway through the movie.  Yes, the most important thing is getting to my destination on time, but a bit frustrating when the movie stops halfway through the flight.2) Not sure if this is possible, but when you are stuck in the tarmac waiting for a gate is there anyway to mitigate the pungent smell of jet fuel exhaust coming into the cabin?  I sat in row 9 during my last flight.  It makes it hard to breath, and I have concerns of the toxins the passengers breathe in...even with the mandatory masks."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,I'll NEVER fly Southwest again,8 hour delay for a 40 min flight that caused us to rebook everything!!! They provide NO $$ for food. Then I get to my NEW scheduled flight 10 hours later to only be DELAYED AGAIN!!!  I paid for BUSINESS SELECT A1-A15 boarding and they load 11 wheelchair passengers & their travel buddies!!! Why pay for first boarding when you end up behind 22 people!!!!  I will NEVER fly Southwest again. AND THEY GAVE US FREE DRINK COUPONS GOOD FOR TODAY ONLY WHEN THEY'RE NOT EVEN SERVING DRINKS!!! I was a loyal customer but they lost me FOREVER this time.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Southwest airlines policy rips off people.,I have a flight at the end of the month from Reno to Albuquerque. I had purchase my ticket a head of time unfortunately no one knows when they are going to be sick so I had got sick and they will not cancel my flight if I cancel they will penalize me and charge me. Then they said I will just have credit to use for another ticket. What a way to Rob people this is in American southwest airlines I understand needs to make money as a business but by Robbing people like this wow I highly recommend another airline After this I will never fly southwest airlines they should change that heart symbol they advertise on the side of their planes obviously this company has no heart for the people just their pockets.
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Lost iPhone in airplane,"I am very pleased with the recent service from Southwest. I recently lost my iPhone and they were very responsive and accurate with finding my lost item. It only took 2-weeks to find my iPhone that was left behind on a plane. On the day of losing my item, the flight attendant let me use her cellular phone to reach my family and notify them of the situation. She was attentive to the situation and wanted to make sure I was safe and could reach my destination. Very excellent job from the entire staff!"
Date of travel: September 2021,50,smooth flight,"Great flight attendant, on time service, reasonable fare. I have seen southwest employees hustle to stay on time."
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Early Bird Check-in is simply money making machine that bites fliers,"I tried to buy Not so Early Bird Check-in, only to find out if does not benefit you, it is not guaranteed you'll get early priority. Everyone is allowed to buy, which means buyers are being fooled. Because you are again competing with other passengers for priority. Which means you can still be put to B or C even if you you bought the crap of not so early bird check-in."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Southwest is our FAVORITE AIRLINE,"We have taken 4 round-trip flights on SWA in 2021 with great customer service from all SWA employees.  We have just returned from a visit in California with family. We flew on SWA to Oakland,CA  from Buffalo,NY on September 1,20214… And returned from Ontario California September 22.   I cannot emphasize how GREAT The Southwest employees in all capacities made our trip a better one! This trip I needed extra handicap assistance for 1st time and was treated with great care and respect.  We have always loved Southwest airlines and its employees… But this trip really reinforced our feelings!And just a comment on the world situation… These poor SWA Employees must enforce federal regulations for COVID/masking. How has it happened in our society that the violence and disruption and disrespect for these employees has grown to such a state?!  I am in full support of the federal government assisting these workers. Their jobs are hard enough let alone having to be policeman too!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Never again!,"Thought I’d save $50 compared to Delta flight. Delays, delays and more delays. Mechanical issues. Then they couldn’t get a log book delivered. In the meantime, the Delta flight that I could’ve taken left and arrived on time. I could’ve driven from Atlanta to PCB quicker than this trip took. This airline sucks. Check out the Yelp reviews! Almost all 1 out of 5. This airline sucks! Ruined my trip that I was looking forward to going on. Never again will I fly SW."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Easy Flights!,"We flew from Baltimore, MD to Manchester, NH on Flight 2871 on Sept. 16 and on a return flight 2667 from Manchester to Baltimore on Sept. 20.  We were warmly greeted at curbside check-in at both airports and quickly sent on our way.  Everyone from the security personnel to gate check-in staff was so pleasant.  Thankfully, neither flight was completely full, so we could spread out a little – we had an empty seat between my husband and I. This was the first flight we have taken since January 2020 due to the pandemic.  We were required to wear masks from the time we entered the airport, on the plane, and until we left the airport.  We were pleased to see that everyone was complying with this regulation.  The crew were cheerful and entertaining.  Frankly, I feel sorry for the flight attendants due to the passengers that they have to deal with.  It used to be everyone dressed for casual Friday, now they dress like they are working in the yard on Saturday.  Even more distressing is the amount of items that people carry on… way too much.  This was less than an hour flight.  The best part of both flights is that they were uneventful – thanks to our skillful pilots."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Seating was unacceptable,Scheduled seats together but had to sit separately. On the way back we had to pay an extra $180 for seats together. We got drink vouchers as a consolation and couldn't redeem them on the flight.
Date of travel: August 2021,50,PATIENCE of JOB!!,"Flying SOUTHWEST Airlines gives me a better feeling than others (3). It's a sincerity thing.  Communications and air travel are two of those most difficult commodities to coordinate, let alone please EVERYONE.  But SW Feels like they are sincerely making that effort.  Not just by the great employees, but the not so great moments too.  Comparing is hard enough with humans involved, but for all these situations and moments ""I"" have seen, they really do have a lot of ❤.  Thank-you to all of the employees, every single one!!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Passenger,"Worst ever!! Sent some email to screw up our flights that we did not get!! Customer service worst ever ! No compensation at all! I work at 7am and my husband works at 7:30, they do not care at all!  Les than 1 star service!!"
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Handicap friendly,I cannot express my gratitude to the steward/stewardesses and the pilot on my flight to Florida and back! They made sue I was comfortable and was there to assist incase I needed help transferring from my wheelchair to the aisle seat ( even the pilot ) if I could give you 100 stars I would! Amazing ! Thank You southwest I will be using you every chance I get!
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Not Safe,"I flew Southwest both ways.  It was horrible.  I had to ask a man next to me but across the aisle to raise his mask.  Plus both ways there was an individual  excessively coughing on the flight within view or in the seat next to me.   My seat mate on the outgoing flight  was given coffee and allowed to remove her mask so she was unmasked much of the trip and still coughing.  On the way to my destination,  we were told the plane was full.   These individuals should not have been permitted to fly.  I will not fly Southwest again during the pandemic.   The only positive was that the pilot managed to make the  trip  above in record time.  Needless to say, I quarantined and will continue to do so.  I am very disappointed in Southwest. I expected better."
Date of travel: May 2021,40,"When I have to, SWA is a nice experience","I flew SWA recently because my normal AA flights didn't leave late enough.  I like being able to choose an aisle seat so I pay the little extra to have earlier boarding number.  I like how the seats are all spacious.  It gets a little getting used to when it comes to boarding but beyond that a good experience.  Since I fly internationally and appreciate the points, I plant to stick with AA and fly SWA when needed."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Southwest Airlines you rock!!,"I have always flown on American Airlines however, watch out American Southwest is becoming your new competitor in my world.  I was trying to depart from New Orleans after Hurricane Ida and Southwest became my go to airline due to availability, cost at the last minute, free baggage, seat selection, and early boarding if you are willing to pay $15.00 to $30.00.  Also, the flight was direct to Atlanta with no connections or delays unlike the American flights.  In addition, Lori who booked our flights was efficient, effective, and extremely helpful during the time after Hurricane Ida.  Thanks Southwest Airlines you are slowing becoming a favorite in my book.  Thanks for a safe and on time arrival and departure and the LUV vouchers.  Our next adventure awaits."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Never again at any price!,"Use to fly SWA back and forth weekly. Cabin service and gate agents are horrible, lazy and just don't care. This airline ranks almost below Spirit! Never again at any price. Flew American last week and Delta the month prior. For only a little more cost a much better experience.  They actually want your business! Southwest could care less..."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Tried to leave me for 4 days in Denver,"SouthWest was the only airline to cancel ALL their flights into Boston for ""hurricane"" Henri which never even affected Boston.  Other airlines kept their flights on schedule and were landing all day/night.  Instead SW cancelled our flight on Sunday from Denver>Boston, and said the soonest they could get us to Boston was 5 days later on Thursday.  A full 4 days later than we were supposed to get there.  They wouldn't rebook us on another airline, so we had to pay $900 on Delta who got us in later that day no problem.  I will never fly SouthWest again."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Canceled my flight last minute,They canceled my flight the day of and rebooked a flight for me where I land four hours later and gave me a 5 hour layover. This ruined my family’s schedule for my cousin’s wedding.
Date of travel: September 2021,50,All-time favorite,"The more I hear people complain about other airlines’ carryon restrictions, extra fees, frequent delays, and airline employees on power trips, the more I appreciate Southwest. I never fly another airline except if Southwest doesn’t go where I’m going. I love them."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Stranded in NYC,"Southwest Airlines left ALL of their passengers STRANDED in NYC on Aug. 22, 2021. They hurriedly made the decision to cancel ALL flights leaving LaGuardia the day before a possible tropical storm. No other airlines cancelled ALL of their flights.Furthermore, when trying to get someone from SW to help us, they did not respond until I borrowed an A-lister's phone. I am a female, and I was initially spoken to differently than my male friend.Extremely disappointed in SWA and will be looking for another mileage card that allows me to fly on another airline!"
Date of travel: August 2021,30,Little Tube Of Horrors,"No longer are the crews fun loving in fact they wish not to deal with you at all. No one greets at the door though they do stand around. You are to get in your seat sit down and shut up. The seatbelt/life vest speech still goes on but is very to he point. More effort was spent barking the mask commands over the loud speaker. In fact they actually patrol for miscreants who try to get air. Were told to ""not even try to get by with eating""No personal food or water. Pretzels were issued. You can not even ask for drinks any longer there is a choice of 4 only and you must signal by fingers. Can only go to the bathroom one at a time and if someone sneeks in while you are still coming up the aisle they don't even speak just point at the sign and you must drag your distended bladder back down the aisle. I am by no means a small person but I was trapped against the window by the flesh of someone bigger than me and her equally large companion with that tiny bathroom break my only escape. While forced to wear mask for 3.5 hours in a pressurized tube my O2 sat at one point dipped to 81 at which point I rebelled for fear of my life and popped back up to 94 almost instantly which for being in the tube is an acceptable level. Did anyone care that I was hypoxic-nope. What little pleasure of flying I had left is now gone. Just another thing to be endured on the way to where I want to be. Thank you very much SWA I ""luv"" you too."
Date of travel: September 2021,20,The Hunger Games of Boarding,"I usually don’t fly this airline, but we were looking for a non-stop at certain times, so we did. We paid for business select, and my husband waited for the boarding pass opening, got A1 and A2. Our understanding  being that you want to be on the plane in the first group. We arrived to find the prior flight still waiting at the gate, and so we sat for a bit. The prior flight was way delayed, and ended  up not boarding. Our flight was also delayed.  But it did eventually begin to board. There weren’t any announcements that were audible, and the crowd just formed like a mob, so when they began boarding we stood at the front, waiting for the people in wheelchairs and such to get on, being pushed and shoved by the crowd at the gate. I went to check in and the man next to me shoved his boarding pass at the agent, who said, I’m doing pre boards still. So then another bunch of passengers pushed through and walked on. The crush of the crowd pushing me to the side, the agent said ok, A’s can board now and I was let on behind 3 other people, then waited for my husband, A1, who Had been pushed back in the crowd after letting a lady through in her wheelchair. By the time we got on, we were only able to grab the very front seats to get a window. That was only available because the flight attendant was standing there.  We asked if we could take them. It was crazy. The flight was weird for me, as the staff pretty much sat, with pandemic restrictions being what they are, I guess?  But it wasn’t horrible . We did get some coffee and snacks, and some extra water, as the flight had been delayed for a good hour while they loaded the luggage on the plane after we boarded, and we were on it for far longer than we planned. At the baggage claim after landing though…another hour wait to get our bags, standing, no seats, in a crowded, confused area, where our flight “timed out” on the sign and sent our entire plane of passengers walking around trying to find our new spot. I could not believe what a mess that whole flight was. We were miserable. Two days later I realized they broke a handle piece off my luggage. Guess that’s why it’s free. Our flight back was nothing like that, so at least I can give 2 stars, but I’d rather just spend the money for a better airline and avoid the Hunger Games wheel of luck."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,UNWILLING to work with you during a PANDEMIC,"I had to cancel a trip to see family for Thanksgiving in 2020 for obvious reasons. I have not been able to fly throughout this Pandemic for the risk and therefore have not been able to use the credits for another flight until now. As I try to book my flight, almost 10 months after when it was canceled, I am made aware that I can't use my credits anymore because my ""new' flight is after the 12 month limit.... which makes no sense. I was traveling for Thanksgiving, and am trying to travel for Thanksgiving again.... Called customer service and they were horribly unhelpful and unwilling to talk to me."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Consistently Terrible Service,"My husband and I travelled to Colorado this past weekend for a good friend’s wedding celebration, and made the grave mistake of booking our flight with Southwest. We needed to arrive in Denver in time for a 4-8PM welcome dinner, so we booked a flight that landed at 2:20PM thinking that would give us plenty of time. As we were en route to the Atlanta airport, we received a notification that our flight was delayed an hour, which was inconvenient, but a Southwest representative informed us that there were no earlier flights available for us to switch to so we figured we could still make it work and just be a little late to the dinner. Then when we were about 2 hours in to our 2.5 hour flight, the captain announced that we could not land in Denver because of “bad weather” and instead needed to divert to Albuquerque to refuel. We were not informed of this until we were practically on the ground in NM, and what we were initially told would be a 20-minute refueling turned into over an hour delay in Albuquerque. We did not land in Denver until nearly 7PM local time, at which point we had completely missed the wedding event that we flew in for – had we known we would not be able to attend the welcome dinner, we would have flown in Sunday morning for the wedding instead and saved hundreds of dollars in lodging and rental car fees. To add insult to injury, everyone we spoke to in Denver was baffled by our story because they claimed there were clear skies in Denver all day – no severe weather at all that would have prevented our flight from landing on time! Even assuming there was severe weather that all of those people somehow missed, I’m guessing we could have avoided it had we departed at our original scheduled time; alternately, had the plan been adequately gassed-up in the first place, we would not have needed to divert to Albuquerque resulting in a further multi-hour delay. I paid a lot of money for a flight that would get to Denver at a certain time, and I did not get what I paid for. Southwest’s operational incompetence and inefficiency robbed us of a celebration with a dear friend that we can never get back, and ended up costing us hundreds of dollars in services we ended up not needing as a result. This is the third time in a row that I have had a terrible experience with Southwest (after an abruptly cancelled flight in April 2019 and similarly excessive delay in December 2019), and I am honestly angry at myself for giving them another shot. Never again."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,SOUTHSHIT!,"Whom ever coordinates the seating, should be replaced or fired! They DO NOT assign seats but take out the time to generate a section and position on the boarding pass.  So this means you don't get to sit with your family,  while a pandemic is brewing and then you have the stupid that never travel and want to fight over seats!! They're so worried about everyone wearing a mask but bring out your drinks in a cup with no cover or anything! GRosss!!! Never again! Oh and they mention having movies on board and the seats don't even have screens! Lol!"

Southwest is canceling many flight lately I been told, now I believe it."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Ms,We were supposed to have 1 stop but when we arrived at the airport in Baltimore the flight had added two more stops. 12 hours for what should be a 5 hour trip. Can’t get off the plane without having to remove all belongings and stand in line again. Only 3 choices of soda and no food for 12 hours. Shame on you Southwest. You have lost two longtime loyal customers. Even the flight attendant said “ the passengers going to Phoenix are very confused”.

I had to rebook next day. I felt SWA could have done more to right the situation. They Didn’t even acknowledge my frustration. You get what you pay for,"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Racist Employee’s,"My family and I had a round trip flight from BWI to Orlando and back, obviously. The trip over was decent even though it was overly packed. But, when trying to return from Orlando my family and I were banned from entering the flight from a racist employee who was scanning boarding passes. When she was told she shouldn’t speak to people the way she was and that she was only speaking to people of color that way she made a scene and chased my sister and grabbed her by the book bag. All we were trying to do when she did this was walk down the tunnel to the plane. The lady stopped boarding the entire plane for about 20 mins and called the police even though she was the one who was causing a scene and basically assaulted my sister. 10/10 do not recommend south west airlines especially if you’re a person of color."

Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Southwest Airline no longer the best; in fact, they may be the worst","Forget every positive experience about the Old Southwest, and erase those high reviews. Those days are over, and it's the end of an era. They should change their name to Scrubwest airline, because there is a high percentage your flight this Fall is going to get scrubbed. It will either get canceled, or they will move it to a new time that is often impossible to meet. The CEO is retiring in 2022, so I guess he's taking down the ship (plane?) with him. The Board should kick him to the curb, although it may already be too late to save the airline's reputation. If you complain, they will offer you $150 on another flight that will just get canceled. New marketing strategy - ""Scrubwest Airlines - Wanna Get Cancelled?"""
Date of travel: September 2021,10,What happened to Southwest??,Two of my flights have been canceled less than 12 hours before my trips within the last two months!! This time I’m missing a family members wedding. This is unacceptable.  Called last night to see what was going on and waited on hold for 4 hours only to be told “sorry”. If you enjoy actually being able make it to your destination then I recommend staying away from Southwest Airlines.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Used to love Southwest, now I'm never flying again.","In the last month, ALL of my Southwest flights have either been cancelled last minute or delayed. I used to love Southwest because it was so reliable and consistent. Now, I do not trust whether or not my flight will even leave. I don't think I will fly Southwest ever again for anything important (like the past two times that have been for weddings I was in). I really don't think I will ever fly Southwest again in general, because of how untrustworthy the airline has been the past few months."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Will NOT refund a fully refundable vacation package and airfare,"I purchased Business Select Refundable Airfare and A fully refundable Vacation package with ""cancel for any reason"" insurance.  The airline still has NOT refunded my airfare or vacation package worth over $3,000.I would stay away from booking with SOUTHWEST AIRLINES at all costs.  They do not care about their customers and choose to NOT refund their fully refundable tickets and vacations packages.  I feel scammed and will find further ways to inform the public of the horrible customer service"
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Amazing airline,I dont have a negative thing to say love not paying checked bag fees and early burd for not rushing to check in. Boarding was simple. My daughter left her phone on plane and they took a week or so but mailed it to us. Overall a great experience
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Three times,Three different flights to Buffalo from Baltimore three different family members three different days within the same week and a half and the flight all three times getd delayed. South West I'm done with you. Get it together. You and your delays are a discrace. Upgrade your gear. Your delays cause delays for not only you but everyone else as well. One time is fine but three different people different days but same flight time? Hmmm
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Flight,We flight southwest every time we go somewhere but on this flight 798 coming from Cozumel was different than before flight attendants were rude and both of females from the 3 the guy was quite didn’t even say or do anything the others 2 were so loud and so dry and sharp when saying anything on the page which amazed me Because I know since I flew several times before something was off the other one taking care of the people she was I guess annoyed than she didn’t want to hear or interact with no one hope this was a one time experience because I really enjoyed flying   in This airline.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Unconscionable and Irresponsible!,"During these times the airline industry, like many others is experiencing labor shortages, burned out employees, cutbacks, and delays. If you are a reasonable person who travels by air, you can't be surprised when things aren't going smoothly. However, my experience with this flight was absolutely horrible.  The flight was continually being delayed which yes, I understand.  Boarding finally took place at approximately 3:20 as the plane was scheduled to ultimately take off around 3:44. Boarding had been completed. It was a very FULL flight. Apparently, the ground crew was still trying to get the bags loaded on the plane so further delays ensued.  We sat until approximately 4:30 in a closed plane with little to no air circulation and again I emphasize a CHOCK FULL FLIGHT.  All this as a PANDEMIC is still happening !!!!! Why air cannot be pumped into the plane in these circumstances is a concern! If that is not possible, there should be at least some type of plan B for circumstances like this while the country is still experiencing pandemic like conditions. It was IRRESPONSIBLE, UNCONSCIONABLE AND HORRIBLE!  Southwest should be compensating every single person on that flight.  Often, the captain will stand at the exit as passengers disembark.  There was no captain or pilot to be seen because if there had been, he/she would have heard about  my dissatisfaction and concern! As of now, I am not sure I will be choosing Southwest as my airline of choice."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Miserable,"Absolutely awful experience, during flight I had a slight impairment in my breathing and dropped my mask down to the mouth region. They then kept harassing me into picking up my mask even though I repeatedly told them I had difficulty breathing with the mask on during the flight, not initially, initially I was just fine. They could not sympathize for even a second, an absolutely disgusting business and everyone involved in it, including the employees. Wake up everyone, do you not really see what is happening, I will never attend Southwest Airlines in the foreseeable future!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Rude,"Poor service rude employees, worst airline I've flown on by far will avoid traveling with southwest moving forward"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Crazy experience.,"Worst experience ever while flying  My wife and I were supposed to fly to Denver then LA. We were rerouted to a Dallas then El Paso. No big deal. During flight our masks came down to the end of our nose mine once hers once and we were told to keep our mask up over the bridge of our nose    When we landed in El Paso. Apparently the 2 stewardess that asked us to keep our mask up went and got one of their superiors. This was the craziest experience of our life. The lady came on the plane and went crazy on us. Threatening us with “throwing us off the plane” making a huge scene, tryin to get us to argue with her, which neither of us would do.  This went on for about 3 minutes. Her basically arguing with herself. Then she gets us another mask Bc I explained that my mask may have come down to the end of my nose Bc it was cloth.  She went crazy again. Said put this mask on  I replied ok. “Is this good”. She said “do you want to argue with me?”  100% trying to bait me into an argument   “I’ll throw you off this plane she explained.”  Unreal. Southwest this is how you treat passengers? Never seen anyone over 8 years old act like this.  We were embarrassed for her.  Never again Southwest."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Changed or canceled three of my flights in the last 45 days!,Today my flight to New York through Baltimore was canceled at 2:48 pm for a 6pm flight. This is the third time in 45 days.  Each time I was rebooked for another day and arriving to my destination at least 24 hours later. Southwest has really gone downhill. They also removed the canceled flight from the flight status when you look it up. Based on the fact that they canceled 3 hours before my flight leaving me no time to rebook with another airline.  At this time I would not fly Southwest.  Also waited on hold for over an hour for customer service to file a complaint.
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Why do people like this airline?,"Southwest gets lots of positive reviews, but I really don't understand why.  If you're not checking luggage, they cost roughly the same as any other airline, and the experience was definitely worse.The only reasonable connection Southwest offered between San Francisco and Minneapolis had me first stop in Burbank (remaining on the plane) and the changing planes in Phoenix.  So I flew three segments on this trip, and none of them was enjoyable.  The experience at the airports was even worse than on the planes.I absolutely despise Southwest's bizarre boarding procedure.  I paid extra for ""early bird check-in"", which gave me a boarding number on their ""A"" list.  Even so, I had to wait a LONG time amid chaotic crowds at the airport and then race like the running of the bulls to board the plane.  Even with that, on one of my flights I still had to stow my bag in another row.  That's because even though I chose a row that was empty when I boarded, the overhead bins in that row were already filled.Both of the planes I flew on were old and filthy.  I know from the layover in Burbank that Southwest doesn't clean the planes at all when they stop.  They didn't even spray or wipe down surfaces.  All the flight attendants did was check to make sure the safety cards were still in the seat pockets.  This is probably because Southwest tries to turn their planes in a shorter time than other airlines do.  When it's 45 minutes or less between touchdown and take-off, there's not much cleaning that can be done.On all three legs the only service was a tiny package of snack mix and a tiny cup of a non-alcoholic beverage.  The flight attendants came across as rude and indifferent, as if they were doing us a big favor to be handing out that tiny treat.  They said there was wi-fi available, but it didn't seem to work on any of the flights.There were lots of children on all my flights, and many of them misbehaved badly.   (One little girl spent the entire flight kicking my seat.)   Neither their parents nor the flight attendants corrected them in any way.  When I landed in Phoenix I found that my onward flight to Minneapolis had been delayed.  No Southwest employee ever gave a reason for this delay, and they acted annoyed that I had even inquired.  We ended up 3 1/2 hours late, which got us into MSP around 3am.  There were absolutely no apologies given--not by the gate staff, not by the pilots, and not by the flight attendants.  Honestly, they were some of the least pleasant airline employees I've ever dealt with--definitely not who you want when there's a delay.I e-mailed Southwest after this experience.  Their response still had no apology whatsoever and no explanation for the delay.  They did, however ""as a gesture of good faith"" give me a small credit for future travel.  I'll likely never use it, because I really can't imagine flying Southwest again."

Date of travel: August 2021,10,100% seat capacity--No Social Distancing,My husband and I booked a vocation to and from Jamaica with Southwest Airlines from BWI months in advance. There was no social distancing at air terminal and definitely not at Southwest Airlines terminal. The plane was full to capacity with no regard for social distancing throughout the flight. I had to ask a passenger to please wear his mask properly on his face. There were times when passengers talked freely with masked off and one particular passenger allowed his mask to fall below his nose while coughing and sneezing. It was awful. We also boarded flight 905 and experienced no social distancing on it or at the terminals as well both at BWI and in Jamaica. I don't want to take a flight anywhere if this is what is the now norm. Horrible.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Minor with disability,"My children were flying alone and my youngest has a broken foot. I set up wheelchair service so she didn’t have to crutch all the way through the airport. When we arrived at BWI they helped me get an escort pass and set my daughter up with a wheelchair. The flight attendant at the gate was rude and seemed irritated when my daughter started crying because she was scared to fly without me. Finally I got her calmed down and they got her on the plane. The flight ended up being delayed and they ended up sitting there for about 50minutes before they departed. I confirmed that a wheelchair would be available for her upon her arrival and customer service stated that they would meet her on they jetway and take them down to baggage claim to be picked up by my family. When they arrived at Chicago O’Hare airport, no one met my daughter with the wheelchair. My older daughter tried to find out what was going on and was completely ignored and dismissed. So my daughter ended up having to crotch all the way down to baggage claim for no reason When she could’ve easily just met my family on the departure level. So needless to say my daughter was in serious pain due to the excessive walking. Very disappointed in Southwest."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Great Ticket Agent in Cabo San Lucas,"I want to let you know about a wonderful experience we had with Southwest's Ticket Agent in Cabo San Lucas.  Her name is Alejanda Malta.  On Sunday, August 22nd we got to the Cabo Airport and got a text that our American flight had been cancelled due to mechanical problems.  American's only alternative was to take a flight two days later which did not work for us.  We learned that SW had a flight within 30 minutes so we hurried to the SW counter.  Alejanda to care of us immediately and we were able to get on a SW flight back to Phoenix.  Alejanda was amazing as she took care of us in no time what so ever.  She was very professional, cordial and showed complete interest in taking care of us.  She totally made our experience absolutely perfect.  Never once was there an issue while rebooking our flights.  I wish I could have Alejanda at the airport counter every time I needed to work with someone.  She was amazing!Alejandra, we thank you for your assistance.  You made what could have been a very disastrous situation for us easy, swift and stress free.  You are truly a professional in what you do.  Southwest is lucky to have you."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Friendly but VERY unhelpful,"I recently booked a flight for my family to travel to Houston for my grandmother’s funeral.  Unfortunately we were impacted by Covid and unable to travel.  I received airline credits but was denied a refund.  Three family members will most likely not use the credits given they are attached to specific individuals vs an account.  In addition, the Early Bird specials ($15 ea) that were paid for were completely forfeited for the four of us impacted by Covid.  Someone at Southwest will surely enjoy the $60 bonus.After the “credits” are redeemed if at all, no one in my family will ever travel via Southwest Airlines again.  I appreciate friendly but not a satisfactory solution."

Date of travel: August 2021,10,No-Show policy needs to be amended,Be ware of SWA’s no-show policy!  My connecting flight on a different airline was delayed due to bad weather on the East cost. I was unavailable to contact SW to cancel per their policy because I was literally still in the air.  When I contacted them after landing I was on the phone 90+ minutes only to be told to contact another department on Monday. After paying for a new booking to complete my travel and  sending the documentation that was supposed to result in either a refund or credit from the initial flight SWA denied my request. They did send me a nice-nasty email informing me of their decision and thanking me for my continued patronage…
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst Airlines,"I have had bad experiences before with South West with delays and lazy service, but this one takes the cake. Started it with a delayed flight that led to having a lay over that was 2 hours, then when we arrived in Phoenix for the layover they delayed an additional 2.5 hours. With an almost 5 hour delay, 2 kids under 2 1/2. They had no resons or explanations. With each boarding they do not allow families or those with disabilities on first they are 3rd section to board after premium boarders and section A.Their staff is kinda rude and stern all the time as if people are going to attack them. On our flight back to Salt Lake they delayed our plane for an hour, no explanation. Once we boarded they said there was some ""weight distribution"" issues so they had to reorganize the luggage and supposedly that didn't work so they had to move people to the front and middle of the plane. The whole situation seemed sketchy and really scary because I have never ever seen that before on any flights ever. To top off the whole flight experience we had checked in our double side by side jogging stroller at the gate when we picked it up once we landed, one of the wheels was completely mangled and the axel bent. Keep in mind this stroller is not light and is made really durably. They had to have literally just chucked the thing and threw something on top of it. With this in mind they said that ""they are not responsible for any damages"" we literally had to carry our kids with a broken stroller all the way to the otherwise of the airport (that isn't small) with no accommodations or assistance.  Their service is unacceptable and unaccommodating. Their customers are not first in any way. If you families don't take them. It's not worth the price."

How about trying to do at least the minimum of what your ask....we were also told that when a staff has their weekly hours in if the flight gets delayed they just go home.....passengers receive nothing....unless you ask and demand they want to pacify you with a 50 dollar voucher......whoopdee doooo...

The return PIT-DEN has been canceled and once again I was put on a flight that stops in Nashville and gets me home 4 hours late.  Honestly, I’m sick of playing Southwest’s game.  I canceled my flight home on Southwest and bought a non stop ticket on another carrier because Southwest is very unreliable right now…..I read in the news they’re having staffing issues with all the flight cancellations and flight changes.  Beware if flying on Southwest right now."

Either way , large corporate entities, such as Southwest Airlines clearly have....hopefully that government bailout helped your employees at least. Once again the customer always deals with the loss and the corporations grow wealthier. I had no choice last holiday season and wasn't allowed to travel to see my family. I had to cancel the flight and tried not too, but travel bans in the northeast prevented me from going. Additionally, no vaccines were readily available and I would put my family at risk. So with the flexibility that all the airlines were shouting in the streets I presumed I had a year to figure it out. Not so with Southwest (I am sure other airlines suck too). I went to go use the funds and was informed that they expire before I am able to travel and it was a year from when they were purchased. The best part is you have to travel before that expiration date, not purchased.  Of course the modern method to saving money is 'get them as early as possible' so kind of useless unless you travel all the time. They also informed me that any  Covid-19 policies had expired last September???? The heart of the pandemic, when numbers were starting to climb back up?? We all had to sacrifice and suffer loss this last year and five months, yet it seems that corporate America is stronger than ever. I will find a way to use these funds and not give Southwest another dime to contribute to their millions, rather than let them pocket $100 of it (penalty for expiration) and use the rest on their currently overpriced tickets. I was always a loud advocator for this airline, and throughout the years went out of my way to use them. No longer, as there are many other choices. One day consumers will hopefully figure out that we have all the control, but most likely not. Thanks for nothing Southwest, here is hoping y'all go bankrupt!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Cancelled Flight, No Communication, took 3 days to get ahold of customer support","I am hoping to get someone's attention at Soutwest today...this week maybe?😲 Would be nice. Been trying to speak with a 'Customer Care' rep since Friday 13th. I have called multiple times. Today I have been on hold for 2 hours and 41 minutes. I was told to stay on hold as Friday I learned that when you can't keep up with the phone lines you turn them off...even though Customer Care service is suppose to be open M-F 9AM to 5PM Central time? I understand we are all struggling right now but come on. I have had a flight booked for months and when I show up to the airport AFTER checking in correctly 22 hours prior...I find the flight has been cancelled? Only after the baggage attendant takes my bags, throws them on the line, and the are gone! Then, I look at the printed ticket and it has me leaving 18 hours later? And arriving in a different city? No email. No phone Call. No text. nothing. I have sent an email, Facebook message, and called. I will continue to reach out. After all I spent $600+ on this flight. You're not doing us a favor, you are providing a service that we adequately paid for."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Terrible experience, never again","Booked a flight from SLC to LAS wanting to try Southwest since they support USA as an all Boeing fleet. Booked the flight based on flying on a 737 Max. Friday morning, day of the flight the plane was switched to a 737-800, first strike. The plane left Baltimore 1 hour, 45 minutes late, second strike. Reviewing the route history, seems it's a chronic, late route which apparently nothing has been done to correct that. Plane showed up and we start to board (pre-board) and  a few groups obviously needed the extra time. Then multiple groups of people (2-4 person groups) started pre-boarding, mostly adults and looked perfectly healthy. Seems they learned to work the system. Boarded in group A36 to A40 and no shock, the first several rows were filled. After picking my aisle seat, and waiting in the plane with no A/C, the right engine needed help starting at the gate (huffer). Add another 15 minutes to the already late flight, perfect. The attendants absolutely didn't care and were standing up front chatting with the gate agent before the door was closed and everyone was seated, unprofessional. Engines starting and 10 minutes into the flight, an announcement, NO drink or snack service... Arrived in Las Vegas 2+ hours late... First time on Southwest and it's my last time. Southwest is better than Sprit, Frontier and Allegiant ( extremely low bar) but I'm sticking with the big 3 from now on... Great job Southwest, you should be proud..."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst am most accommodating airlines,Worst trip i have ever had The entire staff does not care and this airline does not care about the customer
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst customer service ever!!!!!!!!!!,"Flights switched multiple times, had to fly to different cities to get home. No explanation. No apology. Will never fly again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never again,Kicked us off the plane for no reason. They called different crew not even they knew.Worst trip I’ve ever been on. Next flight is on Monday do NOT go here ever horrible.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"I will never travel with Southwest Airlines again, low prices or not.","I want to start off this review by stating that I plan to NEVER travel with southwest again, ever. My boyfriend and I had travel arrangements to go to Jamaica. First, our originally scheduled 5:35AM flight was delayed over an hour. The customer service agent at the gate desk told all passengers waiting to board, that the flight would be delayed from 5:35AM to 7:35AM. Mind you, this flight was scheduled to take roughly an hour and a half. We had a connecting flight at 9:05AM!! (Barely making it)… When asked what would happen if we were to miss our connecting flight because of the delay, the agent could not provide a straight answer; complete lack of consideration for any and all passengers. About 45 mins later, the same agent announced that the flight was now going to be leaving at 6:40AM instead of an hour later. Okay, that’s better but what about those that could have left the gate in anticipation of a later departure? Again, complete lack of consideration for any passengers and their time or plans. Fast forward to the end of our vacation and to be expected, the flight was delayed. Just like the previous flight, passengers were given a delayed time and it was once again changed without notice. Lastly, our connecting flight and final flight home was also delayed. Southwest failed to provide their passengers with suitable notice of delays and or the opportunity to change flights if needed. The lack of communication and professionalism is uncanny and I would highly recommend against this airline, discounted prices or not."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Me & my 9 year old daughter were kicked off the plane for no reason!,"I will never, ever fly with Southwest Airlines again! My child was using the restroom in the front of the plane and I was told ""you need to get out of here"", when I asked where would you like me to stand Hannah said I don't care but you need to get out of here and said she felt threatened because I got too close. They kicked us off the plane at 8pm at night, I will be getting my money back!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Southwest Airlines Flight #4982 - 8/11/21,"For years my airline of choice has been Southwest Airlines.  I was so happy when they started service to the Hawaiian islands.  With no first class or meals, I was uncertain how such a long flight would be; however, as they’ve done for the past 50 years, Southwest delivers the same high level consistent service we’ve all come to expect.  Regardless of the craziness covid has brought to air travel, the crew was nothing short of perfect.  I have no ties to Southwest Airlines other than my brand loyalty to a company that understands that  their employees are their competitive advantage.  There was no “harshness” towards the passengers they had to remind how to properly wear their masks, rather just polite conversation to make sure everybody was in compliance.  The new 737 - Max 8 felt roomy and bright.  The cabin was very quiet and comfortable. They did serve a larger snack that did help tie us over until reaching our destination. Southwest is not a “budget” airlines, to me they are a no frills airline that gives you everything necessary to get from point “A” to point “B” (including free checked bags) safely, comfortably and  at a reasonable price point. Their staff is always friendly, courteous and often times funny.The entertainment system is good, easy to use with a good selection.  While other airlines have focused on fee income, Southwest Airlines has clearly focused on their employees and remaining true to their mission statement and  business model.  Bravo Southwest Airlines - great job!!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,40,Mr,Price wise and service wise it’s great. Baggage limit is excellent. When we have long flight then minimum expectations are usb charger and good refreshments. They providing refreshments but those are like direct to dust bin. If they providing anyway so should have provided good refreshments like nuts/good snacks etc. Hope they improve in future.
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Filthy Planes,"I recently flew business select even though this site only allows me to choose economy before posting. I spent over $1400 on a flight from Oakland California to Manchester New Hampshire and back. The planes were filthy. There is no way they cleaned them between service. As soon as passengers disembarked, they would allow new passengers to board the plane within 10 minutes. There was litter on the floor and in the seat pockets in front of me and the floors were filthy.  In these times of the Covid pandemic they should be even more vigilant about cleaning between flights but that is certainly not the case. I have flown Southwest for years and I am a rapid rewards member. They are not requiring their employees to be vaccinated. I won’t fly with them again."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Jennifer and Kathy Saved our trip,"After an 11 hour delay for our travel with allegiant air, We hurried to a ticket counter in the southwest wing of the airport and much to counteract our dismay from out delay. Jennifer and Kathy were able to help us figure out a solution. Our travel for a birthday vacation for my friend was only for a 3 day and 3 night trip. An 11 hour delay was really inconvenient for a short get away. We booked on an early morning flight in worries of a total cancellation. We were put on stand by for a flight in 2 hours from changing our plans. We were able to be accommodated on the 4:00 flight Instead of waiting until 11 pm. Landing in Tampa at 630pm instead of 1 am gave us an extra evening of vacation o enjoy. Highly suggest. my friend and I have already rebooked a spirit flight at the end of the month to southwest airlines instead."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Flawless experience!,"This was my third round trip on Southwest. Efficient service and customer service. Some people don’t like the open seating but it is the fastest way to get the plane boarded and on the way. I paid a little extra for the early bird check-in and was assigned position 27. I sat in an aisle seat on the second row. Perfect experience. I wish they still flew the Jacksonville-Fort Lauderdale-San José, Costa Rica route. One can hope."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Unreasonable Delay,"Our flight was scheduled  to depart at 9:35pm. Plane arrived 9:40 pm. They screwed around with the plane for 15 minutes then they told us they needed a new plane. Now we leave at midnight. Totally unacceptable. Disappointing. Exhausted. Way to go SW, you put all these commercials out with people smiling, all happy and pleasing. Then you stick it to us. You guys say we have a choice when we fly? That’s right. My next choice will be with another airline."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,HORRIBLE SERVICE,"The man next to me asked if there was an outlet to charge his phone and the flight attendant said,” come on! You didn’t come prepared??”The lady next to me asked for coffee The flight attendant looks at her and says,” well, how do you want it?!?! You need to tell me if you want cream or sugar!” As he wave his hands at her like she was incompetent.They also DO NOT pre-board active duty military. They are the Only airline in the U.S. that doesn’t I’ll NEVER fly southwest again nor will I recommend them"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Unnecessary Money being disbursed,I don't understand how a passenger can purchase a ticket weeks prior to the flight just to have someone else purchase the same ticket on the same flight for less days after I did. I was told by the airline that each ticket can be rewarded a voucher towards their next flight. I paid for all four tickets on one credit card. The other passengers don't fly much. I would of much rather had my money back on the credit card. I have Unnecessary monies tied up with Southwest policies rather than on the rental car I need when I get to my destination.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Been delayed/cancelled/rerouted for 12 hours,"I do not typically write reviews, but I feel the need to write one today. We are going on our honeymoon vacation. Baltimore to San Francisco. Should be easy, right? No. First flight had a maintenance issue with the walkway and lost 8 bags of the previous flight. So they had to find those and divert the plane to a different gate. Got there, boarded, and after all said and done, gave us a 1 1/2 hour delay. Missed our connecting flight. As an “I’m sorry” we got free alcohol coupons for next time we fly. (We don’t drink and they aren’t even providing it anyways right now, so it’s useless). Had a long layover given we missed our flight probably at one of the most boring airports I have ever been in. Board the next flight, no air conditioning. Maintenance was supposed to come fix it, never did, I don’t know. But sat on that plane for another 1 1/2 hours. The flight was literally 48 minutes to the next airport. The time we sat on the hot plane we could have gotten to the next airport and not miss our connecting flight. No one on the plane was complaining about the heat because I’m sure everyone was tired of this. Well, while they were trying to figure that out, a huge storm came in and delayed us even further and we were asked to get off the plane. Delayed by another hour waiting for it to pass. Booked a different flight leaving an hour later. That’s fine. It is what it is because I understand they can’t fly in bad weather. But wait, it gets better, we board the next plane sit on it for ANOTHER 1/2 hours. Had to take it out of commission due to a dent. I am no joke writing this review as I am deboarding the ONCE AGAIN and walking to to COMPLETE different end of the airport. Thank you southwest, We have now been at this airport for 9 hours. Missed our connecting flight at the airport, lost out in our $200 hotel room, and lost our rental car. Shoot, who even knows where our checked bags are at this point. I would give zero stars if it were possible."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst Airline ever!,"Southwest has every excuse for not getting a plane out on time.  We were delayed an hour and a half and then they said there was a crack in the cargo bay after we boarded the plane.   Engineer never showed up to even check it out. Delay, delay, delay.   I will never fly them again.  My daughter was flying home today too and her flight was delayed four hours.  They boarded a plane that had no AC.  Their connecting flight in Chicago was delayed two days so they were going to be stuck there.  Now they have a flight to New York and they will have to Uber to Connecticut in the middle of the night.  What a mess."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Lost my bags and do not care,"Southwest lost my bags in Denver. So far nothing their customer service has told me is true about when I would receive my bag.  Also, open seating on a plane is ridiculous! This was my last flight on Southwest."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible — No AC and took so long to depart,The plane didn't have an AC working. Southwest should not offer flights. Horrible experience. Dont fly with Southwest
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrendous!,"I will NEVER fly Southwest again! We’ve flown Southwest before and were always satisfied with the service and flights. Today, that changed. On the way to the airport this morning, we were notified that our flight from Orlando to Pittsburgh was cancelled. It is a Saturday and there are no other flights available until Monday, with the exception of one very long layover flight. I originally booked and paid for a non-stop flight as we are traveling with two babies. The earliest option with availability is a non-stop flight to Baltimore tomorrow morning. I called to attempt to get on this flight and was told it’s either pay an additional $183 to change to the Baltimore flight, or wait to fly to Pittsburgh on Monday.  Are you kidding me? So now I’m stuck paying an additional $183 flight change fee, $145 for a hotel room in Orlando for tonight (which I would have had to pay for even if we took the Pittsburgh flight with the long layover), and $209 for a rental car to drive from BWI to PIT to pick up our vehicle. They offered NOTHING but a too bad, so sad. APPALLING! I understand we are not the only ones to be going through this situation at the moment, but offer your passengers some sort of assistance, be it waiving the change fee or credit to a hotel.  Even an apology for the inconvenience would have been appreciated. So here we sit at a hotel in Orlando for the night. Out an additional $500+. And that doesn’t count the additional baby items that I now need to track down and purchase as we had perfectly planned our needs due to baggage. Also the additional cost of lunch and dinner today. This airline is not accommodating whatsoever. BOOK WITH CAUTION!!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst customer service related to flight cancellations..spent 2.5hrs in the phone to get agent and they hung up,"My wife’s flight got Canceled in a last min. Gate agent used dirty tactics that she needs to rebook her within 2 hrs or she was going to forfeit the funds. Rebooks her on on August 9th from MSP but keeps Denver to MSP as is for August 8th. When i realized this i called SW client service. After 2 hrs finally get an agent who cannot really help. When asked for refund, she states it will take 30days. If they cannot provide promised service, or get an alternate flight in a timely manner, why do they get to hold funds for 30 days! Worst customer service and agent should not use dirty tactics! Also when asked for supervisor they out me on hold for another 30 mins and they hung up!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"If I could rate Southwest Airlines a zero, I would.","Over the past year and half, my husband and I have flown many times on Southwest, and prior to the Covid pandemic, Southwest was always our airline of choice for domestic flights. The pandemic changed things, quite understandably, and we have had patience in what we know has been a difficult situation. However, the past several flights we have completed with Southwest have definitely taken turns for the worst in terms of customer service, with flights being rescheduled without notification to us, re-routing us to flights that are not non-stop (when our originally booked flights were nonstop), returning us to our home town in the middle of the night (when our originally-purchased itinerary arrived late afternoon), losing our luggage, (all of which have actually happened to us in the last 12 months).  But this is finally the last straw.  We will not be flying Southwest again. In June, my mother passed away. The memorial service is scheduled to take place on August 8th.  In July, as soon as the memorial service dates were confirmed, we booked our flights back to Portland from Colorado for the memorial service. Twenty-four hours before our flight time, we checked in, as is the usual routine with Southwest. We were assigned seats. Some hours later, we received the usual emails with reminders for timeliness of arrival to the airport for our flight, mask requirements, etc. There was no indication that anything was amiss with our flight. Now, less than 8 hours prior to our flight departure time, we checked our flight status to give my family final updates for our arrival time only to find that Southwest has canceled our flight.  All other Southwest flights from Denver to Portland within the next 24 hours are listed by Southwest as ""Unavailable.""We called the ""Contact Us"" number for Southwest Airlines to try to figure out what we could do to rectify the situation.  After sitting on hold for literally 2 hours (with what became an increasingly annoying message about how sorry Southwest was for the delay and that they would be ""right with us, as soon as possible""), we finally gave up and hung up.  While sitting on hold, we found and booked a flight on a different airline, at last minute prices with luggage fees, etc.This behavior by Southwest Airlines is profoundly unprofessional and completely unacceptable.  It breaches the contract Southwest Airlines entered into with us, as its passengers, of a service they were to provide (transportation from Colorado to Oregon), paid for in advance, with the express understanding that the service would, in fact, be provided.  At the very least, timely notice of the inability to provide the service should have been provided, along with an explanation as to why the service was canceled at the last minute with literally no notice to us of the cancellation.  No offer of restitution or alternative transportation has been made, and Southwest has refused to provide any sort of customer service (although I'm sure that no one could be paid enough to have to deal with customers treated in such a fashion by their employer).After going on line and reading recent Washington Post (among others) articles, we now see that Southwest has been doing this to its customers for the past several months. They certainly won't be doing it for very much longer, because they will be out of business soon. You cannot treat your customers like this and expect to continue to have any. In a customer-service oriented business such as the passenger airlines are, the death knell for Southwest Airlines is surely tolling."
Date of travel: August 2021,40,Good service,"Good service overall, but covid precautions are over! You have to wear your mask but the plane is jammed packed and even boarding is chaotic as all 60 people in each group now line up together. I was disappointed, but what can you do when you have to still fly :("
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible,"Terrible. Late takeoff after delay, landed and another plane was sitting where we should have pulled in to de-plane. At this point, over an hour late. Just drive wherever you need to go at this point because Southwest doesn’t have their sh** together."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Southwest Has Gone Down the Drain,"(Note: the worst part is near the end of the review.) Pre-pandemic I was always flying Southwest with my family. I loved the free bags and no extra fees. I always had great customer service too. I used to recommend Southwest to everyone. Well let me tell you, no more! Their service, quality, and customer care has gone down the drain! I finally got to visit my family this summer after a year and a half of not seeing most of them due to the pandemic. Myself and my three boys traveled to our destination via American Airlines. Had no issues there - great service and a nice plane! On the way back, however, I traveled via Southwest. Unbeknownst to me they had changed my nonstop flight to a flight with one stop in Orlando. I found this out when checking on my flight a few days before. Now in their defense, I searched my email and they had notified me of this change back in the beginning of May via an email that I am fairly certain ended up in my promotions folder instead of my inbox or else I would have seen it. The thing that urked me is that they made this change the day after I bought my 3 nonstop tickets. The day after their sale ended, they decided to get rid of a bunch of nonstop flights. How convenient for them... Not so much all of us who booked with them because we wanted a nonstop flight. I was hoping they had one this week that I could change it to, but nope. Checked their website - none. Now mind you, I was traveling alone with three boys. My oldest is 6 and the other two are both under the age of 2 (a 21 month old and a 6 month old). If you are a parent, you understand how difficult this could be. I waited on hold for almost 2 hours just for them to tell me they could refund my tickets, but if I used flight credit it would stay as flight credit (not helpful as they have no nonstop flights on this route anymore). They said they ""temporarily"" got rid of nonstop flights from their schedule. I looked at my options for the week and either the layovers were way too short to make it to the other plane for us or they were long and required even more flight time. Needless to say, I had to keep my flight. By then other airlines were too expensive and Southwest said they could not book us on another airline. I was told this before I even asked so you know a bunch of people must have asked this. I haven't gotten to the worst part yet.. We had a fine first flight to Orlando. A little over two hours. They kept changing the time but ended up boarding on time after all. We made it to Orlando and our stroller was already waiting for us when we got off the plane. Kudos to Orlando people. Flying to Dallas was a different story. We were sitting in the plane an hour before we took off. This was due to the weather, so that, I understand. This was another 2 and a half hour flight as well. My poor kids were doing fairly well despite traveling all day. (Remember, two of them are a young toddler and a baby.) Near the end of the flight while we had been traveling for over 11 hours already one of the flight attendants remarks about the mess we had made (my toddler spilled some chip crumbs on the floor) and said that we would have to clean it up, but she said it in a passive aggressive way and asked if we needed a trash bag. While I told her ""okay"" I don't think she heard me because she said, ""I will get you a trash bag,"" like it was a mission of hers. She never ended up bringing the trash bag. Now mind you, I have a baby on my lap that is still learning how to sit up well on his own and a young toddler that I am trying to keep entertained so he stays in his seat and my 6 yr old is napping. But she expects me to bend down in the tiny space where our legs go while holding a baby to pick up crumbs. Really? When my 6 year old woke up I made sure he helped me and we quickly threw away all of our trash including stuff on the floor as the attendants went by quickly with the trash bags. (Side rant: Why do they always go by so fast even when they see you still trying to gather trash?) Needless to say, we left some chip crumbs on the floor and some fell in between the seats (which already were dirty with other people's crumbs so I wasn't reaching in there). When we got off of the plane I was waiting with the boys for my stroller with the baby attached to me in a wrap. There was one other family with their daughter waiting too by the time I got my stroller. As I am unfolding my double stroller with the baby attached to me and making sure my toddler doesn't run off, the flight attendant who never brought me the trash bag comes off of the plane and said that I left a huge mess and it was rude of me because they have nothing to clean it up with and as I was saying, ""You never brought me a trash bag,"" (which was the only reponse my flabbergasted mind could come up with), she just kept walking and ignored me. WOW.. The mom in the other family waiting for a stroller was like, ""Really?!"" She couldn't believe how rude that flight attendant was to me while she sees me struggling to juggle my kids and our stuff and stroller while traveling all day by myself (my husband had to stay in TX and work). I am generally a nice person okay, and if she had brought me a trash bag like she said she was, even though she was rude, I would have had my 6 yr old son help me clean up the floor hoping I didn't squish the baby while bending over in that small space with him and doing her job for her. Is it my fault Southwest makes flight attendants clean the plane? Isn't that part of your job? Is it my fault they don't give you guys hand vacuums? So besides the super rude, unsympathetic flight attendant who must have never been a mother, and Southwest getting rid of all of their nonstop flights from Philly to Dallas (and who knows where else), Southwest does not do the amount of COVID cleaning they claim they do. Both planes were dirty and the first one I was on had dirty tray tables that I made sure and wiped off and sanitized for all of us. Southwest is skimping on their cleaning procedures because they are turning over planes at such a quick rate. They just care about the all-mighty dollar. They don't seem to care about their customers anymore. It is a real shame. Southwest, I used to love you, I used to always fly you, but now I must say goodbye. Try to do better, please."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,How Rude!,"So I don’t fly very often and airports give me a lot of anxiety. This was also my young minor daughter’s first time flying alone so I was especially nervous that something would go wrong. In my worried state, I had trouble figuring out how to properly attach the sticker to her bag so I headed to the bag drop off with the sticker in hand where I thought I’d get some simple direction. Instead I was met with a talk to the hand attitude. I said I wasn’t sure I was putting it on right, and the lady at the counter told me to basically step aside, read the directions and figure it out on your own before she would take my bag. My anxiety went through the roof at that point!  I cannot believe how rude their customer service agent was over a simple task that would’ve taken her just a few extra seconds to assist me with."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never knew there was an airline worst than Spirit!!,"Our round trip DIRECT FLIGHTS were changed to have a layover in Milwaukee on the way to Vegas (interrupted our trip time) and a 2 hour layover on the way home in Dallas. I was already upset because direct flights cost significantly more than if you fly with stops SO to change my direct flight to a flight with stops without giving me some of my money back was upsetting. It felt like they were stealing from me. Although they ""offered"" a new flight they knew there were non available. We were unable to find another direct flight. On the return flight, we got to Dallas at 7 pm and prepared to change planes for our 9:50 flight. Got to the gate and was told that our flight time was changed AGAIN and take off was now 11:44. We got in line to board at 11:20 only to be asked to sit BACK down because we are waiting for a co pilot to show up who won't be here until 12:34 AM! WE have been in airports all damn day and it's all because of Southwest. THEN the employees get on the intercom saying the most random and disrespectful things to the passengers. Gate attendants words: "" you will be landing in Atlanta at 2:39am. I can't do anything about the time so don't be mad at me"". In WHAT professional world is this okay?! Please help me understand why I paid Delta prices for a Spirit Airline experience?! We won't be getting home until after 5 am and we all had work/school in the morning. Southwest can go to hell and I mean every word."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Im good on Southwest,"I flew southwest 6 months pregnant with my husband, 11 year old son, and 2 year old daughter returning home to Orlando from Portland Oregon after coming from my mother passing away on 7/30/21. Our flight was scheduled to leave Portland at 2:00pm which was only delayed 30 minutes (no big deal). The lay over was in Denver we get off the plane with 30 minutes to spare before our connecting flight was suppose to take off to find out our flight had been canceled and was not leaving until 6:00am the next morning. We are then  told to go wait in the customer service line for 45 minutes to get told we can’t have a partial refund, hotels would not be accommodated, and the flight in the morning would be taking us to Indianapolis then Orlando instead of our original flight which was straight from Denver to Orlando. The customer service representative cut me off and stated that they only had 4 spots on this plane so I needed to tell her if I wanted to be on the plane or not. They told us the flights were canceled due to weather but there was no bad weather in Denver or Orlando. My family and I went to the 3rd floor sat in seats and walked my 2 year old around in the stroller until she fell asleep for exactly 1 hour, no one else slept at all. We were able to leave at 5:30am with a flight going straight to Orlando, I got sick from lack of sleep literally the morning of before we got on the plane, my daughter, husband and son are all sick now but thankfully we made it home the next day by 12:00pm. I think it’s highly unprofessional to drastically change someone’s flight to the next day when they land and then try and make them pay for a hotel. I think had I not been pregnant and had my 2 year old with me, and returning home from a family death it wouldn’t have been as bad but I have no idea what happened to customer service. I will never fly through Denver again ( I know better) and I will never fly southwest again (3rd strike for me)."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible flight,"The whole flight was horrible from no AC to the take off and landing. I canceled more than 24 hours for out return flight and it said I'm eligible for a refund since I'm canceling more than 24 hours from the return flight. Just got off the phone with the customer service for the airline and they said I'm not able to get a refund only a future date with an expiration date of a year from the canceled date, but why would I want to fly this crappy airline. Rough take off, rough landing, and no AC. EXTREMELY uncomfortable and horrible experience. Ruined flying. Thanks southwest airlines for showing me that you guys have the worst customer service and ruining flying for me. Greatly appreciate it. 🙄"
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Great experience!,"I have always flown Southwest in the past but was nervous to fly after reading recent reviews, but we had a great experience! All the ticket and gate agents and flight attendants were friendly. Both legs of our non stop flights were on time. Did not mind wearing the mask at all.  We did not buy early birds so checked in at the 24hour mark and received low B's both times. No complaints at all from us. Will definitely continue to fly Southwest. Looking forward to flying with them again in October!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,I will never recommend southwest - med condition,"I have a young teenager whom is dealing with hearing loss he is deaf. As such I have always used southwest to have him fly alone going to and from where I am working as I travel a lot for work. I have found on today he was told he could not be pre boarded regardless of his boarding list stating he is deaf and him being an A list PREFERRED CUSTOMER. This is utterly distasteful, I nor the child should have to explain his condition when the boarding pass clearly states this information. Furthermore, after explaining someone else had to intervene regarding these things I promise southwest this is the last time you will make the mistake of embarrassing a child due to medical conditions. Flight 927"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never AGAIN!!!!!!!,Canceled our flight! Booked us a flight automatically 2 days later!!! What!!!! Zero help to rebook to get us back home! Worst experience ever! We have flown for years with Southwest and are preferred members! Will never do it again! Crazy how airlines take taxpayer dollars then turn around and treat the very people who they took money from badly! Go elsewhere!!!!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Cancelled flights and delays and more delays,"Do yourself a favor and search airline on time percentage before you book. Wish I would have. I would like to meet these people that are so happy with southwest, because they aren't any of the thousands I've seen in the last three days stranded at airport after airport. What was supposed to be a 7 hour trip is now on it's third day and we are still sitting in an airport with another day to go. Our 9 day vacation is down to 5 minus a day of jetlag, make it 4. Unfortunately I have little faith getting back home will be different and will be missing work. It should be criminal we pay full price for a good flight, when I could have got the flight that had several spots for much less. And then get rebooked on a trip that is soaking three days.  It will be a long time before I am convinced to fly anywhere on any airline until I am confident I'm not just donating my hard earned money to the billionaires club."
Date of travel: August 2021,30,Girls trip,The flight itself was good but when coming back to Savannah we was in the plan for at least about 30 to 45 mins waiting to get off. Pilot gets in the intercom and tell us he has no update because no one is answering to clear us to get off. First time flying with y’all and my last.
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Not nice  Flight attendants,"They feel entitled to criticize their customers during the flight. The first comment they say once you are sitting is “wear your mask, don’t act like a 2 year older “ .  “It is not that hard”They are under the impression that we are all feeling the same about it. They think it is a funny thing so they make jokes about the ones that feel otherwise.Very unpleasant judgement."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Business Select is NOT Worth the extra cost,"This website would only let me choose Economy--I flew Business Select. First the good points, check-in Indianapolis was quick and easy, but perhaps that's because I arrived at the airport 2 hours early. The other positive was how quickly the bags appeared on the carousel at my destination--usually the  wait at Bradley is LONG. But, the flight had been delayed arriving after midnight, so I guess the baggage handlers were as ready as the rest of us to go homeNow for the not so good:1. At check-in as a Business Select customer, I was given a ""ticket"" for a free beer, wine or cocktail. Southwest is not serving alcohol even with these tickets. I had flown American first-class into Indianapolis, and ""yes"" I was able to get my Bloody Mary on American.2. This flight had 2 ""legs"".  On the first Indy to BWI, I was A7 and on BWI to Bradley, I was A1. I understand that those in wheelchairs and others with  disabilities are allowed to pre-board. Well, not only were these people pre-boarded, but so were apparently healthy college-age individuals and people with school-age children (though usually they board between the A & B groups).3. Once boarded, we sat at least 15 minutes before we were told that the plane was waiting for other passengers. Then, after they boarded, we had to wait for their bags to be loaded. Total wait time was at least 40 minutes. 4. On the initial ""leg"", there was soft-drink service. On the final leg, the flight attendant--not the captain--announced that due to ""expected"" turbulence there would be no drink service. Strange that this announcement didn't come from the cockpit.  Not only was there no drink service, there was no turbulence.I intend to inform SWA of these issues, and that unless absolutely necessary, I will never fly SWA again. Business Select was expensive and while I was at the head of the A Boarding Groups, so many people were allowed to pre-board, that I might as well have saved my money."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Flight canceled,When I went to check into my flight I saw out flight was canceled without any reason. There are no customer service agents available to speak with. To rebook on the app comes with a price tag. Best to fly with a more reliable airline.
Date of travel: July 2021,20,1/4 flights cancelled over the last two years,"Flight cancelled again for no reason with zero notification. I have flown over 40 flights in the last two years on frontier and southwest. Southwest cancels about 1/4 of the time and only occasionally gives any notice. I have even had southwest flights cancelled for weather, walked over to the frontier counter, bought a ticket, and landed on time at my destination. Southwest will only be a backup airline for me moving forward. Unreliable."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Good airline - but what happened to carry on size restrictions?,"I don't mind  Southwest Airlines, they are typically on time, and I do not mind the seating experience. I do have 2 problems: The airlines need to put a restriction on the size of carry ons. People are bringing HUGE rolling luggage, whatever happened to size restrictions?  It slows down deplaning. The other problem is this:  people are taking advantage of the disability/wheelchair loading. There will be 10 people wheeled up to the gate - the attendant then leaves. When it's time to board, these people will WALK ON THE PLANE WITH NO ASSISTANCE leaving the truly disabled - those who NEED ASSISTANCE - waiting for someone to help them. This happened to my mother, who is 92. She truly needs assistance walking down the ramp - and by the time she was helped onto the plane, the first FOUR ROWS were taken by able passengers. Yes, they may have had diabetes, or asthma, or heart issues.  But someone who needs help WALKING down the ramp ought to be allowed on the plane first.   OR....the entire family who was with the person in the wheelchair gets on the plane - all of  them , my mother witnessed 4 people get on the plane with the person who was wheeled up to the gate, yet the wheelchair person gets up and walks ably to the plane - and they take up space that the person who cannot walk that far could have had. Really irritates me, and this is not only Southwest's fault, but society's fault for being pigs."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,MAN,Horrible what they do to customers. Cancelled flight with no real explanation. Other carriers were making all their flights to Denver last night. Rude customer service. No heart. My friend was going to visit her grandchild and was really looking forward to the trip. All they offered was a seat the following night with no hotel room voucher.  Fly with anyone else.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Treat your trip as Tentative  - Southwest does,Cancelled flight after original boarding time - no explanation.  Customer service lacking.  There was no heart.  Logo needs to change!
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service,"My family and I bought Southwest tickets to fly to Mexico in December for my 50th birthday.  Prior to flying my father contracted COVID and was also diagnosed with dementia.  The hotels also put COVID restrictions into place.  We called Southwest and cancelled our flights to which we were given ""Travel Funds"". Fast forward we are taking the family and going on a vacation in December, this year.  We tried to book the flights using our travel funds and were told we can not due to them expiring in October.  We called customer service and explained the situation and were rudely told we have to wait until they expire and then pay a $100/per ticket fee to reinstate them.  We understand paying the fee and requested to pay it now to extend the date.  We explained we can not wait until October to book the flights as flights are limited and are already nearly sold out.  The customer service rep had zero compassion and stated there was nothing she could do that that was the policy.  We asked to speak to a supervisor and were told only contact with them was through email.  The email response we received only had a first name and stated there was absolutely nothing that could be done to try and resolve the problem.  We called customer service again and once again explained the situation.  We again said we would gladly pay the fee now and book the flights.  The rep sternly responded that they are not able or willing to do anything to assist.  That we would have to take our chances and wait until after October (IF they decide to take the fee and extend the funds!) or just loose all the money.  They stated they gave 2 year extensions for travel plans changed due to covid, she then sarcastically stated that we did not fall in that time frame.COVID is out of our control, along with the medical problems of my father.  We are not asking for a refund of the money or even asking to have a fee waived to extend the funds.  I simply want to book a flight flying the same month I was going to previously!  No compassion and no attempt at finding a solution!!!  I will not fly Southwest again."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,"Don't believe the slogan ""We run on Southwest Heart!""","Our daughter was supposed to get married last year but Covid strung us along so we had to cancel flights we had booked. The wedding is finally happening this Fall and when I went to use our flight credits (travel funds) I found they were expiring in a few days. After literally hours on hold I was informed that while the date booked met their Covid extended deadline, the cancel flight date was outside of it by a month so they would not do anything for us. The best they would do is extend for 6 months if I paid $100 per ticket. So much for heart..."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Airline changes flights again and again and...,"Our flights were already changed two times in a week after booked. First they moved the outbound flight 2 hours later which is very inconvenient since we have to drive 5 hours upon arrival. Then they changed the return flight from nonstop to one stop. departing earlier, arriving later, same price! Given they already changed flights two times in a week, what are our chances to have anything resembling our initial itinerary in the mid of October when our trip is scheduled for. And of course you can not cancel it! Only rebook for other non-nonstop flights at even more inconvenient times."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible - flight change that causes to cancel our vacation,Southwest just changed our flight - without notice.  Causes us to miss our connecting flight and we had to cancel our vacation.They now suck along with the other airlines
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Changing flight debacle,"Had to change a flight a week or 2 prior to an agent. I had to split my flights and change the departure date and returning flight for one of the passenger. The agent only split the flight and changed the returning flight but not the departure flight. I had no idea that the departure flight didn’t get changed until the last minute when I was trying check-in for the flight. I called southwest to resolved the situation but they can’t change my flight unless I pay a fee of 800 dollars, which would have been much cheaper had they did my request correctly a week or 2 prior. I’m highly disappointed and I have been flying southwest for the past 7 years."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Business Class,"Moved my trip two weeks ahead because of a storm moving up the coast.  Myself and my husband traveling. Since changing our plans, the trip was cheaper.  They gave us $288 in credit - non refundable.  So I upgraded to business class by using the credit and paying an add'l $53.00.  ($341 in total extra).  When getting on the plane, looking for our seats, I see the family with business class who's numbers were directly in front of ours sit in different seats.  When I asked him why was he sitting there, he replied, you can sit anywhere.  So, paying $341 extra was a waste of money, there was no curtain separating  business class and economy and they gave us a drink coupon for alcohol which they are not serving.  So, my advice is, do not pay for business class, it's a rip off.  Leaving on a Friday, returning on a Sunday, the cost was over $1,000 for two people.  I'd say that's price gouging. PS, they gave us .25 cents of chex mix and 4 oz of soda or coffee.  What a rip!  Seats were exactly like everyone else - hard, no extra room and no plush cushion. No USB, No monitor for movies. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible overall experience,"The planes are cramped, much smaller than alaska for example. Flight attendants are rude, do not give you all of the information and do the bare minimum. They act like they’re herding cattle rather than doing customer service.  Delayed flights on the first leg of the trip. When we arrived to the tarmac we sat on the plane for 45 mins (still sitting and waiting so who knows how much longer we will be here) waiting for a gate when there were easily 4 without a plane at them within my view from the window. The flight attendants then told the cabin “we are cleared to move to the gate please be seated with seatbelts on.” The plane moved all of 10 feet then we stopped and waited another 15 minutes with no communication from staff. The flight attendants were not helpful in this case.We finally  into the gate we were originally planning to go into, so the original plan to find one was bogus. I ran to the next gate and barely made it. When I boarded the next plane, i asked the flight attendant if the flight was full, she said yes. I am now seated on the second flight and the plane is definitely NOT full (photo below of middle seats empty) We also just heard an announcement that the pilot is still on another flight, not yet landed and doesn’t know he’s going to seattle (the current plane Im sitting on). So I ran here, parched and didn’t get a beverage, to sit and wait for the pilot to land and come to this plane 😳The flight attendants lie to customers rather than being honest and communicating with us. This airline treats its guests disrespectfully, things are not well organized and I won’t fly with them again. Southwest has let flight attendant standards go far too low. Not a respectable airline like alaska or United."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,BWI has very racist employees with southwest,"Absolute worst experience ever with employees. I will never fly with southwest again. Me and my 10 year old son were treated absolutely horrible. I hate to say this but the way they kept on looking at us up and down and making snarky remarks towards my son and I and others because what, we and others are white and they black is crazy. This world has to stop with the racist crap. All evening we watched how different classes of people were treated because of what skin color, it was disgusting. My 10 year old could even see it. It was that obvious."
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Southwest is the best,Thank you Southwest for having a direct flight from Columbus to Cancun! Flight left at 1050am and we landed just before 1pm local time. Please keep this flight on the schedule!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,From Best to Worst,"Back in the day, Southwest was the best airline to fly domestically in the states. I do not know what happened. This last trip has been the worst flight experience I have ever encountered. To start my trip, I booked my flights with a longer, 2 hour layover to ensure a slight delay would not hinder my travel. This still was not the case. Southwest changed the gate and plane in Norfolk, resulting in a delay. Next, we boarded and waited for over an hour to just get gas in the plane. Meanwhile, planes scheduled after mine were boarding and taking off, in the original gate my flight was supposed to be. Almost 2 hours later, we took off. I knew I was cutting my layover short at that point, but we were scheduled to arrive with just enough time to spare. I sprinted to my gate, to see my next flight's plane sitting there. The ramp to get on was still connected to the airplane, but no one was there to check me in. I frantically looked around for someone to help me, but no one was in the area. I had to watch my plane leave without me. I then got a text stating they had rescheduled me to the next day in the evening. I went and talked to a Southwest representative, who helpes change my flight to earlier in the day, but would not offer any other flights to the surrounding airports in LA for the evening. I requested they compensate and put me in a hotel, as I now had to stay overnight. I was informed that they would NOT put me in a hotel because they were not responsible for me missing my flight. They blamed the flight control in Norfolk, instead of taking responsibility for being very unorganized, resulting in 9 people missing their flight (to Ontario; there were many more traveling to other places). I talked to another representative to see if I could get a better boarding position, as I had the boarding position B1 prior to them sending my plane off. They had given me C13, which is considerably worse. They would still not compensate me at all. I have been unable to talk to a customer service representative, but if this is how Southwest treats thwir customers now, I will not be back. I did my research during the extra time I had of sitting in the airport overnight, and apparently Southwest has the highest delayed flights percentage. Two years ago, this was unheard of. Their motto of ""flying the friendly skies"" does not uphold. Its a real shame how far this flight company has fallen."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"0 customer service, read the fine print","These airlines would rather let someone with covid get on the plane rather than give peoples money back. Save yourself a headache, money, and the possibility of getting covid on the plane and book with an airlines that are understanding of health problems and changed situations. Not greedy like SW. also, same as the lady wrote up there, the credit can only be reassigned to the same person. Which is BS. Lol"
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Be sure to read the fine print if you think your credits are good,"When we canceled our flight, we were told we could use the credits for another flight although we wouldn't ge a refund. We were find with that. We had planned a trip with our 2 grandchildren. But when we went back to book another flight, they said our grandchildren had to fly to get the credits. Why? We paid for it, they didn't. We aren't planning on taking them on this new trip. So be sure you know that the credits are specific to a particular person, regardless of who pays for the flight. This is deceptive."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Holy cow! What the heck happened to Southwest?,"Holy cow! I used to love flying SW and have been flying with them since the 80s. It is now time for me to start using other airlines.  Between cancelled flights, late flights (and they've adopted the American Airlines bad habit about lying about why flights are late), and their now outrageous prices, it was a nightmare. All the planes I boarded were dirty and you would think that with the pandemic, they would clean these planes...ugh! They did not enforce the mask rules at the terminals and the counter ladies in Orlando are rude. I have always HATED talking to the counter ladies in Orlando, yesterday they were meaner. I happen to love my job, but these people who hate their jobs need to move on. The ONLY saving grace about SW is the flight attendants. They are always the best. So...goodbye SW, it was good while it lasted. Stop blaming Covid on your poor performance and behavior...it's been a year and a half and if you haven't figured out how to do things better by now, shame on you."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,3 Cancelled Flights!!!!! Horrific Nightmare Abomination,"1st cancellation was as we were pulling in to long term parking. Computer malfunction paid for hotel in las vegas that night empty. Southwest couldnt get us out for 2 days so we flew Delta($225 room, $800 Flight) The thursday of our departure flight delayed 1 hr then 2hrs, then boarded, then sat on plane for 2 hours then deboarded. then would of missed connecting in Denver baggage went though. ($250 room, $50 in Taxi, $150 in clothes to change into toothbrushes etc) Next morning 1st thing flight cancelled no available flights to get us to hartford again!!!!(friday night las vegas rooms sold out almost everywhere $659)NEVER EVER FLYING SOUTHWEST AGAIN!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Basic &Unfriendly,If you want to go anywhere on a budget and want no perks whatsoever this is the place for you if you want to be yelled at for not putting your mask over your nose this is the place for you besides awful service and rudeness of some but not all of the flight attendants this airlines would rank the very lowest on my list on my recent trip flights were delayed flight attendant was demanding people put on their mask not asking but demanding they were so screwed up all they would offer people was a cup of water and that's it on that flight no music no Wi-Fi no movies nothing at all so please don't fly with children because they will be totally bored unless you bring your own things to do I paid over $600 for a flight from Phoenix to Las Vegas round trip for myself and a child on economy way overpriced for that short of a trip for less than an hour in the sky I think next time I'll go back to United airlines
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Will Never Recommend Southwest To Anyone,"If I could give Southwest a negative rating, I would. My flight from Detroit to Nashville was delayed three times, causing me to miss my connecting flight. I then had to spend the entire night at the Nashville airport waiting on my 7:45 AM flight out of Nashville, that was also delayed three times, and FINALLY left at 9:20 AM. And to top it off, they lost one of my suitcases.  This was the worst flight I have ever had, and will NEVER fly with Southwest again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,The Worst!,"I wish I could give a big fat zero. This is the WORST airline ever! They dented my bag on the way to Florida and then on the way back- my back got dropped off in St Louis and then it was returned to me ripped the next day.  Someone wrote a CA on it- though it was not done when I checked my bag because my bag was in perfect condition. The lady who I finally got my bag from tried to say it was conditionally accepted, though thank God I had proof with a picture that it was not ripped when my bag was checked. So she tried to deny that it was on them and then decided to slap me in the face with a credit to fly with them again. Why on earth would I ever fly with a lying POS airline ever again! And now I have the headache of trying to deal with corporate. Do NOT EVER fly with this company, unless you like damaged bags and someone lying to you to save their own ass."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Traveler,"Southwest does not live up to their reputation. I'll explain the aircraft took over 30 minutes delay due to a maintenance issue in Las Vegas, the chain reaction started a storm blow in and we waited another half hour on the tarmac. Had we left on time no problem would have been gone. But in the game of counting delays and not paying people for the problems. They blame it on weather, the FAA doesn't count weather delays. So now since we missed our connection they gave me a discount on a room. Oh we couldn't get into the gate because they had other late flights. Bled on WEATHER of course. But overheard gate agent talking about how Southwest paid agents, pilots. Ramp workers all to stay home due to covid. So flights are canceled.  When arriving in Houston for connection we sat for 20 minutes again blaming weather. But 6 gates cleared while we waited for the special gate we were going to. So no chance to make our connection Next time check Spirit,or Alliegent way cheaper even when paying for bags. Also the others fly into smaller airports which may be closer to where you are going. Not stuck changing planes in a dilapidated airport that no one else Flys into so you are at the mercy of the merciless. Just my opinion while being jerked around.Buyer be ware"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,BEWARE TRAVELERS!!!,"Had a few things stolen from my checked luggage on Southwest in Las Vegas Mc Carren.  DO NOT , i repeat Do NOT check in valuable things or clothes that are new!!! They are a bunch of thiefs. Whether its southwest staff or tsa, they cannot be trusted. You have been warned! From a very angry and upset traveler."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Nice flight,Our flight went well. Everything from booking through baggage pickup went better than we thought given the covid issues all airlines are facing.One of our flight attendants was a bit flustered trying to handle the beverage orders and seemed often to not hear the passenger requests. He was pleasant at all times though.We have not flown Southwest since 2012. We'll be back.
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Southwest just does it well,"Southwest just does it well. Everything about this flight was above average. We have not flown in nearly 2 years due to covid and taking into account what hassles could be in place due to masks etc, this crew from check in through bag pick up in Boston was on their game.A short flight yes, but everything was in place by Southwest to help us get through with little difficulty at all.Thank you!"
Date of travel: July 2021,50,My Favorite Airline!,"Southwest Airlines is my preferred airline.  I have been taking Southwest since they first arrived in Chicago.  Now, that's a long time.  I fly out through MDW.  So, between Midway and McCarran airports, Southwest tends to have many planes at both airports. Hence, no biggie when a plane change is needed.  They usually have back up planes. Southwest is no frills and a very good airline.  Online booking, self-tagging, updates... everything is electronic and very  nice."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Southwest is the BEST,"I have flown Southwest DOZENS of times and will do so again.  They have cheap flights, NO baggage fees and FRIENDLY attendants at ALL STAGES of the process- from check in to landing.  Southwest automatically gives you MORE legroom so you are not crammed in.  They let you take TWO bags free and pick your own seats when you get on the plane.  They are almost always on time.  I have flown from LA to Vegas, Sacramento and Seattle on Southwest.   I wish they flew to New York.  I would never fly another airline again if Southwest went to more destinations!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,On my bad list now,"I use to love southwest until now. I will not fly them ever again. The last two times I have flied with them I have gotten terrible flight attendants. Rude, terrible customer service, and just down right mean. I use to be a flight attendant and I would never act the way these people act. You lost a long time flyer. Get your stuff together southwest."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Cancelled flight and wants to CHARGE more for rebooking.,"Southwest cancelled our flight at the last minute and couldn’t get us on another flight until the next afternoon.  This caused us to loose several hundred dollars in non refundable lodging because it was last minute.  For our original flight we checked in when we were supposed to and had good seat assignments which was key because we are traveling with our 13 year old daughter.  New seat assignments on rebooked flight are at the end on an overbooked flight so no chance we’ll sit together.  When I asked Paige at the BNA ticket counter if she would comp a seat assignment upgrade because of the considerable inconvenience and expense this issue has caused, she refused with the worst comment in customer service “I’m just following the rules.”  BUT offered to SELL us an upgrade.  So #southwest wants to charge me to rectify a problem THEY caused."
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Amazing Crew,"Flight 4619 July 21 /2021The 3 stewardesses and the captain were very helpful , patient and kind .. I lost my earbud in the flight and after every one left they helped me for 45 min looking under every seat with me to find it and they never rushed me off the plane , though it was midnight and they were tired . I am so thankful to them and to their customer service.. I hope this review reaches the corporate office for their amazing  attitude and customer service. Wish all airlines have a crew like them ."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Highly Disappointed,I’ve been on a Southwest Airlines flight 5 times (to include a layover) for business within the last 2 months and all have been delayed but maybe one. My flight today (#3925) from DEN to PHL was delayed. We finally get to Philly and we have been waiting for baggage claim for 40 mins. Highly disappointed and do not recommend.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Bad Customer Service,"I had a bad experience with a Southwest Airlines employee last week by the name of Terence in Houston. As I approached him with my two children with a question about boarding his answer was rude, he raised his voice and told me I should of taking care of the issue at the help desk before boarding. As I told him I did not know he replied well I am telling you now. With a loud tone of voice. As I was walking back I heard him raise his voice to a couple as well. Very bad customer service!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Bait and Switch,"This is the second time I booked way in advance for best pricing and direct flight.  I got a notice this morning they again switched me to a different flight,  not direct and at a time that will not work with my travel plans.!   Now too late to get better pricing with different airline. Also they give credit with them rather than refunding my money.  No longer using Southwest as I cannot rely on them to stick with schedule."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Flying to Seattle,Terrible experience from boarding to being lectured on plane cheap flights cheapest  service will explore other options
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Bait and switch,"Southwest is offers great deals and great prices.  Then they cancel the flights and put you on terrible flights or worse.  I have been a loyal Southwest traveler for may years but the past 6 months they have become terrible.  I still think the staff are great but the policies have changes.  I will be searching for alternate airlines from now on.  Sorry Southwest, your quest for the buck has lowered you to a bottom tier carrier in my book... sad :-("
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Handled the weather delays the best way possible,"We left Albuquerque nearly on time. As we approached Las Vegas, we were diverted to Ontario, California due to thunderstorms in Las Vegas. The whole time I was kept informed via text of our connecting flight from Las Vegas to Columbus. We spent about 30 minutes in Ontario refueling then on to Las Vegas. Continued delays in Las Vegas but we were kept informed the whole way. Arrived in Columbus 4 hours after our planned arrival. Luggage was there quickly. Everyone on the plane stayed calm. I love Southwest."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Never Flying again this is a garbage airline,"Apparently they’ve been doing this a lot lately from what I’ve read from others. They must be having serious problems managing an airline which, the last time I checked, was their only job. They cancelled our 6am direct flight from NYC to Chicago while we were already at the airport and just through security 1.5 hours before takeoff. There was no explanation and they just rebooked us for a 3:30pm flight that connected through Atlanta. We arrived at 9pm instead of 8:30am like we were supposed to. We were forced to completely waste a day off ubering back and forth from LaGuardia. And then there was nobody to talk to at the gate for another hour. They refused to give any type of monetary refund for the flight so we could attempt to take a more competent airline and never gave a reason as to why we couldn’t get on the plane that was sitting at the gate. This is a terribly run airline and I will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst travel experience ever/Southwest Airlines,"My daughter bought me a birthday vacation last year that was canceled due to COVID-19, we rebooked after we were vaccinated and felt safe to fly. I wish I could say the flights were great, and the flights themselves were ok, but Southwest employees were extremely unfriendly and one was completely unhinged and almost didn’t let us go. It was in Baltimore and he was a man of color who thought I disrespected him, I did not. I was talking to my daughter, who is biracial, he over heard and thought I was speaking to him, and would not let us board. I was hysterical crying and finally a supervisor allowed us to board. However my daughter had paid extra to board in the first group (A) but we ended up being the last 2 on the flight and didn’t even get to sit together. He nearly ruined our vacation. It but a strain on everything. I pray Karma will set it right. I am a former travel agent and a previous airline employee, not Southwest, I know when I was working his behavior would not have been acceptable. We are both traumatized now from his behavior. It made every flight stressful. I realize there are unruly people flying right now, but we are both respectful. I understand racial tension is high as well, but every employee of color that I came into contact with was either rude or barely civil. If they treat others as I was treated I understand why some people act out. I am Not well and this will probably be my last trip, it was supposed to be a wonderful memory for my daughter after I am gone, now this memory will always have a cloud over it, because of the one ticket attendant who nearly destroyed our trip."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Crappy trip thanks to Southwest,"Flew from Albuquerque to Dallas to connect to a flight to Baltimore and when we landed in Dallas we sat on the tarmac for 40 minutes. We informed the stewardess that we needed to make our connecting flight to which she replied, “we’ll get you there”. After finally being let off the plane we walk, along with several other passengers from our flight, to our connecting flight. After arriving at the counter we were told that our flight had already departed, and pretty much, to bad so sad.  Several of us are now stranded without our luggage and Southwest reuses to take any responsibility what so ever. They were well aware that we were delayed on the tarmac and I believe it was because the flight to Baltimore was overbooked.  They used to be such a great airline, will the jig is up,"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN,"I sure as heck will not recommend this airline to anyone! We will never fly with Southwest AGAIN!! While we were on route to the airport we were notified that our flight was changed. When we got to the ticket booth,we were told we were on a later flight. 3 hours later and rerouted to Baltimore instead of Nashville. When we got to Baltimore we were told our flight was delayed again, and its going to take off at midnight and we had to wait. Then an hour later we were told that the flight was cancelled and we had to wait until the next day at 7:20 pm and there was nothing they could do. What a bunch of crap!! According to Southwest the air traffic controllers cancelled the flights not the airline. They say this so they don't have to put up passengers in hotel rooms. I called a friend and asked him about this and he told me, Southwest does this because they have a upgrade program,and if people upgrade to the A seats by paying more then they bump you to a later flight. Some of us have to plan our trips according to the money we have and don't have extra cash for extra hotel rooms or extra meals. NEVER AGAIN SOUTHWEST!!!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Change to your upcoming trip!,"SW change the departing time of  direct flight from 10:20 am to 3:40 pm. We need to be in Denver by 4:00 pm. I discuss the issue with customer service, but to no avail. I was told my options are to take a 6:00 am flight with connections or cancel my flight. Terrible customer service."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Southwests punishes us for their delays!!!,"First off they delay our flight which in turn makes us miss our connecting flight. Which that isn’t even the main issue. We are told we have to recheck our bags for the new flight they assigned us because now we have to stay over night in the Denver airport because there are no more flights going out until morning. So we go get our bags from the terminal to then have to go back to the counter to recheck themback in and they tell us sorry you can only check your bags in 4 hours prior to departure. Well no one told us that when they told us we had to jump through all these hoops, so we leave our son back at the gate with all of our stuff because we didn’t want to have to take it all back through security AGAIN. Only to find out now we have to sit here for 3 hours with him by himself at the gate because they won’t let us check our bags in early. Their customer service and relations are HORRIBLE! How is it our fault that they delayed our flight and then won’t just forward our bag to the destination, then they won’t check them in early…..WORST FLYING EXPERIENCE EVER!!!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,old plane,"old plane, unprepared for urgent situation , not respecting traveler or themself.This is a recurrent and chronic problem with SW airline, and to proved look at the percentage of delayed flights on their schedule."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Favorite Airline,"Just came home from our trip and have to say Southwest is one of the best airlines.  Did early bird check in and will always do it for any future trip.  We were in the A group both flights and it was so nice to get on and be able to sit where we wanted and relax until take off.  Flight attendants were friendly, as were the boarding crew."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Disabled,I have not flown on a plane and over 10 years this was a disaster I told them that I needed a wheelchair half of the time it was not there man I told them that I had to go to urgent care while I was on my vacation and I didn't feel that I was well enough to take the plane so the lady on the phone tells me to go to the airport and   and told me it'd be $63 to stay over on a medical this is unacceptable. I wasn't offered any kind of snacks or anything because I was resting.I was supposed to arrive 11 that night I miss my connection the guy was slow in the wheelchair I'm stayed I was supposed to arrive apps 11 Saturday night I did not get to my destination until the next day on Sunday at 7:30 p.m. now I'm unpacking and I discovered that some of my stuff is missing I can't hold anybody responsible but the airlines
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Never fly southwest,"They lied to us a total of 3 times about why our flights were cancelled/delayed. Never giving them my business again. Went from a single flight to atl at 3:00 to a layover leaving Colorado at 5:00 that ended up leaving at 9:00 and made me miss my second flight. They lied their whole way to the end, was not until afterwards that we realized the reasons they gave us were complete lies."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,PATHETIC IS BEING POLITE!,"Buyer Beware! This airline is a joke! I had to buy a $225 shuttle to Denver after flight canceled..We are now delayed on our new flight by 2&1/2 hours! Literally almost every Southwest flight on Denver's boards are canceled or delayed. They offer no assistance whatsoever. They are using ""weather"" as the excuse to not aid anyone and for poor management. My parents flew American and are now home safe and sound. My family of 5 sits at the airport praying we get home today. PLEASE SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND DO NOT FLY SOUTHWEST!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE,"Horrible experience!!! Bumped from a $500 flight from NY to Charlotte, NC after sitting on the tarmac for 2 hours. Rebooked flight for the following day at an airport  an hour away from my home. The rebooked flight took 6 hours as I had to stop for a layover before continuing on the Charlotte. The kicker? They LOST MY LUGGAGE along the way. So, now I’ve lost a day of vacation and have no change of clothes to boot.  Heed my advice, book with a different airline. I certainly will."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,A 1 hour flight turned out to be a 5 hour nightmare.,"Lately Southwest has been delaying and/or cancelling thousands of flights; so, mine was not an exception. Let's forget about the not usable WiFi on board and no outlets to charge the phone.The flight left Orlando, FL 30 min late, and had only been partially cleaned (there was trash in the seat pocket in front of me). The Captain announced that the weather in Atlanta was fine; then, 70 mi south of the airport he started a holding pattern, without notifying the passengers. After 10 min of holding, he said that there was a cell near the airport (most passengers do not know what a cell is, so he should have explained better). After two more holding patterns, he started the approach and said that the bad weather had moved away and that we were cleared for approach and landing. The approach was not a peasant one. The pilot was turning left and right, supposedly trying to align the airplane with the runway. Weather was clear! Over the field and at less than 100 ft from ground, full power was applied  for a go around. After several minutes of silence from the cockpit and in a climb, we were told that we were proceeding to the alternate airport, Nashville. Nothing to worry, the pilot said, "" we'll be there in 45 min refuel and fly back to Atlanta"". Once in Nashville, the pilot came out on the cockpit and said, he had to make a mandatory go around because wind shear was detected and we did not have enough fuel to try a second approach. Then he disappeared. We learned later that the pilots could not fly us back to ATL due to crew rest. We waited not 45 min, but 1.5 hours for new pilots and finally  departed and landed in ATL at 11:30 pm, instead of our schedule time of 7:30 pm. Several passengers missed their shuttle connection to get home and had to spend the night at the airport. Southwest personnel did not offer anything, not even an apology.I understand that wind-shear is a serious condition; but, I don't believe that this was the case. We were in the clear and the bad weather was far from the field. What I believe is that the pilots burned a lot of fuel in the 4-5 holding patterns, missed the first approach for whatever reason, and did not have enough fuel for another one without risking to end up in a emergency fuel situation. My opinion is based on many years of experience as a fighter pilot and airline pilot, and have landed at ATL hundreds of times in good and bad weather. One more thing, this was my first experience flying Southwest and, certainly, will be the last one."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Do not fly this Airline.  Not enough crew to work the flights!,Flight was canceled due to lack of crew.  Had to wait 2 days at my expense to catch the next available flight.  Time for Southwest to park it's planes.  Still no seat assignments and loads plane like a bunch of cattle in a cattle car.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Do NOT use southwest,"My family, 8 of us, attempted a vacation using Southwest Airlines.  Our flight going was changed 13 times.  We ended up arriving 30 hours after our scheduled time.  We were at the airport and they sent us home to come back the next day.  When writing them about this, they gave us a $25 voucher each.  What a slap in the face.  We had already paid for a hotel and two rental cars which was money wasted since we couldn’t get the money back for missing the days there that southwest made us miss.   Terrible customer service too.  Beware"
Date of travel: June 2021,30,Multiple flight time changes,"This was our first flight with Southwest in many years, and I am unlikely to try them again.  Our flight time was changed several weeks before our flight, but then on the morning of the flight, we had multiple schedule changes.  This is always understandable, although I have found it very rare on other airlines and usually, when there is a delay, it is changed once or twice.  With Southwest, we were notified that our 12:00 flight was delayed until 1:20, then 2:10, then around 10:20 in the morning we got a text that the flight was delayed until 3:15.  Since we live an hour away from the airport, we decided to wait it out at home.  Suddenly, after 11:00, we get a text that our flight has been moved AHEAD by more than two hours and was now scheduled to leave at 1:00 PM. This gave us less than 2 hours to get to the airport, park, check our bags and get through security, and we had to race to get there and almost missed it.  Once we were on board, we heard other passengers talking about it as well, and most were not happy with the time being moved ahead on such short notice.  I am sure some actually missed the flight.  I also do not care for Southwest's seating procedure. You are given a boarding number, but then it is kind of a free for all when choosing a seat.  People are holding seats, trying to get more room, and by the end of the line, some families and couples are split up.  I don't like this. I like having the chance to put my family together.  My one positive about Southwest is their baggage policy.  I love that and appreciate that they don't try to nickel/dime you for bags."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Used to be an airline, now it's a trainwreck","Wow, how far Southwest has fallen from being an airline that prioritized getting passengers from a to b while providing great customer service. Now they can't do either, and they gouge you every step of the way. The details of their awful service today, for myself and many of my fellow travellers, don't really matter at this point. It is possible, despite their staff, policies, and practices, that we may make it home tonight. But I'm not counting on it. Look for episode two shortly... Better to go with United or American... Never thought I'd be saying that!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible staff,Looks forward to telling people about mask policy and is rude.   Will lose business in long run as a result.   Power hungry crew and a 2 hour delay to boot.  Terrible.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,GARBAGE CONT.,I paid extra for a nonstop flight and 2 days before the flight changed and I had a layover on the way there and 2 layovers on the way back. When I brought this to their attention they WOULD NOT COMPENSATE FOR THE EXTRA MONEY I PAID. Only a full refund. Not even early check in or switch me to a sooner group since I did PAY EXTRA FOR A NONSTOP THAT I DID NOT RECEIVE. If I would have been made aware that they can change flights that you pay extra for then I would have paid the cheaper price for the normal flight that I actually received. THIS AIRLINE IS A SCAM AND ONLY CARE ABOUT MONEY. They also have very very limited drinks and snacks during the flight and that just makes it that much more NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE. -A still very angry and tired passenger.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,GARBAGE,Wish I could put ZERO STARS AND 0% CHANCE OF RECOMMENDING.Good luck if anything happens to your flight for weather conditions. They DO NOT COMP ROOMS. THEY DO NOT COMP FOOD. THEY WILL MAKE YOU SLEEP IN THE AIRPORT.I will absolutely never fly southwest again and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you do not either. They would compensate NOTHING. No blanket. No food. No snacks. NOTHING. Not even early boarding for the next flight that I was forced to rebook to the next morning. 🙃 I would pick American Airlines or Delta if I were you. The ONLY benefit is 2 free checked bags but at what price?? THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE HELP.Now I understand weather conditions... but there were only 9 of us who got the short end of the stick and they would do NOTHING FOR US. -A very angry and tired passenger.
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Don’t fly southwest,"I have always flown southwest for a long time and never had a problem but this time was totally different. I flew down to New Mexico to visit family and brought my kids with me which are 3 1/2 year old and 6 month old. The airline does not tell people traveling with kids that they do not serve juice anymore they only serve coke, Diet Coke, 7up, or water or Coffee I was very disappointed. plus southwest used to serve food on their long flights like the one I did from Chicago to Albuquerque- we’ll let me tell you not anymore they only serve peanuts. I had such a close connection in Chicago that I had no time to stop and get food for my 3 1/2 year old son. Plus at my connection it took a pilot and someone else to call down to the people who pull your luggage to find my stroller bag which almost made us miss our connection.  Plus this airline used to call ahead to connecting airports and tell the connecting flights to wait to for people - we’ll let me tell you they don’t do that anymore either so if you miss your connection they don’t care. So what I am trying to say is - Do Not Fly Southwest Airlines cause I know I won’t be anymore I’ll be taking direct flights from now on."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Two types of steward/stewardess,"On our flight from Denver to Phoenix, my adult daughter and I had a mature gentleman for a steward. He was either having a really bad day...or he is in the wrong business!  I accidentally spilled pop on my daughter's tray table and lap.  We hit the call button and when he came over I pointed to the puddle of pop and asked for napkins.   He brought 3...just 3.  We hit the call button again and a friendly younger woman came over with a stack of napkins explaining that when a person is standing like that it usually means a spill. We thanked her, cleaned up as much as we could before the gentleman came by to collect trash.  Now, he gave us napkins not 5 minutes earlier, he saw the cup with ice and napkins but he choose to totally ignore us and pass by our row looking to the other side of the plane!  That younger woman came a minute ot two later and took our trash.  I think the old guy would be better suited as a Walmart greeter!"
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Jacked Around,"We scheduled this flight to Spokane for a family gathering on July 4. I scheduled an early flight because we needed to go to Kalispell and wanted to be there for the party on the first night. However, SWA canceled the first flight for us and put un on one that got in  at 4 PM. With getting a car and driving that would put us in at 9 to 9:30 PM past the time of the party. I changed the flight to  one at 6 AM that got us in at 11 AM. On the 3rd I got boarding passes and we were set or though I thought. At midnight on July 4 SWA sent a text message saying the flight was cancelled and rebooked to the another flight that got me in at 4. I read the message at 3 but we had no options. We had a ride scheduled at 3:45 that we couldn't cancel so we were at the airport for 5 hours before we were on the plane. We were given boarding passes at the end of C section boarding and I explained what had happened but the gate agent wouldn't' move us into the A priority line without us paying money and there were spaces available for that. So we were the last to board. Luckily we found space for the carry one. This is the first time I have ever flown SWA and had this type of thing go on. I have flown SWA since the 80s and have always thought that this airline was better than the rest. Now I have a jaundiced eye and will think twice about using them for my travel."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,"Covid related cancellation, no refund","I had booked a reservation on SW Airlines, April 2020 to fly to and from Galveston TXThd reunion was cancelled due to Covid. I called SW A, to cancel. i was told the funds would be a credit that expires in 12 months, ( I didn't like the expiration date on something I paid for and was unable to use) I accepted that, I figured I'd use it in the next year. I am planning a trip to Chicago at the end of July 2021..I tried to use my confirmation number, and was rejected. I call SW customer service. I explained the situation. The rep explained to me that the 12 month cancellation was from 12 months of the pmt, not 12 months from the flight.I was offered a possible voucher that would be mailed out in  30 days and that SW would take half the voucher as an admin fee.. I told them that this wasn't acceptable. They reiterated to me that it was their policy at SWA to swallow funds with out any concern for the client. Those were not their words, however that was the message received.my intention is to place every review possible to warn others of these unethical practices.Dan OBryan"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,0 Stars.,Can not imagine a worse experience. Moved back a flight but wouldn’t tell the passengers early enough to change flights. Customer service was less than helpful to say the least. Then to run salt in the wound they wait for 30 minutes for passengers at 1 am. Will be traveling any other airlines for sure.
Date of travel: July 2021,50,"Always a good experience, start to finish.","We love Southwest.  They make it so easy for families, with family boarding first so they can sit together - on a recent flight when people moved to let a late-boarding family sit together, the captain came on to commend them!  On another leg of that same flight, security was delayed and we just got to the gate in time and were the last ones on the plane.  My partner and I started to sit in middle seats, and a kind attendant signaled us that there were still two seats together at the back.  Service is always positive and helpful, our flights have been smooth, we love the great rates and free bags - it's a slam dunk."

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst of all airlines.,"Horrible, South west airlines is extremely unorganized they are constantly messing up gates, and double booking flights. Constantly running late. I don’t care if you get free snacks they suck. They need to get there stuff together. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone. If I could give them a 0 I would."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible Airline,"If I could rate a 0, I would. Worst airline I’ve ever encountered. First flight was cancelled less than 8 hours prior to departure for no reason. They rebooked me on a flight over 24 hours later. When I called customer service, there was literally nothing they would do for me other than give me a travel voucher for that one leg of the flight that expired 2 months later, if I cancelled and rebooked on another airline for $1200! Then, on the return flight, they kicked the man next to me off the flight because his sleeping dog that was inside of a carrier under the seat, that he paid for and was an emotional support animal, was not zipped in the carrier. This was without warning and they did not give him an opportunity to zip the carrier. They rudely yelled at him and his tiny dog without any warning and forced him off the flight. Worst airline and customer service ever."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Rude, Possibly Discriminatory","The agent who sold me my ticket and issued a boarding pass did not mention anything about not being able to bring a carry-on in addition to the small dog in his bag. This was not a policy expressed prior to going through security etc. As a result, I had my important items in my carry-on and planned accordingly. This included medication and tech items.When I got to the gate, someone announced that folks who needed additional time to board the plane should go to the gate. I did so and immediately was told without a hint of politeness or consideration that I could not have a carry-on. If I did not check the bag ""I WOULD NOT BE LET ON PLANE."" It is stressful to be talked to like this and aggravating to shuffle belongings around at the last second at some jerk's whim. I would be more flexible if communication was improved.I believe that I was only singled out because I made the choice to notify staff I needed a few extra moments to board as it says in the highlighted section of the airline’s website. If I had not asked for an extra minute, it seems unlikely I would be ordered around like this.It's not ok to change policy at the last second and be so rude about it and then not expect any frustration in return. Being ordered around like a criminal in response to trying to have basic accommodations is not ok.I do not ""look disabled"" but suffer setbacks in panic and related issues, especially in the airport. A little consideration goes a long way. Even normal levels of human consideration for the customer would be leagues ahead of the experience I had with the airline. Will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Six hours late,"Flight was six hours late, no apology or recompense from airline. When I tried to rebook, they changed my boarding group to an inferior group.

I had a small drawstring bag with just my wallet and phone in it, and a carry on luggage. I put my laptop bag in my carry on, but took it out to answer emails while waiting for boarding. When it was time to board, the flight attendant was very rude Louise Chang- saying I can't board with 3 bags. Now I understand this, if I was carrying a big backpack and luggage, but my drawstring bag barely had anything in it. I had to open my luggage and put in my laptop, while she let other passengers go in front of us. Terrible experience."

Now the bad news, pilot now says he’s timed out on his flight time, mind you this was a scheduled 2.5 hour flight. Maybe we’ll find you a new pilot, but unsure when that will be. Meanwhile a full plane just sits here. Southwest Airlines needs to figure out what they’re doing."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,"Stranded in Bozeman, Montana by Southwest!","A recent trip out west to Bozeman, MT I used Southwest Airlines; both coming and going I had to connect in Denver. On the return I found at check-in that my flight was canceled due to weather in Denver. Automatically they rebooked my trip two days later with the same flights.   Instead of keeping my flight from Bozeman to Denver they canceled the whole trip to avoid me being stranded in Denver with them being require to-put me up in Denver as trip interruption. I was told by the SW representative at the counter Southwest would not compensate or provide me with longed as the trip was canceled at my starting point. The Bozeman airport is in Belgrade, MT a few miles west of Bozeman. There were no hotels around the airport; there was nothing around the airport. After finding there were no alternative flights out; another Southwest representative help me by booking me to Denver, on the same flight I was originally booked, then on the next day to St. Louise and another flight to Philadelphia. I was responsible for my hotel and meals as this was considered a rebooking and two different trips. I was able to book a room via Priceline for a room in Denver with airport service. The issue was Southwest avoided any cost by just canceling the whole trip. I was luckily to have the second representative, Joshua, to help me figure out how to get home, although it took me two days. Southwest did text the cancelation however I was in areas with no cell service. The counter representatives need better customer service training."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The  looser airline,The plane is very noisy. The flight attendant are very rude and when I asked for help to get there cheap wifi . She answered she didn't no how . This was my first time flying with this cheap airline and would be my last one. I flew this one because it was the only direct flight to Grand Rapids. I don't recommend any one to fly it very bad experience. Thanks

Date of travel: June 2021,50,Awesome!,This is the best airline ever! Here are the reasons why…#1: you get to pick your seats!#2: they give you complimentary drinks and snack packs!#3: clean and comfortable This is one of the best airline we’ve ever flied.
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Watch your luggage,"My husband and I took a short flight from Honolulu to Kona (45 min). Check in was quick, baggage drop was fast and painless, flight was on time to start, but took extra time to load all luggage, so we ended up being 20 min late. When we arrived at our destination, my husband's luggage was broken. He is unable to pull his handle up to pull it around. After getting to the hotel, we opened up the suitcase to find the handle rails bent and multiple pieces broken on the inside. I am a frequent flier with Southwest and this is the only time I have had an issue with their handling of luggage."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,More cancellations than flights,Tried to fly hone from DC to Spokane and we are on day 3 of not being able to get home.  Horrible customer service.  Stay away from SW
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Beware!!!!!,Without a doubt the worst customer service I’ve ever dealt with. They canceled my flight and when I explained I would just drive there but needed my luggage they were so rude and condescending. I explained my inhaler was in my bag and the customer service rep laughed and said that was dumb and my mistake. I explained my inhaler that was in my purse ran out and I was having breathing issues and she laughed and said I should have been better prepared. I’ll never fly with this company again. Without a doubt the most condescending customer service in the world. I’ve never wrote a bad review online but felt it was necessary. Please be aware they are fine unless something is canceled then they become rude and don’t care!!! I wish pay more to not be treated so badly in the future.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst customer service from an airline,"Southwest cancelled my mom's flight 2 hours before she was scheduled to depart on 4TH OF JULY WEEKEND. I had a hotel room booked in Breckenridge for $560 a night and being a holiday weekend she could not get another flight in time to use the reservation. Obviously, being the DAY BEFORE I was unable to cancel and get a refund. The customer service team refused to provide a reason for the cancellation and did absolutely nothing to resolve it. She ended up having to book with another airline to get in a full day later and costing her a lot of money. I've flown Southwest exclusively for over 6 years and this company will never receive another dollar from me after this."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Don’t fly southwest,"They no longer serve alcohol and are very rude about passengers asking to purchase it. They are super gay about wearing a mask and the flights are no longer enjoyable. Suck it, Southwest."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Watch Your Luggage,"The flight was standard, the got us there almost on time and no incidents on the flight. However after we landed I was very disappointed to see that my luggage had been destroyed in the flight. The entire seam on the top and side was shredded, there were cuts and tears all over the bag, and even the metal reinforcements were bent. There was some note written in sharpie clearly showing that someone saw the issue. I took my bag to the office and waited about 20 minutes for them to find a supervisor to take a look at my bag, just to have him tell me that the issue was due to the manufacturer? He said they don’t cover that issue because it was a design flaw causing it to tear at the seam. The manufacturer did cause the bag to get shredded in your machine. There were clearly rips all over the bag from processing, which he said is just part of flying and everyone’s bag gets them over time. It was the second time I had used the luggage! As for the broken METAL reinforcements on the side of my luggage, his only response was unfortunately we don’t cover this issue. What issue do you cover? I don’t think I’m asking for much in expecting to have my bag in one piece and not have the contents falling out because one whole side is Reilly’s open from top to bottom. I guess it was nice that he taped it shut so I could get to the parking lot without leaking the contents of the bag everywhere. I’m not pleased at all."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Disinterested Crew,"Thank goodness it was a short flight is about the best I can say for it. Well, and the plane was clean. But the crew failed to do even the bare minimum. They did not come collect the last of our trash before landing. They did not make the person in front of me set their seat upright upon landing. And they did not make the people sitting across the aisle wear headphones, so I was forced to listen to whatever they were watching. (Glad to say the very opposite was true on the flight back a few days later.)"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,VERY UNSATISFIED!!!I WON'T RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!,Our family is travelling booked for round trip flight to Chicago to Orlando with a child  our flight was orginally 12 pm but was change all of a sudden to 3 pm.Our seat assigned on our tickets but once we were on plane seats are all taken we have to ask if they will be kind enough to allow me to sit with my child.Fortunately there's one guy who let us take his seat for me to stay with my child.I dont understand why they have to change our seats when we already booked ahead and make sure we were all sitted where we want and thats always the case  on all airlines this is the first time ever!Inside the plane was dusty.I dont think they've been cleaning it.Also bag claiming numbers not mentioned on paper they give us so u have to look and find your luggage on all areas.Going back again time was delayed.VERY DISAPPOINTED suppose to be a Happy Vacation...😔
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Awful experience,"This airline is the worst I have ever flown with.  Left Orlando airport on Saturday, June 26.  I landed fine in Chicago to find out my connecting flight to Washington DC was cancelled.   I could not get my luggage because of lack of manpower.  I took an rubber to a hotel in Chicago because I couldn’t get any flight out of Chicago until Monday.  No vouchers were offered for a hotel.  I was booked on a flight for Monday which was also cancelled.  I finally got a flight out on Tuesday which was an hour and half late arriving at Washington Dulles.  I had to pay for 3 nights at a hotel in Chicago and for meals for 3 days out of pocket.  This experience cause a lot of stress for my family and me.  I will never use Southwest again and will tell others of my awful experience with your airline.  No other flights were cancelled at of Chicago Midway due to weather except Southwest.  I had to stay on the telephone for 80 minutes waiting to talk with someone from customer service.  The person I spoke for was very accommodating but there wasn’t anything she could do to help me get a flight out."
Date of travel: June 2021,50,You get 5 stars for overall history with me. Issues with Long Beach airport though,"I love you guys. I'm A-List Preferred and Companion Pass. I purchased a round trip ticket to MDW from LGB- Business Select. Both ends of the flight were cancelled. I understand that- stuff happens.However, I found out when I was at LGB and was automatically re-booked. I could've gone to O'Hare on this trip. Would've been nice to speak to someone, but I was facing a 99+ minute wait even on my dedicated line. I understand that as well as this was a system wide phenomena and not just with SWA.However, LGB has no line for Business Select or A-List. I had to wait in line to get served with everyone else with luggage. When I returned, I went back into the terminal to be sure what I saw was correct. Alas, it was. However, SWA did have kiosks which I could've used. Unfortunately they were not out in the general area but stacked against all of the other counters. The sign simply said ""Kiosks"" which was next to ""Southwest"" and ""Hawaiian"". Please put ""Southwest Kiosk"" on the sign as I could not see anything else that crowded day."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Awful,Sat on the runway for 45 minutes extra and then once landed sat for an hour due to “difficulties” ….
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Southwest Ticket Agent Megan at Tampa Airport,"We got to Tampa airport early for our flight to Burbank Airport via Nashville. The weather in Tampa was horrible with heavy rain and lightening. They kept delaying our departure time to Nashville and there was no way we were going to make our connecting flight to Burbank. Megan worked with us on the options we had available to us, all of them not arriving in Burbank until the following day. She called the booking agents and tried to get us on our best option (we changed the options twice) she was extremely patient and helpful. She made this horrible situation tolerable. Thank you Megan at the Tampa Airport!"
Date of travel: June 2021,50,They made things right,"On June 21 I wrote  a review indicating how unhappy I was when my son's flight was cancelled, and they required double the number of points to book another flight.  The airline has made my son and his family whole.  It is only fair that I write a new review with the additional information."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Customer,Departure time was changed three separate times before the flight was completely canceled. Sat in the airport for 15 hours.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,No,"Do not fly with southwest unless you want delay after delay. This has been an ongoing issue for weeks now. Horrible service, many flight cancellations and delays for my past four times flying with them. I am extremely disappointed and will not be back. It sounds like half of the other people who had to wait with me will not be flying with them either. Bummer"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Conditional Bag Acceptance Scam,"Watch out when southwest tags your bag as ""Conditional Acceptance"" especially when they don't let you know what it means and why they are doing that. They damaged my bag and lost items that were in the front section of the bag and noted, sorry, we cannot replace the lost items, because we accepted your bag conditionally. Other than the fact that the entire computer system was down and we could not fly for 4 hours, and they damaged my bag, and lost my items and indicated that they accepted my bag conditionally, and then updated then closed my claim with a standard letter that they will send you when they loose your entire bag, I'll let you decide if you ever want to fly them. I have very few choices, but Southwest airlines will not be one of them."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Flight cancelation,Arrived at the airport in Atlanta to learn that my flight at 7:30 pm is cancelled with no explanation.  Horrible experience.  This is a work day and I need to be at work tomorrow.  Never again fly with them.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,tons of cancellations,"Southwest canceled my flight 10am for my flight at 6:35pm and nothing until the next day. my sisters flight was cancelled twice this weekend coming from Orlando.  not very helpful and seems unapologetic. they are telling people weather but it is because of excessive employees calling out sick.  this is inconveniencing travelers and not doing anything to compensate.  extra money is needing to be spent for hotels, etc and Southwest doesn't care.     going forward, this will not be an airline on my go to list.  handling situations professionally is important and unfortunately this business did not do this."
Date of travel: June 2021,30,Frustrating Experience All Around,This was a bad experience all around with Southwest.  Storms made our departure over an hour late...not the fault of the airlines.  But their communication with us was very poor as to when we might leave.   When we arrived I patiently waited for others to take their luggage from the overhead.  Someone took my sleep apnea machine.  I have filed a report with Southwest but trying to talk to a human being is next to impossible.  Waits are over 2 hours...really??  When we got to the baggage claim area we had to wait over 90 minutes for our luggage...no explanations or apologies from the airlines.  Then we were told to change areas and it finally arrived.  Rather than a 2.5 hr experience this turned into a 5.5 hour reality and I still do not have my apnea machine...One last comment:  the airlines say they are doing extra cleaning in between flights.  There were used Kleenex in the compartments that hold the safety info...how did they clean and leave that?  Gross!!
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Amazing crew,Thank you Southwest!! June 25th was a terrible travel day. My 16 year old traveled from DC to New Mexico to Denver to Las Vegas to finally home in Phoenix. 12+ hours on one plane. Your staff on sw1044 were the most amazing people ever. She was crying most of the time but even the pilots comforted her. I couldn't have asked for a better bad experience. It wasn't your fault but boy your staff are amazing!!! Weather disruptions are unavoidable. I just can't tell you how nice it is to know you cared for my little girl. Thank you isn't even enough. The Captain walked her to her last flight....the stewardess with her from DC to Denver was Empathic and did everything she could.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Late late and  then more late.,Have notification on app for text. Says on time. Get to the airport and delayed. Waste. Oh. Good luck finding a pilot to show up. Horrible experience.
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Not Sure If I Will Fly Southwest Again,"After all of the Southwest delays that have been happening We tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Booked a flight to DIA from DAL love field. Flight was delayed first of all, upon landing in DIA I found the my checked bag never even made it on the plane and was promised it would come in at 8:39 that night. It did not. I did not receive my bags until late the next day. Fast forward to our returning flight back to DAL Ichecked my bag once more and waited for an hour on the plane while they found people’s “missing luggage.” Had an unsettling boarding experience as people were being turned away and one was yelled at by the person who checked tickets. While the plane was in the air the flight attendants let people walk around on the plan even with the fasten seatbelts kits on.  Upon landing in DAL, the bags didn’t come out until 30 minutes after we deboarded the plane. Not only that but my bag was opened and my trial size shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, and toothbrush were removed from the bag with no note left to spare and no explanation from southwest when I called about it.After these issues with my baggage on Southwest and the other issues I have seen with them in the past couple weeks I’m not sure I will fly with them again anytime soon."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,bad service,"I printed my husband boarding pass on day of the flight, 11am, since I forgot to do it night before. All day we are just waiting for time to go to the airport and of any text of cancellation or changes since we put in my email and cp nos for any changes on flight info. Nothing. Then I dropped my husband to the airport, he checked the board and flight was cancelled. So he went to the customer service, apparently SW scheduled him to fly on Sunday without informing him or texting him of anything. My husband just went ahead and cancel it altogether. What's the point of putting your email or cp when asked on their site to receive supposedly any changes or news about flight? Today, I'm getting email to check in to his flight for Sunday which supposedly the customer service cancelled for him. What?"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,I will never fly southwest again,"The staff is rude, my flight was delayed an hour, and the captain wasn't informative at all. We sat on the plane for an hour and he only addressed us when it was time for take off. This is my first and last time flying with them!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Crap customer service,"I checked in and was at the gate about to preboard  when they cancelled my connecting flight. I’m in one of their southwest wheelchairs since I need a knee replacement it is hard for me to get around. They don’t know if I should board. They start preboarding and customer service calls my connecting flight number over. So now I have to walk back over to customer service. Then they tell me not only is my flight cancelled they can’t get me home until tomorrow but my luggage is going today. If my luggage can fly why can’t I? Not to mention my medication, my everything I need is in that bag. I don’t understand. How is this acceptable? Since I’m from Chicago, I immediately call my family and they tell me it not only stopped raining it was only drizzling. So what you’re telling me is my flight was cancelled due to drizzle that no longer exists, you want my bag to go to Denver, never to be seen again. You want me to be stuck in Seattle. Interesting. They didn’t even offer to pay for a hotel. How did they even know I could afford another night here?"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,I will NEVER fly southwest again,"Like so many other recent reviewers, I was stranded in Denver due to 'weather'. What was supposed to be a 6 hour travel day (layover included) turned out to be a 24 hour nightmare. The flight from ECP got routed to New Mexico after being told Denver was closed due to a thunderstorm. Fine. We then were stuck waiting on the plane on the ground for over an hour before it was decided we could get off while we waited for the weather to clear. This delay ended up being 5 hours. By the time we got to Denver it was damn near midnight and ofcourse all connecting flights were long gone. At that point, we had to wait in line for nearly 2 hours to speak with a southwest rep regarding what our options were. Meanwhile I was also on hold with southwest to see if I could speak with anyone on the phone. No one ever answered and I hung up after 2 hours. Upon speaking to an agent in the airport I was told that the next flight was at the END OF THE NEXT DAY. There would be no credit, refund, hotel accomodations or even a darn blanket for the night. I was left with so many others sleeping on the floor shivering (there were no hotels, rental cars or Ubers available). Absolutely unacceptable. I ended up purchasing a flight with Delta so I could get home the next morning. I know of many other people that did the same thing. I understand that the weather is not necessarily the airline's fault, but their inability to accommodate people that are stranded and offer ZERO assistance is just not ok."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,As a tourism director I would not recommend Southwest,"Hospitality is my job and when I finally was able to take a much needed vacation to visit family I ended up needing another vacation but next time I won’t fly and definitely not ever again with Southwest. My flight in was initially fine but during my layover southwest had overbooked the flight and I was terrified that I might get my seat bumped and end up stranded in Chicago. I made it on the plane only to be delayed another hour because of a late flight attendant. This interfered with my family’s plans right off the bat.The morning of my return flight I left my family behind in a borrowed car and drove five hours toward the airport to find out my flight had been delayed an hour. On my way to check in my flight was cancelled and I was rebooked an entire day later. I sat stranded outside the home of my family in Maricopa with everyone five hours away. I called Southwest and after sitting on hold for over an hour I was told there was no way to get me home earlier and that they would not work with an another airline to help me. Now my job was at risk and I was still stranded with nowhere to go for an entire night. The agent told me that I would have to book my own flight on another airline if I wanted to get home earlier but that Southwest would get me a voucher for a hotel if I could make it back to the airport to pick it up. I was told that I would need to call back to cancel my flight after I had made other arrangements. They said they would reimburse and then I could call customer service on Monday for further any further reimbursement. I finally found a flight through Delta (thank goodness) and had to spend the last bit of money I had to book it. I was finally able to find a ride back to the airport only to be told that Southwest does not provide hotel vouchers so I was stranded again. I made it back to Maricopa and was grateful enough to find a way into my families home so I had somewhere to sleep. I called Southwest again to cancel my previous flight and sat on hold for an hour and a half. I might also mention that on my first call after Southwest had cancelled my flight and I was sitting on hold…..I was searching other flights only to find that my original flight could still be booked and I have the screenshot…wow!Ive been flying for over 20 years and I’ve never had such a horrible experience. My anxiety has been through the roof and I’m almost terrified to get back on a plane because it has been so stressful. I work in tourism and hate to think that those visiting my community might choose a destination closer to home  just because of a bad flying experience but I will be considering this in the future.Signed,Distressed passenger Jamee"

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Absolutely Disgusting and Loathsome and Vile and Atrocious,"Firstly, they made us wait half a day because the flight was delayed, and then we waited on the plane for an hour, only to be told that the stupid pilot wasnt on the plane and the flight was canceled - HIRE BETTER PILOTS THAT AREN’T SLEEPING IN THEIR HOTELS WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FLYING PLANES.The consequence: many of us missed the NATIONAL competition for dance - happens once a year!Multiple passengers were crying in desperation because they most likely missed crucial family events.Plus, inexperienced flight attendants kept making abhorrent “B” puns.There were nasty crumbs on most seats.Would love to have this company terminated."

Date of travel: June 2021,20,The worst hub and experience with SW,"Hubby had to Fly from Houst to Denver for a week, then fly back. Coming crack 2 weeks in a row it’s been a s$&$ show in Denver. My husband was delayed last week for 2 hours. Now here he sits in the airport again with 2+ hours delay and still waiting. Either SW needs to get it together or the airport does. He flies select and flies weekly. He has  the choice of other airlines and always liked SW. now he’s rethinking his loyalty. It’s ridiculous after a long week away from his family. Get your act together SW!!!"

Date of travel: June 2021,40,Amazing staff,"My flight from Denver to Sacramento was delayed several times than canceled. I was bummed, obviously angry and bummed out and only planned to be there for a day to pick up my new puppy. They changed my flight for several hours later. I decided to take the shuttle back to my car to sleep till my flight and three southwest employees were on the shuttle with me. The heard what happened and felt terrible. They gave me snakes and even a cute little proposal with a light up rubber ring. I understand there are so many things out of our control but these employees made me feel like a million bucks. If it wasn’t for them I probably would have never flown with southwest again. Whoever they were they deserve a huge shout out for going above and beyond to keep there customers."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Very displeased- Riley is unprofessional,"Riley was working the front desk and I have never received worse service in my life. Not only did I have to deal with the airline canceling and delaying my flight,  but the staff, specifically Riley was incredibly rude and I will assure you I will let everyone know about my experience. I was on flight 423 on 6/25 from Denver to Burbank if you would like to identify the employee. He is beyond disrespectful and many passangers agreed. Will never fly with you again due to him and his sexist and disrespectful nature"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Southwest is terrible,Every time I fly with SW my flight is either delayed or canceled. This company is terrible and would not recommend. I’ll fly with spirit before I fly with SW again!!
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Don’t book with them!,"So F Southwest Airlines, literally abandon us where we went and we need to get home…they’re like oh we can book you another flight….ok not until tomorrow? Cool, I have kids and a life I need to take care of thanks. Oh but we can give you a refund on your tickets into your southwest account to use for the future. Ummm…no I don’t want to do that. I never have flown in my life before this….you really think I will in the next year?? They’re like well we don’t refund when we had to cancel your flight due to weather….are you serious?! Like the weather is our fault?! There’s seriously no weather here or where we are going to. Maybe where the airplane is coming from, but seriously it’s such BS. Do not fly Southwest Airlines, their customer service in these situations are garbage. Have been trying to reach them for hours, the guy at the airport wasn’t helpful at all. Like way to ruin my last day of vacation guys. You could of turned this around, now I’ll never fly you again, even if I have credit. F that!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Fundamental issues with the company,"They are not prepared to fly post pandemic. They cancelled our flight with less than a 4 hour notice, provided no help to get on different flight. We had to book trip home with another airline. We were on hold for more than one hour and 25 minutes. I am an A list business flyer....I had to see how they treat the occasional customer. What is more surprising is they did not have enough staff or planes to get people in or out of Orlando in the summer which apparently was a suprise to SW management."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Southwest Airlines cancel my flight, rebooked it and cancelled it again.","Southwest cancelled my flight on June 24 out of ABQ two hours before the flight. I had an event on Friday June 25 that I missed. They rebooked me the following morning on flt 1508 where I had 3 stops to SAC but I was told at the gate, the Orange County leg was cancelled and no way to get me to SAC so they refunded my money. I was cancelled twice in 24 hours. I missed my event for Sat the 25 as well. I have no trust in SW anymore. I lost 2 nights of pre-paid hotels and 3 days on pre-paid car rental and no reinbusment. We are not customers to SW, we are cattle to them. They dont care once they have your money. Drive next time and stay away from airports. You'll be happier and the only way they will take notice is not to fly at all."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Southwest fails again,I flew Southwest again hoping they would be better than the last time. It was not. Our flight got delayed prior to boarding. Then once we landed in Las Vegas we sat in the plan for an hour waiting to find a gate to deplane. Do not fly Southwest.
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Southwest was terrible! Nasty flight attendants.,I have flown SW numerous tones and always loved them. This was different. Our flight attendent was crabby mean and threatening us if we didn’t all bird and get seated fast enough. Then they left the seatbelt sign on got 90% of a 4 hour flight even though it wasn’t very rough. In fact it was mostly smooth. Barely served anything to drink and I had to beg fir a second thimbleful of water. I turned to tap the flight attendant as she zoomed by me with water and she got all nasty because I touched her with one finger on her back. Now we are sitting waiting a half hour for our gate. The flight attendants would have made this flight better if they wouldn’t have acted like nazis. Horrible. Nasty flight attendants.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,DO NOT book hotels through Southwest Airlines!,"We assumed that Southwest Airlines would offer reputable properties - wrong. They take you to booking.com, and the biggest problem with booking.com is that their properties are not vetted. Our money for a booking was taken, then we were denied entrance to the property after 10pm when our plane landed because of the fine print. On the second day of our booking, when we are let in, we find out that there was no key to the property in the first place, as a prior tenant had lost it. The door was wide open - and continued to be so as we were out and about. Additionally, we lost $150 on a deposit that the property wanted us to ""zelle"" to him - he didn't return it because of damage to the kitchen... there wasn't even a kitchen in the one room property we rented. Plus, there was no toilet paper, and no bath towels. Still, booking.com will not refund us the money for the first night or for the deposit. STAY AWAY.(I have no problem with the airline itself - just the hotel booking)"

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Reunion ruined,"My son and his family were supposed to fly from Midway to LaGuardia on June 18 for a family reunion.  At 3AM he received a text that the flight was cancelled.  There were no other flights that day.  He tried to book a flight for later in the summer, only to discover that the number of points needed had doubled.  It would be fair for Southwest to offer him the opportunity to rebook for the same number of points, but they have not offered him that option."
Date of travel: June 2021,30,Not My Favorite Anymore,"Southwest has been my favorite airline for years.  This trip they really dropped the ball.  The airplane had mechanical errors, which happens.  The problem was there was no communication at the Aruba airport.  The staff at the gate were not given any training or instructions.  The passengers were getting text messages from the airline saying the flight was delayed, then cancelled, then rebooked and the staff was not aware.  Literally a 20 year old girl was in charge.  She did her best.  It was so chaotic and it really didn't need to be if there was just better communication.  I have a few trips I am planning.  I am not sure I will use Southwest unless I hear something from the airlines. In the end, we had to stay overnight. The hotel was not at all prepared to accommodate that many people.  The room had an awful odor.  The worse part of the whole experience was on both days we were told to show up 4 hours ahead of our flight.  In both cases, Southwest employees did not show up for at least an hour.  On day two we all arrived at 6:30 am.  SW staff came at 7:30 am.  Customs did not open until 9:00 am. It was insane and all avoidable."

Date of travel: June 2021,10,30hrs in hell,"This review is not only of one flight but the entire experience flying from Nashville to Bozeman and back in around 30hr. First, every flight but one was delayed ""due to mechanical issues"" .. are none of these planes fit to fly or are they using this as a generic excuse for allowing their entire schedule to fall apart through any given day. Would they lie to you? Yes!! Had a gate agent tell us to ""run for it"" 20 something gates away in Denver when she knew full well that our connecting flight had left, stranding us .. just pure evil. Sure the planes were packed, the food/drink service abysmal but what I want to concentrate on here were the personnel. In my working years I flew Southwest literally hundreds of times .. they had always been the friendliest, happiest folks in the sky. I don't know what happened to their corporate culture but EVERY agent we interacted with was rude, uncaring, bothered, not helpful and in at least one case, just pure evil. The flight crews were mostly curt and officious. The Southwest of the past is far in the past. It would be fitting for them to fold their tent and get out of the business because clearly they hate to fly and it shows."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never again Southwest!,Worst airline ever!! Delayed almost 90 minutes out of Tampa after a boarding regime that felt like cattle to slaughter! How hard is it to assign seats? Then over an hour to get luggage in Austin. Just awful on the way home as well. Crowded because people cannot find enough overhead space. Airflow was non existent in flight. We thought we wanted Southwest because of direct flights. Never again. It’s better to connect with a real airline! Aeroflot ( Russian airline) is better!!!
Date of travel: June 2021,30,Non-stop from NOLA to Phoenix 06/08,"We felt fortunate to be able to fly non-stop to Phoenix from New Orleans,There was a delay leaving to gett all the passenger's luggage loaded, but after that, there were no delays and we arrived within an hour of the scheduled time.My only issue is the flight attendants talked too much and interrupted my reading during the flight."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Canceled our flights and didn't let us know 6 days before our departure.,"We had flights for 6 planned through Southwest Vacations and Southwest Air canceled our flights on May 6 and didn't advise us. Our travel agent went in to verify everything and NOTHING was there for our flights. SW canceled all 6 flights and didn't give us any notice.  We were left with a wonderful Punta Cana resort with no way to get there. Southwest Air gave no indication as to why, that they just dropped the flight from the schedule. When we asked them for alternate flights they did not want to assist us. The CSR from SW couldn't give us a reason and when asked if they would possibly add a flight, she advised that she ""didn't have a crystal ball"" to be able to verify that. Wrong thing to say to someone who manages a business. Very poor customer service.  We will never use Southwest again for travel and we have used them a LOT over the years. American Airlines bailed us out and offered flights. Be cautious that SW will cancel you with no reason or warning."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Inexcusably horrible,"FIND ANOTHER AIRLINE.  I have just returned from Bradley Airport (BDL) for the second consecutive day of what I will charitably refer to as my Southwest Airlines debacle. Let me first say that I have been a Rapid Rewards member since 2012, and a patron of Southwest prior to that. Until recently, I have been generally satisfied with the service and schedules, and I applaud their front line staff for whom today I have great pity. I recognize that there are substantial logistical challenges for the travel industry in general, and airlines in particular in rebounding from the ravages of the pandemic.  However, the exceedingly irritating experience that I have had in the past two months crossed deeply into the territory of unacceptable yesterday and today. This is a corporate failing of epic proportions. My saga begins April 9, 2021 when I booked a post pandemic trip for my wife and I to see our son for the first time in a year and a half. The dates were to be June 18 to June 23. It seemed to go smoothly enough: BDL to BWI, BWI to RDU… a four hour trip. (Confirmation code 2FRTY2)On April 29 (20 days later), Southwest emailed us with regard to a modification of our trip: BDL to Orlando (MCO), MCO to RDU… now a five and a half hour trip to North Carolina, via Florida. Irritating, but not insurmountable. I was still feeling some sympathy for the logistics issues.On May 12th came another email informing us that “we (SWA) have made a change to your upcoming trip”. This email included a new confirmation number, and a link to view the itinerary. When I logged onto my account, I found that my original itinerary was gone, and that the new confirmation number “could not be found” in the airlines system, and my trip had simply vanished. REALLY upsetting!	I immediately called the SWA customer service number, and, after a 45 minute wait on hold, managed to get my flights rebooked on approximately the same schedule that I had originally booked in early April. Confirmation code 3NHEOY. Now that I was left ill at ease by the series of “rescheduling events”, I rechecked the itinerary several times on my account, looking for unexpected changes.On Wednesday evening, June 17th, we went to bed anticipating our trip the following morning. The next morning, yesterday (June 18th), thirty minutes into our ninety minute drive to the airport, I received the text from SWA informing us that our flight was delayed FOUR HOURS. The new departure time from BDL was now AFTER the departure time for our connecting flight out of BWI. When we reached the airport, your weary front line people informed us that they had no seats available from BWI to RDU for the rest of the day. We had to rebook for the following morning: a 6:00 AM departure to get us through BWI, and on to RDU by 10:30. We drove the 90 minutes home. 	We got up at 2:00 AM this morning and drove the 90 minutes back to BDL, giving us ample time to get through the early morning TSA crush. At 4:30 AM we were at the gate, looking out at the parked and darkened 737. At 4:45 I received the text  from SWA informing us that our flight was delayed THREE HOURS. Once again, the new departure time from BDL was now AFTER the departure time for our connecting flight out of BWI. The system apparently automatically rebooked us to a flight from BDL through Chicago MDW, a 7+ hour journey  that would bring us to our destination at midnight. Unacceptable. Our trip effectively  chopped in half, with what seems a high likelihood that we would be stranded in Raleigh or Baltimore on our Wednesday return, we had no option but to cancel. I am enraged. My wife is in tears. My son and his wife are disappointed. 	What did we get this morning? After some haranguing, a manager threw us a couple of $100 vouchers that are essentially lottery tickets inviting us to another dumpster fire, should we try to book another flight on Southwest. Seriously? $200 doesn’t even cover my lost prepaid airport parking fees and gas for two wasted three hour round trips to the airport. And I still don’t know if I’ll recover my $365 prepaid rental car costs. I’ll add the 6+ hours of on-hold phone time (two of it waiting for an SWA representative) in the past 30 hours. Their corporate image is gravely damaged in my eye, and based on the hundreds of unhappy faces I saw yesterday and today, I am not alone. If they’re hoping to redeem yourselves in the face of this mess, they’ll need to do alot better than a dog biscuit."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Never Before Experience,"I have been a Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Member for over 20 years and have always been a very satisfied customer, up until yesterday. What a day. Was to fly out of Baltimore's BWI on 2 pm Direct flight to Austin. I received my first flight delay by text driving to the Airport and it went down after that. 30 minute flight delay turned into an almost 3 hour delay after boarding the plane for about 30 minutes, getting off with baggage  and  then re-boarding again after another long wait all wearing a facemask. I did hear all the reports with very erratic program and systems issues throughout the week. Very disruptive for everyone. Worst experience flying with Southwest in my over 20 years as rewards member. Wow, the pandemic has sure made some changes to the airline industry. I can only say, there has to be improvements going forward."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,What. A. JOKE!!!!!!!!!,"Don’t!!!!!!!!!! Just don’t!!!!!! Fly with someone else with 10 layovers and you’ll get there faster!!!!!!! SHAME ON YOU SOUTHWEST!!!!!!!!!!! If you do t have the staff or technology, then STOP taking our business first class A list money when we have to wait hours and hours and hours for you to get crap figured out!!!!!! Terrible!!!!! Even lost over $600 on a rental because I didn’t get to destination before they closed!!!!!!! Yeah, I really wanted to lose all that money AND have to spend more Ubering everywhere!!!!!!! I will never spend a dime with your company again  and will make sure my hospital never does either!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you have an important trip or event, DO NOT FLY SOUTHWEST!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible reschedule from Southwest with no options,I will literally never fly anything other than Southwest! I have been a loyal customer with them for years!!! But today they lost any of my future business. After changing my straight flight from Tampa to Dallas to go through CHICAGO and adding 4 hours of flight time to my trip while traveling alone with a one year old they told me there's no other available flights to Dallas or Midland than getting there at 11:40pm. My original flight was scheduled to land at 6:50 pm. This is BEYOND unacceptable!!! Apparently neither of my original flights exist any longer. So they're trying to save money and squish us all on one flight instead. Cheap and inconsiderate. No compensation either. Just either cancel and find another flight somewhere else or deal. I'm so upset.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Poor quality of service; no accountability,"Delayed flights without no immediate update is becoming a pattern. The lack of communication is very frustrating. On 6/12/21  flight 4788 was delayed and I nearly missed my connecting flight 0690 ( I was actually rebooked). Due to the confusion my luggage was lost & when I found it (the next day) 2 if my 3 suitcases were broken. What’s actually more frustrating is the fact no Southwest flight attendant, clerk or baggage claim representative knows what to do or who to contact and instead of taking accountability blames the person who last spoke to me regarding the situation because “they should have told you” came out of every person I spoke to. Please help me understand why the last two flights (my company) booked with Southwest have been a nightmare."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst experience,"We were supposed to fly back home from New York to Dallas. They canceled our flight with no other option but to reschedule 2 days later. No one was able to help. We had to get two more nights in a hotel, rent a car, pay for food for those two days. The day that we are finally supposed to leave they have delayed our flight 3 times already. First we were supposed to leave at 3pm, got delayed to 4ish, then 5:30pm, now 6:30pm. The only response we get from southwest employees is that they can’t help us. Hopefully, they won’t delay the flight any more. This is getting extremely frustrating"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Nightmare from Colorado Springs to Reno flight,"June 15th, due to technical difficulties, my #3938 flight was cancelled from COS to Vegas to Reno (final destination). They rebooked it 6hours later to Denver. Denver Hub was Hell; finally got on plane and sat on tarmac for 2 hours while they waited for a pilot to come in from Baltimore which that plane was late. Did not get into Reno until 1:30 am. I was so exhausted, I booked a room in Reno so I would not have to drive 2 hours to Tahoe. Called Southwest customer service 6-17-2021,  who said there is no compensation. No food vouchers, no hotel coverage, nothing. I can show all my receipts. As an A List customer who has been loyal for years to Southwest I am so angry. Way to lose a frequent flyer."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Southwest is like flying Greyhound buses,"Southwest planes seem to be always, always late! And according to SW, they always blame their tardiness on something or someone else...air traffic, no available gate, whatever. According to them, it is never their fault. Just like how a little kid never takes responsibility. 3 out of 4 of my SW flights were late in the last week. If you're a business traveler like me, you cannot tolerate that nonsense. You're on a tight schedule, and you literally don't have hours and hours to squander because SW stretches it's planes too thin, and just cannot run them on schedule.If you're a leisure traveler, consider SW to be the Greyhound Bus lines of airlines-- you may save a few dollars - although now SW often is the same cost or more as the competition, and many people do not realize that- anyway SW planes are crowded, smelly, dirty...just like many buses. And you often get a lower class flier on SW. Plus their flight attendants very often are obese or sloppy looking. American Airlines by comparison, has far fewer fat flight attendants, and overall much more presentable personnel.Southwest-- the unreliable, smelly flying buses of the sky."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible! Southwest loses another customer!,"We have been faithful customers of Southwest for over 20 years. I have never experienced such terrible customer service and scheduling in all those years! We have taken 4 flights in the past week and EVERY one was late. First due to mechanical issues, and others due to a person on flight crew not being there....was over an hour late on 2 flights for this! That is not coincidence, that is poor planning. I have called Southwest the past several days. Wait times are 86 minutes, 62 minutes (was disconnected), 100 minutes, 96 minutes, and tonight I have been on hold for 2 hours!!! This is ridiculous! I use to love Southwest and appreciated their customer service. Whatever changes they made due to COVID need to be undone! It is NOT working!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible Customer Support,Southwest cancelled my flight due to technical issues. They then could not find a replacement flight for me. I had to stay the night in the airport and then found a flight on my own with no help from southwest. I called there support line and waited for two hours to get a hold of someone. That someone then told me that I had made a mistake by buying my own ticket and that they would not be able to cover it. I then went to the front desk where after 4 hours of asking they finally agreed to cover the expense of the new ticket I bought due to them canceling my flight the day prior. I was then told they could not find my bag. Eventually it was located in San Francisco. I’m flying into Oakland. My bag tag says my bag would be in Oakland. They said there was nothing they could do. The worst customer service I’ve ever seen.  Do not fly southwest.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Very Disappointed,"After our flight was cancelled due to weather data errors and Southwest computer glitches, the next day we got long delays at the airport, and an extra hour delay waiting on a flight attendant to land on another flight. Some of the delay for the late flight attendant was due to rain , however. They also didn’t transfer my early bird selection to my changed flight. Spent two hours waiting for an operator to talk to about that. She couldn’t fix it but she did at least refund me since Southwest had not done that yet. Use to really think Southwest was a good airline, but they have lost my vote this trip. Not sure if I will use them much in the future. Will be looking elsewhere."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Quick trip gone long out of hand,Worst flight and customer service.  Lost 8 hours.  Plus had to pay for food.  They gave me a $100 voucher.  Last night I went to purchase more airfare.  In October I have a flight.  I went to use the voucher but it expires in September. Its currently June.  I paid for the airfare so I had the flight during their 50%off.  It was $850. I was on the phone for over 3 hours to use the voucher.  Two agents said they cannot attach the $100 voucher whatsoever.  But I can have it extended for another flight later on.   I then canceled and found different airline same flight details for $50 cheaper. This is an absolute nightmare go elsewhere if you value your time. They have no customer service and will put you through loopholes. They do not value their customers and will not make it right.  They just prolonged the inevitable.  I have never been treated like this. It was easier to cancel the flight I had just booked than to resolve $100 voucher on a fake 50% off sale
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Price gouging,$642 for the wanna get away non stop flight. How is it this is the only flight that is this amount. All layovers are cheaper. Not by much $360… one way. Your service has went downhill. Your non-stop flights have become obsolete. We used to fly you as you were the  only carrier with non/stop flights for our child to visit heir non-custodial parent. I can fed me credit card because it takes us almost 4K to fly one flight thats 2 hours. Over your airline. Bye bye
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible to and fro,"Left an hour and a half late because of baggage tags that sometime forgot to scan, took multiple attempts to land in Jamaica. Upon arrival, we were given paperwork for customs at the airport, which could have been handed out, maybe in the hour and a half we say on the plane in Chicago.  Brand new luggage arrived with the deepest gouges I have ever seen; looks like it was dragged behind the baggage cart! On the return flight, again the unscanned baggage tags kept us waiting another hour or so, but this time they added in passport and COVID-19 issues for passengers that had already gone through customs, security, and were now boarded. If there were actual issues, it worries me that the passengers made it as far as being allowed to board the plane. While in flight, we were given the US Customs form, but with no pens. The flight attendant that handed it to me had at least seven ink pens clipped to the pocket of her apron and when I asked if I could have a pen to fill out the form, my request was answered with ""I'm sorry I don't have any pens."" At first I thought she was joking, but she abruptly made her way down the aisle. Finally, we landed in Chicago, only to find out our slot for customs was given to another plane, you guessed it, 45 minutes waiting on the hot plane wearing the ridiculous facemasks! I will never fly this airline again! Oh and boarding groups are the dumbest things, just give us a seating assignment."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Southwest does not care,"2 cancelled flights, no hotel vouchers , rebooted me TWO days later with no where to stay. Their system crashed and they claim no fault?  Talk to literly 5 different people with no help. Bags are lost too. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,checked baggage theft may 2021,"while flying from Austin TX to GR MI , my checked bag was opened , contents dumped out , expensive dress clothes stolen . on reporting this incident , i was treated with contempt . i filed a report and was referred to as MS.  [ i am male ]southwest concluded that TSA was responsible . TSA concluded that southwest was responsible . i will NEVER use southwest again ."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Poor communication and not reliable,"I’ve been flying twice a month for 10 years and decided to try Southwest. This is my first trip with them and the gate agents are not friendly, not clear with several delays on what time we would actually board. Lack of personnel seems to be an issue as well. This is the second time in all the years I’ve been delayed and the poorest I’ve seen for handling it. This is the first and last time I will fly with Southwest. Southwest, your team needs to understand customer service. Training might be needed."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worse than Spirit,"My husband has been stuck in Dallas for over 24 hours now. His flight has been cancelled two days in a row. He tried booking to a nearby city two hours away: A delayed flight due to no pilot? First flight was canceled because of ""system failures"". On the second cancelled flight, one SWA employee said it was cancelled because there were  not enough flight attendants, and another SWA employee said it was a system failure. It all sounds extremely fishy. If this last flight gets cancelled, my husband will be going on 48 hours trying to get home, and the reasons given sound like lies. I'm pretty sure the planes haven't left because they weren't full. At this point, Southwest, you should be paying for other, apparently more reliable, airlines to fly out the customers you have failed to get to their destinations. This is absolutely ridiculous. These cancellations and delays are 100% your fault. Take some responsibility for your awful airline, and actually think about helping all of the people you are stranding, some with no means for accommodations. If this is how you handle your customers in a crisis, you are about to lose a lot of business. Good luck to you."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Can’t believe it!!!!,"What kind of Airline doesn’t have pilots available to fly their planes?? SOUTHWEST!!! On my 3rd hour of waiting for them to “find a pilot” to fly our plane. Let me repeat that, I’m on my 3rd hour of waiting for them to “FIND A PILOT”!! To find a pilot! I’m dumbfounded really. This is like literally going to a bank and they say “wait 3 hours while I go FIND A TELLER to take care of you.” This is ridiculous. This is truly ridiculous ."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Disappointed; SWA is not the same,"I am writing this review with the hopes that SWA returns to the same level they were at prior to the pandemic. I have generally enjoyed flying SWA prior to Covid and actually have their CC. I travel frequently for work and fly numerous airlines, and SWA has always been in the top few. However, this recent trip was a totally different experience. While other airlines (Delta, JetBlue) have taken to improving cleanliness and taking measures to sanitize between flights, SWA could not even clean up the food and trash left behind from the previous flight. The four planes I flew in were absolutely disgusting. I used some leftover wipes from a previous Delta flight to clean my sticky dirty tray tables and seats. The family across from me showed me the massive amount of food that was crushed up under their seats that was just left there. They made the point that the plane sat for 3-4 hours during the delay, and the least that could have been done was to take a little time to clean it up.The overall communication and service was horrendous. All of the flights I was on departed late and we would not receive prompt communication of delays until it was far beyond useful. The last flight was canceled altogether after 6 hours of being strung along, despite known computer issues. We were lied to by crews that it was due to weather and that the pilots were over their time just as we were sitting on the runway to take off for a 45 min final flight. We could not get our bags back and were told they would arrive sometime at our final destination. Myself and my fellow traveler were rebooked on two separate flights one and two days later, respectively. We ended up cancelling the final flight altogether and driving 6 hours home to avoid any more of this frustration.Overall, the experience I had is probably not unique and should be noted if SWA wants to retain previously loyal customers. Extremely terrible and disappointing. Our bags are still lost and we been told we will not be refunded for the issues. I hope that they can do some sort of service recovery at this point, otherwise I will definitely be avoiding SWA in the future."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Frustrated flyer,"How does an airline like Southwest let a complete system failure happen at check-in without redundancy, causing cancelled flights and delays for hundreds of people with huge financial and personal loss? The poor handling of the situation and lack of effective communication was a complete debacle. You cost our family half of our already limited time together and thousands of dollars in non-refundable airline and hotel fees. To make matters worse,  just before getting to the check-in area, our group was accused of “line jumping,” which we didn’t do, or did in an honest mistake almost an hour earlier when we first got in line. I was shocked and started to explain to a female rep we had briefly spoken with, that we had been there the whole time and maybe they thought that because we had been told to move to a different line for “full-service” and better handling of our cancelled flight, just to be told to go back to where we were previously, but decided it was a lost cause. Why didn’t she remember us? Was it fair to send us to the back of the line we had already waited through and was now twice as long? Everyone was frustrated including her. The fact that she chose rudeness over peace-making and deescalating the situation was a poor reflection on your company. She had already made up her mind and sarcastically said to the group behind us, “some people are just that way and karma will come around,” presumably to get us “bad” people. - not “confused” people, “misdirected” people, or more accurately our “valued customers” whom we let down. We were all just trying to figure things out and salvage what remained of our travel plans. I don’t personally believe in karma, but if it exists, she might want to think about the irony of her words."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Changed flight on us after we booked.,SWA changed our flight schedule a month after we booked.  The flight there became several hours later and the trip home became several hours earlier.  Know our vacation was shorter.  The day of the flight they delayed a couple hours for unknown reason.   Basically used up our first day in Vegas at home.   We should have spent the money on a better air carrier.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,discriminatory/Rude,"I would rate this a ZERO STAR. The flight attendants are very discriminatory. We travel with our nine years old daughter in the early am and she was so tired, thirsty and hungry. When they started to served snacks and drinks they went pass our row several times and did not bother to ask us for a snacks or drinks. My daughter was looking at them walking back and forth hoping that one of the flight attendant would give her some snacks but no one would look at her because she is an Asian kid. I looked at my daughter and saw her tearing eyes, I rubbed her head and asked her to sleep. It was so heartbreaking to see my daughter in this situation. I will never travel with Southwest airlines again. They are discriminated against Asian."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Don’t trust!!!! - trying to fill flights!!!,"Been waiting 6.5 hours at an International Airport. NO delays talked to maintenance or weather, or any other policy…. They are trying to fill flights!!! If you want to get there on the day you want — plan 24 hours ahead!!! I will not be getting to my location until 24 hours after my original time!!! I want refunded a whole day of work, travel, and time missed with family. AND THEY WON’T EVEN RETURN ME THE PRICE OF THE TRIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Rude and unappreciated as a paying customer,"Where to begin? First we paid for Early Bird checkin and got numbers in the mid teens, BUT upon attempting to get in line folks with numbers in the in the high 20's were ahead of us and told ""those numbers don't mean anything just get in line"" WHY have numbers at all? Why pay extra for them if you just get in the line anywhere? Also, while we were welcomed and thanked for our ""Flying with Southwest"" by our pilot in Cancun NOTHING from our pilot in Chicago. That might have been overlooked BUT as we disembarked our plane we were heading to customs/immigration and a SWA employee ahead of us opened a locked door and stepped aside as we proceeded to go thru the door Were rudely admonished to ""Wait for me, I have to lead you. You need to listen to directions!"" I am 70 years old, a retired USN Master Chief and I think I can follow instructions IF any had been given. I do not need to be treated like a child. NEVER SWA AGAIN. YOU just lost a customer you said was important to you!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,What a Joke,"I wish I had a job where I schedule things and then just show up when I feel like it.... not only was my flight delayed over an hour without so much as a ""hey sorry about the fact your rental car company will be closed by the time we get in now and your whole night is screwed."" But then once they finally boarded people, we all got to sit on the plane for another 45 mins while we waited for them to LOAD THE BAGS...... I truly have to wonder how at an entire airline there doesn't seem to be a single person with the most basic of competency at their job.... Oh AND as though they have not done enough to make flying the most miserable experience ever, now they no longer offer alcohol to cope with there blatant incompetence.... I would pay $100 to see a CEO from one of the crappy airlines actually travel the way they force the rest of us to. I'm willing to bet they all have alcohol and a lack of masks on their private jets that leave on time with their luggage. Maybe if they actually had to follow their own policies and miss some meetings when planes show up an hour after they were supposed to be taking off, there would be some favorable changes in policy....... in the meantime, I will not be choosing Southwest again, and in fact will probably choose to drive if I am going anywhere within the country. The stress and annoyance that they have made flying isn't worth the speed anymore."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,It used to be so different,So unimpressed with the route this airline has taken. I’m so sad to see how they have treated their customers during COVID-19. Terrible customer service.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Awful!,Terrible! Worse than terrible! Pilots were awesome! Service stunk! Stewards/stewardesses (most) stunk! Timeliness stunk (consistently late). Luggage damaged. Checking baggage a nightmare!
Date of travel: June 2021,30,No customer service,I had an early bird check in issue.  Talked to customer service and essentially told me that I was lying about when I bought it.  I had NO receipt because none was emailed to me.  I had NO records for myself to say when I bought early bird check in.  I ended up checking in hours later and got C 51.  Customer service is absolute garbage.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,This airline is more of a mess than ever,"What a horrible experience it was flying after not having flown in 18 months. I had and still have a bunch of points on Southwest, so I thought I'd use them. Had no problem booking the flights using points, but the connecting flight from and to Phila. changed a few times. Ok, so things happen and I had plenty of notice. What I was not prepared for was the complete mess at Midway Airport in Chicago. I simply despise that airport and Southwest seems to use it since they have all or most of the gates there. I was stuck there for 30 hours four years ago, but that's another story. So, I was flying back to Philly from Birmingham, AL and had a connecting flight through the dreaded Midway airport. That airport was packed cheek to jowl. Unbelievable. The monitor said the flight was on time. Well, that was news to me since there was no plane at the gate for almost an hour after the flight was supposed to depart. I guess it was invisible. Finally a plane flies in and rolls up to the gate. The passengers get off and then we wait and wait and wait. Finally we get on and sit and wait and wait and wait. Long story short, the Captain gets on and says ""Well, when you hear this, you're going to lose whatever patience you have left."" You could tell he was super annoyed about the delay situation. Turns out that another flight's baggage was put on our plane and our plane's baggage was put on another plane. So, we had to sit and wait for all the baggage to be removed from each plane and then put on the correct plane. That's why I never check baggage. Then they had to fiddle around balancing all the baggage. We were four hours behind schedule. I walked in my front door at 2:30 am. Never again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,ABSOLUTE TRASH AIRLINE,Could not be more disgusted with this airline. Somewhere along the way this airline has gone to complete crap. The customer service is atrocious and non existent…why is this? Why did Southwest decide that customer service was no longer important somewhere along the way? Nothing like sitting through literally 15 minutes of some bitchy flight attendant berating the entire plane into wearing their masks EXACTLY the way the all powerful flight attendant says OR ELSE. Well done Southwest your now officially the ugly step sister to Spirit Airlines who kicks two year old children off their planes for masks falling below their little noses. Here is also why customer service is important. It partially makes up for the fact that Southwest is the most poorly ran airline around HANDS DOWN. Always departing/arriving late for the most amateur reasons. My flight crew couldn’t figure out if there was an open seat for someone flying standby for 30 minutes. The plane was fully boarded and they couldn’t figure out if there was a seat without a human sitting in it… for 30 minutes. The sight of this crew scrambling around like a bunch of babbling amateurs was literally embarrassing. Landing early but getting stuck on the middle of the runway for 45 minutes because the other incompetent Southwest crew can’t get a “paperwork” issue figured out and get out of our gate. Landing at 11:30 at night to an empty airport and waiting 45 minutes to an hour to get our baggage. All the while Southwest employees stand around not informing anybody why our baggage is taking so long in an empty airport. I WILL NEVER FLY SOUTHWEST AIRLINES AGAIN. IM CANCELLING MY SOUTHWEST CREDIT CARD. ABSOLUTELY EMBARRASSING & PATHETIC!
Date of travel: June 2021,20,"What has happened to this airline, from excellent to horrible","Today I am mourning the demise of what use to be the best airline in the sky, especially in terms of service and price.  The COVID time period has been trying for many, but I assumed this airline would weather the storm, and come out the other side. The phone wait times are horrible, the early check in is a scam (it supposedly checks in automatically 36 hours before the flight, but you cannot access the information on the site until the 24 hours before, otherwise you must wait 70-90 minutes on the phone for a CSR to give information), the CSRs are now extremely rude and uncaring.  The flight tomorrow to Orlando will probably be the last time I fly this airline.  I am a Dallas native, and was there when Southwest first started flying.  It is ashame, Southwest you can do better, we have seen it! Where is the CEO and VP of Customer Service during this time?"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Normally good, but not this time","We were stranded in Denver and not happy about it. Originally booked nonstop from St Louis to San Fran. They changed it to add a 40 minute stop in Denver. We left St Louis late because of weather, arrived in Denver 10 minutes before our next flight was leaving, they didn't wait. They left us in Denver at 8:45pm without luggage and automatically booked us on a 6am! flight which then had a layover and wouldn't get to San Fran until Noon! the next day. Other than the baggage desk there were no other Southwest people there to speak with and nobody to call. So, I guess we were supposed to sleep in the airport or hang around for 9 hours? Then we continue on another 6 hour journey to San Fran? All this without luggage, deodorant, hotel, change of clothes, toothbrush...We had Alcatraz tour next morning at 11am, completely sold out for months. There were 5 seats left on the only flight that would get us out of there on Frontier. So, there went $1,000 and we didn't get to our hotel until almost 2am. Pretty horrible start to the vacation. Tried to get in touch with Southwest on the phone because nobody else could help with a refund. Tried 3 days in a row, sitting on hold the first 2 days for an hour before hanging up. Stayed on hold for almost 2 hours the 3rd day and finally got through and all they did was refund the cost of the flight, no other compensation."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Won’t fly Southwest again,"First time flying in a while. I felt like I was back in a bus depot, not an airport. Paid extra to upgrade our tickets due to hubby being 6’7 with bad knees. Was assured that by paying extra we could have really good seats. We watched 6 wheelchair patrons (one of them walked better than we did before sitting herself in a wheelchair) each with an entourage all board before us. Literally 16 people. I’ll never fly open seating again!"

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Do not fly Southwest,"I would never recommend southwest airlines to anyone. They changed are flights,  my cousins flights were changed twice. We called to have an agent to get our flights changed and you could tell they were stressed. I called to get the early bird special and the only thing they could guarantee was the automatic check in so why bother paying extra for nothing. I've always flown American and JetBlue and will continue to fly with them. Never again with southwest, never."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Not as good as you use to be,"Southwest, you have always been great, but not lately.  You keep changing flights and don't alert passengers when it's been delayed. You don't understand that the changes u make mess up people's livelihood and plans. You need to start working on making it right. I've never been so upset with my travels with Southwest. Your flight attendants aren't as friendly as they used to be. STOP ruining people's travel plans. My WHOLE travel trip has been a big disappointment because of you! Not happy at all."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,would not let me change passanger on a reservation,they will not let you change a person on a ticket i lost 350 due to my son girlified broke up with him 3 weeks before the trip so i paid for the ticket and i tried to put someone else in that spot and they told me no and would not refund my money back instead gave her a credit under her name for a future flight and that's not cool i will never fly again southwest since they don't give refund or let people change names to give the ticket i paid for to someone else that all i wnated todo even if i paid extra to change names i would be cool with it but they like screwing customers over i seen a few reviews about this so dont book southwest unless you know 100% everyone is going
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Over lay overs and early boarding charges,"Purchase 2 tickets from Tampa to Boston with one layover for June 18th,  Check my tickets last night to find out  we now have  another layover and hours added to out flight.  Never received any confirmation changes from Southwest,  Payed an additional $200 for the tickets to have early boarding that I am sure with all the lay overs will not be a option.  Flying from Tampa to Atlanta to Chicago then Boston,  Does not sound like a weekend getaway."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never again,"I always fly delta but I allowed my mother to create the itinerary and choose trip details. I completely regret it.southwest is terrible. Their way of doing things is horrible. First of all, the posts that are suppose to help direct and organize on boarding does the exact opposite. There’s just crowds of people confused, and standing too closely. Have y’all not heard of the coronavirus?? Then might I say I became extremely enraged that I was standing in my group (A31-60) first and somehow these entitled older group of Caucasian people tried to bully me into getting ahead of me on the post? Walking literally close enough to breathe over me, hounding me about what exact number I am? Why does it matter. There arent numbers labeled on the carpet, there’s a range and that’s it. If southwest had their stuff together better, maybe this wouldn’t occur. You shouldn’t have ranges if your entitled ass consumers are going to treat them like seat numbers. This can cause a lot of aggressive exchanges and conflicts!!! Then to not have seat numbers is equally as ridiculous. Never again. Back to delta."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Quick trip to Indy 500,"We took non stop flights on a Phx-Ind and return itinerary. Left Phx on Saturday AM and returned from Ind on Monday AM. Both flights left on time, arrived early. Good cabin service but limited to the offerings. Masks required in flight. Our planes were both among the newest in the SWA fleet and looked like it, very nice."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Canceled flight,"We understand that airlines have to cancel flights from time to time. That's not the reason we feel  SW deserves such a low rating. The reason for the rating is the way they handled the communication and willing to help us out once they canceled the first flight in our trip and their response for assistance. It is too long of a story to share in this review but the short of it is that the flight they canceled and did not tell us about until we were checking in, cost us an additional $900 and a full day of our honeymoon. We reached out to them several times and the only response we received is the COVID excuse with no willingness to assist in any manner.We do not plan on using their future travel plans. POOR, POOR, POOR customer service!!!!"
Date of travel: May 2021,40,Friendly employees in these trying times,"These days it seems that so many travelers are tense and stressed out and they take it out on the airline employees.  But on our roundtrip flights from BWI to MCO every single one of the Southwest employees were smiling and pleasant.  They are in a very tough position and on our flights at least they were great.  Obviously there were Covid modifications but I think Southwest is doing a great job, all things considered."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Hypocrite crew,"Took the 2:15PM flight from punta cana to Baltimore on May 30th 2021. The crew preached the entire flight about wearing masks and checking everyone’s face for making sure their mask was put on correctly. Multiple times they jumped on the intercom about being safe and how to wear the mask. Once we got off the plane I had to wait for my significant other, two crew members (the African American and the blonde flight attendants) walking With a customs agent, no mask!!!! F this airline. Rules for thee but not for me! Just know that when you fly southwest"
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Never again!  3 out 4 flights not customer friendly!,"In 10 days my Husband & I fly on 4 different southwest flights from May 5, 21 thru May 15, 2021 departing from Birmingham, Al to. Denver, Boise, Las Vegas, Orange county back to Denver and home to Birmingham.  Out of the 4 flights 3 of them the Attendants (Women & 1 Male were SNIPPY) they treated we the public like  we were 3 year old""s  threatening  if we didn't  have our mask on quite right they could de-board you off the plane.  A constant reminder.  I  found that behavior of the attendant's  arrogant and devoid of customer service and this shows exactly why there's a growing hostility toward flight attendants, which SW seems to be leading the airlines in this area.  I will gladly pay more $ to avoid flying Southwest.   With the events of the past 15 months you would think that the Attendants on SWA would be more customer oriented .  The only fight that was really good and deserves 5 stars was Denver to Birmingham at the end of our trip, guess that just might be some southern hospitality??"
Date of travel: March 2021,20,You get what you (don't) pay for,"OK, bags are a good deal.  Otherwise you're literally part of the herd.  As an institution, the airline doesn't care much about the individual.  If you're late for a flight, even if there were plenty of free seats on the flight you missed and the one you take, you're likely to be out the whole fare.  Yep, they will really enforce their ""no show"" policy to their benefit and your loss when there was in fact no harm to their revenue from an honest mistake or unfortunately delay.  They took me for $688."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Ignorant customer service,"When the person boarding customers goes on a long speech which equals to threatening people if they don't wear masks exactly as they are told to they will be kicked off, the captain will turn plane around and deboard you, etc . That's just ignorance,  arrogance and horrific customer service  and shows exactly why there's such hostility toward flight attendants"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Mrs,"Paid $50 for “early bird” check in to get a better place in line for boarding. They put me at number 60 for my boarding number. Which started after the family boarding. In addition, the seats don’t recline, there is no charger outlet and no smart device holder. they cost of the ticket was the same as other lines. Definitely will not be flying Southwest again if I can help it."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,SOUTHWEST AIRLINES FLIGHT CANCELLED-BE VERY CAREFUL MAKING RESERVATIONS WITH SOUTHWEST AIRLINES,"VERY, VERY dissatisfied with Southwest Airlines. I made a reservation to Kauai with my family several months ago and we are leaving in two weeks. We received an email notification our flight was CANCELLED two days ago (16 days before we are supposed to depart). The email stated ""please keep this confirmation number to use for future travel"". When I called Southwest they told me they had a schedule change and cancelled the flight because there was a ""lack of demand"" for that flight. When I requested a refund instead of future flight credit the agent  told me they would provide a refund but only because they cancelled the flight. The agent went on to say they don't typically do refunds and made me feel like they were doing me a favor. I had to rebook on a different airline and spend thousands of additional dollars because we were departing within two weeks. When I complained to Southwest they offered a pitiful $75 travel voucher for each of us and again acted as though I should be grateful. Unfortunately the travel vouchers won't even come close to covering the additional cost we are incurring for the new tickets. I travel frequently and I've been an ""A Lister"" with Southwest for several years. They have always been my first choice airline for travel. I will avoid traveling on Southwest going forward. Thanks Southwest Airlines."
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Great customer service,"I am very happy with Southwest airlines customer service, back in March my sister and me had to travel the same day because my mother was very sick in the hospital and the  customer service representative was very understanding to my emergency, she found a flight the same day and we could go to see our dying mother the same day, our mother passed away but we could see her before she passed!! We are very grateful to Southwest customer service!! Thank you so much for everything!"
Date of travel: May 2021,50,OKC to SRQ to OKC,"Nice ride down to Sarasota from Oklahoma City, great weather to fly in!  Now, when we were on our way back?  It got to 90 degrees F in Atlanta...in May....so I overheated.  The flight attendant was kind enough to get me some ice, that my husband asked her for, in an ice pack for my neck and that helped.  This was on the ground, ya know, so the a/c was overworked anyway.  My husband was wonderful, as always and fanned me until we were in the air and things cooled down and I felt better.The flight attendants were great and did their jobs very well.  Thank you, Southwestern!!!"

Date of travel: April 2021,10,Customer Service is NO HELP and Lacks,Customer service is a joke that gives you the run around and no solution. So disappointed in southwest
Date of travel: May 2021,30,lacks pet friendliness,"I flew economy on my flight there and upgraded to Business Select on the way back.  Southwest welcomes pets but not happily. Southwest Airlines lacks the friendliness that Jet Blue Airlines offers when it comes to traveling with dogs. While Jet Blue requires that carriers must be placed below the seat during taxi, take off and landing, Jet Blue lets you hold the carrier on your lap during the flight. Southwest's policy to keep your pet under the seat for hours is animal abuse. I found that some flight attendants are more welcoming of pets than others and some are not at all. The rules seem to change based on which team you get on a particular flight. I remember when flying Southwest Airlines was fun. But now they try to make jokes, be congenial over the speaker and are plain rude when interacting with people. Some flight attendants pick on customers and seem to make up their own rules. The older ones are the worst. Especially the blond ones. I'm not impressed with Southwest Airlines. It's a good thing we have airline choices."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Southworst... non-existent customer service,"Booked a flight and hotel through the Southwest app for my nephew and family of three RT from MSP to SNA. On the return, my niece checked her family in 24hrs in advance with no issue. Upon arriving at the airport two hours ahead of their flight. When they went to check there bags they were told their flight had been changed from 10:50 to 7:00 and they missed their flight. My niece showed the agent her electronic boarding passes and the agent told her that the notice was sent to Southwest vacation and they were responsible for notifying the family not Southwest Airlines (are you kidding me)! The agent then informed my niece she had been rebooked on a flight6 hrs later. She asked if they would rebook her on the last flight of the day, which was wide open, as this would allow her family (two small children)?to return to our home and wait for the new flight. A supervisor then came out and said they would not move them, and that she was already doing them a favor not making them fly stand-by. She also told them If they wanted the late flight they would have to buy new tickets. I arrived at the counter meet the supervisor and she made these exact statements to me as well and added “it our company policy and I have already gone out of the way confirming them. My wife and I fly at least once or twice a month Southwest was always a airlines we would recommend but with this experience never again!!!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Disappointed,"So l flew from Atlanta Ga to San Antonio,had my two boys 3 years and 18 months,an hour after we took off one of the hostess asked me if l had paid for my son to sit on that seat,and i did not get it how l was going to get in a plane with two kids and not pay for the seat and my son is 3 years,l found it very disturbing and it was an hour after taking off,,i was sad and embarrassed and disappointed about this approach.."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,How a bad experience,"All excited I try to buy my ticket for the next Weekend and visit my family through the app. I have everything ready and I make the payment by Apple Pay which was made satisfactorily.  then I realize that my ticket was never generated.  I call the Southwest representative tells me that a confirmation of my ticket was never made and that I should call the bank to cancel the transaction, I call the bank and they tell me that they cannot cancel the transaction because southwest is still processing money and my payment and that  this may take 5 business days.  This whole process took me about 1 hour on the phone.  now thanks to Southwest I don't have a Ticket and the money!  Well done southwest."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,In love with this airline,"I love my experience with Southwest , first time and I was very happy, awesome customer service , also I left my wallet in the plane , I filed a complaint, within hours I got a respond and they found my wallet . Send it i me overnight. Thank you to the staff"
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Garbage,"I frequently fly for business and personal travel. Southwest is garbage; seating is terrible and frequently late. If you have an option for another carrier, TAKE IT!"
Date of travel: May 2021,30,Las Vegas hub is rude,"Let me say the Full Service check-in desk was fabulous. The gate agents are awful. We arrived at gate; gate door still open. Agent looks at pass and says ""stand against the wall"". What? Is this prison? No explanation why we had to stand there.  The desk agent finally came over and explained. She was nice and helpful.  Agent at next gate, I asked if I needed a new boarding pass. Her response ""Why would you think you need one?""  Out of 5 interactions, two were pleasant; three rude. No internet unless you pay for it. No plug in for chargers. They offer 4 beverages and you order by number.  1) coke 2) diet coke 3) 7 Up and 4) water.  Might be less expensive but I would rather pay a little more for service."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Shout out to South West,I lost one of my AirPods early in the flight! Me and the nice passengers behind and beside me helped me search frantically but we couldn’t find it. The whole airline crew helped me search after everyone left and found it for me. I appreciate y’all thank you!!
Date of travel: March 2021,40,"Very good, definitely recommended","SFO to LAS, quick and easy. Been flying Southwest Airlines for years. No delays when departing San Francisco and boarding was quick. The seats were social distanced and masks were required, which is good knowing that Southwest Airlines are taking precautions against COVID-19. Flight was smooth, service was very good, and flight attendants were very approachable. Landing in Las Vegas was no problem. I recommended Southwest Airlines to family and friends, they were satisfied as well."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,1st time riding through Southwest,Terrible experience!! Straight to the point:•Flight was delayed 4hrs.•Airport staff didn’t know what was going on.•Our gate number literally changed 4 times.•Their was no seat available for me but an off duty Pilot offered up his seat.Spirit isn’t my favorite and I was expecting better from Southwest but I don’t see a future with Southwest after my first experience with them. Very disappointing.
Date of travel: May 2021,30,Chaotic Boarding,"Check in was quick and easy. The boarding for this flight was not the usual orderly procedure. The agent announced that A, B and C would board so everyone jammed into the small area. There was no social distancing. The  agent only used a sign for  A 1-15 then shouted out numbers that few could hear. We then boarded a full bus to the plane. No social distancing here. At least the agent here used signs to allow passengers to board numerically. The flight was full and beverage service is limited to four choices. Not the usual Southwest experience."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible customer service ,"Easy 1 star, was shocked by the terrible customer service, gate agent was extremely rude while we were stuck in Dallas for a weather delay, after being delayed 5 hours he announced the wrong destination city (the destination we were going) and instead of apologizing got defensive about there being ""10,000 other customers also stranded"". Had high hopes for Southwest as an alternate airline but I will be sticking to the big 3 airlines in the future."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,"Once the best, now among the worst","Southwest Airlines used to offer the best customer service of any airline; now they offer the worst. I have flown Southwest for over 10 years, and I had never had a single reservation changed, until now. Since December 2020 I have flown 3 times with my family, and each time Southwest has changed our reservations out from under us, sometimes more than once, and each time the change was for far worse flights than my original booking. They hide behind their voice system and no longer offer callbacks instead of waiting on the phone.I go to the trouble of booking my flights way in advance so I get the most convenient flights for the best price. Now that is a waste of time because the damn airline moves us 3 hours earlier or adds on a 3 hour layover, turning a 6 hour trip into a nearly 10 hour ordeal. Every time they change our reservations we have to rebook airport parking and airport limo reservations. And now it's happening ON EVERY TRIP.And they blame it all on covid, as if that's an excuse. That is such a lie. They just don't care about their customers anymore. It used to be that the flight attendants on Southwest were cheery, fun, and really loved their jobs. Now they are all nasty and bitchy. Listen sweetheart, if you don't like your job anymore then go work someplace else; I am not responsible for your problems.The only good thing left of the old Southwest is their prices, but even those are going up. I am now doing something I thought I'd never do: I'm shopping other airlines. And at the rate Southwest is declining, it won't be long before I kiss this airline goodbye."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Bait and Switch Non Stop Changed to Layover! Twice in a year,"Waited until Southwest opened booking for flights to Salt Lake from Tampa on April 1st, jumped on it the same day and had a non-stop flight for my wife and I that put us in Salt Lake at 11:45 AM. This would give us plenty of time for our 4 hour drive to a remote location in Idaho. Within 3 weeks of booking, we are switched to a connecting flight in Nashville and not arriving in Salt Lake until the evening!! Tried calling SW and there was a 120 minute hold time. So I rebooked a much better flight connecting in Austin and putting us in Salt Lake at 1:50 PM. Just a few days later, they change our return flight. We were supposed to get back to Tampa by 4:40 PM, now it is 8:35 PM. This is total BS Southwest. How can you open bookings only to cancel your non-stop within 3 weeks for a flight in August? There is no way there was enough time for you to figure out the flight may not be financially viable for you to continue it. Southwest did the same thing to me last year on a flight to the midwest. Booked non-stop and they cancelled and rebooked us on a connecting, when they had created a new non-stop leaving only a few hours later. Why not just put us on the new non-stop? I had to call and get it switched. Used to be a good airline..................."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,"Flight kept changing, booked a flight that was not refundable.  Their major chgs should make this refundable!!!","My trip was scheduled for June, 2021, but that is not an option in the list below.I have been a Southwest fan for years.  They used to be really great.  In the past couple years not so much.  In Nov I had a flight booked for Hawaii.  My sister in texas and Colorado also booked with SW Airlines so we could fly together.  Then I got a notification the my cancelation had been completed.  In calling them, they canceled my flight, I had not.  I had to book with another airline quickly and both sisters also changed their flight.I booked a flight to Norfolk before, my grandson and I were meeting at the layover from Phoenix and Albuquerque, they changed my flight to a different day!Now the one that has tipped me over the edge.  I booked my flight very early to make sure I could be at my granddaughters graduation.  I have received notifications of flight changes.  The layover is in another state, my travel time went from reasonable to a full day of travel.  I canceled this flight because I cannot do an over 3 hour layover right after I take off from here.  I cannot get my money back because my tickets are nonrefundable.  I would accept that but believe an exception should be made when the cancelation is due to THEIR changes.  I am very frustrated!!!  Also, if you don't use your travel funds within a specific amount of time they will keep your money and you have no options to get it back!!!I now believe you should never book in advance with SW at least.  I don't know how other airlines handle it, because I was one of their biggest fans before all these issues."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Staff Treated Adult Passengers Like Children. Tacky, Insulting, and way out of line.","I recently flew Southwest Flight 673 from Chicago to Phoenix.  My flight from Phoenix to Chicago was great. Professional,  fun, and easy.On the other hand, my return flight was a nightmare. Apprarently the ""Denver Crew"" didn't get the memo to operate in a consistent way with every other Southwest crew. To say that the ""male"" flight attendant was a jerk would be a colossal understatement. Not only was my mask on and over my nose, it was worn the same as every passenger around me. Well, that wasn't good enough I guess.  He wanted my mask ""higher"" up on my nose and acted like an appointed dictator about it. I did as he asked but he still grabbed another flight attendant to come over and ""threaten"" me to be removed from the flight if I didn't ""comply"". Get lost already with this crap, and not even a day later, the mask mandate is lifted. Congrats Southwest,  you gave mediocre talent attendants absolute power and authority over your ""paying"" flyers. Everyone around me on this flight was disgusted at this mans behavior. Flight 673... only male flight attendant..... Denver Crew. Get rid of this self righteous detriment to your organization.  I have flown with you for years and paid morw money to do this particular flight than I would have with American Air. That was a mistake.  Train your people to stand down. Perhaps ask of someone has a medical condition or anxiety that may require them to pull down their masks periodically.  And also, get your people out of our faces when we are eating or drinking.  The level of disrespect was unreal. I am getting angry just thinking about it. Enough Already."

Date of travel: June 2020,10,Non-Transferable Shouldn’t be a Thing,"I always heard their customer service is ""like no other,” & that’s true - just not in a good way. Had to cancel flights last spring due to COVID for my kids & one of their friends (had [lowest fare] flights with both Southwest and Alaska). The friend doesn't ever travel, so will never use the credit. You'd think during a global pandemic (read: beyond anyone's control), they'd allow for a transfer of credit in situations like this (I understand non-refundable, but non-transferable [in general really] is crappy ""customer service""). Not budging. Basically I got ""tough luck on losing your money, but hope you'll fly with us again soon"" from 2 different CSRs (hoping they'd resolve & I wouldn't have to leave a negative review.) Ha, not a chance I'd fly with them again. Alaska? No problem. Credits can be used for anyone. :)"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Boarding Games,Southwest tends to hold seats during check in to later upgrade you for $30 even though you’re not guaranteed a specific seat. You’ll end up in group C even if you checked in exactly on time. Don’t be stupid and pay $30. They just need to change check in.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Southwest Vacations,"I have been booking through what I think might be their travel agency. I can't tell because their service on the web and on the phone is awful. I mean their systems, not their people. They cannot handle transactions smoothly. ""System is down"" is an excuse I get after hours of waiting on them. Does the airline really want this level of service associated with them? They can have the sweetest agents but they can't do all but the simplest things I can do for myself. Why pay for empty service that has no access to the airline travel credits, their credit card machines don't work. 2 hours on the phone and stress non stop. Hard to rate an airline I can't even book."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Simply the worst airline company out there,"The service is inhumane and unfriendly. They wouldn't give a priority boarding to a pregnant woman with 2 little kids, who were pretty miserable standing in a boarding line (there's no assigned seating) for half an hour because of the airline delay.Not only they compress people into their dirty airplanes like garbage in a dumpster truck, where you sit shoulder to shoulder, but their airplanes are late and then they ""marinate"" you inside the plane while it's just stays at the gate for 30 minutes on a 58 minute flight!  If your life and sanity are precious to you - spend a few extra $$ and avoid it at all cost!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Ruined my Vegas trip,"Wow, this company's service has just completely fallen off the map. You guys used to be the best in the industry, now you are by far the worst. I've never left a review like this in my entire life, but I am just appalled by southwest airlines these days. You can say pandemic, staffing shortages, whatever bottom line you guys only care about filling every seat. Your concern is no longer with your customers and wow does it show. You book non-stop flights, then BAM! Your flight is inconveniently changed to multi stops, 12 hours to get to your destination, and oh yeah one of those flights will probably be delayed and then your missing your connections, and oh sorry your stuck. Which is what is happening right now. I'm sitting on a plane in Vegas that was supposed to leave over an hour ago. We are told paperwork is the issue (what the hell does that even mean?) baggage we are told next is the problem. Now there is no way we are going to catch our next flight, and of course conveniently there are no more flights out tonight to our destinations. 2 days of my vacation gone. Am I going to make it to work tomorrow?? Prob not. You guys are awful. 25 years flying with you guys, sang your praises to all my friends and family (who all became avid flyers with you as well at my recommendation) and now, you couldn't offer me enough to continue to fly with you guys. And this is like the 3rd time freaking with these issues in just the past couple months. I'm going back to JetBlue. I'll pay the extra to have assurances that I will get where I need to be, and get what I pay good money for to begin with."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Again, Ripping off Early Bird Check-In Travelers","Booked flight way ahead and always pay for Early Bird Check-in.  Now $20 per person each way. A couple traveling with me purchased Early Bird a couple of days prior to traveling.  Checked in and this happens  1.  my friends got a better boarding number then myself and 2. a group of competitive dancers who just changed their reservations were also ahead of me.  Now lets get to the A and B groups.....A boards first, then Families Board, followed by B  and C groups.  I was in B group (first time EVER) while all families whom did NOT pay for Early Bird check-in boarded before me.  I counted them and if Southwest would have charged the families, the total take would have been around $600.  I contacted Southwest as I fly with them often.  They really do not care about taking my money and giving me a bad boarding position.  Excuses, Excuses, Excuses....... there are other options.  In this case, I did not get what I paid for!!!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,My daughter's funeral,I choose to fly with southwest because of convenience only. Never again! They treated me like crazy and the plane and threatened to remove me because I gave her a thumbs up instead of saying yes. She tried to use her power to have me removed. Smh
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Customer service sucked,"Flight attendance was very rude and somewhat racist. The plane held 175 people and it was only 17 passengers. The flight attendant choose to be a problem starter with the only black person on the plane. On top of such rude customer service, the plan needed a mechanic exactly as we're pulling off. We were asked to unboard after waiting 30 minutes. 30 minutes turned into a hour, 1 hour turned into 2 hours, 2 hours turned into 3. Oh by the way they just spray wipe the seats, all the paper and food remains on the floor."
Date of travel: May 2021,30,You get what you pay for,So I decided to try Southwest because i was in need of a quick cheap flight to see grandson play ball. I’m an AA regular. Pros: I like the seating arrangement. It works. I think I got off the planes a little quicker. Cheap. Friendly service.Cons: The 700s have narrow seats. Many late arrival/departures. Overcrowded/run down airport bases. Legroom appears less than other airlines (even though they use same 737-700s. No explanation of why there are departure delays (2+ hours)
Date of travel: May 2021,30,Flight from hell,"Arrived in Baltimore for connection without incident.  Flight to Atlanta delayed due to storms in Atlanta.  Delayed two hours.  Finally get on plane and sit on tarmac for another hour.  Take off and flying over North Carolina, pilot turns the plane.  Come to find out there was a medical emergency.  Landed in Charlotte.  Another two hour delay.  Finally take off for Atlanta.  Landing in Atlanta, no gate available.  Sit on tarmac again.  Total time from Baltimore to Atlanta - 9 HOURS!!! Could have been a better flight if we had stayed in Baltimore until the weather in Atlanta cleared.  Absolutely no reason to board.   Although they let us off the plane in Charlotte, people were starving as it was supper time.  There was only one place to buy some wrapped sandwiches and candy.  Complete lack of organization by Southwest.  Arriving home at BDL, my luggage never arrived.  Luggage still in BWI with someone else's name on baggage claim.  SW says they will deliver to my home when it arrives.  Due to weekend and holiday, won't arrive until Tuesday!!!!  Not acceptable.  Go back to airport, pick up luggage.  Compensation not sufficient.  Ticketing agent ups the compensation but fills the voucher out with someone else's name.  Left airport not realizing.  Had to go back to ticketing agent and get name corrected."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,A nightmare experience dealing with SW,"I have had an amazing bad experience with SW.  I had booked direct round trip flights to DEN from DET.I should note that when calling their help line many times I got the message that the wait time to talk to someone was 120+ minutes.  This was not something that I have time to do.They changed their flight schedule many times and booked flights that were unacceptable to me.  ****They even cancelled my direct return flight and scheduled the return to Nashville.  ****  No flight from Nashville to DET was booked. **** And when I sent a message to their complaint department, I got the automated message to call the 120+ minute line.  I had many flight changes, many automated responses to my questions.  What a complete disaster booking with SW has been for me."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Mass confusion ,Our plane was 1 hour late but wasn’t notified until 2 hours before so sat in airport for extra time. I ask the man at gate 20 B why it was going to be late he said no clue. The fight was coming out of Oakland. We paid extra to receive a better number in the group loading. We were A40 and 41  no complaint there my issue was as many as 15 wheelchairs got to board first I understand if your handicap but you could tell people were taking advantage of the policy. The flight attendant should have thought something was going on. The policy claim one person is allowed to go with the person in the wheelchair not the whole party. People with C boarding was loading before people in A group. The gate attendant didn’t care so why pay the extra fee if it don’t matter. The woman in front of us on the plane was one in a wheelchair when we landed in Chicago she got up and exit the plane with no wheelchair had no problems grabbing her suitcases and exiting the airport. Only 3 people actually needed wheelchairs when we landed. Amazing the other 12 people were able to walk without any help.
Date of travel: May 2021,30,Could've waited/ communicated,"Took off an hour late from Portland Maine due to maintenance and arrived at our terminal 5 min late at Baltimore for our connecting flight.  WHY couldn't they wait... they knew we were coming and that it wasn'tour fault. Customer rep says ""nobody told me there was anyone else coming"" and walked away. They should have known, they should have waited. Next flight is 6 hours later and we'll get there at midnight. Sure, they gave us $400 voucher but that doesn't solve the problem for next time... it just costs the airline $400 and it'll happen again. What a foolish world in which we live..."
Date of travel: April 2021,40,Above average seat and space,Southwest harps on mask wearing. Fortunately they are not total Nazi about it. The seats and seating space are larger than economy of the US majors. Getting to check two bags is nice. With new flights from the Springs I will be flying them much more.
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Little quick DC trip,"Always fun and friendly.  Remember, and they say this all the time, there are NO reserved seats on SWA. :)SWA keep your prices low and we’ll keep tracking you!:). Thank you!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible airlines,Used to love Southwest but they lost my business. Terrible customer service especially during Covid-19. Customer service main focus is that masks don’t slip off someone’s face!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Done with Southwest Airlines,"I had to cancel flights to visit Disney World in Florida in March 2020 due to the start of the Covid Pandemic.  I was given a credit to use towards my future flights.  I booked a flight the summer of 2020 for December 2020 to spend Christmas with my in-laws in Chicago.   I am an ER nurse and due to extremely high covid numbers in the area we cancelled.  Again we were given a credit to use for a future flight.  Now that we and my in-laws are vaccinated, I attempted to use the credit from the cancelled tickets today in order to book a trip to finally see my husbands family this summer July 2021.  Southwest basically told us too bad.  They are making us eat over $950.  So angry.  We have been flying Southwest and only Southwest since 2008 and fly 2-3 times a year with a family of 4.  Never again...  Glad to know how they feel about loyal customers."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,From First to Worst,"Southwest has gone from an inviting, friendly airline to the absolute worst since COVID.  Packed airplanes with attendants focused ONLY on strict mask compliance make it one of the single worst experiences out there for the business traveler.  As a 10+ year companion pass holder I will be moving my business elsewhere...would give a 0 out of 5 if the app would let me...."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,TRUE DESERVED  SCORE IS 0,I know you guys as a business do not really care. But just thought i would let you know i cancelled my wife's flight that she had scheduled with you guys after your terrible service you provided the lady with her 2 year old kid and her mask. My wife was going to fly with you guys but not anymore and i know i can not receive my money but i would rather just let you guys keep that money then to ever let my wife fly on your airline. How about you train your employees to show respect for others as a human race. keep my money you guys are a joke!!!!!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Early bird check-in is a scam!,"I purchased early bird check in and got to my gate and they would not honor it. They said they couldn’t find it in their system and to call customer service (which has a 2 hour wait) and they couldn’t help me. They assured me that I would get my $15 refunded. Obviously for that small amount, it’s not about the money. The problem lies in the fact that you’re led to believe you can board earlier and their system is so slow and backed up that they can’t find the reservations timely. Overall we had a terrible experience after our initial flight was cancelled and we were rebooked on a later one, making us waste a whole evening and then forced to be the last ones to board. Southwest is definitely not worth it!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Not interested in business traveler,Wifi doesn't work for the 8th flight in a row - very slow and unusable.    If a business traveler recommend going to another airline.   TV words for the leisure traveler not interesting in wifi or doing work.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Lost money due to travel restrictions & Southwest isn't going to even try to make this right!,"Short version of the story.. I work in healthcare I worked through the entirety of Covid so far & continue to do so. Back in Sept not knowing when things may look somewhat normal again & having restrictions from my work on travel, I had to cancel flights to visit family in Florida. I was given 1yr from purchase date to use, this which would be into June of 2021. Fast forward to today. Travel restrictions are better although unnecessary travel is not recommended. I went to book a flight into Fall as by then my clinic may get a little slower considering the last year only emergent cases & must see patients were seen at the hospital I work at. these past couple months have been so busy I cant take time off anytime soon.  I call Southwest to book a fall trip & I am told I have to travel by 6/2 in order to get my money I have already paid & had to cancel from a Covid related cancellation. My problem here is I am strapped like many with cash even though I worked entirely through Covid it would be a blessing to catch a break. My understanding was 1yr from the date of purchase to purchase the next ticket., not that it has to be used within the year. Maybe I messed up, maybe I am to blame fully & I understand why there are rules but when life is spun outta control for everyone & now the pieces are starting to be put back together it hurts to get slapped back down with my own money....Under regular circumstances I would understand.. I just wanna catch a break please.... I used to fly Southwest twice a year I now will not, my word I will NOT.. which is unfortunate but its best for my soul. You've let me  down southwest.."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Change my travel reservations without consulting me,"I have flow with Southwest for years. Over the last few years, it seems like they have forgotten what made them a great little airline - GOOD CUSTOMER SERVCIE! Yesterday I booked a flight and I need the itinerary to meet a specific time criteria due to the location of the Albany NY Airport and where I'm staying in Vermont. After I booked the light and paid the fees, SW very quietly over night change the itinerary booking me on  flight an hour earlier than I wanted to leave and putting me on a flight that get's me home 4 hours later than my original schedule. If I wanted to fly 1000 miles out of the way and spend five additional hours of ""my time""  sitting on a plane or an airport, I would have booked my flight that way. REALLY! Southwest is acting more and more like American airlines or Delta than the Southwest I use to love flying with. I tried calling the 800 number provided and I was told the wait time was 91 minutes. Again what kind of customer service is that? This is bait and switch tactics and must be illegal."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,booking,"The absolute worst airline I have ever dealt with, and I haven't even gotten on the flight yet. First the wait time is absolutely ridiculous anywhere from 50 minutes to 373 minutes depending upon when you call, and you will wait every minutes that the automated systems tells you plus more.  I  Need to cut my vacation short by a day, and they want to charge $1145.00 to have one less day at an all inclusive, and change the flight to a day earlier, checked with United and I can fly home for $632+bags total $692. If i want to go really cheap I can fly home with frontier for  $380+bags.  Seriously Southwest what a rip off, I'll catch a flight home with another airline and eat the lost flight and lost day at the hotel.  NEVER booking with Southwest again.  Lesson learned."
Date of travel: April 2021,40,"Good Trip, Good Safety Precautions",Appreciated the flight attendants and gate personnel attention to passengers wearing masks correctly. There was a slight delay on second flight to destination and they kept us informed and made up half the delay time. Easy trip
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible Experience,"Avoid this airline.  I selected direct flights and paid more for that.  Three days later, they changed my schedule and added layovers.  I am trying to call them now and have been on hold for THREE HOURS and still waiting.  Unbelievable.  Avoid this airline."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible experience. Terrible customer service!,I used to luv SWA but just had an awful experience that forced me to spend 6 hours on hold only to be told they couldn’t help me. Worst customer service experience ever!
Date of travel: May 2021,20,I am sick and tired of changed flights!   It has become a bait and switch company!,Over the last couple of years I have booked around 20 flights with SW Air and before that plenty more.  But what has changed my view of this great airline is their ridiculous  amount of times they have changed my flights from non-stop to layover flights.  It has become a very frustrating experience to book a flight to arrive somewhere in 3 hours and have it changed to a 7 hour flight experience.  I understand change in schedules but they are at the point they appear to be deliberately showing non-stop flights to get customers and then switching.  I will be looking at Jet Blue and other airlines that I have ignored in the past so that I can believe that when I book a flight it will stay the same.  I had two flights changed in the last 24 hours that went from non-stop to a layover flight adding multiple hours to my travel day.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible service,"Terrible customer service. Beware military, they will treat you like garbage every time. You cannot board early, which is a nice privilege with being military, but they took that away and you can only board early if you are in uniform (helpful hint: military are discouraged from traveling in uniform so we do not get KILLED). Never flying southwest ever again, would rather be treated like a valued customer by another airline"
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Great Mainland-Hawaii and Inter-Island Travel Experience,"Southwest is a welcome addition to both the Mainland-Hawaii and Inter-Island markets. Two free checked bags, plenty of legroom, and friendly, efficient service make Southwest one of the top options for flying to and within Hawaii. Frequencies of Inter-Island flights could be better, but Southwest has plenty of seats and although most flights are full they're not too packed. Also, compared to most other airlines in Economy class, the legroom is very good."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,No accountability   - covid destroyed customer service.,They cut every corner imaginable now. No reimbursements for missed connecting flights. Totally unorganized. Delay delay and delay.They bait and switch every thing. Pay up for a better airline than garbage like Southwest. The companies need to go bankrupt or consolidate.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Flight debacle,"First I have flown southwest many times . Although since COVID I feel the level of service has spiraled downward. First my flight I booked months ago that got me in at 10:30 am was cancelled and rebooked to a flight that got me in at 2pm - of a 3 day trip !  My flight home was set to leave at 3:25 pm , they boarded everyone and then we sat for 2 hours with not much more than a we are waiting on paperwork . Finally after people are getting antsy they allowed people to get off , but still no idea if or when we would take off . Meanwhile the flight crew is eating asnd acting like no big  deal. At 4:45 they decide to deplane everyone . I went and asked are we getting a new plane or getting back on this one ? I was told - no idea at this point . Finally at 5:20 they make us all reboard . And we finally leave . I wrote and email telling them I was disappointed in lack of communication and basically was responded by them saying these things happen and we have no control - this is true to a certain point but the fact you think peoples time means nothing is a problem and they always say at the end of a flight we know you have many options when flying thank you for choosing southwest - we they are right we have other options and if you want to do something about the way that scenario was handled - I find that unprofessional and ridiculous. People having to haul everything off then back on - it was a fiasco. But the flight crew during that 2 hours of sitting there could eat and drink water - while the rest of us just sat not knowing if we were even going to fly out that night . Not impressed - southwest definitely dropped the ball on this one !"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible Experience,"Booked non stop flights, they later changed to 1stop flights with long layovers, and made us wait 2 hrs on the phone to update to one that actually worked.  We had to wait because the website would only let us change one of the flights, not both of them to the same flight."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,SOUTHWEST CHANGING NON STOP PAID FLIGTS TO LAYOVER NO REIMBURSEMENTS.,Very unhappy customer here! Our large family has planned our first trip to Disney July 2021. Southwest is going crazy changing everyone's flights. Our Family paid for ! A nonstop flight now have an entire plan transfer layover. They have to do with 5 little ones! Our Return flight now has been moved 4 hours later in the day creating various rental as issues. You can't just go around moving everyone's travel plans. For no other reason that getting more people on a flight and then using covid as an excuse. Also no alternative was offered no courtesy credits nothing. If something PAYS for a non stop flight that's what they should get! And if they don't there should be partial cash reimbursements. Not cancel it and get refunded or suck it up.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible service,Pick another airline! Southwest will waste your entire day and ruin your plans more often than not being unreliable. They will also do nothing to compensate you for your trouble except give attitude. Horrible experiences.
Date of travel: May 2021,50,great airline,This is a great airline. We love the no fees for bags.  Our bags did not make it to our destination and they retrieved them and delivered right to our house.  They also keep you will informed of when it would arrive.
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Great Airline.,It was my first  time flying and they made it super easy. One gate attended even sang a song before got on about covid which was really cool. The airline is cheaper then most but don’t let that fool you because it’s better than most. There’s no assigned seating so you can sit where ever after your boarding position. They give you free soda or water and a trail mix sort of snack which taste amazing. I will always fly southwest when ever I can.
Date of travel: April 2021,30,Suggestion for Southwest Airlines,"Southwest Airlines Booking Phone Number +1-888-566-5066.Hello,I love to travel and usually will only use Southwest to get me there.I flew yesterday from Pensacola to St. Louis, via a stop In Nashville .Is was a packed flight from Pensacola, which we all boarded and buckled in. Then an announcement from the captain, a dent was noticed on the right wing. Now ,of course, it's of importance but why board an entire plane of people before knowing wether the plane was going to fly? So we exit that plane wait for another plane to be prepared. Probably half the passengers had connecting flights, making it a worry for all if we could make the connections. About 20 minutes later we boarded another plane. The Captain announces all but 2 connecting flights will be held for us. Fantastic! We exit the plane as an announcement over load airport communication that our flight to St. Louis is waiting for us, all passengers have boarded, and that is the last announcements and the doors will be closing! Two 67 year old women start walk, jogging to the best of our ability to an entirely different concourse, the last gate in the D concourse with our 2 carry ones. I have had 4 back surgeries and most recently surgery on my right foot.My idea to you is, couldn't you have had a golf cart waiting for all the passengers that have connections waiting for them that were a mile away?I'm a fit individual despite of my back disease but knowing I was holding up an entire full plane of people( probably worried now of their connecting flights) I was moving myself in ways carrying weighted bags that has me in bed today. I'm calling my surgeon to see if I blew out more discs because I should never do what I had to do yesterday.  It was very kind to hold the flight but please have someone realizing your passengers have to try to make an unrealistic attempt to make a connecting flight a mile away.Please give consideration to my idea, in the future, for it could have been a couple of 80 year olds, or a more disabled individual than myself.Thank you ,Stephanie Massie"
Date of travel: May 2020,30,Bait-n-Switch,"Been flying SW for over 20+ years. Have found recently that they are doing a ""bait-n-switch"". Booked desired (minimal flight time, direct route), economy flights well in advance of travel. Near travel date, SW canceled our economy seats and  rebooked us on other out-of-way, double the flight time flights (economy). I can keep my original flights IF I re-book them at the expensive BUSINESS class. Appears SW is ""bumping"" people before we even get to the gate to make more expensive seats available. This IS NOT overbooking, but bait-n'switch!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Hotel booking through SW nightmare,"I booked a room using sw hotels and found a suite at the flamingo in Las Vegas at an incredible rate. It was too good to be true. Despite calling both SWhotels and the hotel itself to confirm that reservation (which both did) as I attempted to check in today, my reservation was cancelled by SW earlier in the week! No notice to me!! Luckily, the very nice gentleman at hotel registration was able to find a room to accommodate my friends and I for the long weekend, but it’s not a suite (they’re all booked) and we actually now have a room with bunk beds. I don’t know weather to laugh or cry. SW was not helpful at all as to why this happened. At least they’re refunding me my money. I’ll never book a hotel through them again."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Mr,My luggage was damaged the beginning of March.  I still haven't been reimbursed.  I was offered snack mix and a cup of water on my Memphis to Houston flight.  This is like the megabus of the sky.  No assigned seating.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Baggage is just slow as possible ,"Slow as molasses with the luggage coming off the plane, just terrible what are the baggage people doing sleeping, on break, etc."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Nonstop flights now include layovers,"I booked a roundtrip, nonstop flight from DCA to MSY; however, Southwest later modified the flights and added layovers on both legs of the trip. When I contacted customer service, the agent was kind and genuinely tried to help, but could do nothing except offer me a full refund. I expected that customer service would at least offer me a coupon or a discount, but all I received was an apology for the inconvenience. I've never had this happen before with Southwest, but I will definitely think twice before booking with them again."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Fly Southwest,When we fly we usually choose Southwest airlines!  They fly to most of the locations we vacation at and in most cases are on time.  Connection flights could be hard but overall they do a good job.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Customer,Two male attendants were more interested in talking rather than assisting ANYONE!They were extremely rude and very sarcastic when giving instructions on mask use!Duh...we get it!  No need to bully customers!I fell asleep half way through flight and one male jackass flight attendant shook me and said fix my mask...it had slid to the tip of my nose!Can't you find decent respectful employees SW!
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Disappointed,I flew Southwest 2 or 3 times a month during Covid last year and to date this year.I was understanding when they made changes and they were accommodating as well to get me on a plane.This time they changed my direct flight out of Memphis where I fly in early and fly back out the same day to adding lay overs that will not make it work for my meetings I have set up. I can fly direct out of Nashville and they have made the changes in past multiple times last year and even last week when I flew with no additional fees. Now since the flights are filling back up they want to charge $350 to make the changes. You would think they would take care of their loyal A List Preferred customers.I guess I'll be looking at other carriers in the future to do my business with.
Date of travel: April 2021,30,"Missing perks of other airlines, everything requires a charge","First, our flights were changed, so we ended up adding a day to the end of our vacation to make up for the lost day. The boarding chaos hasn’t changed in years, it’s outdated. Other airlines have you pick a seat when you book. Southwest gives you a boarding position. Of course, you can pay more to upgrade your position. In-flight WiFi is advertised at $8. It’s free on other airlines. There are no screens for watching tv or movies like on other airlines. The staff are fantastic though. However, I will just use another airline next time & save me the hassle & money."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Horrible,"Booked a flight leaving at 11:50, SW changed flight to leave at 4:50. Dropped off dogs at pet resort then got a text leaving at 8:50pm. Not 10 min later got text flight cancelled and rebooked 2 days later! Hotel is nonrefundable.  And plans totally disrupted. No explanation   no compensation. Unbelievable. I'm so disappointed in SW airlines! Time to start looking into other airlines."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Missed my connecting flight due to Southwest's incompetence!,"Flying to Baltimore from Orlando, we were supposed to board the flight at 10:30am to fly out at 11am. We didn't even board the plane until after 11am, when we asked what the hold up was the gate crew informed up that the people who were supposed to clean the plane in between flights didn't show up. When we finally boarded the crew told us that connecting flight should still be fine, it was not until I got off the plane I was made aware I would now have a 6 & 1/2 hour layover because my connecting flight had already left. I was supposed to be home by 3pm and didn't make it home until 11pm, because of this I had to rearrange childcare and pay more money to board my pet for another day. So I should pay more money because Southwest doesn't have their sh*t together? Finally ending this review with how rude the Southwest employees were at Baltimore airport, they acted like if was an inconvenience that 25 people missed their connecting flight, when it was all Southwest's fault. Do not fly Southwest, pay the extra money to actually get where you need to be on time and to deal with an airline that is competent."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"Southwest  Vacations TERRIBLE, Southwest Airlines GREAT","They are two COMPLETELY different companies. Southwest Airlines is great. Southwest Vacations are TERRIBLE! They will make it VERY difficult to use your credit to rebook trips. The customer service people are mostly incompetent and unknowledgeable. I would hope such employees would give information and advice based on fact, but they did not. They stole hours of my life that I will never get back and added major unnecessary stress by simply being incompetent and unknowledgeable."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Absolutely stay AWAY FROM THIS AIRLINE!!!,"Long story short, booked out flight then they changed it to two stops, then the delayed our flight an hour and have us 5 minutes to run from one end of Baltimore airport to the other. Dumb lady said “you need to put your mask on” I was like I don’t Fin care about my mask rn. Keep in mind, this was the LAST flight of the night. This was southwest fault 1000%! So she slammed the door like a child and said “you’re not gunna cus at me” I’m like it wasn’t even to you!! Your company caused this.  And she had a little attitude and called her supervisor?! He almost didn’t let us on. I was like okay, I’m sorry but this was south west fault.. Trash. Stay away from Southwest. They don’t give a crap about you and will change your flight numerous time’s and blame it on you. EMBARRASSED US INFRONT OF THE WHOLE FLIGHT caused a delay because they screwed us over. STAY AWAY FROM SOUTH WEST!!"
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Happy to Fly with Southwest Again,"This review is a lot late, but my first return to business travel was in Nov 2020. Aside from the mask, there was the same considerable hospitality that is synonymous with Southwest. Unfortunately, at the time my business travel did not normalize, but if it had, I would have continued to use Southwest."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Southwest Stays Consistent,"Second business trip in the past year. Looks like my travel schedule will start to increase to a normal level in the near future. So pleased that Southwest continues to provide consistently, friendly and efficient air travel. I’m happy I’ll be seeing them more often, again, to enjoy their hospitality."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,"You Sucks - flight attendents, free pass to be jerks","SWA flight attendants are just mean.  It's like COVID gave them a pass to be mean.  I have seen them be mean to old people needing help, young people struggling with masks and just down right rude to the rest of. us  I used to LOVE SWA and I fly often, but if I have to look elsewhere screw the points program, I will pay more at this point.  Right now it's not worth the awful feeling they give while flying with them.  Shame on your Southwest.  I am so angry by the time I get off your plane I have to chill so I am not RUDE like your attendants.  I have asked all my fiends who travel and they feel the same so I figured it was time to say something."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Southwest Customer Service Line,"I had an issue with an upcoming flight and could not figure out how to do it online, so I had to call in the customer service.  I was ""greeted"" by Shundalynn who has to be the rudest, and cockiest employee at Southwest.  If these are the types of employees this company hires, I'd look else where to get your plane tickets.  Her manager, Ophelia, was not much better.  I have flown Southwest numerous times as well as other airlines.  I will take all future business to Delta though.  They treat customers excellent every time.  It's worth the few extra dollars to be treated better.  Southwest should really work on their customer service skills if they don't want to lose their client base and be an airline out of business."
Date of travel: April 2021,30,Rethink the seats please,"I know Southwest prides itself on low cost travel, but the service has gone downhill the last few years.  If you want people to line up in order prior to boarding, then enforce it.  People cut in line and then get first preference of the seats on board.  WHAT?!?   I’m tired of playing by the rules and then getting told “oh well” when others don’t.  No power chargers on the flight too...again some small little things that make a huge difference."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Whatever this company had is GONE,"Staff is consistently rude, pissed off about everything. Three separate flights, experienced a rude staff each time. Also don’t like their seating policy, but they used to be friendly enough to make up for it. At this point this airline is literally a case study in how not to do business."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Mask rule not enforced just threatened,"Gentleman in the row behind me refused to wear a mask.  He had one with a vent and the Flight Attendant gave him a real one and he refused to wear it.  Kept taking it off as soon as the FA passed by.  She warned him 3 or 4 time and he still wouldn't keep it on and just ignored her.  She said she would have the officials waiting for him at the gate when we landed.   No officials, the guy just walked off like the rest of us.   Why wear a mask if the rules aren't enforced.  Soon this information will get around and then there will be non-maskers all over the plane"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,HORRIBLE!!!,Flight attendants on a power trip & delayed our flight for ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD REASON. WILL NEVER FLY SOUTHWEST AGAIN!!I would give you a negative score if I could. BY FAR
Date of travel: October 2020,10,worst customer services ever,I am on hold for over 60 minutes worst customer service ever. I want to book a flight using an old flight cancelled by covid. How do you get customer service with Southwest I will never use this airline again
Date of travel: April 2021,10,They don’t accommodate special needs,"Hi, my name is Kathleen Alluin.  I have a son with special needs, his name is Dominick.  I was supposed to get married in March of 2020 one week after the shutdown so of course we needed to cancel.  Never in our wildest dreams did we think we would have to cancel our wedding once let alone twice due to traveling still not being safe for Dominick.  With vaccinations and places beginning to accommodate children with special needs I was hoping to take my boys to California to go the the beach and Disney land in September for Dominicks 4th birthday.  It would also be his first birthday he would get to celebrate with my family since I am from California.  When I called to receive a  one month extension on his travel credits it was really surprising to me that they said no. Usually I do try to be understanding but I guess I am tired of people telling my son no which we have heard a lot of during this pandemic.  I guess it just surprises me that there are zero accommodations being made for people with disabilities.  In March Southwest made a form available to people with disabilities like my son who has sensory sensitivities which I feel like is a step forward.  But even now the flight credit would only be made available to my son for 4 months, even though at this time I am not so sure I would feel safe traveling with him even now.  Which makes his time period to travel even shorter.  He had a flight credit that was only made available to him in a time period he couldn't use it due to his disability and the representative had to say to me was ""I don't know what to tell you.""  Just like when Disney refused to give any service to my son ""it wasn't personal"".  I am not sure how it's so easy for people to so casually be insensitive to a child who is constantly having to overcome obstacles and how heart wrenching it is for his mother to watch.  And all I asked for was an extension to his flight credits for one month."
n/a,40,Smooth Early Morning Flight,I flew to West Palm Beach on a quick business trip. It was the 6am flight with a quick stopover at BWI. The aircraft was clean and mask protocols were being followed. Flight was at 2/3 capacity. Staff was very polite and professional. Great airline for last minute travel but I prefer Jet Blue.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,GREEDY SOUTHWEST CONCIERGE,"After I booked flights, I used Southwest Concierge service to book a room at the Springhill Suites on Creighton Road, Pensacola, Fl, on April 8, 2021. Southwest charged me $179.68. When I checked out of the hotel the next morning and the clerk printed my receipt, the room actually cost $132.96. Yeah Soutwest OVER CHARGED me $46.72. When I called customer service - that term is an oxymoron in this situation - their explanation was that the clerk never should have shown me the true amount. When I requested a refund, the answer was NO. You know how you thought that if you booked with the airline they would leverage their buying power to your benefit. Not with GREEDY Southwest CONCIERGE. Do not use GREEDY Soutwest Conceirge."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Traveler,"They supposedly save you money, but they cost you time!Then, they cost you money because you sit in an airport and force you to spend stupid amounts of money on average food at the airport.Last time I will ever fly Southwest budget air!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,DO NOT Change your flight when they tell you it is free,DO NOT change your flight if they give you the free option if you have more than one person in your group.  I booked mine so long ago for the spring break week for cheap money. I went to change mine today because I was flying tomorrow so I figured I would look and see if any opened up closer at Providence.  When I checked it showed every flight for the day had anywhere from 8 open seats to 15.  EVERY FLIGHT.  That meant there were over 50 open seats for the day.  So I changed the first one.  The minute I was done I went to change the other all the flights were gone.  Yep gone in 2 minutes.  Every flight.  .  So I went to change it back.  Yep that was gone too.  This business practice is intentional to cause you harm at the expence of their profit.  What do you do now.  Two people flying out of different airports at different times.  You have a $2000 rental.  Both my wife I and our children have Southwest Credit Card Accounts for 5 years..  We will be canceling them and finding a new airline because they intentionally put you in a bad spot.  Goodbye Southwest.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Very rude and unprofessional flight attendants!,"I have been on many flights, I experienced by FAR the rudest and most unprofessional flight staff ever! Look for another airline!"
Date of travel: April 2021,40,Work...and more Work...,"Well. is short flight  but good, there was no problem, all the protocols for COVID  19, the Staff were very nice, and helpful ...."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Unprofessional ,Staff were just very unprofessional.  Sarcastic in the way they interacted over the intercom. Loud and a bit obnoxious
Date of travel: December 2020,30,"Cheap flight, no COVID spacing between passengers","With COVID we were told that we would have a seat between us and another passenger, however they informed us that our flight was fully booked and the plane was full so there wouldn’t be a single extra seat on the entire plane. We had 1 snack bag of southwest mix given to us and the option of water. It was an ok trip, luckily it was short. It’s really hard to fly southwest if you aren’t flying solo and you want to sit next to your friend."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,The worst customer service.,"Yesterday I flew from Las Vegas to Austin. I had a transfer is San Jose as part of my flight back. When I arrived to board my layover flight at 10:20 which, was the boarding time, I was told the doors were already shut and that I’m not getting on, the lady at the gate seemed like she was actually happy that I missed my flight, and she was taking full advantage of the situation to make me feel like bad about it.  So after the discussion with the best southwest employee ever (just a little sarcasm)  I get to deal with the worst employees I’ve ever talked to at southwest. The whole time we were beating around the bush trying to figure out how I get home, there was a short, round guy that kept trying to intimidate me and reminded me over and over again that they were gonna kick me from flying. All this guy kept doing was threatening and trying to intimidate me. It was so uncalled for. It really seemed like they enjoyed that I missed my flight. Probably don’t get much attention, so when they do they make it count!  Seemed to get a big kick out of it. He was definitely trying to get me to over react so he could use his SUPER SOUTHWEST POWER OF AUTHORITY and kick me from flying. I’m not going to sit here and complain about the employees I ran into, cause I could talk awhile. But the employees of Southwest Airlines are so disrespectful. They walk around like they are better than everyone else. The whole mask thing and then yelling at you if it goes below your nose. Get over yourselves. You clock in and out of work like everyone else.  I literally got told my an employee at the gate that I would pay $10000 if I boarded the plane without a mask. Like. What? These employees need to calm down, not be so aggressive and do the job YOU signed up for. You are not a police force, you’re an airline company. Check yourself southwest. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 I will never fly a Southwest Airline plane again. Worse than spirit in my book."
Date of travel: March 2021,40,From the Desert to Paradise,"This was my first trip since having my son so I was a bit nervous already but to fly from NV to Hawaii, it only increased my anxiety.  I thought the flight was quite easy with SWA to Honolulu.  I knew what to expect as far as time, etc. as I used to live there but had never taken SWA (since they are new to fly to HI).  I don't think it's fair to rate an airline low during Covid because they are very limited on service abilities and such.  What I can say is the staff/air team was great! Upbeat, accommodating, and fun.  The flight was smooth yet full.  Not an empty seat on the plane. I would fly to Hawaii with SWA again (though I may bring a seat pad because those seats for 5+ hours was a bit uncomfortable."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Never Ever Again,"This is the worst airline I have ever been on. No assigned seating so it's a complete mess. The attendant at the front is telling everyone to just hurry up and pick a seat. He's telling them to 'call out' those people on the aisle seats that are pretending to be busy because they are not, they just do not want to sit by you. Wow, way to make a terrible flight experience worse. Completely done with this mess that they call an airline."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Horrible and Terrifying,"Horrifying !!! Today was a disaster  and never should have happen. Flight number 827 ... This flight left at 10:10 am from Ft Lauderdale and should have never been allowed to take off.. it was poor judgment on Southwest part to allow this flight to leave. The weather was a major factor... once in the air we were told by the captain that we were going around the some weather and that we would go northeast and loop through the panhandle of Florida to avoid... BUT this did NOT happen .. I have flown well over 50 times in my lifetime and I have never experienced turbulence or extreme conditions like this.. it was so bad people were scared , crying and throwing up.... finally the captain gets back on the speaker and informs us that the flight tower sent us the “wrong way” and that we were heading to Georgia and “was not sure if we had enough fuel to make it so we would need to stop somewhere “ This increased our panic because we were still having major issues with turbulence and the plane... people were praying and trying to check their phones to see where we truly were.. we did finally make it out of the extreme weather as the pilot found his way out of the storm... it was sheer panic for over an hour and 15 minutes on a flight that should have only lasted two hours we were almost an hour late to New Orleans. I do not recommend Southwest at all and I will not be flying at all ever. Thanks to the issues with Southwest and also very scary that the flight tower had no idea where to send us in this type of condition."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Mask Mandate for 2 year old children,"This review only reflects my poor experience on this One flight, it does not reflect how I feel overall, I believe the company is still setting the standard in the aviation industry. However, this was the worst experience I've been through on any flight, and I have flown on, Southwest, American, Alaskan, KLM, Virgin, Delta, Qatar, British air, South African air, ETC.. You get the picture. As a former Delta and United employee, I found myself gravitating to Southwest airlines due mainly to their customer service on-board. For the most part, the flight attendants are warm and welcoming and talk to you like an individual and not a number. However, on 07APR2021 #WN 752 DEN - BOI. My family and I had the worst experience imaginable. So we have all heard of people getting kicked off flights because their 2-year-old would not leave their mask on, Well guess what!! I was welcomed to that small group of parents who travel with their 2-year-old and was demanded to either hold him (as if he has a straight jacket) and keep his mask on or get kicked off the flight. To make matters worse, there was another family who had a child the same age if not older as mine and they (being the main flight attendant) never asked or required both of their children to wear masks. Which is really disappointing because now with her not enforcing it for the whole flight, my wife and I both felt and still feel targeted due to us being an interracial couple with a mixed 2yr old child. Let's be honest, I get the federal laws in place to protect us all, but let's put it into perspective. Can a 2-year-old count to 20? Can they say their complete ABC's? Let alone use the restroom by themselves? The answer to most if not all these questions is NO, so how do you expect every child a day over 2 to perform a simple task like wearing a mask efficiently or even at all? Lastly, if you are going to enforce it, make sure the whole flight is also given the option to force their children to wear their masks or get left halfway to their destination, at least this way no one feels targeted and the rule is consistent across all CUSTOMERS and not certain ethnicities.  #southwestairlines #airsouthwest"
n/a,10,Alcohol,"Why are u using the excuse of less touch points for flight attendance with serving alcohol but I am on a fully loaded elbow to elbow passenger trip. Covid doesn't know the difference between non alcoholic and alcoholic beverages...move on already....sincerely, a pissed off passenger"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Never again,"So in the time of covid, I was put in a full plane (No empty seats at all) and told there is not service of drinks because of covid and social distancing.  I will never fly with this airline again unless I want to then visit the hospital for covid after. Save your life and money by not allowing this disturbing acts by airlines to put money over the lives of there customer's."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Stuck in Dallas with unexpected long layover,"I’m stuck at the Dallas Airport on a 4 hour layover, because Southwest changed my flight without my knowledge. They said they tried to call me, “but the voicemail was full.” Okay, so they subbed a crappy flight FOR THE SAME PRICE/POINTS and I couldn’t check-in to the second leg of my flight until I got to the layover location in Dallas. Now, I will arrive SIX hours later than my initial reservation AND I was placed in C group,  because of my late check in, even though, I’m a Rapid Rewards member and I spend A LOT of money on my Southwest Credit card every year and I tried to check-in 24 hours before the flight. I asked if I could get an A or B group, because of my daughters traveling with me and since it isn’t my fault for the late check in. No one wanted to help me with that, unless I wanted to pay $120 to “upgrade” to A group. Christina at the counter acted like I was lying about not being allowed to check in from my original location, Austin! I have 4 flights scheduled for next month. After that, I will probably NOT use my Southwest card and/or fly with Southwest again."
Date of travel: March 2021,30,"Hey, it's Southwest! Flying bus experience","What I can say that other people did not say, already. It's Southwest! Flying bus to your destination and the crew who tried to be funny and comforting.The only real option you have with them is to check in as soon as it's possible. That gives you option to sit on the place that is the same like all other 170 seats! If they can get Go-go app working, I would be completely happy with them on 1-2 hours flights"
Date of travel: April 2021,20,No mask enforcement,Listened to the 20 minute lecture about wearing a mask and then we get on the plane and a couple in front of us with a small child are sitting in there seat talking with there mask down almost the entire flight. The male was wearing a mask a gator with holes in it which the airlines clearly stated were not permitted. Needless to say this gentleman was never offered a proper mask to wear. Not that he was going to use it any ways.Airlines staff never enforced there own rules on this flight.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Southwest Early Bird purchase/ experience with customer relations,"Purchased tickets to Fort Meyers Florida back in December 2020 purchased early bird check in airlines changed our flight about 3 weeks before our trip. We did not like the flight Southwest chose for us so we took the one time change. We get our assigned boarding 24 hours before leaving and we are in B boarding which means early bird with A boarding, then anyone who needs more time, people with small children then early bird B boarding. If you plan to sit with your family do not pay for early bird check in unless you are guaranteed A boarding! Waste of money. I watched about 30 families with small children who had boarding C, no additional fees get on the plane before my family.Not to mention I bought  my early bird with my tickets in December 2020 right when the dates opened. Which means with COVID and travel restrictions 60 other purchased there tickets before me. I called customer relations to question my boarding assignment and I was told I had a great  position for early boarding. I questioned if my early bird was carried over from my previous flight which Southwest changed and could not get an answer.The customer relations call was another waste of time. I was told my issue was documented. The lady in customer relations needed customer service training. I felt like I was bothering her. She did not care about my issue, the fact my question was not answered but she did tell me she could see I fly with Southwest frequently. Point taken I am just another paying customer! Got it! Bottom line Early Bird not with the $ if you can not be guaranteed you will have A boarding and reaching out to customer relations is not worth your time.Lesson learned you do not always get what you pay."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,"Rules for thee, and not for me?","So, I'm a disabled vet, and my caregiver and I flew to Vegas, and on the flight back, while trying to organize her stuff, my stuff, and my service dog, the flight attendant interrupted me 3 time to put my cane away, before I was even able to sit down. Then, while I was drinking from my soda bottle, she told me numerous times to pull my mask up, even when I had the bottle to my lips. But across the aisle, there was a family that was eating foot long subs, and was never told to put their masks on in between bites. To top it off, I got pictures of her talking on the phone with no mask on, or pulling her mask down and joking with the other flight attendants. Last time I checked, I needed my mask off to eat and drink, but not to talk on the phone, or talk with your friends"
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Southwest is the Best!,"Flew Southwest last week from BNA (Nashville) to PHX (Phoenix). Easy check in and boarding pass done by phone, paperless.  Friendly flight attendants provided us with a small bag of snack mix and a drink on board (Coke, Diet Coke, 7up or water). Snacks and beverages have recently been re-added since Covid.Boarding is done by sections. You can pay extra for a Business ticket to board first. Also families with small children and those with special assistance board ahead of the other passengers after Group A. Then everyone else boards in either group B or C. Once you board you pick a seat. If you are fortunate to get in boarding group A, you can usually get your choice of seat. There are three seats per row, so most fliers want to get either a window seat or an aisle seat and not be stuck in the middle seat. It is worth paying the extra $20 (each way) for the Early Bird check in. You are (almost) guaranteed to board with group A."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Sent sheriff deputies after someone for a 2 year old not wearing mask,Terrible experience.  My 2 year old would not wear a mask. i was not told on the flight that i would be greeted by 4 sheriff deputies to detain myself and my 2 year old.  I was also put on a no fly list.  If you have small children do not fly during covid with southwest.  I had my mask on the entire time along with my 6 year old.  My 2 year old was having a hard time with it.
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Terrible customer service,"I didn't get to take my trip because of Covid-19.  Three days before my flight, the governor of California shut the state down.  Only essential travel within the state, only essential businesses were open.  Ten -fourteen day quarantine if you were coming into the state.  I was going to stay in a hotel, not with family.  I cancelled everything.  My trip was only for 6 days.  I was not vaccinated.  I had converted my Luv voucher once.  When I called to see about using these funds and the cash funds I was told that the voucher could not be converted again so I would lose that  money and the cash if I didn't travel by the 22nd.  Having just been vaccinated and the state just re-opening this isn't reasonable for me. At this point the cash can be converted for $100 which leaves me with $88.76 from my original $467.00.  I was told, that is too bad.  That is our policy.  The rep I spoke with told me you could have still made your trip, we were flying into the state of California even though it was shut down for essential business only.  So, that is your problem.  You could have gone anyway.  I lose all of my money because of Covid because they were still flying and I was unable to go to a state that was shut down.  But they were still flying so that is my problem.  That is terrible customer service."
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Best Domestic Airline!,"I love Southwest! They always have the best prices (with 2 free checked bags), a simple change policy, and the best customer service around! I have flown them almost a half dozen times across the country, and no one compares. I will go out of my way to fly Southwest due to their overall ease and value."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,So Long Southwest,"Have flown with Southwest many times for many years (my wife and I are both Rewards members and actually own stock in Southwest).  We have never had any complaints with any actual flights and have given them high recommendations.  Then came COVID.  We were scheduled to fly out for a vacation, literally, the day lockdowns were imposed in March 2020.  Consequently, flights had to be canceled along with the entire trip.  Tried 2 more times in 2020 to take the same trip.  All, too, had to be canceled for some reason associated with COVID.  As a result of these 3 separate cancelations for flights of different costs, flight funds from the original trip got divided into 3 separate piles.  We were finally able to go on a trip in March 2021 and used part of those funds.  Just two weeks after getting back from that trip, we booked another trip for July 2021 to use another portion of our travel funds; however, they refused to extend that batch enough to allow us to fly in July with the money we had already spent.  Customer Service was absolutely blunt in their refusal and wouldn't even hear us out.  NONE of this mess was our fault and it certainly wasn't our desire to cancel one trip with Southwest, let alone 3!  COVID wasn't Southwest's fault either, but it would have been nice to have a little sympathy and consideration from a company wanting customers to come back after the Pandemic toward loyal customers who were actually trying to come back.  So much for everybody working together to get things running again!  Southwest may have ate my $414; but when we get off the plane from using our last batch of travel funds, the Rewards Cards are getting shredded and we'll never fly Southwest again.  Southwest was our favorite airline, but we're not going to allow them to punish us for something we had no control over.  Apparently, $414 is worth losing 3 customers.  Didn't want to do it, but so long Southwest!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Horrible condescending agent,"I will NEVER use Southwest again! Jill was a complete jerk on the phone. The tone she used was so condescending. She and the lady before (can’t recall her name) were the definition of rude and unhelpful. They both used 9/11 as an excuse as to why they could not bend the “rules” and return my money or allow me to transfer the ticket to an immediate family member. I just had twins and will not be traveling anytime soon. My husband is a service member, fought in Iraq and they use 9/11 to justify their excuse?! I’m appalled Southwest. If you care about customer service, don’t treat people this way. I hope their higher ups listen to the call with Jill on Friday, April 2nd at 6:15pm. I will NEVER fly with you all again."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Disrespectful Employees,"My suitcase’s dimensions were made specifically for it to be a carry-on, and keep in mind i have traveled with this suitcase before. When i was going from the indy airport to orlando, i had no problems with getting my suitcase on the plane. But when it was time to return to indianapolis, the lady at the desk to scan tickets before boarding called me over to get it measured as she thought it was too big. to me, it looked as if it fit the measuring box, but she claimed it didn’t. She had a terrible attitude this whole time and seemed like i had just ruined her whole day.  she then had me go to the customer service desk to get it checked, where the guy there seemed super rude and like he didn’t want to help us. i asked why i was able to get it on the plane at indy but not here. he proceeded to tell me that the employees in indianapolis don’t know how to do their job. he also did that the suitcases are not allowed to be sideways in the overhead bins. I go back to the ticket scanning desk and after i scan my ticket she looks me in the eye and says, “you better go right on down and give your suitcase to the baggage worker before you get on the plane” again, she seemed like i had just ruined her whole day...even one of the flight attendants were rude. She started the flight by telling us that if we don’t follow southwests rules that it would end “extremely ugly” excuse me? what does that mean? I think it’s also important to point out that another persons luggage didn’t fit in the overhead bin so one of the (nice) flight attendants flipped it on its side without thinking, so obviously it wasn’t that big of a deal about with way it has to be turned. Overall was a disappointing experience. It was flight 284 on 4/1/21"
Date of travel: March 2021,20,First Covid trip to Aruba,"While the airline advertises safe flying, it was not assured in person. Saw the flight attendant talking to people with their masks below the nose and not reinforcing their policy even once. The people that sat next to us on the flight didn’t even have their mask on at all and not one word was said. The flight attendants don’t care about people not wearing their masks properly even a bit. They announce at the begging of the flight that you must wear your masks properly, but when it comes down to it I have never seen them enforce the rule on the flight there or the flight back. People behind us didn’t have their masks on the majority time of the flight and were not told even once to put them over their face."
Date of travel: May 2020,50,Great Customer Service,"They have been the easiest airline to work with. I can't wait until they start flying to Costa Rica again - I have a lot of credit with them from 2020. They have a great luggage policy and allow for flexible changes. I don't have to be stressed when I book with them because I know their customer service is so helpful. The boarding is in order of when you checked in and you just choose your seat vs. having your seat chosen for you. It's different but worth it. Great for traveling alone. I would even choose this airline with friends though because of their flexibility, baggage fees, comfort, and customer service."
Date of travel: March 2021,20,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"While Southwest has elevated the air with their services and policies, this is far from apparent in their Phoenix Airport Terminals. The few food establishments are costly even compared to airport food. There is little room, especially to socially distance, and there are no outlets to be found for delayed and weird customers. If you must go through here, bring double masks, a snack and phone chargers if you dare to survive."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,SOUTHWEST IS A JOKE,"I booked a month ago 2 flights and they double charged me. When I called customer service right after I booked she said she seen the mistake and changed my flights when I simply asked for a refund.. TODAY I just got off the phone with southwest because it has been 3 weeks since i asked for the refund, and they're lying saying I only asked for 1 refund when I was charged for two. Anyone with common sense would have chose to refund someone but never again i promise i go through ANY  different corporation this joke of a company. Yall are pathetic. 🤣"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst Airline EVER.,Me and my family will NEVER fly with southwest again. We took a plane from L.A back to Tulsa and they made us switch planes. It took them 3 hours to get us another plane and IM SURE the plane was not properly cleaned. IT WAS FILTHY! The staff was absolutely useless . They couldn't do anything about it. It was 12 when we even got on the plane. Thank you southwest for the worst plane experience.
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Horrible with covid,"Absolutely horrible experience,  I've flown 5 times since covid and you are the absolute worst. Flight was delayed 5 hours, and not once did we see anyone cleaning. There was  no order to calling seats... section A was called but some B and C were allowed through at any time for no special reason other than getting in line before their turn... and I use the word 'line' loosely, more like a cluster stampede. Masks were not enforced, people coughing unmasked. Tray on the back of the seat had sticky juicy all over it and the seat next to me,  trash in pouch... obviously  no cleaning.  We were served open plastic cups that were carried on a tray down the isle that anyone not wearing their mask/ wearing it below their nose were breathing all over.  Unboarding customers from the back were rude, unbuckled before we even stopped and then jumping to the front of the plane, instead of waiting your turn like it's always been. Stewardists should be enforcing order from chaos. Plane was jam packed, no space in-between seats... strangers sitting right next to you taking off their masks to eat and drink.   Keep in mind this also is a plane leaving Miami,  Florida... 3rd highest covid state in the whole US."
Date of travel: March 2021,30,Full plane both arriving and departing ,"Will avoid during spring break at all costs, no seating assignment, overcrowded will definitely look at other airlines in future.  Glad wasn’t traveling with another as wouldn’t likely have been able to sit together."
Date of travel: March 2021,30,This gate was a mess,"I normally like southwest for the convenient scheduling and free bags. Gate B1 at Fort Myers airport was a mess. They didn’t use the numbering system so there was no social distancing whatsoever. Also, my husband is an A lister; he got the very end of the A boarding numbers. He might as well have been in B. Maybe it’s the pandemic, spring break, etc but it was disappointing."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Poor mask compliance,"Flight was packed, horrible mask compliance, and no intervention from flight attendants. Adding insult to injury, they won’t let me extend the deadline on my remains flight credit. Southwest has been trending worse for some time in my opinion. I’ll favor other airlines going forward."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,"female flight attendant shaming passengers, forcing them to DOUBLE mask!","The female flight attendant had huge ATTITUDE, loud and rude, feeling to be GOD and all have to bend over to her. Shaming passengers for any simple issue she could, just picking on them. She was making passengers to wear double masks at her wish(Especially if someone was asking her questions she didnt like to hear, holding ppl on the line for her announcements and looking down at ppl if they were questioning. Mean /rude attitude and body language! She was forcing ppl to  double mask, even someone with an N95 mask!!! How uneducated that it? raising her voice to kick them out if they were not obeying her wishes in front of ppl! Have you felt helpless, harassed, abused by such in a position of power?"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Bad bad bad aircrew,"Description of Problem/Inquiry/Comment:    On march 24th 2021 I was in my first flight  nightmare. As I was requested, I was wearing a  mask the whole flight. The only thing that  happens is because the mask was big on me, it  was sometimes under my nose, and I fix it  immediately when the flight attendant asked me  to. I was at the beginning of the plan, and  somehow I was the only one she was looking  for. My dog was under the seat in his bag, his  head was out because he was barking since he  has anxiety, she was telling me to put is head  in and the other flight attendant said it's  fine because he didn't let people sleep. When we landed, a manger name Julian Sanchez  was waiting for me, telling me she is going to  call the police if I'm not giving her my name,  while the other flight attendant screaming  ""dirty jew"" and lying saying I was treating  her bad, when I never ever reached to her even  once! The flight attendant clearly was racist  to me, lying I refuse to wear a mask, when I  never ever refused to wear a mask, people on  the flight next to me can tell it!!!  When I was asking julian Sanchez to get the  flight attendant name, I've been refused by  her, violating my right the file a complaint  against this flight attendant, whome I think  should leave the airline since she give it a  really bad name! I never felt so ashamed and  embarrassed. I called the customer service and  they didn't want to tell me her name, like the  manager Julian Sanchez told me to do.  I find the flight attendant a layer, racist  and very rude. I find myself powerless against  a big company that won't care, and will do  everything to protect their employees and  names. If I had a video to document all what  happened, everything was easier"
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Thomas Flight 1433 on 3/23,"My guy Tom Tom, showed us the way to vacay like the North Star over our favorite bar. Smiles McGee even saved us a seat and a tasty treat. We were happy to leave a glowing reviewing for a bright grin on a cloudy day. Thanks Thomas!(PS his mask had his smile printed on it and he wore it the whole time, nose and mouth)"
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Still much better than taking a regional jet,"Flew back to Raleigh from Little Rock, with a plane change in Atlanta. Customer service at bag drop allowed me to check my bag earlier with a smile, compared to the packed and understaffed AA desk next to them at Clinton National Airport. Flight to Atlanta was on a 737-700 with 40 empty seats, while connection to Raleigh was a full 737-800 flight.Flights were pleasant and uneventful (one hour each), with everyone offered a cup of water and a snack mix pack on each segment. SWA continues to provide reliable and quality service even during a pandemic."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Terrible Customer Service,"Flight had to be cancelled in March 2020 due to Covid for a vacation our family was taking to Colorado.  Since we did the ""Wanna Get Away"" fare they would only give me a credit, which I was fine with.  However, even though I was the one who paid for the tickets for myself, my wife, and my two year old, they split the refund amount between the three of us.  So now my two year old daughter has money listed under her name that they will not let me use.  Seems like an irresponsible way to do business and just an easy way to con parents out of money during a pandemic.  Called customer service and all they had to say was, that is what I paid for by selecting the ""Wanna Get Away"" option.  I absolutely did not pay for my flight to be cancelled due to a pandemic and told that only my two year old could book a flight with that money.  Terrible way to treat loyal customers."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Poor Customer Service,"Southwest advertises great customer service, I had the worst experience from one of their agents. I paid $15 dollars so I could get an ""A"" boarding pass, that means no early ticketing. They only do that so they can charge an additional fee, again which they claim they don't. I arrived at the kiosk printed my ticket and bag tags. I then attached the tags on my bags. I then proceed through the line that had an over head computer screen reading self tag your bag..  No one was in front nor behind me. I arrived in front of two computer screens reading self tag your bags.  There was 4 agents helping people at the time.  One right in front was helping a group of 4 who had missed a flight. One of the agents finished and I walked up to her. As I approached her she screamed I can not help you! She said "" I am going to help the full service line. So I had to go around the people working on getting a ticket and wait until the fourth agent was done. When she finished she put my bags on a conveyor belt asked for my I.D. and I was done. It took less than a minute, which the first rep could have done and still helped at the other line."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Attacked on plane with no intervention by crew,"Flight home from CO, this lady and her family berated Nick and myself for a solid 5 minutes for getting out of our seats and walking to the front of the plane before they were able to (they had bags in the overhead and we did not, and they hadn't even attempted to stand up or get out of their seats). Back story - Nick suffers from crippling claustrophobia as part of his PTSD. Anyway.We didn't do or say anything, and they stopped for about 2 minutes and had normal conversation but started up with the insults again out of nowhere.So this time I told the lady, ""He has PTSD from serving in the military on submarines. Mind your business."" To which she called me a b**** and her and her kids continued to tell us they don't care that he's in the military and he should have ""waited his turn"" as if standing up and walking to the front while everyone got their overhead bags was going to delay them an hour. I told them to stfu and told the kids that once they've served their country and gotten PTSD, only THEN they can act like their mother and berate a veteran. (Even though that's appalling behavior for anyone at anytime from any walk of life.)We walk away silently while they keep yelling obscenities at us and her kids start threatening us.Then at baggage claim, an unrelated person to that incident decides to give Nick hell for walking up to the carousel to look for our bags just like 40+ other people did. So I step in and say, ""You walked up to it just like he did. Why pick on him and not the 40 other people standing right here?"" And she starts bringing up how ""rude"" we were on the plane. And even after explaining they were cussing at us and Nick has PTSD, etc.. she continues on and on about how ""some people just like drama"" and keeps insulting us while we stand quietly, but she's the one who started talking down to Nick for just standing at baggage claim.Nobody from the Southwest Airlines flight stopped it. Nobody from the Austin Bergstrom intervened. The flight crew was down at baggage claim with us.I guess this is how we treat disabled veterans in Austin, TX now."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Departure Disaster ,"Love SW Airlines but if you are leaving from San Jose Del Cabo, give yourself three hours or more to get checked in. Think Mad Max meets airline check in and you get the picture. Truly a stressful experience that seems to occur every time we leave Mexico. Hard to social distance with no rules and defined queue for waiting.  Lots of people cutting in line and no employees policing the situation."
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Simply the best,"Great service over the years. Crew, customer service, fares, you name it. No company is perfect, but Southwest us right up there."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Two stops there and two stops back one staying on the the flight the other changing aircraft.,Horribly long too many stops. Not recommended for flying with a child. Does not care about parents having a granted sit next to child.
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Viral super-spreader event,"After getting a notice that “some” middle seats would be filled, my flight was jam packed - every seat. Food and drink served, so lots of masks down. Staff kept making jokes about masks - I really feel sorry for the jon-vaccinated people in this flight. If I hadn’t been, I would’ve walked off. Would’ve been hard to get from my small seat between two bigger people and their dog, but I woulda made it. As an MD, pretty appalled."
Date of travel: March 2021,30,Things are changing,"Always loved this airline and I hope today is not a harbinger. I fly 2-3 times a week on SWA. Missed a connection and was assured no problem. Frustration 1 was staring at the missed plane at the gate for 20 minutes. They rebooked me 3 hrs later, not bad but difficult for this trip. Tried to book to Manchester instead. 20 mins at podium, 20   on phone, 2o more to supervisor I was sent to. Bottom line, sorry, it is not a sister city so you are screwed.  Super said things are changing at vp level and we get in trouble if we break the new rules. New experience for me."
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Great service.,I love Southwest! They are so much better than other economy airfares-  They do not Nickle and Dime you like Aligent or Spirit! Free TV and movies and free 2 bags checked! However due to Covid no beverages are offered but I think this is everywhere..
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Stuck in Denver,"My husband and I were trying to fly out to New Orleans for our wedding anniversary but mother nature had other plans in mind by covering Denver in a giant blizzard! While it was an absolute pain to be stuck in the airport because of cancelled flights, Kristi L. at the ticketing counter was incredible and did absolutely everything in her power to her us to our destination! Very impressed with her customer service skills especially in a high stress situation."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,"They rebook only half my family after canceling flight, and don't tell me or help.","I've flown Southwest for many years, am an A list member, have a Southwest Visa, and earn a companion pass annually. I've promoted Southwest over the years as having better customer service than other airlines, but that is not the case anymore. They've gone to crap. It's been deteriorating for years but today was the worst. My flight to Denver this morning was cancelled on Friday due to a storm; it happens. I spoke to a Southwest agent to rebook my family of 6 and was told all done. When checking in for boarding passes the day before the flight I discovered the agent did not rebook my teenage son (so 5 of 6 us only) and the flight was now sold out . I called Southwest and they forced my son on the flight (overselling it by one). I show up to the airport this afternoon for the rebooked flight and it was cancelled due to winter weather; it happens. The gate agent told us ""headquarters"" is rebooking everyone automatically, you'll get a text. I received a text with a rebooked flight departing at 1:40 p.m. tomorrow. It stinks but it's weather. Then I go to check-in for boarding passes and discover that Southwest rebooked only half my family (3 of the 6 of us). That does me no good. And the airline never texted or emailed me any problem rebooking the other half of my family. I then went online and there were three seats still left on the new flight. I was able to quickly add my wife and third daughter, but when I went to add my other daughter the last seat was gone. I called Southwest, and after a 60 minute hold was told there was nothing they would do (so much for doing what they did just two days before when they messed up rebooking my son). The most the agent said she could do was pass me to her supervisor, which meant another long hold and her supervisor saying the earliest they could fly my daughter out by herself would be the day after the rest of us (also the day before we were flying home). And this was only because Southwest did not rebook the entire family or advise me there was a problem rebooking all of us on a flight. So now I have to cancel my family's spring break trip entirely and deal with the mess that is canceling lodging that was paid for and ski passes that were paid for -- all because 1) Southwest failed to rebook us all as they said was being done when they cancelled the flight; 2) failed to tell me that they were not able to rebook the entire family; and 3) won't lift a finger to help resolve a problem they created.I know the airlines are hurting in the pandemic, but with service like this I hope Southwest burns to the ground. Good riddance."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,might want to reconsider flying SW,"If it would let me I would give them no stars. My wife is scheduled to fly on SW at 6 in the morning. Two days ago she got a text that the flight would be crowded and she could change her flight at no charge. She did not want to do this and did not respond. Yesterday she got a text that her flight had been changed from 7 in the morning to a flight after 8 at night. That didnt work and she was permitted to change her flight to a flight at 6 am. The flight she originally booked was not cancelled they just overbooked it and kicked her off.Now at 10 pm ( 8 hrs before her flight ) she got a text message her new flight is cancelled. We have been on hold for an hour now and the recorded message says the wait time is over 120 mins. Looking on their website there are several flights tomorrow but all are full. So it looks like we are going to be on hold for over 2 hrs ( until after midnight ) and she still wont be able to fly tomorrow. I understand things happen out of the airlines control, but this is not the case. There is high demand and they overbooked her flight out of greed, taking my wifes seat away that has been paid for some time ago. I would rather walk to Utah than fly with SW airlines. They clearly dont care about anyone but themselves."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Horrible service,"Completely unwilling to help in my situation, customer service didn’t even try to help. “There was nothing they could do”. Really unfortunate they are far from accommodating for pregnant women."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Poor Treatment and Poor Service,"1. I was traveling with my 81 year old mother and 13 year old daughter. They would remove the mask to eat a pretzel and then the attendant would come by and scold them for not putting mask up fast enough. 3 times on each leg they did this to them. 2. Pretzels and water? Water comes from a bottle. Just like soda does. But no sodas. Does drinking sodas on a plane cause Covid? 3. I carry a prescription from my Dr that I am mask exempt due to a respiratory disability.  But I still wore the mask to keep the peace. I too was scolded several times even after I explained my disability. I only pulled the mask a little from my face when I began to pant for oxygen. Note, I didn't take it off or pull it down. Just away from my face about 1/2 inch to allow oxygen to flow. 4. The theatrical of virus protection was a farce. ""Everyone wear a mask and social distance"" Nobody was wearing an N95 mask and then they pack you in like sardines. I saw every type of mask including those sun screen covers that fishermen wear.  I can understand the rules but to have your gestapo/flight attendants act as police for the FAA is insane. Especially as they are all making up arbitrary rules not based on science or medicine as they go along. 5. I had another trip for 4 people booked for the following week but have now cancelled all flights until stupidity ends. I have cancelled all my sales people from flying as well."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,The airline you don’t have to stress booking on,"Even pre-pandemic, southwest didn’t charge change fees.  Flexibility was provided to the customer as close as 10 min prior to departure.  Southwest hasn’t participated in charging people for carry-on bags, or even a couple checked bags.  No deceptive pricing snares.Simple, dependable, friendly, transparent.Thank you Southwest.You take care of both your employees and your customers."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Southwest Does Not Love Its’ Customers,"I have traveled with Southwest Airlines for years and have loved their flights and service.  However, Southwest recently showed me just how much they appreciate my loyal business.I booked a flight late November of 2020.  Just before my trip in the month of November, I tested positive for COVID-19.  Due to quarantine, I was forced to cancel my trip.  I called Southwest and they gave me a credit for the flight.  I was told that I could not take the credit as points, which I was fine with.  Due to my positive test, and travel restrictions from my employer to certain states, I have not been able to travel, nor have I had any reason to travel.  My credit expires on July 7, 2021.  With restrictions being lifted, I decided to book flight for late July 2021, my wife and I celebrating our anniversary.  Southwest advised me that I could not use my $436 credit towards that flight because the flight was booked after the expiration of the credit.  I explained that I had no other trips to take and requested a two week extension of the credit for my anniversary trip.  Southwest refused to extend my credit a reasonable 2 weeks and told me to allow the credit to expire.  Then call them and request an extension after the expiration.  With this option they would take $100 from my credit, and then I wouldn’t be able to use the new credit of $336 until after 20 days later.  They would then extend the credit.  So I either lose $436 or get $336 that I can’t use for the trip I would need it for!!So I decided to take an unplanned trip in June, a trip I neither planned or budgeted for, just so that I would not lose my $436.  When I attempted to book a flight for June, Southwest would only allow me to use half of my credit for the 2 tickets I attempted to purchase.  Still leaving me approximately $218 that I will probably lose.  How can a company be so empathetic with circumstances surrounding a pandemic and then implement policies designed for a customer to lose money, especially when they are telling me that I have a credit.  Southwest claims to love its’ customers.  Is this love?  Or I guess Southwest just feels like What’s love got to do with it."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Southwest Cancelled our flight,"Then when we tried to rebook,  wanted to charge us $200 more on any flight we rebooked.   Plus they won't give us our money back.  SCAMMER AIRLINES!!  WE WILL NEVER EVER BOOK WITH THEM AGAIN.  And we will warn as many people as we can about their tactics!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,WOULDN'T ACCOMODATE AFTER WINTER STORM,"I would like to escalate my complaint, my flights were canceled due to the winter storm in Texas. one of my passengers in now unable to make any rescheduled trip. she is a minor and will not be using the travel funds at all in the next year. I would like to be able to use the funds for my next flight which is coming up in April. I am out $200 because of this and would really be appreciative if I could use this money especially in these hard times.  The storm was obviously unforeseen, so I ask that you please transfer the funds to my name. I know SOMEONE must be able to do this for me.  I always fly southwest and hope I do not have to resort to stopping my loyal patronage. Someone from the customer service team sent me a generic copy/pasted denial of my request but this is UNACCEPTABLE. I would like to be contacted by a higher level manager who has the authority to accommodate my very small request since you ""pride"" yourself in the customer service you say you provide."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Hotel Bookings,"Couldn't find where to post about hotel bookings through Southwest. Beware of the trap. Not only did I not receive my confirmation number, but SW couldn't even help me locate it. I booked with my rewards number and yet they were no help. I had to cancel my hotel due to a broken down vehicle and could not reach Booking.com since they don't list a number. I called Southwest four times and each time they hung up on me. They don't have any help line for your hotel booking. The hotel itself, even though they weren't supposed to, cancelled my reservation because they felt so bad for me. Booking.com is a POS, and had I realized that was the third party SW was doing business with I wouldn't have booked. Also, if you spend your money on a flight and cancel, and they keep your ""Travel funds,"" then you should be able to spend it on whatever you want- hotel, car, flight. Get your S#!t together SW. If you're going to involve yourself in the hotel and car industry, then link your services together so your members can get assistance. I wasted 5.5 hours trying to cancels my reservation and you all were useless."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,BROKEN FOOT/ankle - WORST SERVICE EVER,"My boyfriend, who shattered his ankle was a flight today. I called ahead and make arrangements and was willing to pay for an extra seat for his foot. They said no worries, plenty of empty seats. Not only the flight attendants give him a hard time. They didn’t provide a pillow/ cushion, nothing. And no one asked if he needed anything. Completely disgusting behavior. This why i always fly JetBlue - don’t waste y  ok r money with this airline."
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Great experience,Love this airline. Staff and pilots were outstanding.  Just a wonderful experience overall. Traveling with grandbaby and she loved it🥰.  Won my loyalty for sure.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Lying Employees,"The reason Southwest Airlines offers low fares is because they have low rate employees. They are ignorant, liars, and just down right incompetent. I would not put a cat on their aircrafts. A flight that should have taken 1.5 took 5 hours after being re-booked, being asked to get off the plane because of first a technology issue then being told it was an employee error. So which one is it? Stay away from this bus terminal in the sky."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Review,I know that in the past Southwest has done great. But since Covid they have become the rudest meanest airline. They don’t even understand what’s in the executive order that our president signed.
Date of travel: August 2020,50,First Time Flyer,"I was a few days shy of my 42nd birthday when I took my first flight ever. My doctors had cleared me to fly. I have a condition known as malignant cardiac vasovagal syncope and three structural heart issues. Basically, if I pass out due to any kind of stress, my heart and lungs quit for a little bit. This can be aggravated by lack of sleep and dehydration. I was very excited when the plane left the ground and felt like a little kid on their first roller coaster ride and was sharing this excitement with an older woman who was seasoned in flying. This was a two-flight trip and this first stretch to Chicago Midway Airport. About 20 minutes before landing I was beginning to experience the first signs of problems. The two attendants on this flight were perfect! Their training was evident, but their humanity and honest concern shown through like a beacon in the fog. A am a former E.M.T. , former volunteer firefighter, fire company president, fire police, and have been in the workforce of the healthcare system since I was 18 years old. When you, yourself, are the patient, it’s very difficult to be your own support system or “rescuer “. That being said, the grace given by these attendants was what kept me just on this side of consciousness. When we landed in Midway, I was able to walk and talk, but just barely. I had just a little over an hour till my second flight. One of the attendants assisted me of the plane and even carried my  very heavy carry on bag in order to help me get to the bathroom and the store for food and Gatorade with salt and to help me get to the next flight’s boarding lobby. The Chicago Fire Company (I do not know which division ) responded to the airport to evaluate my condition. They were very respectful and regarded my privacy with a professional support that was very reassuring. The woman who was perhaps a manager for Southwest Airlines at Chicago Midway was very kind and very professional. As the paramedics and team of firefighters were working on me, she had the airport doctor on her cellphone. My coherency level was just starting to come back, meaning I was just beginning to have the ability of communicable speech again. This is “normal” for people with this condition, though it leaves you in a euphoric exhausted state. This is also when you start getting your awareness levels back again and can become very self-conscious. It can be very embarrassing. They all were very reassuring, regardless. I spoke with the doctor on the phone and knew the line of questioning intimately. In other words, he did his job accurately and professionally. He was also very kind and understood my condition without me having to explain, other than the diagnosis itself (most healthcare providers do not know, nor understand how to treat this specific condition)(one wrong move can cause the patient to go into cardiac arrest). I hadn’t realized at the time, though I should’ve known it, that I was extremely dehydrated and hadn’t slept in almost three days. This and the excitement so stressed my body out and it was reacting negatively to the stresses. After the doctors medically cleared me, having given me strict instruction (which I most certainly followed ), I was able to board my second flight in time. The option was given to me that they could set a later flight for me if I needed more time (I was trembling). The option was helpful, but I decided to continue forward on the scheduled flight. Once on the second plane, it was slightly larger, and I chose a seat near the back closer to the attendants, further from other passengers (still embarrassed and concerned it might happen again) behind the wing. The second flight was about 5 hours? I’m still not certain. I couldn’t in good conscience not have the flight attendants be prepared for the possibility of my condition affecting me yet again, so I asked one of them if anyone had contacted them about what has happened on the last flight. Remember, I’ma former E.M.T., firefighter, etc.  They were surprised by my question and just as I began tiredly attempting to explain my condition to them, the wonderful woman who had handed me her cellphone to talk to the doctor then entered the airplane and gave the attendants all of the information they required to deal with any potential situation. They gave me multiple packages of pretzels (salty items) to compliment my Gatorade so as to add to my hydration levels. The whole time the plane was taking off, and throughout the flight, the attendants were amazingly, well, attendant. At the same time, they were non-invasive and very reassuring. I don’t know what was happening with communication behind the scenes, but I know that I will never travel with anyone else. It will probably take a miracle to get me back on a plane again, but, if I must, it will be with them and only them. May God bless each and every one of you as you all blessed me that day. All of my gratitude to you. Thank you for being so wonderful❤️"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Terrible ,"My cousin and I, had the opportunity to fly on Feb 18, 3021 from Ft Myers to Indianapolis on Southwest Airlines, Flight #206.  Firstly, we didn’t board until we were basically taking off.  Then we sat on the airplane for over 30 minutes waiting for the pilot.  Once the pilot arrived we were told it would be an additional 5 minutes for some paperwork to be completed.  There was no air going during this time and it was 85 degrees outside.  This was a sold out flight and there was no social distancing whatsoever.  So everyone had masks on for over 30 minutes in a hot airplane cabin.  At the very least, most individuals were very uncomfortable breathing with a mask in a hot plane even with all the window shades pulled down, and no air circulation.I wrote to Southwest and my first response was some canned letter with regard to Texas and there weather problems.  None of my issues that I reported were even acknowledged....  ZERO.I wrote a second complaint stating that none of my issues were responded to and I wasn’t accepting their response.  So today I get an apology.... sort of.This was their response to the social distancing comment I made.  “ Nonetheless, I understand it was frustrating to wait onboard Flight #206 after the Captain for your flight was delayed arriving as a result of irregular operations that impacted his previous flight segment, especially given your dissatisfaction with the number of Passengers onboard as well as our open-seating policy. While we are no longer able to guarantee that middle seats go unoccupied, as outlined in our “Southwest Promise”, we are taking multiple steps to support the well-being of our Customers and Employees, including enhanced cleaning procedures, face-covering requirements, and limited onboard service.”So they can’t even keep their own written promises with regard to social distancing of passengers.Southwest® Promise from check-in to deplaning When you travel with Southwest, know this: Our top priority has and always will be your Safety. We’ve employed stringent cleaning and Safety practices to support the health and wellness of our Employees and Customers. We’re using electrostatic and anti-microbial spray treatments, cleaning aircraft between each flight using a disinfectant with the same grade that’s used in hospitals and restaurants, implementing physical-distancing measures, limiting the number of Passengers onboard, modifying boarding procedures, and providing masks for Employees.

Date of travel: February 2021,30,"Welcoming staff, but jet and boarding area too crowded and not all pax keep mask on","Planes book every possible seat. during reg times everyone prefer space, but during covid it doesnt feel safe!! way too crowded. some pax removed masks and took repeat requets from crew to attend, wait area at gate in ATL so so crowded, no where to space out. (FLL airport was better). Safety concern. Also SW canceled a flight due to weather, texted about cancel, but didnt provide alternative, NO ONE picked up phones on Sat night before flight (was on hold for 2 hours and then gave up, dont think anyone would...). Also SW forgot to refund paid for cancelled flight, and took 3 calls from airport staff to take care of it. Despite of it all, I think they are a friendly honest airline, I appreciate baggage policy and will remain a loyal pax. Would love to see empty middle seat till virus is over."
Date of travel: February 2021,50,Clearly the best airline in the country,"Southwest is head and shoulders the best airline in the US. Their safety is unequaled, and the helpfulness of the staff is beyond compare. I never fly anyone else if I have a choice."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Awful,Will never fly this crappy airline again. They could have put us on an earlier flight and wanted to charge all kinds of money in Las Vegas. Awful customer service and don't  care at all anymore. Also cancelled a flight and didn't even notify us
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Awful airline,"DO NT FLY this AIRLINE, theu are WAY BEHIND THE TIMES AND do not have updated equipment! Not customer service oriented at all!!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Southwest sucks!!!!,"DO NOT FLY THIS GHETTO AIRLINE, THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU OUT AT ALL!!!!!!!!  We got in early and could have taken an earlier flight but they would not accommodate us because they are greedy!"
Date of travel: October 2020,50,The Absolute best !!!,I flew Southwest in October to Denver and then back home to Raleigh. It was the most efficient service from and airline I have ever seen ( Ive flown all of them Delta United American and Southwest )and for domestic north america always fly southwest. From check in to baggage claim. soo great. bags came very quickly. The flight crew is really beyond amazing. They are so helpful and are great at looking out for the safety and comfort of the passengers. We were stuck on the tarmac once for an hour and they brought water and snacks for the flight. Boarding looks complicated but it is really smooth. It may look like it takes a long time but it does not. the seat is great and i LUV  the in flight entertainment. our crew did in fact enforce the mask rule kindly. I wish they flew from the east coast to Hawaii with stops and without having to book the seperate flight in California. Will always fly with them.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Returning from Aruba,"#1 less than 12 hours before I was to depart on 2/14 to Aruba my flight was cancelled via email. Thank God I check my emails  They rescheduled me for 4 days later and the others I was traveling with 3 days later. WHAT??? Luckily Jet Blue took us ALL the day we were supposed to leave.  It's now almost March 1st and I have still never received a reason why my flight was cancelled.  Today I flew home from Aruba on Southwest because they did reimburse our flight on 2/14 because they cancelled but not the return. So we had a ruff ride from Aruba to Baltimore due to turbulence, no fault of Southwest. But flew around and around Baltimore for at least 30 to 40 mins we were never landing. Finally when we did land we only had time to hustle from C terminal to B terminal which was not as close as the others. Why? I have no answer. But they had all the passengers boarded and ready to fly to Providence. We were supposed to fly out 8pm but we were still sitting there until 840pm because they were still loading luggage. We finally get to PVD at about 940pm to only have to sit and wait another 30 minutes for luggage. No one ever promoted Southwest as much as I did but they have a lot of work to do to get back to the same rating I had for them. I believe they got rid of so many employees that it is now catching up to them. You can't say the people aren't flying. We didn't have a empty seat."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Terrible Airline,Service and plane are outdated. Rude attendants and lack of professionalism made this the worst airline I have ever flown.
Date of travel: February 2021,30,Southwest Airlines great for our short trip to Atlanta.....,"I must admit that my flight from New Orleans to Atlanta was one of the easiest trips I have taken in a long time.  Considering that if we had celebrated Mardi Gras in the city of New Orleans the Louis Armstrong International Airport would have been packed.  However, today the luck of the Irish was on my side and our travels on Southwest Airline was uneventful.  Upon arrival check in was great because I was greeted by a friendly representative and printing my baggage tag was easy and more importantly....the luggage was Free.  Bags these days are expensive to transport so it was a breath of fresh air to save $60.00.  Our wait at the gate was not very long, boarding was orderly, our flight was direct, the flight was smooth, and our take off and landing was uneventful.  Upon arrival in Atlanta it was easy to retrieve our bags and depart for our adventures.  Upon our return the process was relatively easy however, I would recommend that if you are traveling with children make sure to purchase the pass that allows you to board early.  Southwest allows passengers to board via a number system.  We were told to line up near the window once our number was called; however, the numbers were only visible from the inside of the pole instead of on the outside.  Thus, it was somewhat difficult to find your place.  In addition, you may have to deal with disgruntled passengers who may be inclined to believe that you are cutting the line.  Unfortunately, this process resulted in my son sitting alone because there were only middle seats available once we boarded the aircraft.  Lesson learned...purchase a pass if you have children traveling with you.  Overall our experience was great....free bags, a direct flight, and on time arrival and departure.  Truly, I could not ask for much more considering the cost except for a pair of wings (many airlines have for children) for my son and having him sitting near me during our return flight.  Sadly, they didn’t have any wings for kids nor a seat for him to sit next to me on our return flight. 😰"
Date of travel: February 2021,30,Covid19 has impacted level of service. Middle seats no longer blocked.,"$8 charge for  WiFi. No seat-back screens for in flight entertainment:  Had to have brought  own smartphone/tablet. No headset outlet to plug into,On a midday 4 hour nonstop  flight, only food was two little bags of dry snacks and only water was served. Flight crew was helpful and pleasant. On time arrival and departure. We continue to  choose Southwest because there are no charges for bags and no change fees. Would not have flown this route with connecting flights.. The nonstop was long enough !"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,F*** Southwest Airlines,My grandmother died and I was just trying to get yo St. Louis..... the security team is testing out a new system so security takes twice as long..... then the train got stuck at gate a.... the plane was still ******* (they don’t accept profanity) here when I got to the gate snd they told me I couldn’t bored and that I would have to fly stand by for the next flight 2 HOURS later..... told me it was MY fault that I got stuck at security snd in the train and refuse to tell me where the **** my suitcase is...... **** southwest!!!!!!! Fly ANY other *******  airline. I fly alot  and this is how they treat their members..... nope never again
Date of travel: February 2021,10,COVID Related Flight,"Very disappointed with this airline as I sat next to someone who was inconsiderate of my personal space during a pandemic. This individual stole things from me, spilt water on me and on top of all that never wore her mask. This individual was asked multiples times but never put it on as they sat next to me spread out. The airlines did nothing about this during this two hour flight which put a lot of people at risk. This is extremely disappointed and will not be flying southwest again."
Date of travel: February 2021,30,Very poor management of the airline,When we arrived at the terminal to check in for our flight the line was a mile long.  We both had boarding passes so we just wanted to check bags.  After talking to some other passengers we found out they were calling for flights that were in danger of not taking off in time.  They were putting those passengers in the bag drop line.  The reason people were about to miss flights was everyone had to stop and fill out the ATTESTATION FORM. Why was that form not emailed to everyone who flew into Mexico a few days before they were supposed to fly home.  Then everyone would have had one all filled out and ready.  What kind of monkeys are running the Southwest zoo?
Date of travel: February 2021,20,It's a PET PARADE on Southwest Airlines,"5 cats, 6 dogs, 4 hours in the cabin of a 737. If you have pet allergies, BEWARE you will have an allergic reaction."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,"They would destroy your checked suitcase, damage and lose some of your belongings","This airline fails to meet domestic standards when it comes to safely handling passengers' suitcases during transportation. They will offer an unlimited number of suitcases for you to check in, charge you exorbitant amounts of money for it, but then damage your suitcases and belongings and loose part of it. They would apologize at your arrival and offer you BS very bad quality ""emergency bags"" to contain the rest of your belongings so you can take it home, and some 2 cents voucher and keep your damaged property promising you that the airline will cover its cost if you go on some specific online platform that is difficult tp access with codes and other information and send them your ticket information, pictures and tags - but once you follow all of their nonsense various requests and even provide them with photos and freceipts, they will call you a liar, deny responsibility and basically just tell you: ""go ahead, sue me"". Complete unprofessionalism and abuse of power and totally unethical ways of treating passengers. They damaged and lost part of my belongings and it has been a month that they have been playing games and sending nonsense conflicting letters where they are basically insulting the passenger and demanding completely unrelated things. Do yourself a favor: RUN AWAY - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS AIRLINE AND COMPROMISE YOUR PROPERTY if you care about your checked belongings. They are offering free 2 first suitcases for a reason!!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Bad customer service,"Called to make flights because we have little ones,and the system asks for it. Got it all lined up with the nice lady. Then we mentioned our points, she hung up on us. Wish I had her name for this review. You know who you are. Unacceptable."
Date of travel: February 2021,20,You get what you get with COVID,"There is absolutely no reason Southwest needed to fill this flight completely. It’s absolutely insane that they care more about profits than their customers’ safety. However, if you are traveling during a pandemic, it’s understandable that you’re taking risks. SW asks everyone to wear masks and encourage people bringing their own wipes to wipe down the seats. I think next time I’ll spend the extra $$ to fly delta for the safety aspect but given the circumstances the SW flight crew is really great and diligent. It’s more of a corporate issue than a local one. Their CEOs are greedy AF for encouraging this nonsense during a global pandemic for profit."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Disappointed long term customer,"With a 12 hour notice our flight was rebooked to the next day, much later arrival time, do to predicted weather at connection.However friends flying with us were just cancelled and could not get rebooked for 2 days. We were suppose to drive together hours to the Keys. We recommended paying more and flying southwest for the free luggage to take paddle boards. Wish we had booked cheaper direct Spirit flight which another friend took and is still going today. Other friends took American, still going. Will fly spirit next time in winter! Direct flights!!!You would think that they could reroute around weather since not at departure or destination!"
Date of travel: February 2021,30,Almost a top-notch experience,"This was an emergency booking since our flight on another airline was cancelled.The staff (onbaord and off) were excellent. We did experience a few problems, some due to COVID.FIrst, my wife is disabled, SW does not make boarding easy. Most airlines annouce at boarding time for disabled passenger to come forward, sometime before 1st class, sometimes right after, and you just get in line. SW requires the boarding pass to be marked as ""preferred"", but that information doesn't appear on their website, nor at their boarding gates, we found out when they told us we'd have to go to customer service to get the passes updated. This was at boarding time, and we held up all of the other passengers while we went to get the boarding passes changed.Next, other airlines, because of COVID, are still offering soft drinks, SW only has water. It's not that hard to offer an unopened can to a passenger.Finally, their entertainment system is poor. Very slow in loading, my connection kept timing out while trying to load the movie. By the time it was loaded there wasn't time to watch the movie, but that didn't matter since it froze after 5 minutes of play. Kids don't understand that, they just want to watch the movie."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,"If there was a rating worse than terrible, i would give it.","I arrived at the airport to find my flight was canceled. I approached a gentleman at the counter to find out why and he informed me that my layover flight (Orange Co Ca.)was canceled due to weather. I explained to him that i needed a flight that day due to my job requiring me to be present on Monday morning to which he answered, Well it's not going to happen!! He did not offer to find me another flight for that day only that no airlines was flying into Nashville on this day because of the snow and ice. Well apparently American Airlines did not get the memo because I had to pay $500 with them, for a ticket to get home and they DID fly me into Nashville!! This was on top of my luggage being damaged, wheel broke of, when I arrived in Sacramento to begin with. I will NEVER book with them again. I received the worst customer service from any company that I have ever had to deal with. I will be glad to pay the extra fee for better service as will my family and friends who also have always used Southwest. Hope someone asked me for an airline recommendation."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Fu<¥ southwest,There employees claim they treat them great but the rip families apart. Randomly sending them to training when they have families to take care of. While there family are left in power  and southwest doesn’t allow them to communicate with them at all. People who suffer from anxiety and aren’t able to communicate with them
Date of travel: February 2021,20,Dissatisfied ,"Ugh. Quietly the notices were sent out so no one sees the change of no longer keeping the middle seat open. I say quietly because I received an email 3 days before the trip:  the middle seat may be filled. Other airlines are lowering their prices and keeping middle seat open. I felt there was a switch and bait. However they said their policy changed December 31. Boarding they say no one can wear a bandanna, just the proper mask etc etc. this is not enforced. Terminal in Denver. No social distancing what-so-ever. Priority boarding. What is that!  Another bait and switch?  Pay and still board after a large group. Seems the prices are no longer competitive. They might be another time but today it is not. For someone that is 6'4' it is important for me to have a seat with leg room!  Ok. So disappointed. Plane staff and all staff is wonderful."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible customer service. Cancelled flight due to “weather” 12 hours ahead of flight and there was no “weather”.,"Horrible customer service. Cancelled flight due to “weather” 12 hours ahead of flight and there was no “weather” in either the departure or arrival locations. Receive a text to rebook and there are no seats on any other flights. So have to quickly grab seats Hunger Games style to another airport 1.5 hours away from the original arrival location where car is parked. Called SWA to seek assistance and was only hold for 3+ hours! No call back option from an agent in 2021? Ridiculous! Then SWA offers no transportation voucher to the airport where our car is located or does not offer to book us on another airline. Call escalated to “customer service”, which is a joke—again they offer a flight the following day to the original destination but no hotel voucher. What a ridiculous, pathetic and archaic faux attempt at customer service. We will never fly Southwest again. You know it’s bad when I would recommend Spirit over SWA. Southwest is officially the worst! P.S. Hockey parents—it’s not worth the free bag check for the headaches. We’ve had much better experiences on every other airline other than SWA."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,"Unprofessional service, unable to change flight.","My direct flight was cancelled due to weather conditions. Southwest changed my flight to the latest flight the next day with a five hour lay over. I tried on my computer to change my flight to a direct flight on the same day, Southwest blocked the ability for me to do so. I had to call to change my flight. I called and was on hold for two hours when they hung up on me. I called again and waited another three hours for the representative to tell me “ if your unhappy with your flight cancel and go with another airline.” The reps ID number is 144113 his name is Quinton. I was in shock that that’s the first thing he told me instead of trying to help me figure out other accommodations. I am canceling my Southwest credit card and using all the points I have and will never fly with Southwest again. I’ll fly with Untied, Delta or American instead."
n/a,10,You get what you pay for.,"You know the saying and southwest is out to prove it.  Cant book online, says to call 1 800 number, with a wait time of over 2 hours. What a joke and not showing any love for their flyers.  Okay adding more cause app says to.  At the very least have a call back option and hire some employees!!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Don’t fly southwest!!,"Don’t fly Southwest!!! Not only was our connecting flight cancelled multiple times, they refused to help with anything!! All employees were very rude in the process! I have used Southwest for years, but I won’t be a returning customer. The BWI Southwest employees continued to blame it on the weather, however Southwest was the only airline not flying!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,"Cancelled flight, no communication","We bought BWI to DEN direct flight for the whole family. Paid extra to have a direct flight. Southwest cancelled my flight 2 days before it with the only communication being a text message. Never received any phone calls to choice from other options. Automatically rebooked me to a flight with a stop and  refused to give any refunds. I could have bought a flight with a stop from another airline much cheaper!! Anyway, no point in paying extra for southwest, you might as well fly spirit, customer service is the same, meaning non existent."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Turned away,"Due to my oversized bag, a Jetsurf board in its special $800 travel bag, SW refused to allow me to fly with it for a flight I had booked over a month in advance.   Nearly every airline is fine with this oversized bag.  Due to being turned away, I lost my rental car, and had to rebook with United at top dollar.   I notified Jetsurf who had SW OK’d on their list of OK to fly.  They have now removed them from their list. If you have an oversized bag forget this airline.  I now understand why people call them South Worst and I’ll never fly with them again!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Felt like they wanted to spread the virus,Flew Delta to key west and had a comfortable flight with social distancing. Flew Southwest home and was shocked to hear the plane was completely full. Southwest stated an email was sent to inform us of the flight capacity but we never received such notice.People reaching over each other to stow their carry ons was almost comical given the pandemic. Southwest should be ashamed of themselves . I will not fly Southwest again .
Date of travel: February 2021,10,0/5,If I could give them 0 I would. Screw you Southwest Airlines you left my mother in tears from the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I hope you go out of business.

I received an email saying we have till MARCH 2021 to use it.

Date of travel: February 2021,10,Unbelievable,45 min waiting for luggage. Pathetic. Done. Now they want me to at least write 100 characters before they post my review. Amazing wanting me to waste more of my time.
Date of travel: December 2020,50,The Best Airline Ever,"One of the best airlines even in a pandemic.  Water and snacks never tasted so good because safety was the highlight of the trip.  The Flight Attendants were extremely kind. I was so thirsty on this flight and asked for an extra water and the flight attendant didn't hesitate to ask me to hold on for a second, she came back with two cans of water and said, if you need anything else, I will be here.  My heart was touched with her kindness.  Kindness goes a long way, it gets you a great review."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Unsafe During COVID-19,"I am a physician. I am not an Infectious Disease expert or COVID-19 expert by any means, but I have provided care to COVID-19 patients. I devoted my entire holiday season, including Christmas and New Years to taking care of COVID-19 patients. I have not travelled by air in a while. I was lucky enough to be vaccinated several weeks ago and thought that it would be an acceptable risk to fly to see family for a weekend. I was very wrong. My flight with Delta was a fantastic experience. All passengers were wearing masks, and flight attendants would remind them to pull the masks up if they were not wearing them over their noses. The boarding process was slow with plenty of space between patrons. The middle seat in each aisle was left empty to promote social distancing. The flight attendants were wearing appropriate masks and offered Purell packs for cleaning when you got on the plane. Water and snacks were served in individual bags with the instruction to keep your mask up between sips or bites if you chose to partake. The process for disembarking the plane was even socially distanced. Passengers were asked to remain seated until those in front of them were up the aisle with their bags. Overall, I felt relatively safe the entire time flying with Delta. My flight with Southwest back was an entirely different experience. People were crowding against each other while boarding. The plane was packed to the brim without a single open seat. When I asked the flight attendant at the front whether they were keeping middle seats open for social distancing, he laughed at me. The cabin was hot with all the bodies packed in. People took off their masks or pulled them down so that noses were exposed, and the flight attendants said nothing. The flight attendants were not even wearing appropriate masks- they were wearing the type that infectious disease studies have found are not as effective. If Southwest thinks that their waiver before flying is doing any good (the one that says you do not have COVID-19 symptoms/exposures), they should strongly reconsider their stance on that. There were multiple passengers repeatedly coughing without masks and sniffling throughout the flight. Disembarking from the plane was a similar crowded disaster as boarding. I felt unsafe the entire flight.My experience with Southwest was a slap in the face to healthcare workers who have sacrificed so much during this pandemic. Southwest disregarded the health and safety of all its patrons present on my flight."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Profiting off a Pandemic,"Last March we had tickets to fly to New Orleans. That was on March 16. You might remember that everything shut down that week and we had to cancel our trip. Unlike American, on which I had tickets for April of 2020, Southwest would not refund my money but offered an extension of the ticket for one year. I accepted that thinking one year was plenty of time to reschedule. How wrong can you be. By March 16 2021 we won’t be anywhere close to having control of this virus or being able to safely travel anywhere beyond my mailbox. I therefore called Southwest again to request a refund which they refused. They offered me a further extension of time for $150. each ticket. I felt that was extremely unfair considering the circumstances. They should refund the money in an extreme act of God circumstance, but at the very least be willing to extend the ticket value until such time as this pandemic starts being competently handled. This is terrible customer service and Southwest has permanently lost my business. Think twice before flying Southwest"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Checked back marked fragile was manhandled,"My son took his pc to college, so we packed it in a special bag for pc’s, we added padding at the bottom, top and all around it. At check in it was marked fragile by the agent at the desk. He gets to the Cincinnati picks up the bag and the case is CRUSHED! It’s a pretty expensive pc. He went to claim it and they said they don’t cover electronics. Well someone better take responsibility because they said it would be taken care of at the counter in San Juan."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Great Airline - working through the COVID pandemic,"We used Southwest to finally take a twice-postponed trip to Disneyworld just after Christmas. Southwest switched several months ago to allow middle row seating.  For us, we were fine because there were five of us and we took up an entire row.  It was not a completely full flight so the one empty seat remaining on the row was empty the whole time.  I was on the side of the plane with my wife and daughter.  In my experience, Southwest's customer service is far superior to other legacy airlines and also low cost airlines.   Their flight attendants are friendly but do enforce the rules - especially regarding mask usage.  Their rules regarding the way they seat their passengers takes a little getting used to but I am comfortable with it and have not had a problem keeping our party together  during flights.  For those unhappy with a seat next to them being occupied, I feel your pain but if you don't buy an extra seat that spot is fair game and you should expect to have a person sitting next to you. The best part about Southwest is their baggage and rescheduling  flexibility.  COVID may have prompted some other airlines to temporarily loosen their change fees, but Southwest has never had them.  Also being able to check two bags is wonderful.  If prices are close, I will always go with Southwest, especially due to the lack of change fees.  COVID caused us to have to reschedule this more than once and  SW was very accommodating and didn't charge us half the price of the ticket to make a change (zero $$ change fee)  It is nice to fly with an airline where I don't feel like the customers are hated or at least taken for granted. Another nice feature is they seem to have more non-stop flights than many other airlines, mainly because they have less reliance on ""hub cities""  and instead rely more on point to point flights.   We did have an automated reschedule prior to flying that booked a connecting flight after our original flight was cancelled, but they cheerfully booked us back on a  non-stop when my wife called weeks before the flight date. They are great to fly and I hope they keep their business model and are able to work through this COVID crisis.  I also read that they haven't laid off or furloughed any workers through the Pandemic unlike many of their competitors.   Kudos to Southwest!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,"Bad attitude, racist","Timothy silvery, very ride , nosey, and disrespectful. I fly at least once every two months. I never encountered a disrepectful person like him . My flight was ruined. Watch out for him, please."
Date of travel: January 2021,50,Best choice if you're not flying first class.,"First things first.  If you are paranoid about COVID or any other virus, stay home or drive to your destination.  Unless you're wearing a surgical mask and wearing it correctly, those pieces of underwear over your mouth do no good.  So when another passenger needs to take it off to breathe, don't get your panties in a twist.  Likewise, if you ""need"" an empty next to you, buy two tickets.  It's not rocket science.  Your personal circumstances don't give you priority over other people who have also paid to be there.Love SW flight attendants (or is it ""LUV"" SW flight attendants?)  They seem to be well-informed and relaxed.  There is no Nazi atmosphere here.  Yes, they follow rules, but they are not nasty about it.  We had to check bags this time and the lady at counter was wonderfully friendly and helpful.  The gate agent had a sense of humor and was efficient at loading.  Just a great flight overall.SW will be our first choice from now on."
n/a,50,budget friendly ,It was still affordable airlines to choose if you are travelling domestic and it is really  recommended to get especially if you have huge checked in bags since it was cheaper for add-ons. It also has more space than spirit airlines.
Date of travel: October 2020,50,"The best and safest airline in the country, coming from a pilot",I know something about the airline business. I will not let my family onto a United or American flight any longer. I don't trust their maintenance programs. Southwest is the best by a LONG way. Even if it means a change of planes II take Southwest every time.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Social distancing is a joke,I paid extra to board early and get a good seat. After just having surgery I needed extra space. I found a great seat upfront. Of course someone sat directly next to me. Flight crew didn't care. The plane had several rows of empty seats in the rear but social distancing want enforced and I was told if I was uncomfortable I could move. I had an issue getting into the bathroom in the rear of the plane and the stewardess told me to push because it's not rocket science. Staff need training Covid procedures and customer service.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE EVER,NEVER IN MY LIFE will I fly southwest again. My flight was supposed to be from 8:45 to 1:15 and they rescheduled it 3 TIMES. The last time they canceled my flight at 9:30pm at night THE DAY BEFORE travel. We literally moved our entire schedule around to fly at 8:45 and now at the last minute we have to scram to get to the airport 3 Horus early!! Not to mention they scheduled a 5 hour layover that we would have NEVER booked!! I have memberships with many other airlines and I’ve NEVER experienced this in my entire life!!! In addition due to their idiotic no assigned seating policy I checked in EXACTLY 24 hours before my checkin time and was lucky enough to get in boarding group A. However on the rescheduled ticket they put my husband and I in group C!!! HOW DOES THIS MAKE SENSE?!!! What’s the point of me waking up to check in on time!! Southwest gets 0 STARS from me! Delta would NEVER do this. I will NEVER fly this bogus airline again!
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Nonstop to 6 hour layover,"I was supposed to leave to come back at 1:45pm on a nonstop flight from Vegas to Des Moines landing at 6:30pm. This meant I could go out the night before my flight and have fun and not have to rush in the morning or worry about over sleeping. Instead my flight back was changed to leave at 8:45am and I didn't land home until 8pm. That meant a 6 hour layover. I will admit that the onboard staff was always polite, if the people managing this stuff could get their act together I might give them another shot."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Selfish for your money,"While flying my friend down to Florida (different airline with no other available flights for the remainder of the day) she was told now she had to have a  soft kennel for travelling with her ~5 pound dog. They said Southwest would sell her a soft kennel at the ticket station. I get off the phone with her so she can make the purchase, then calls back to tell me that they're the only ones that have them and if she wants to get one she'll have to purchase a flight with Southwest in order to get one. Customer service at its absolute worst. They had plenty of them per the ticket attendant but would not budge on selling her a $15 soft kennel because she was on a different airline. It being an emergency situation, she purchased the ticket and had to cancel her original flight down losing a majority of the money already spent for the last flight.Needless to say, this will be the very last time I consider Southwest Airlines."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,COMPANION PASS POINTS ISSUE,"Before the pandemic I was an active flyer to Las Vegas.  Got the SWA credit card through Chase in 01/2020 and figured I would earn the points for flights.  To earn companion pass you need 125,000 points.  In November 2020 I was getting close enough to 125,000 to give it a run.  In November 2020, I called and spoke with two representatives at SWA Rapid Reward Department to confirm that all of my points from now to the end of the year would go towards companion pass.  They were not very sure and had to ask around both times I called.  My concern was my billing statement closes on the third of the month.  Meaning my December Charges would close 01/3/2021.  I was assured TWICE, when they reconcile the points that I would get the points for the charges in December.  Going into December I had 112,000 points.  I needed 13,000 to achieve Companion pass.  I used my card exclusively in December and purchased items from, Adidas, 800-flowers and Dicks Sporting Goods who were featured vendors with bonus points available.  I had accumulated over 16,000 points, which was more than enough to qualify me for companion pass.  When my statement came out 01/3/2021, all of my 16,000 points were posted towards January 2021.  I called and spoke with a representative who said to contact Customer Relations and confirm they were completed with the ""year end processing"".  on 01/12/01 I spoke with Hannah in customer relations.  Her tone was beyond condescending and she indicated they were not going to adjust the points because my billing statement closed on 01/3/2021.  I advised all of my charges were in December and I was told twice that those points would be adjusted accordingly.    She said they did see that I had called in several times over the last two months, but they were not going to review the calls to see if I was provided incorrect information.  She said she would escalate my call to a manager; however she knew it was not going to be changed.On 01/13/2021 I received a call from Andrea at 469-587-2058.  She repeated the same thing and reiterated that even if I was told incorrect information, they would not change the information.  There was no need to check my calls.  Furthermore there was no specific documentation on their end as to the reason of my calls. This was such a letdown.  I was so excited to think I was going to achieve Companion Pass.  Even more frustrated that none of the representatives were versed in how the point accrual was handled.  Then infuriated that Customer Relations wasn't even interested to validate my claim that I was provided inaccurate information.  PISS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Complete Disregard for COVID,I will never fly Southwest again!  Their complete disregard for COVID and the health and safety of its passengers is abhorrent!  We flew to and from Dallas the day before and day after New Year’s. My entire family was diagnosed with COVID a week later!  I am so disgusted with the airlines need for money that they couldn’t just limit the flights.  We will never fly with Southwest again.
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Refreshments ,What is the rationale for not letting passengers order what they would like to drink if you’re going to serve ice water in cups? Other airlines are not restricting refreshments. We’ll be flying a different airline when we book our next trip.
Date of travel: April 2020,10,i hate it,its a horbile place i had o sit away from my kids no covid saftey no nothing dont go there the plane
Date of travel: January 2021,50,Always a great experience!,"If I have a choice between airlines, if Southwest is an option, I almost always choose it. In this particular instance, when flying back home from Christmas, Southwest had the cheapest flight prices. While I didn’t love that they no longer fill middle seats, I know they are doing all they can to minimize the spread of COVID with cleaning procedures and ensuring everyone is wearing a mask. My first flight was full but my second one was nearly empty, allowing me to basically have no contact with anyone, which was nice. I appreciate that you can choose your seat, so in an empty plane, you can go anywhere! The flight attendants are always super friendly and helpful and I’ve never had a problem! Highly recommend Southwest!"
Date of travel: January 2021,40,Better covid precautions,"This flight was much better, the middle seats were open so I felt a lot more comfortable. People in the boarding area did not follow social distancing rules so that was concerning. I did arrive to my destination safety so I thank God for that."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,NO COVID SAFETY,Plane was packed and I felt truly unsafe packed in this plane during a surge in covid truly disappointing
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Do not use Southwest Vacations aka Apple Vacations,"My friends and I booked a trip and had to cancel 15 minutes after we booked it. it has been 7 months that I have been waiting for my refund. They have $1,100 of mine and my friends. We are getting the runaround. They have terrible customer service and they do not get back to you and especially they do not want to give you your money back. We had one representative say that I definitely would get a refund and I'm still sitting here 7 months later with nothing. I put a complete faith in this company. Southwest airlines will not do anything because it doesn't affect them and this is a different company. Terrible customer service."
Date of travel: January 2021,20,No Covid safety,"I always use southwest & no other airlines unless a must. I was shocked when I saw the plane going and coming was full to capacity and no Covid safety in place. Why wear a mask when someone i do not know is next to me elbow to elbow. I was so uncomfortable I could not move. The person in front of me kept coughing. The plane was delayed departing for 20 min while retrieving people’s trash and food items. We didn’t even leave yet and your allowing people to eat. When eating masks have to come off. I just don’t understand how any of this was for our safety. Shame on you southwest. Should have had middle seats open!!! You failed us. DO NOT TRAVEL DURING PANDEMIC IF YOU DO NOT HAVE TO. The airport was full, people everywhere. The check in lines were not long at all but by the gate was full & people breathing down each other’s necks. Not one person was social distancing and nobody was there to tell people to either."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Thanks for nothing,"Horrible!! I usually fly Delta and had a colleague talked me into giving Southwest a try. Ended be 1.5 hours late, and had no access to my rental vehicle!! Spent the trip using Uber."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Covid? SW doesn’t care,"SW doesn’t care that there’s a Covid surge. They are booking their flights to 100% capacity. They say they’ll notify passengers when the plane is over 65%, but they won’t tell you until 3 days before your flight - making a change super difficult."
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Horrible covid accommodations,"Boarding and deplaning were good, but drastically different than the other 5 flights I’ve taken during this pandemic! I did NOT feel safe because the PLANE WAS PACKED AND THE middle seats were still open. This caused a big problem with the people behind me because a young man had to sit next to someone with a dog and there were outburst of arguing between them throughout the flight! Great online movies and nice staff, but with covid still being fatal for some and cases exploding, the middle seats should still BE CLOSED!! Shame on you Southwest!"
Date of travel: January 2021,40,Good flight,Good flight! Boarding and deplaning were easy and I felt safe because the middle seats were still open. Great online movies and nice staff!
Date of travel: January 2021,50,Amazing customer service,"Prior to leaving for San Antonio I was having some issues with my flight. Southwest Airlines was incredibly responsive and helpful, and specially the representative I spoke with named Jennifer was so kind. I’ve always liked Southwest best, but this made me like them even more!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Horrible not helpful check in!,"IF COVID IS SUCH A BIG DEAL TO SOUTHWEST , why was I not helped on to a flight I booked! With 20 plus min to board a flight that looked pretty darn empty . Instead of helping me get on plane witch was one flight for 1 and a half hours, to a all day exurtion through multiple airports for 5 to 6 hrs of in flight,   NEVER FLYING SOUTHWEST AGAIN!"
Date of travel: December 2020,30,Good but not Great,"I typically am a huge Southwest fan. However, and I know they made this known prior to our trip, the selling of packed flights during COVID and at a high travel time I can’t get behind. If Delta wasn’t so expensive I would have flown them. While the gate staff and flight attendants did well to remind everyone to keep their masks on during the flight I was very disappointed and uncomfortable that they would sell out the flights. I understand they need to make up a lot of lost money from this year. The worst though was on our second leg from Dallas to Phoenix when they had us board the plane ready to be on time take off then sit an extra 30 minutes while they finished loading the luggage. Why not have us wait before boarding. Overall it was an okay experience nothing special, I took my own extra precautions while on the flight. I will say as people we leaving the plane they were already starting to wipe things down."
Date of travel: December 2020,30,Maskless Passenger on Christmas Day,"I was dismayed to see a passenger sit massless the entire flight.  Flight attendants walked past the person several times during the flight and even offered him water and snacks.  They never asked him to put his mask on. Southwest is a good airline, but this was disappointing to see."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Great Flights,"Our trip was somewhat unusual due to Covid, but we had the best flight crew on each leg of our trip. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful and due to the plane not being full we were able to keep middle seat empty and in some cases whole rows were empty around us. We had a short layover in Vegas and then spent the night in San Jose. Each airport experience was good and we never felt threatened or unsafe. The employees at the Kona airport were especially helpful and went above and beyond to help us. I am so glad Southwest has started flying to Hawaii and I would recommend flying this Airline."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,"So Fun, and always a positive experience","I always fly Southwest and will continue to do so.  While waiting in the area to board, they had holiday themed games complete with prizes for us.  The flight to Denver was one of the smoothest I have encountered.  Our luggage arrived with us, on time and undamaged.  The flight crews are almost always very friendly and helpful, even in these crazy times.  I felt safe for both of the segments. I love Southwest and they will always be my first choice to fly."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND / WILL NOT BOOK WITH SOUTHWEST AGAIN,"Of all the flights we’ve taken, this past week while traveling for the holidays was by far the worst. They boarded our planes on-time just to make us sit on the crowded plane for over an hour EVERY flight. This made us late to our connecting flights both to and from Minneapolis. We literally had to run from one gate to the other because of the extreme delays on the runway. When asked if they could contact our connecting flight to make sure we wouldn’t miss it we were told by the flight attendants that they had “no control” over the other flights and we “should” be able to make it if we go/rush straight to the other gate. The flight attendants were rude and dismissive on all 4 flights (with the exception of maybe 1 or 2). And to top it all off, we had to wait at baggage claim at Houston Hobby airport for over an hour. We would not recommend booking with Southwest if you’re looking for a friendly and/or convenient experience."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Always great flights ,Good help is hard to find. That might be because southwest hired most of them. The flight crew and ground crew on this trip and most every flight with southwest was awesome
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Damage luggage,"I will NEVER fly with Southwest again! They broke my suitcase and now they refused to pay for it. When i got my suitcase back, i did notice it was dragging weird but i just thought it was something stuck underneath and i was in a hurry to get to my destination. Once i got to my destination i took a closer look at it and realized that one of the wheels  was actually broke. This was a brand new suitcase, prior to this incident. I WOULDN’T EVEN RECOMMEND ANYONE, EITHER!"
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Poor Customer Relations,"We made reservations for a pair of round-trip tickets to fly to Honolulu, HI,  for March 6, 2020.  Then restrictions with traveling and quarantine in Hawaii prohibited us from traveling.  Especially as seniors, we didn't want to take the risks. SW allowed one extension to use the tickets by 12/22/20.  After that date, the tickets would convert to vouchers that must be used by 6 months,  but the cost for the conversion comes at a cost of $100 per ticket.  With travel restrictions in California where we live, use of our tickets before 12/22//20 was not feasible.I contacted SW to argue my case to request another extension for use of tickets without the $200 cost of changing them to vouchers.  They refused.  Granting the request would not have cost them a dime, since the tickets have been paid.  When SW is so inflexible at this time of a surging pandemic, their customer relations can't be good under normal times. In the future, whenever possible, I will use another airline.   I hope sharing my experience can be a cautionary story for others."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Middle Seats Now Open During Pandemic,"Unbelievable how money hungry this airline is. Having the middle seat open during a pandemic when there’s possibly another strain of the coronavirus emerging and when cases are rising on a consistent basis. This is absurd, ESPECIALLY traveling from Atlanta, GA (a city where COVID-19 seems to not matter). The largest and busiest airport in America. Shame on you all. This airline is not concerned about the health and safety of passengers, just looking for financial gain during a worldwide crisis and have used the holiday season to do so. After my return flight with you all, I will not be booking anymore flights with Southwest Airlines, I’ll be forced to book with one of your competitors (most likely Delta Airlines) until the health and safety of passengers is first priority."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Air Filters on Flights Dont Save You From Poorly Managed Terminals,"Horrified by hundreds of people elbow to elbow unable to find social distance in PHX terminal C last night. Flights were waiting for late passengers. Gate agents without amplification making announcements we could not hear from outside the overcrowded terminal. We hid in the American terminal as long as we could, but as our flight time approached our choices were rent a car and drive home to Chicago or brave wading into the hundreds of people standing around also waiting to board late flights. You might be a little safer on a full flight with good air filtration, it is the terminal where you are going to have to decide if you are feeling lucky about catching Covid-19 or NOT."
Date of travel: December 2020,30,Sometimes safe,"I Think the airlines are doing a great job sometimes.  The kiosks are great but no antibacterial stations to clean hands afterworlds.  The people taking your luggage were quick and efficient.   Trying to ask someone at the gate area   a question was ridiculous!   He kept saying oh I don’t understand.  He also talked down to people on the speaker.  All gates are announcing and nobody is stating where the flight is going.  People were confused.  Understandable as people are trying to spread out and sit with their groups.  With that being said , I do not underrating the open seating with covid.  Why not sit a group of people together If they can take up an entire row?  If you are practicing to reduce the spread, enforce  more safety measures.   No wipes to wipe your tray tables or antibacterial soap anywhere to be found. And in the amount of time we loaded, there is no way they wiped the plane down.  They had maybe 10-15 minutes in between one group unloading and another loading.    Then sit by a stranger when we have 6 in our group and could all sit together.   (And we could sit anywhere on the plane.  Not looking for front row). Then one poor lady entered in last group.  She had a kid about 4 or 5 years old.  They were going to make that kid sit by himself with strangers.  One of the air line stewardess made an announcement to help them.  They entered the plane with a group of 3.  Why would you allow such careless sitting on your plane?  It is amazing to say that people can’t dine inside after riding on this plane.  With the amount of warnings and emails we received on covid, you would think more safe guard measures would be put in place.  I am just trying to figure out how you made things safer?  Everyone wearing a mask?  Airline workers wearing gloves?  Your services are good  but your safety procedures get an F."
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Less than pleased,"As a person who is disabled, I would expect that airlines would understand if you need certain accomodations but this time (only my second time flying with SW) they did not.I've flown with other airlines and never had issues. You can see my disability and they allow me to do what I need to prevent the line from being held up. My 1st time flying SW they made me get out of line and change my ticket to put me in the ""needs extra time"" preboard class. Really annoying since I'm physically disabled and missing an appendage. Having dealt with that previously, the 2nd time I decided to fly back home I booked my ticket and called to make sure things were squared away so I wouldn't have hassles (especially since medically I can't tolerate a mask but still needed to fly home). I was told by customer service I was all set. Unfortunately when I checked in using the app, when I looked at my boarding pass I was not all set. They changed my connecting flight, but not my original departing flight. I called and was told there was nothing they could do, and that I would have to have them change it at the gate. 🙄I approached the gate and told them of the situation. They didn't seem to care and wouldn't change anything except add a note saying ""needs extra time"" as if that is going to do anything. So I'm extremely sorry to the people I held up while boarding to Chicago because someone wouldn't do their job. I very much am displeased with the fact that it doesn't matter if you can't wear a mask for whatever reason. Now my face is all broken out because of a reaction to whatever is used in the mask. Not to mention other mental ailments it has caused. The sad part is, I never wore one through TSA security, not in the airport and no one cared. Boarding I had to have it on but I didn't have my mask on all the way(around chin) which tells you it's all about compliance control. The flight staff was seated 2 feet in front of me staring at me but I was only told to properly wear my mask as I got off. Needless to say, my connecting flight from Chicago to Grand Rapids I ate the entire time. There are ways to still be safe without having to dress for the surgical convention runway.Maybe next time (3rd times the charm...right!?) they will have their poop in a group. 🤞"
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Fantastic,"I recently traveled to Atlanta to visit family back in August. Typically I would have flown Delta because I could have flown out of the nearest airport directly, but I wanted to give Southwest a try. I had traveled on the previously with large groups but had never done so solo. The ground staff at BWI were fantastic, very efficient and getting from the front door of the terminal to the gate only took about 10 minutes including security. Southwest has taken steps to help reduce the probability of transmission of COVID-19 aboard its aircraft. This was apparent during the boarding process as Southwest currently boards in smaller groups than it did before the pandemic began. Boarding was simple, but just make sure you take a look at your boarding pass before boarding begins so you know when to approach the podium. Gate agents and flight crew were fantastic, as had been my previous experience. Service was a bit less than usual (soft drinks were not available) although I believe Southwest had this posted on their website, but I was already aware of this regardless. I presume this will return once the pandemic winds down. The flight down to Atlanta was smooth. Some of the highlights include the free checked baggage (up to 2 per passenger up to 50lbs each) and the open seating. I would recommend Southwest more for vacation travel than business, but personally I would have been satisfied with them either way. Definitely a new go-to airline."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Flight sucks,Flight attendants are rude and disrespectful. Talking down on passengers. Never flying southwest again!!!!
Date of travel: December 2020,50,First Class as Always,"Another great trip on Southwest!   Cabin crew very accommodating, funny, and friendly as usual.  Especially considering the current travel environment due to COVID."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Sucks,"Booked 2 months ago a direct flight for March travel 2021.Get an email from SW changing my flight from a direct flight to a flight with 3 stops.Don’t waste your time booking ahead, it will only get changed to stops ranging from 2-3.Book Jet blue.  Direct inexpensive flights and you will not get flight changesAnd stops"
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Southwest Gives Excellent Service to Handicapped,"We have not flown for 12 years and were hesitant about flying with a handicapped person needing a wheelchair carrying a Medical Supplies bag.  From the Security Guard at Midway who went above and beyond to make our trip successful (too bad didnt get her name, but she worked 4th lvl right by the handicapped pkg) to the bag handlers in both airports who answered our questions not related to bags (so sweet of them). The attendants who took our Medical case on plane, and the security people who were efficient and kind.  My husband was cheerfully transported thru both airports.  Thank you for a calm, peaceful, and caring trip."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Delayed luggage and no contact,"I did check-in with two bags out of which one arrived on Boston airport and one didn't arrive. When I didn't find one, baggage service people told me that they missed it at the Dallas airport only and it will come tomorrow. I requested for delivery as I had travel from Texas which has highest number of Covid-19 cases. I wanted to quarantine myself as its not safe for people around me.  Next day I didn't received any call from the airline then I called again and they told me that your bag has arrived. I again requested for delivery but they didn't reply. they said they will call me back but it seems like no one forwarded my case ahead. Irony is they give announcement and ask for quarantine but don't take responsibility of their mistake. two days later finally I went to the airport and collected my bag. It was my first time traveling with southwest and to be honest my flight journey was great, they maintained social distancing and it was clean. but baggage facility is worst."
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Southwest (customer) Service Worth Flying With,"My son and I had the greatest pleasure of flying with Southwest Airlines on flight 6588 departing Philadelphia to go back to Atlanta. My travel date was 10/09/20. The flight attendants were great however my greatest shout out must go to the pilots !! I traveled with my son has autism and this was his second time flying since he was a baby. He did great going to Philadelphia. On the flight leaving to go back home it was a great smooth ride. As we were leaving my son stood looking into the cockpit and the pilots were so nice to him allowing him to look and even answer questions. He even took a picture!! They did not know he was autistic all they saw was a curious little boy that wanted to see the section of the plane that has all the controls😊. Thank you to the pilots and the gentleman that was with them. You truly made our flight the above and beyond experience. With the pandemic and racism plaguing our country you showed such great hospitality and kindness to him giving hope that we still have wonderful people that live in America even if their skin color is different from yours! Kudos to you Southwest for providing exceptional service!! I thank you from the bottom of my heart!! I have always had the best experience with Southwest but this act of kindness put you on top of all other airlines. The Southwest staff was a pleasure from welcoming the passengers onboard to the delightful and amusing at they  announced the safety protocols. One passenger ask the staff member while boarding was his seat first class and the gentleman replied, “all our seats are first class” and the passenger smiled."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Destroyed Luggage,"My luggage was ripped and torn to the point where the contents of my bag were exposed when I took it off the belt after returning to my city on a Saturday night.. I called Customer Service on Monday morning to report it and was told that I had reported this after the 4 hour window so they would submit an exception of some sort. A day or two later I received notifcation that my claim would not be processed and they were not liable for any damage. After pleading my case about this policy not being appropiately posted on their app or the itinerary outling my trip in addition to me not being a seasoned traveler so I was completely unaware of this ""rule""I was met again with rejection. I submited multiple photos that I took at the airport with the corousel in the background proving that the damage occured at the airport so I was hoping at minimum to recieve at least a small amount of reimbursement or at least a credit back to my credit card  for a small amount. I don't have expensive luggage so it's not like I was looking to receive hundreds of dollars in reimbursement for damage. Instead I received a ""Luv Voucher"" for $50 off my next filght to which I responded that I would NOT be using this and should have received this as a credit on my credit card as this only benefits THEM that I use their airline again. I also experessed that I wouldn't be chosing them again for air travel. The repsonse? An email stating that my case had been closed. No further apologies or any attempt to rectify the situation. I was basically given the finger and the feeling is mutual."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Best flight attendant ever!,"My husband, service dog Oakley and I recently flew on southwest to las Vegas and got married. Our flight there was just as memorable as our trip! It wouldn't have been the same without Troy Hubler as our flight attendant! He absolutely loved Oakley and was talking to us being his friendly self and found out that we were getting married! Not only did Troy make us feel so special for our special day, he went above and beyond! Once we got close to landing he made us a crown out of the snack bags, and gave us a bottle of champagne and cranberry juice. He handed my husband a radio and told him to hold it... He started playing here comes the bride and also who let the dogs out for Oakley. He was by far my favorite flight attendant I have ever had and I really hope and wish to cross paths with him again! Thank you Troy Hubler for being such a kind and amazing person you're one in a million! Much love, Daniel and Jennifer Jenkins 😃"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,No refund,"In November, 2019, I paid Southwest Vacations $1,000+ for a two-person package from Washington to St. Louis for May, 2020.  In March, following the pandemic, I cancelled the reservation. Since May, I have filed multiple email requests asking about my refund.   Each time, I receive the same boilerplate response.  A month ago, I sent a registered letter.  No response.  Very disappointed inn an airline that I have previously recommended."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,I only travel Southwest,I have tried others like Delta American but Southwest is the best. More leg room and better price by far!! And the fact i can bring my cat gives them more cred to me.
Date of travel: December 2020,50,COVID-19,"I cannot praise Southwest enough for the way they have handled traveling during this pandemic. I’m currently on my plane right now & there is no one in my row, no one in the row in front of me, and no one in the row behind me. Everyone is required to wear their masks and they have announced that multiple times. Thank you, Southwest!!!"
Date of travel: November 2020,40,"Very well spaced and comfortable, safe flight.","Southwest has taken a serious approach to getting back into the travel business in a safe manner by leaving middle seats blocked. Kiosk and online check in. Boarding in groups of 10 rather than 30. Requiring masks for all customers and crew. Reduced contact with mobile phone, paperless tix or paper passes to scan.  Elimination of snacks and drink orders to reduce contact and trash pickup on short flights. Detailed info available online to answer any question we had. The flight was quick, safe and comfortable."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Rude to my pregnant wife!!!!!,Be aware there that seating is open to first come first serve with Southwest Airlines. My wife is 6 months pregnant and dealing with some complications. Our only request was to sit together on the plane. That request was rudely denied by the customer service agent because my wife did not have a medical condition documented by a doctor beforehand. I guess her baby bump was not enough proof. We will never be using Southwest again. Their business model assumes that everyone who travels is single and travels alone at all times.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Vibrating Window & Attendants Talk of Suicide,Filed complaint. 29 days later they respond and say that all is ok. Picture shows what I had to do to fix the window myself because they wouldnt do anything. Avoid this airline at all costs.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Let down,"Southwest totally let me down today. I live in Washington DC which has many airports in the area. I went to the wrong airport and had to switch my flight to a later one. Then my original flight was delayed. I had the opportunity to get on it and get home early. The flight was not packed but they would not let me on. They were curt and cold and could not explain their protocol. I had already paid for the flight, a transfer of a ticket and was not checking a bag. They said the only way I could get back on to my original flight was if I paid another $200."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"Do not fly SouthWest, choose Delta","No regard for passengers'time. My flight was cancelled suddenly and I was rebooked to a very inconvenient date without my knowledge. What do I get? The ability to choose another date for free as if that can make up for me 1)waking up at 2 and getting dressed for a 6am flight, 2) making plans with my husband who has a very busy schedule to pick me up and 3) Changing those plans that will not only inconvenience me but my husband. Well how about the date I already chose?!! They don't deserve your money. They may be cheap but choose some other airline."

Date of travel: November 2020,10,Horrible Gate Experience,"I was scheduled to fly from PHX to DTW in early November 2020. When I attempted to board my flight the gate agent publicly and very rudely announced I could not board the flight because I had too many carry on items. I had a small suitcase, a waist belt (similar to a money or passport belt), a mini backpack about the size of an average shoe box and a plastic bag with food for the flight and a fleece jacket. When I left Phoenix the temps were near 90. When I arrived Detroit 4 hours later the temps were about 45 degrees making a jacket mandatory. I was never given an opportunity to combine any of my offending items and instead was told to ""go over there and check something."" Since when is taking food on a plane to eat in flight considered a carry on item? Since when is a jacket considered a carry on item? Since when is a waist belt, which took up no more space than a belt on my pants, considered a carry on item? I get the suitcase and the mini backpack being considered my 2 carry on items but the bag with the food and the jacket and my waist belt? No. I was horrified to be embarrassed in front of other passengers. I was never rude with the gate attendant as she was with me. Was this a race issue? I'm not sure. I filed a complaint with Southwest and in essence, was blamed for having too many carry on items. I was given an insincere apology and no words of assurance that the gate agent would be counseled or receive training or even that her behavior was as abhorrent as I found it. I found the response from the person at Southwest to be inadequate."

Date of travel: November 2020,10,Discrimination (KIDS WITH AUTISM),"Good morning My name is michael Deon fisher, today I had one of the most painful and hurtful situation happen to me. Getting ready to board a flight to Dallas, Tx to visit my father n law & family with my wife, twins girls(Both our diagnosed with autism) and my 8year old step-son. We was denied boarding due to omy girls not wanting to keep the face mask cover over her nose and mouth. They did in fact have on a face guard cover that went all the way down covering both their mouths and noses that came down to their chins. We was flying with Southwest Airlines out of LAX AIRPORT. We try to keep it on them, which started to make them cry and irritated. Kids dealing with autism have different mode swing and easy for certain stuff to tigger them. It’s not right that they can let kids under 2 who probably does or don’t have disability on the plan without face guard. A 1 year or 2 year even newborn can received and give to somebody so what make them different from 3yr old to 40,50,60,70 year old person or etc. it’s not right or fair in so many ways. To watch both of girls cry and my 8 year cry because we couldn’t get on the plane....because his siblings have disability that’s already hurt on us. Into to go to airport were we shouldn’t be discrimination upon on. They don’t know what we go through and th emotional and mental battles we fight everyday to give our children’s a normal life. It’s not fair. They say they go by the CDC guidelines , I never heard the CDC doctors say this disease only affect people the age of 2 & up. This incident was embarrassing and hurtful. We can walk around their terminal with just the shell on and check our bags in but when time to fly they need face mask. I’m hurt and I want justice done. Because they don’t know what we feeling and to messed our holiday weekend up. It’s not right.Ps. I had to put a like becuz that’s the only way they willPost this. They don’t deserve NOTHING!!!Michael fisher"
Date of travel: November 2020,40,Good Flight on Southwest,"Southwest Airlines Flight 920PDX-DEN11:20 am-4:45 pm Boeing 737-800This flight from Denver to Philadelphia was the second leg of a trip home from Portland, and after a much more chaotic experience on our first flight from Portland to Denver, this flight was a breeze. It was a flight with good service, a nice newer aircraft, and an early arrival at PHL.Denver Airport was surprisingly busy on the day we were there, which we did not anticipate in the middle of the pandemic, but it was easy enough to connect between Southwest flights, since they’re all in the same concourse. Boarding for this flight began right on time, and just like on our other flight, the gate agent announced that due to Covid, the normal lining up by boarding number would not occur. Instead, they would just call 5 boarding numbers at a time to proceed directly to the gate for boarding. I actually thought this was generally easier than forcing everyone to line up by number and cram in with their luggage between the marked poles in the boarding area. I’d prefer if it just stayed this way even after the pandemic.We had boarding positions A45 and A46 and were able to get a row quite close to the front of the aircraft. Since Southwest is currently blocking middle seats, it was nice to know that we’d have the entire row to ourselves. I also noticed that this plane had one of the newer Southwest interiors, which we had not had on any previous Southwest flight. My wife and I both commented that although the seats seemed a bit less cushioned than on the older Southwest planes, they were equally comfortable, and the overall space and legroom seemed even better with these thinner seats.The aircraft was very hot throughout the boarding process, and one of the flight attendants made an announcement saying that they were hoping to get it working once we left the gate. I thought the plane remained hot throughout the flight, but it got a little better once we were en route. In-flight service on this flight was good, and I thought the flight attendants were friendly and attentive. They came around even before we left Denver to collect any personal cleaning wipes we had used to clean our seats, and the in-flight service, while stripped down as compared to the past, was efficient. Southwest is currently only offering cups of water for a beverage, along with their standard snack mix, which is fine for me. They also came around at least two additional times with more water if anyone wanted it over the course of this 3.5 hour flight, which was nice.Wifi was available throughout the flight, and features a variety of free movies and tv shows to stream, and you can also sign-on to get access to iMessage and Whatsapp for free using the wifi, which is a good way to stay connected in the air. I also like that you can see a map of exactly where the plane is throughout the flight using the wifi. The only other amenity that would have been helpful to have is an outlet to charge your phone during the flight, which was not offered.I really had no complaints about the flight itself, particularly since we ultimately arrived in Philadelphia 30 minutes early. It was a pretty standard Southwest flight that went well. Baggage also made its way onto the carousel within a reasonable amount of time, so we were out of the airport and on our way home earlier than we were even supposed to land originally. After a more stressful Southwest flight earlier in the morning, this flight was a pleasant experience."
Date of travel: November 2020,20,Frustrating Delayed Flight,"Southwest Airlines Flight 1204PDX-DEN6:15-9:40 am Boeing 737-800On a recent trip home from Portland to Philadelphia, our first flight of the day on Southwest from Portland to Denver was a frustrating, stressful experience when it felt like it didn’t need to be. When we arrived at PDX for our flight a little after 5:00 am, the Southwest check-in counters were quite busy, but there was an open kiosk that allowed us to immediately self-tag our bags. When we went to the bag-drop counter to drop-off our bags, the employee weighed my bag first, which came in at exactly 49.00 pounds, before weighing my wife’s suitcase, which came in just slightly above the 50-pound limit at 51.2 pounds. After noting that the one bag was overweight, she first suggested we weigh them together, and said that if they came in under 100 pounds combined, we were fine. As expected based on the initial weight, when the bags were weighed together, they came in at a combined 100.2 pounds, literally 0.2 pounds over the 100 pound limit. In my opinion, the employee was rude and just generally unreasonable, and insisted that we either pay $75 for being overweight, or get out of line and reorganize our luggage. We opted to reorganize our luggage, and very easily got them both under 50 pounds. However, the whole thing just made me angry. I totally understand that 50 pounds is technically the weight limit for each individual bag. However, Southwest also allows two checked bags per person that can be 50 pounds each, and we were only checking one each. Moreover, I’ve flown on multiple other airlines that routinely allow a pound or two over the official limit without issue. We were talking about such a minor overage in weight that the whole thing just felt silly, particularly so early in the morning. After dealing with the luggage, we were quickly through security using Precheck and off to our gate in the new Concourse E. We haven’t been to Portland previously, but I did notice that this new concourse had a lot more open space and seating at each gate than you usually find, which was great. They also seem to be working on adding a variety of new and interesting food options. Southwest uses gates that are pretty far down the concourse, so you can expect a decent walk from security to the gate at PDX.Shortly after we arrived at the gate, the gate agent announced that boarding was about to begin, and due to Covid, the normal lining up by boarding number would not occur. Instead, they would just call 5 boarding numbers at a time to proceed directly to the gate for boarding. I actually thought this was generally easier than forcing everyone to line up by number and cram in with their luggage between the marked poles in the boarding area. I’d prefer if it just stayed this way even after the pandemic.About a quarter of the way through the boarding process, I saw one of the pilots come off of the plane and say something to the gate agent about maintenance, which immediately led the gate agent to place a phone call and stop the boarding process. Shortly after that, he announced that there was a maintenance issue with the lights on the plane, which would require a very short 5-10 minute repair, which had to be fixed before we could leave. However, the problem was that their maintenance contractor was busy on another job for another airline, and that they wouldn’t be able to get to us for at least 60-90 minutes. At that point, everyone who had already gotten onto the plane de-boarded. Although I really appreciated the detailed information from the gate agent, it was extremely frustrating to find out that Southwest does not have any of its own maintenance staff at PDX, and that we would have to wait potentially 90 minutes for a very minor repair. This seemed like something that Southwest could have been better prepared for, and it was very frustrating to have gotten up so early for a flight, only to find out that the airline didn’t have the capacity to take care of a minor issue in a timely manner.The gate agent was very nice and had a good way of keeping people calm despite the frustration of the delay, which could easily have caused many passengers to miss connections in Denver. He told everyone not to rush the desk asking about connections because all re-booking due to missed connections would be handled by a centralized office in Dallas, not by the employees in Portland. He said that we would be called up individually to get new itineraries and boarding passes if the Dallas team determined that anyone needed to be rescheduled. Everyone surprisingly listened and pretty much stayed in their seats to await further directions. Looking at our own itinerary, things weren’t looking good, since the delay, which projected to be 1 hour and 45 minutes, would make our connection in Denver only 10 minutes long. It seemed unlikely we’d be able to get off the aircraft and make it across the terminal before the gate closed on our next flight, but the gate agent did say that the staff in Denver would be instructed to hold flights when possible. This made me feel better, although I wasn’t totally sure if I believed it. Once things had settled down at the gate and the process of waiting for maintenance to arrive began, the gate agent encouraged us to walk around and get food in the airport if we wanted to pass the time. We walked back down the concourse toward the security checkpoint and picked up some breakfast, and while we were there, I heard an overhead announcement instructing everyone to proceed back to the gate for boarding on the Southwest flight to Denver. Not very much time had passed since the initial delay announcement, so I was surprised, but happy, to hear this announcement. It seemed that the repair was completed more quickly than anticipated. By the time we got back to the gate, pre-boarding was already starting again.  We had boarding positions A42 and A43 and ended up snagging one of the exit rows where the window seat has no seat in front of it at all, affording amazing legroom. Between that and the fact that Southwest is currently blocking all middle seats, we had great space on this flight. We ended up leaving the gate exactly an hour late, and the flight was totally fine from that point onward. We took off immediately, made up some time in the air, and landed in Denver only about 45 minutes late, much less than the originally anticipated delay, which gave us no trouble making our connecting flight. It seemed that only one group’s connection in Denver was going to be tricky, and the crew announced that their flight was being held at the gate until they got there, which was nice. In-flight service on this flight was also perfectly fine. Southwest is currently only offering cups of water for a beverage, along with their standard snack mix, which works for me. Wifi was available throughout the flight, and features a variety of free movies and tv shows to stream, and you can also sign-on to get access to iMessage and WhatsApp for free using the wifi, which is a nice way to stay connected in the air. I also like that you can see a map of exactly where the plane is throughout the flight using the wifi. The only other amenity that would have been nice to have is an outlet to charge your phone during the flight, which the seats did not offer.Overall, once we got off the ground, this flight itself was totally fine. The seats were comfortable enough with great legroom in the exit row, along with perfectly fine service. All of our frustrations were on the ground in Portland, where we had an unnecessarily rude experience checking bags, and a frustrating delay with lots of uncertainty about when we’d be able to depart. It felt like with proper planning and staffing, the delay could have been prevented, which is not ok when people are up so early in the morning for a flight to a major connecting airport. It all worked out in the end, since we made our connection to Philadelphia without any issues, but we were stressed and frustrated getting to that point."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,HORRIBLE - THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY DUE TO COVID!!!,I just called Southwest and they won't honor money for flights that were cancelled in March due to COVID - they say they expire on December 3 - HORRIBLE AND WILL NEVER FLY WITH THEM AGAIN!!!!
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Emergency trip,"I had to purchase a ticket for me and my 7 yr old, it was kind of an emergency so i found out Tuesday i had to leave by Friday, I had never traveled through Southwest since  i always travel through JetBlue but this was an emergency, i bought the want to get away fair and after finding out that they don't assign seats, i purchased the early bird check in and it was the best choice i made, my son and i were in group A and were able to seat in front, the stop at DWI was a breeze, the gate was close and the wait was like 40 minutes, the flight was right on time and arriving at Punta Cana was also excellent, we were out of the airport in like half an hour, I will definitively be traveling with them again whenever i have to go to Punta Cana"
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Excellent customer service,Hi my name is Tiffany Hightower and I just want to thank the staff for great customer service that was given to me on November 19th. One person in particular I want to thank is Vaughn. This young man went above and beyond to help me due to me have 10 pounds over with my luggage by buying me a extra bag so that I wouldn't miss my plane. I am very grateful for me making sure that I was ok.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Mask Nazis,What the hell has happened to our country. My family was harassed the entire flight to make sure our mask was above our nose. Then they had a supervisor confront me when I got off the flight. She was nasty and rude. Southwest just became southworst in my opinion. Spend your money elsewhere!
Date of travel: November 2020,30,Improper use of travel funds,"Recently purchased a flight with Southwest Airlines. A week later, I had to cancel the reservation because my job was requiring a 14 day quarantine because of the increase in Covid-19 cases. I called to cancel, but before cancelling, I asked the representative what their cancellation policy was. Was told I had until Sept 2022 to use my reservation. It made me feel comfortable, so I cancelled. When I received the confirmation email, it said Nov 2021. It was a lie!! I phoned Southwest again on 2 separate occasions and was told the representative gave me the wrong information. Instead of honoring what was improperly told to me, they were of no help. Mind you, I was told that SW was giving this option to travelers until Sept 2020, but it expired! Why? Not a single thing has changed with the outbreak, except it got worse, so SW should continue this promo. They have lost my trust and they need to work on training personnel. There was no reason that representative should’ve told me the wrong information, esp if it expired 2 months prior. And if they tell travelers the wrong information, they need to honor what was said. Isn’t that the purpose of recording the phone calls? #TrustLost"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Crazy flight attendants,"I was removed from a flight by an unstable flight attendant. My boyfriend's mask was too small and would slide down when he talked. She came by two times and said something to him. The second time she approached and yelled at him ""I told you four times to pull your mask up. If you cant keep your mask on you will be removed from the flight."" Who is she to talk to a customer in that tone!! His response after her yelling at him and threatening to kick us off was. ""I'm trying to keep my mak up. Dont you have something better to do. Well, that. pissed her off so she went to the pilot and had him pull the plain back up to boarding. This was humiliating and uncalled for. We took 4 flights with southwest that week with no issue. I'm still amazed that one person can make that decision. If flight attendants have that much authority maybe they need to go through a mental evaluation before getting hired. We all are going through a hard time right now. Kindness and compassion can go a long way. No one would listen to us. It was cut and dry she wanted us off so they kicked us off. I will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Really good flight,"Really good flight! It was a short flight, but boarding, checkin, deplaning and the staff were fantastic. The seats were comfortable, everyone wore their mask, inflight entertainment was amazing and I am beyond happy the middle seats are still closed."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Go-To For Short Haul Flights,"There's actually a lot to like about SW. If you fly them with any regularity you probably already know this. My most recent flight a week ago was a quick in/out one day turnaround affair so not much at all to report.The middle seats were still open BUT SW sent out the presser that as of 12.1.2020 they will again be filling those middle seats so with more than halfway thru the month time is of the essence if that matters to you. It certainly did to me, just from a space factor standpoint aside from Covid.Remember, we're talking airlines here so... none are perfect but as domestic flights go you could certainly do worse. Another satisfactory (if wholly uneventful) trip on SW. In airline lingo 'uneventful' is actually a good thing."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Thank you Holly for your excellent service,"We can’t thank Holly, the SWA customer service rep enough for her kindness in getting 3 of us- 3 different confirmation numbers- onto the same flight on this awful day! We drove up to TPA trying to get ahead of Hurricane Eta, unknown to us that the airport was closing at 3p that day to all flights. Thankfully we arrived in time to get on a flight 45min later, thanks to Holly❤️. Otherwise, we would’ve been stuck in TPA an extra day! For this, we remain faithful SWA flyers! Thank you SWA for your excellent customer service and safe travels that horrible travel day 11/11/2020."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Excellent Steward,"Christian, aka “Tiny” made our morning on 11/4 from LAS to DAL awesome with his sunny disposition! His charm and charisma made us feel welcomed on this flight! We joked with him as he walked onto the plane in Las Vegas and before we took off about ‘sharing is caring,’ so Christian, if you see this, you’ll know what this is all about❤️ you are the best and you made our day! Thank you for being you🤗"
Date of travel: November 2020,40,Good flight,"Short flight, but it went well. I was a little uncomfortable with multiple large and small dogs traveling inside the cabin, but otherwise it was great. Boarding and checkin was fantastic, the middle seats are still open (thank God)! This really should continue at least until the beginning of next year when hopefully covid is better controlled because I will not fly after Nov 30th if this is changed! Mask were worn (a few people incorrectly and not covering their nose, but overall it was good). In-flight entertainment is one of the best!! Fantastic experience!"
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Great experience,"I love this airline! The checkin and boarding process was smooth (even with covid). I love open seating, free in-flight entertainment and snacks!! The staff were nice and the pilots were amazing (my takeoff and landing were seamless)."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Refund due to military,I bought a non-refundable ticket for my son to come home for the first time in three years since he is in the military.  He got denied leave after he was giving leave and wouldn't be home again for Christmas.  Southwest refunded me all my money because he is in the military.  American Airlines refused.  Thank you Southwest for my refund even though I wish I could have finally had my son home.  I will always go through you for future flights
Date of travel: November 2020,10,No mask & packed flight! Beware,Don’t fly them! Seat packed. Face mask announced only. No reminders for folks to put up face mask. Flight attendant just ignored. When leaving I said something to them & just had a rude reply that they r not in charge of policy reinforcement?? What?? U can’t state as I finally did excuse me can u please put your face mask on.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Mask,Yes I fly to southwest both in July and October to Puerto Rico and both times I observed the behavior of mask use. Every time I enter both airports I wear my KN95 and on the flight not for one moment I take it if unless I am off the airport outside. It is clear that the tell us to keep our mask on all the time but that is not the case when you sit inside the airplane 35 minutes after take off. They offer a cup of water an a little back of snacks and as soon they do that everybody takes their masks off and breath the same air and that’s where I don’t feel comfortable.I would like to see no food or water offer on the plane do to COVID-19 until it is safe in the future to do so. Thanks
Date of travel: January 2020,10,NO EMPATHY!,I change tickets for better rate and i lost the extra $139 dollars difference. For them is nothing but i worked hard to make that money! Not fair
Date of travel: October 2020,30,Ordinarily I would rate Southwest 5 stars but...,"Normally I give Southwest 5 stars but not this time.  In August I booked a flight on Southwest advertised as NON STOP but less than 10 days after booking I was informed that my flight was no longer a non-stop but my trip from Detroit to Las Vegas would be routed through Baltimore outgoing and Kansas City & Louisville on my return.  I purposely booked this flight because it was non stop. While I fully understood when purchasing my ticket that Southwest reserves the right to change, alter or cancel flights I feel this was a 'bait & switch' situation. I should have been suspicious...Southwest has not flown non-stop from Detroit to Vegas since 2018. When I contacted customer service with my complaint they did not deny my allegations but did offer me the option of a full refund. No, I didn't take the refund - $198 round trip airfare Detroit to Vegas is hard to find!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Awful customer service during COVID,"I have always flown SW and had pretty good luck with them until recently. I had a credit that was about to expire, I went to book a flight online and my credit would not go through and I was told to call. After calling they had to ""look into somethings"" I didn't get a call back for over 2 weeks, and I was calling them everyday!!! By then my credit was expired and they said they only thing they could do was give me the credit back minus $100!!! I talked to about 10 different people, all with AWFUL customer service! This is not ok, especially during such hard times. I will NEVER be flying with this awful company again!!!"
Date of travel: October 2020,30,Had a lot better! Overall not so bad...,Major disappointment with no booze on a Vegas flight! Didnt catch that when we booked the flight. We survived though! Flights were ontime so thats always a plus. Its kinda nice having the center seats left open for social distance though i think that is mandatorywith all airlines. Definitely makes for a more comfortable flight. We couldn't beat the price really and we tried so all in all not to bad for the price! We made it to our destination and home on time and in good health.
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Enforce your COVID-19 policies!!,"I am usually always very impressed with Southwest Airlines. In the past, I have experienced little to no cancellations, extra baggage fees, or any other problems. However, the behavior that I experienced on my flight coming back from Las Vegas after my wedding week was atrocious. Southwest Airlines allowed 4 grown men who were already on a final warning as far as mask wearing policies are concerned to not only board my plane, but to stay on it for the nearly 4 hr trip! Yes, the flight attendants did attempt to enforce the rules, but nothing they did helped at all. The tone they used did not sound serious and they did not mention that they could and should have literally been kicked off of the flight. I understand that there is only so much businesses can do to enforce COVID-19 policies, but this entire situation was shameful! Letting 4 obnoxious grown men walk all over them and spit on their health and safety policies is something that should not be taken lightly. I can provide full size pictures and details to the airline for proof if Southwest is willing to reach out to me. So far, the channels I have used to report this breach of health and safety have fallen on deaf ears."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Southwest Piling On Businesses Hurting From Covid-19,"I own a home care agency on the front lines of pandemic care. Myself and two employees were scheduled to attend a conference in Houston in April. It got rescheduled to Nov and has now been canceled indefinitely because of the City of Houston's Covid protocols.I called Southwest to get a refund. They said their policy for my flight was a credit toward future flights. Then they hit me with the non-transferrability policy. They won't credit the funds to the purchaser...Me/My Business. They will ONLY transfer the funds to the individual fliers...my EMPLOYEES. This is ludacris. I paid with a business card and they were all booked at the same time by me, but they will only give my money away to the employees?If this were the normal world, I get it. No one saw this coming. I'm not asking to be given anything, just not harmed. This is sad. Can't continue to use Southwest going forward...no soul."
Date of travel: November 2020,40,No snack service for short flight,Decided to do a daytrip in Vegas for Halloween although didn’t see much of the costumes since I didn’t spend the evening there. Enjoyed the no rush feel of Long Beach airport and the ease to get there. The flight had a fog delay. Since it was a short flight there was no snack service in these COVID times. The capacity was reduced so that no middles seats were used unless you were traveling with somebody you knew. Oh for those who want a view of the strip when leaving sit on the right side of the plane
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Don't care for customers during COVID,"I WAS a regular customer of Southwest before COVID but they way they are handling COVID is horrible. I have flight credit that expires 11/18 and they won't let me book a flight now (10/29) for 12/3 even though I tried to use the credit earlier this year but couldn't because of COVID. I researched online to see if they extended the flight credit deadline because of COVID and they did all the way to 2022 for people whose credit expires from March 1, 2020-September 7th 2020 BUT when I call to extend my credit which doe not expire more than 3 MONTHS LATER, they refuse.  You can't pick and choose which customers you treat right. Very disappointed and will no longer be flying Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Purchased tickets for roundtrip and delayed flights due to COVID-19. Southwest sent email that I could fly at a later.,"probably further consider that anyone that are or has been military afflicted would be valued to this country. What is important is that decisions and opinions when interpreted in writing are obvious statements that has an impact on individual lives. It cannot be denied that some airlines will use their authority in self-serving ways. Prior to the COVID 19 epidemic I had booked tickets on Southwest Airlines. For years I had been traveling with them and THOUGHT I had finally found a TRUSTWORTHY and RESPECTFUL airline as a veteran. The reservations were canceled due to the COVID high peak outbreak. Southwest sent an email stating that I had a grace period until fiscal year 2021 to utilize the canceled tickets due to the COVID issue. Relying strictly upon the email I decided to rebook other reservations for the prior paid airline tickets. Well the fabricators and manipulators that has a vested interest in misleading the general public L-I-E-D! Well when you want to confuse and distract through deception what better way to do it during the COVID 19 epidemic I called the airline and was told that the tickets were NO GOOD and I would have to pay $100 dollars additional to make new reservations although, I lost $88 dollars. Now they want to push their BAILOUT strategy and use their platform of perceived creditability while constantly using deceptive tactics for financial gain."
Date of travel: October 2020,50,As safe as it can be during covid times,"Empty middle seats make less crowded gates & less crowded planes. All the staff wore masks and appropriate masking was enforced. Flew home on American Airlines due to hurricane & no masking enforcement, crowded flights, hugely crowded gates, and employees not appropriately covering noses with masks. What a contrast to southwest! Will only fly with a responsible company like southwest in the future."
Date of travel: October 2020,30,Disappointing change in attitudes,"I fly SWA a few times a year and recently I’ve noticed a big change in attitude among the employees. I understand that due to COVID-19 restrictions things are, and will be, different. However, the entire airline has lost its “style” of customer relations. Very few smiles. Almost no interaction with passengers. Minimal effort to assist flyers. And with COVID-19 restrictions, social distancing is mentioned but is NOT being enforced while lining up for boarding or when de boarding the planes. It’s a free for all in the aisles. This isn’t a recent change; it’s been happening over the last year or so and seems to be getting worse. Southwest needs to regain their reputation of being a more enjoyable experience."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Discontinued flight after purchase,"I was sent emails about a sale, and found good prices on direct flights.  But a week after my purchase they discontinued the flights i baught."
Date of travel: October 2020,50,recent trip to Colorado,"We took a direct flight from Orlando to Denver. The best thing about Southwest is they allow you to check two bags for free !  Why don't the other airlines do this ?Our return flight was cancelled due to a snow storm coming in, however, Southwest was able to get us on an earlier flight before the storm really hit. We got home earlier than previously anticipated. I highly recommend Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Southwest airline discrimination,If you support Trump you will be harassed and they will try everything to have you removed from their plane. I will never fly with them again. EVER!!!!!!!----
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Nor Cal to Los Cabos,"We took the whole family to Cabo this year for working so hard on Covid 19 and hand sanitizer production.  Half the family flew Southwest and the other half another American Airlines company.  Both did a good job and were on time both ways.  But, I was the only one who flew on both.  There was a difference.Southwest left the middle seats open and the personality of the staff made a big difference.  SWA just gets it.  Nobody enjoys facemasks for hours on end, but having a person smile under the mask comes through.  Great flights, great people... and a great price.  Winning!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,dont check your bags,"had to check one of my bags which they messed up and never forwarded them from my connecting flight in denver. I was told when I got to Reno that it wouldn't make it till the next day. so I drove home and figured they would send it to me given the problem was entirely their fault.  I was wrong I got the call the next day that my bag had made it to reno BUT they would not be sending it to me even though it was the baggage checkers fault.  she then explained that even though she was in fact not there to check in my bag and had never talked to the people that did that I was lying and that it was somehow my fault for not explaining to the employees how to do their job, which is weird because I was never trained on how to work for southwest. she finished by telling me that if I wanted my valuables that they misplaced I would have to take another day off work and drive 140 miles round trip to reno and back if I wanted it otherwise they would be getting rid of it.  now I've flown with many airlines but this is by far the worst customer service of them all it probably is the worst customer service I've ever dealt with and that includes phone and cable companies.  dont believe their promise they will do absolutely nothing it says and I'm my experience actually do the exact opposite."
Date of travel: October 2020,40,Good experience,"Had to fly on total of 4 different flights to go to Manchester, NH and back.  All flights were pleasant considering we had to wear the masks due to covid.  Being 6'2"" sitting in the exit row was an enjoyable experience.  Attendants were pleasant and flight was  smooth.  Was able to read during entire flight and did not realize we were landing till the normal jerking when the wheels hit the runway."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Worst Airlines Ever!,"Southwest Airlines is terrible.  On my recent trip I saw 2 elderly women that were not allowed to board for no reason other than a SWA Rep had zero customer service. SWA was behind in schedules and cancelled flights due to weather conditions. SWA staff were overwhelmed and  not able to resolve its overbooked and cancelled flights thus when one of the elderly females advised staff that they needed to get to their destination asap- the staff rudely said ""well then that's too bad because you are not getting there"" and he refused to allow them to board the plane! It was late in the evening and the last flight out of the airport. The two elderly women had flown from LA to San Jose to change flights thus they were left at the airport during a layover with no place to go- all because of some rude heartless SWA Rep who lacked compassion, empathy and customer service. All of us passengers agreed that SWA is the worst and only travel SWA when there are no other alternatives. SWA treats passengers as cattle."
n/a,10,Do Not Fly Southwest!,"Wow! I Am an A lister with a companion pass and I can't believe what ass@#les they have become! On our flight I had my mask on correctly and this flight attendant was on my butt pointing her finger and threatening me! Three times during the flight she woke me up to remind me that my mask has to be on and it was! Wow...done with Southwest. Bye, bye!"
Date of travel: September 2020,50,My favorite airline to fly now!,"I am a very experienced  business traveler. Southwest is now my favorite airline! You know exactly how much the flight cost is and they include luggage! This trip was  for personal travel but after the last few trips with Southwest, they have earned all my future business."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Wrecked our trip. Taking COVID TOO FAR,"Last week, my husband and I flew Southwest to Orlando. Flight was good until the end. The flight attendant had the supervisors call the cops on us. There was 4 cops & 2 supervisors waiting for us in the gate when you walk off the plane. Obviously face masks are required during the flight, unless you were eating or drinking. During the flight, my husband fell asleep and I put my earbuds in and started drawing. He slept with a neck pillow and his face mask would catch on the pillow and slightly fall lower than his nose. The flight attendant woke him up a couple times and asked him to pull it back up. He apologized and went back to sleep. As far me, I went into my purse to grab 2 mints and a protein bar. I pulled my face mask down to put the mint in my mouth. The flight attendant snapped and told me to put my mask back on, I said I was eating. She said, “it’s only a mint and if this is going to be an issue, I’ll call the supervisor!” And stormed off. We land and get off the plane only to be greeted by the cops. The cops questioned us on what happened on the flight. The cop told us that face to face conflict/confrontation was reported from the flight attendant and that’s why they were called. The supervisor looked up our return flight and revoked them. All over sleeping and eating a mint. The flight attendant might have had a bad day but it’s not enough justification to go out of your way to wreck our trip. Her behavior is unacceptable. I understand you want to keep everyone safe. But you’re taking it too far. Not once did we raise our voice, or stand up and cause issues. Revoking our tickets over something this small, is unbelievable. If it’s that big of deal to eat on the flight, then stop serving water and snacks. Southwest, I want to truly thank you from the bottom of my heart for blowing things out of context and wrecking our trip. We cannot thank you enough for your unbelievable customer service!!"
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Karen in charge of Southwest Airlines? ,"Southwest has turned into Mask-a-topia airlines —replete with Karen’s lecturing you continually through the flight not to let up on masking of face and nose even while eating because —you know — “we are watching you.”  I found the steward’s virtue signaling lectures about our responsibility to not be selfish, think of others, and cover your nose —to the point of telling a masked customer to completely cover his nose or they would turn around the plane (himself not social distancing),   I found it all tiresome, condescending, and hectoring. Flying has become even more joyless on southwest —no Airconditioning until flight.  I will be cutting back by half my trips on southwest until customer satisfaction again becomes paramount —and I’m not holding my breath for a new policy —most airlines are going hat in hand to government for subsidies —to h~ll with customers paying the bill. Socialism here we come. Enjoy the journey down."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Failed to provide refund,I was scheduled with my son to fly to Phoenix on 10/23/20 (reservation #MMZ2I2). I cancelled those flights due to moving to Arizona. The cost of the flights was to be refunded to my account. I went to book flights for my children from Burbank to Phoenix and the money was not available on my account to use. Contacted Southwest and spoke to Robin (who refused to provide any further information) who was unwilling to help or transfer the call to a higher person.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Got Ripped Off,"Back in January I changed the date of a trip. The only way to get the change in cost was a credit that expired 10/9/20. Obviously I have been unable to use it. When I called to see what they could do, they were only able to extend it by charging a $100 processing fee.  It was over half the credit!  Guess we’re not ALL in this together."
Date of travel: October 2020,50,We have become loyal Southwest Airline customers,"I have flown Southwest twice in the past 6 weeks.  My husband and I have become loyal Southwest Customers for the ease of changing flights.  The person I talked to Oct. 5 as I canceled one flight and changed another was worth my telephone wait.  I also have learned when on hold, place the phone on speaker and go about doing chores about the house, being it is gardening, watering plants outside, cleaning, dusting, washing dishes(highly recommend washing dishes during covid as having your hands in soapy water kills the virus), etc. Southwest's reservations, customer service representatives are polite and sincere.  Southwest also keeps the middle seat open at this time, that gives me a little extra happy thoughts in preventing covid.  I do use my own Santi wipes to wipe down the area about me.  So nice to be able to check bag for free!  Also no fee for carry on.  Thank you Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,"Unamerican, unfair.","Just witnessed flight attendant harass and kick passenger off a flight because they removed their mask to eat .  They picked on that particular passenger because he had a TRUMP hat on.  Everyone around him [it's on video] even told the crewmen that the man only removed his mask while he was eating.That was Pure and simple unamerican. Like Trump or hate him, he is the president and those exercising their right to support their president shouldn't be discriminated against.  Won't ever fly SW or recommend to anyone after that incident."
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Mask Policy not being enforced,"What is the point of policies if they aren't going to be enforced at all. A number of times they noted the policy that you had to have a mask over your nose and mouth unless you were 'actively' eating or drinking. However, from the few rows I could see near me there was one passenger that had his mask off all of boarding, through takeoff, and nearly an hour into the flight. The stewardesses past by 3 times and said nothing. The person has  bottle of soda on his tray table that he was sipping every 5 minutes or so. Also, his tray table was down with a tablet playing a movie all through takeoff. After an hour or so I went up to speak to the stewardesses and i got 'they are allowed to if they are eating or drinking'. I pushed and she said she'd speak to him. After that the passengert wore his mask the rest of the flight, but why did I need to speak up to get the policy enforced. Also another passenger had his mask only over his mouth the entire flight. This saddens me as I have enjoyed flying with Southwest for decades."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Terrible Jacksonville southwest employee split me up from my children while boarding us!!,"While in Jacksonville we were treated terribly by the employee boarding us at the gate. He allowed my oldest son to get split from us then when I told my son to save us seats this employee snapped back at us that ""this ain't a school bus"" I responded that we were traveling as a family and again he snapped back with ""um yea but you ain't gotta sit with them,"" to which I replied yes these are my children and I would absolutely prefer too. Absolutely unprofessional and ridiculously rude employee!! Not at all comforting to know that they will split mothers from children that they are traveling with and give you attitude before getting on what may be a nervous flight already!!"
Date of travel: October 2020,30,"If you will change your customer's flights, please make sure you are changing to an equivalent one!!!!","Im a faithful southwest customer, however, I'm so disappointed with this company right now! I booked 4 direct flights months ago (round trip for my husband and I), the airline changed the flights many times and changed to a flight with several stops! I complained the first time and was told they couldn't do nothing. My flight changed again and they are charging a crazy fee for me to change the flights to direct flights again! Unbelievable, I didn't change the flights, THEY  did and somehow I have to pay more for a type of flight I already had. So frustrating"
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Pilot and Staff went above and beyond with my son,"My son boarded the flight alone to visit his dad. Once everyone was boarded the pilot/captain himself came out with my sons nintendo switch in had. I was concerned my son was misbehaving but he said ""everyone loves the little guy, we were just trying to figure out how to operate this"". I showed him and was floored at how attentive and caring this staff was. Thank you Southwest, I was so concerned until that moment. You have great people working there, thank you!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Masks required?  NOPE!,"We have always had great service on Southwest.  We decided, based on their promises of masks required, to travel last month.  The terminal at PHX was jam packed - NO social distancing, no chairs blocked off.  After a visibly ill man sat down one chair over from me and removed his mask I put a second mask over my first one.  This man was on the same flight.The boarding process went OK with groups of 10 boarding at one time instead of groups of 30.  Middle seats were empty, as advertised.At pushback from the gate my husband asked a flight attendant to tell the man diagonal in front of us to put on his mask.  Nope!  The guy was eating an enormous bag of snack mix one tiny piece at a time.  The flight attendant said he is not allowed to disturb anyone actively eating.  Uh huh.  I see.  Once the man closed up the bag and put it away his mask remained off.  FOR THE ENTIRE 2 HOUR FLIGHT!  All 4 members of the flight crew walked past this man and at no point did any of them ever tell him to cover his mouth and nose.  There were 2 different in flight announcements that this man ignored.  At one point a flight attendant literally reached across him to take trash from the passenger in the window seat yet chose to ignore his mask under his nose.  The fact that I could see this man with his mask off the entire flight is a pretty clear indication that masks are NOT required, even when the flight crew is notified.  I have no idea how many other people had their masks off the entire time.  This is NOT a policy AT ALL.  This is a blatant lie that SW is using to lure people into flying.  Yes, we accepted the risks inherent with travel during a plague.  SW increased those risks with their refusal to enforce their own ""rules"".  Don't want to wear a mask?  Don't!  Nobody will challenge you!  SW is completely unconcerned with keeping passengers safe.  The flight crew did not care.  SW did not care when I contacted them as soon as we got off of the plane.  They said they were sorry I was uncomfortable.  Really?  You are blaming this on ME?   I will never trust SW Airlines again."
Date of travel: October 2020,50,So friendly to DOGS!,"My first time traveling with a dog on my flight... I always fly Southwest, but never had a dog along before...So... We boarded the plane, I chose a window seat. I was petting my teacup chihuahua inside her soft carry-kennel though an opening on the top. Unfortunately I didn’t zip the top all the way closed.  I get my neck pillow out and start to snooze against the window. I barely hear someone on the overhead speaker asking who lost a dog!!!!! I wake up and look and one of the flight attendants is walking up and down the aisles holding my chihuahua!I stand up and claim her. LUCKILY all the flight attendants are DYING LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. Thank God they weren’t angry or mean at all.This was my first time having a dog on a plane! Failed miserably!!!! LolBut sooo thankful for the friendly staff that understood I know the rules and simply made an assumption. Thankful, as usual for the compassionate and helpful Southwest Airlines staff!"
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Great and very safe travel experience every time!,"I flew from BWI to LAX this past September and flew back from Los Angeles to Baltimore with a transfer in Kansas City. On all of the flights I’ve been on, the Southwest was very pleasant and made sure the plane was kept tidy and clean. I also appreciate how the airline took the precaution to keep one seat empty between all of the travelers. I would definitely recommend travel with Southwest."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Love Southwest,"Southwest is my favorite airline. The staff is happy, funny, and nice.  During this special time, they can still keep up with the standard."
Date of travel: October 2020,40,Great with Middle Seat Blocked,"We have flown Southwest Airlines twice during the COVID restrictions. The middle seat is held open, so it was fairly comfortable. Once the middle seat is filled again, it will be pretty cramped. Snacks and water were provided. Seating was open and you board by the category indicated on your boarding pass. The whole process was very calm and civilized. They keep you well informed during the boarding process and of anything happening in the air. In all, personnel were unfailingly friendly and personable."
n/a,10,Not dependable,They have changed our flight times twice now like hotel and car rentals aren't dependent upon the flight! They refuse to reimburse and offer no solutions. They finally hung up on us when trying to speak to a manager. We were surprised to get that far after an hour wait time. I have been a loyal and practically exclusive SW customer. I cannot anymore.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Cancellation Confusion,"Let me start by saying I’ve always been a huge Southwest fan. I love their courtesy and they try to make the flying experience pleasant even during this pandemic.  However yesterday they changed 6 of my flights.   One change had me connecting while I was on the first leg of the  flight.  I was notified of these changes throughout the day. Whenever I was notified,  I would go onto their website to change it but several times the system told me to call SWA.  Unfortunately this involved several calls - one  a 128 minute wait with no callback option. It’s now 3 in the morning but I was” only”  on hold 45 minutes. Their call center employee was very helpful but it’s not good to have customers waste so  much of their time.  I’m sure during this pandemic it is difficult to schedule but it’s unsettling that you can’t make plans with confidence that those flights will truly be there. Southwest I’m disappointed."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Slow service,"Never had a customer service rep pick up in less than an hour wait. Called multiple times and always experienced a long wait. After getting on the phone with them, they failed to send the confirmation email, so now I need to call again."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,UNBELIEVABLE!!,"When boarding my mask was just under my nose but covering my mouth.  In the Florida heat its hard to breath with it covering your entire nose walking down to the plane.  When seating a flight attendant asked me once I got settled to make sure my mask is covering my nose as well.  So I sat down and did what she asked.  Within minutes I was falling asleep when I was woken up by the same flight attendant asking if I had a problem with following the rules.  In disbelief and not sure what the problem was now I asked what the problem was.  Apparently my mask wasn't over the bridge of my nose good enough for her.  So I fixed and said these masks suck.  Not sure what she heard but she walked away mumbling something.  So I gently put my head back and made sure my mask was all the way up.  I was asleep completely out when I get woken up by another flight attendant mumbling words to me that I could not understand.  Finally I was able to understand what he was saying and it was about my mask again.  This time it was completely covering my mouth and nose, so I said I don't know what the problem is now.  He kept on harassing me about the mask I was wearing completely covering my nose and mouth.  So finally I just said I'm wearing it and please leave me alone, I'm sleeping.   He walked away and few minutes later TSA came in and removed me from the plane.  To say the least I will never fly Southwest again!"
Date of travel: September 2020,20,Im done with Southwest,I cant believe they keep changing my trip adding additional stops and time to my trip. They dont care about the customer This is my last trip with Southwest they have raised the price anyway so they are close to every other airline out there.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Just be honest,"For two years now I travel to Nevada. Each time I chose a non stop flight. Each year my flight is changed to a lay over in Las Vegas. I understand these are interesting times we live in, but lets be honest. Southwest should stop offering non stop flights on that route. If it was not a big deal in my life I would not be writing. I have back issues and on and off planes is a chore. I get that Southwest is bigger and badder then ever. Get back to the basic's. I am tired of having my flights changed. I will be looking at other airlines for this route and it may be worth it to pay a higher price for the NON STOP flight The last thing I want to say is. I paid for EARLY CHECK IN , I had to RE purchase this 25$ luxury again. It is a waste of money and Southwest should be ashamed of themselves for being a ripoff artist."
Date of travel: September 2020,40,Good job enforcing Covid precautions at the gate and on board; right on time too.,The staff made numerous instructions keeping the passengers distanced as best they could. The flight was full and on time.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Stranded by Southwest Airlines in Portland Maine,"Bumped from my 2pm flight to 6:25 am weeks ahead of my trip. Started my journey home at 3:30 am. Arrived at airport at 4:45 am. Daughter turned in rental. I waited to check the bags.  What???...first leg of flight to BWI is cancelled.  And there are no flights anywhere. Everything is sold out. It was Saturday and there were no flights until Tuesday.  Thank goodness Delta had a few seats, which is why I always get to the airport super early. Southwest would not pay for the 2 tickets plus luggage charges. What?  I travel 20-30 times per year on Southwest and have never had a problem like this.  It took us 18 hours to make it home.   What a nightmare."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,no help and cust service hung up on me,I remember when Southwest actually cared about customers.............they are just another  corporation now.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,LUV IT!,"Quite simply:  An outstanding experience! From the check-in counter to departing the aircraft on arrival.  It was hard to not find a smile.....how can these folks keep up their cheer in this industry? Such a ""can-do"" positive attitude everywhere!   I still don't like the lack of assigned seats, but somehow, it worked surprisingly well.  The aircraft was kept immaculate, and frankly, for the ticket price, I received much more value than with my flying with the legacy carriers or flying with the ultra-low-fare carriers to Phoenix (I think I'd rather fly as a FEDEX package than repeat my experience with an ultra-low-cost-carrier that I flew in the past and will go unmentioned .  Bravo SWA!   Keep up the good work!"
Date of travel: September 2020,50,We had a woderful flight from Chicago Midway to Las Vegas on Southwest,We had a wonderful flight on Southwest. The flight departed and arrived ontime. The staff properly and courteously enforced mask wearing. The airline had empty middle seats
Date of travel: September 2020,30,Rude Stewardess,"A rude flight attendant.  We asked for an extension seatbelt for my disable/senior husband since they keep telling us to make sure the seatbelt is on. This guy just give us a reply without even looking and said that he needs to finish his task.  closing the luggage compartment.  Then when he was done  with that, he just stand in the frond and will not even acknowledged us. Its funny he check each and everyone to make sure they have their seatbelt on but not my husband.  We finally asked him again since the plane is already moving/taxing.  And as expected, just give us a cold shoulder and yeah I will get it ( like on his own time). And then he finally got one and just gave it to my husband quick without even offering to help."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,The Worst Airline Experience To-Date,"The flight was so cheap but you get what you pay for. Bad service, dirty planes and a terrible on-time record. This was comparable to taking public transportation in a third world country. The only thing missing was the livestock.I missed my American flight due to traffic, so I needed to scramble to get the next available flight. The flight was delayed almost 2 hours due to ""mechanical part failure"" Boarding the plane is soul-destroying experience as it is not by class or row. Once boarded, the experience was not much better. Kids off-leash roaming around making a mess and speaking at a decimal level you the only satisfaction would be to choke the life out of them.Please, save yourself, fly another airlines. Their on-time record and safety record should be enough for you to avoid."
Date of travel: September 2020,30,Sept Bday Trip to LV,This is a first our original flight itinerary was changed twice.  The change lost my wife's special condition requirements and made it necessary to go the counter to make corrections to include on the return flight WN 1114 .  The crews were as usual very nice and accommodating.  The middle seat being left empty really works out.
Date of travel: September 2020,30,Families need their own section,"The flight attendants were great, they even gave us cleaning wipes for our seats as we entered. However, even before we left there was a lady with 2 kids and her mom across from her speaking so loud going through math problems with her kids and going back and forth with her mom. Her mom wouldn’t let anyone sit next to her because the daughter kept saying they were all together, when the mom mainly just had the entire row herself and the kids sat with the mom. They kept passing books back and forth across the aisle, the kids kept walking back and forth with no shoes on, leaning across the seats, blocking the aisles. It was beyond annoying and constant. The staff were ok, and the pilot was great as well."
Date of travel: September 2020,40,Good flight,"The staff were quite a bit aggressive and not too friendly. The boarding process was good, but there was an issue with a lady with her two kids that took a long time just to get her receipts or something for her carseat. We finally left, but then her kids whined and cried almost through the entire flight. The staff were ok onboard and the pilots were fantastic."
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Quick and great flight,"Great flight! The staff was great, the pilots were amazing, the crying children drove me nuts, but overall it was great!"
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Awesome airline,"Amazing airline! Great service, especially during covid! I felt safe, the pilots were fantastic. Overall great experience!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Cancelled flight,"I booked a round trip flight for myself and my wife. We were flying from New Orleans to Cancun with a layover in Houston.  After I had booked the flight, I was surprised when I noticed that our flight from New Orleans had been changed and now we were to be flying from New Orleans to Houston and Houston to Cancun at about the same time. I then called Southwest to find out what was going on with my flights and why I had not been notified. The lady told me that it was my fault that that I was not notified because I  choose to be notified the day of the flight. What? I was on the phone for over an hour trying to rebook my flights. I was told that I could keep my same day for the flight to Cancun but we would not get to Cancun until 9:10pm when our original flight was getting us there before noon. This would have been a complete wasted day seeing that we were staying at all inclusive resort. Had to change my whole plans due to Southwest basically canceling the flight from New Orleans to Houston. Had to change our resort stay which cost me $214 more because the discount code I used was no longer valid.We regularly fly Southwest when we travel if the fly to the destination we are going. After this experience, we may rethink what company we fly."
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Delayed and Destroyed Bag,"August 25th on a flight from Orlando to St. Louis. Southwest managed to lose one of our four bags on a nonstop flight that was roughly 20% full. After landing in St. Louis we find out our bag never left Orlando. Southwest promised the bag would be put on the next plane to St. Louis and overnighted to our residence two hours from the airport. 3 days later the bag finally arrived (all my wife belongings)and 3 of the 4 wheels were broken and the suitcase had cracks all in the side. So not only was our suitcase delayed by 3 days, it was also completely destroyed. Fair enough. We fly Southwest because we know they will make things right. We call and explain what happened and we are given $100 voucher for our troubles (they give this to anyone who has a problem during flight). We are also compensated up to $100 for any clothes we had to buy for my wife while her suitcase arrived. The last thing we are seeking is replacing our suitcase. It has now been 2 weeks since the incident and they want us to send our suitcase to Texas to either be repaired or replaced. One problem...we are leaving St. Louis in one week... so please tell me Southwest, what am I supposed to fly home with? I have 50lbs in children's clothing that I don't have a suitcase for. I call and ask them how to solve this issue and their solution is for me to go to the airport and get a replacement bag OR bring all our things by hand to the airport and get a bag when we leave...Are you serious Southwest Airlines? We are staying over 2 hours away from the airport and you want me to drive 4 hours round trip to get a bag you lost and destroyed in the first place? I have a wife, two children, and we are on vacation, and you want me to spend a day going to get a replacement bag? Try again...Southwest Airlines you can do better! We want to be compensated for a new bag that is to equal or lesser value than the suitcase you destroyed! I don't believe this is a hard thing to manage considering we have sent you pictures of our destroyed suitcase! Instead we have been in a back and forth conversation for 2 weeks going on 3 without a new bag. We are leaving in one week Southwest Airlines for our home and about 50 lbs in kids clothes that doesn't have a bag to go in... We do hope you take this complaint seriously and know how disappointed we are with this entire experience."
n/a,10,Southwest Y'all Have Really Let Me Down!,I have travel credits from flights canceled earlier this year. Trying to change a flight for next week. The travel credits no longer show on the appThree phone calls to Southwest customer service and one to Southwest Rewards.A List member and no one can help me use my travel credit funds for the changed reservation. And the app says I cannot change it myself. So Southwest touted themselves as being so generous with no change fees and credits for flights canceled earlier this yearBut when I want to use those credits they are nowhere to be found. And cannot be used.Shame on you SW for scamming the American people You should be ashamed of yourself.
Date of travel: September 2020,40,First Time Flying Southwest,"Due to a vacation that was cancelled due to Covid in April, I had a refund from Southwest that I needed to use, so I used it for my recent plane trip from Baltimore to Portland. The refund made the flight ""free."" My flight had a stop in Chicago. Both flights took off on time and made us early to both our destinations. Since the planes were not full, we had no issue sitting where we wanted. They book the seats so the middle seat is empty. They serve a chex mix and ice water. Masks are required, however, some customers do not wear them properly."
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Impressed by Social Distancing,Southwest did a great job keeping people socially distanced while checking in and on plane.  I stayed on place in Baltimore (to go to New Orleans) and watched the employee wipe down all seats getting ready for more passengers to board.  Very impressive. I feel safe flying on Southwest during COVID-19.
Date of travel: August 2020,50,First Flight During Covid-19!,"I ❤️ Southwest Airlines! I wanted to get out of my house and go somewhere fun. I choose Las Vegas! With my Rapid Rewards points I booked my flights. The plane was disinfectant. Seating excluded the middle seat. The flight attendants offered snacks and beverage service. Plot twist! Hurricane Laura was a potential direct hit. SW notified me on Tuesday to change my Wednesday flight. No change fee, No price change-no problem to rebook for Friday. On the way back, the pilots wife and 3 young children were on my flight to Houston-practice what you preach!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Terrible customer service,"Booked a non stop 6 am return flight.  At check in found out the return was changed to a later,  multi stop flight.  NO email, NO call, nothing to inform me of the change.  Just done by Swa. Called and received NO explanation other than covid.  Covid was going on when the flight was booked.  Customer service apparently is only open M-F 8-5, so I had no time to call anyone since this was a weekend.  When I asked to fly non stop out of Austin was told sure... if I basically bought a ticket.   I found this altogether unacceptable.  Terrible customer service all the way around."
n/a,50,Flying the friendly skies ,"I love this airline, If I could fly them everywhere I would, everything about   this company  is pleasant, to the checking in part and security, and everything about  the  plane is comfortable, the staff is absolutely fantastic,  this is the 2nd. time our flight attendant was absolutley  hysterical.  They were all so super friendly. I really enjoyed our flight and will book again with them."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,We had a wonderful flight on Southwest from Las Vegas to Chicago Midway,We had a wonderful flight on Southwest from Las Vegas to Chicago Midway. They left all the middle seats vacant. Everyone on the flight was wearing masks properly. The flight departed and arrived ontime
Date of travel: August 2020,40,Worry free comfortable flight,"I had a short flight but was worry to death about flying at this time, with COVID still going on I haven't seen my children in awhile. I haven't thought about traveling due to that fact that we shouldn't. When I arrived at Southwest, all staff were abiding by there COVID saftey rules, Staff was cleaning viable areas, wearing their mask and wearing gloves.  When on the plane they made sure everyone wore their mask except when eating and drinking of course. I was very at ease with all the safety precautions that they were taking. So, I just wanted to thank Southwest and their staff for the continued great service that they provider, even with this terrible virus that is going around."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Awful service ,"Beyond Awful service!  This airline sucks!  No food other a lousy few pretzels, no first class, no assigned seating and only drinks are water! They don’t even give you a bottle of water!  It’s in plastic cups they could contaminate!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,My first bad customer experience with Southwest,"Flying from Denver to Austin on 9/1/2020.Checked in at gate 42, Flight 1447 at 10:50am.The lady checking the tickets for passengers was named Kristi.She has to be the rudest southwest employee I have ever encountered. I think she managed to insult or piss off a dozen passengers before they boarded.In a world with lots of choices, vacant airplanes and many awesome people looking for work, Southwest can do better."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Absolutely horrible Customer Service During COVID,"I would like to start this out with I have never been so outraged with a company I feel the need to write reviews on multiple platforms. Originally, in August of 2019, I purchased two flights to Mexico. One of them needed to be canceled and Southwest would not allow me to do that without eating the cost of the entire $500 flight. In return they offered me a transfer of funds for a hundred dollar fee - having no choiceI accepted this change. I then went to use the rest of my voucher (prior to the date of expiration) and found that I could not find the voucher id number. The company reached out and said this would be, NO ISSUE AT ALL - and within three days they would e-mail me the new number with an extension of six months time due to covid restrictions - GREAT! Right? - No. They then sent nothing, went radio silent. So I proceeded to reach BACK OUT to the company (on my time!) and when they reached out again they told me they would not only not honor what had been said but they would now only honor it if they could take another ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS from the $189 voucher. At this point, that would be $200 lost to their customer service department. I really just can’t fathom the inability for such a LARGE company to foot a hundred dollar bill (that I’ve already PAID) and also tell me that there is no one who can be spoken to about this except the one person in the department who is the “supervisor” - I have worked in sales/customer service for many years and this is absolutely ridiculous behavior for a company that prides themselves in the value of the customer experience. Once again, this is money that I have ALREADY PAID to the company that they will have now taken from me - even with a Global Pandemic in the midst."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Amazing staff!!!,For my first trip with my support dog they were so accommodating!!! They went be of and beyond to help me out. I had to cancel my flight with another airline and Southwest was the only one that would take her. I’m only flying with them now. One of the best flight experiences I’ve had the pilots even helped me get my wagon from checked bags.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,"When your ""free checked bag"" ends up costing you three grand","What happens when your luggage doesn't make your connecting flight on southwest airlines.My luggage was to arrive late and I was told by baggage claim at 9pm  that I would get a call when it arrived on a later flight at 10pm.  I received a call around 10pm that they didn't have my bag yet and would call me when it came in.  The following mid afternoon I received a call that my bag had been stolen off the baggage belt.Knowing my luggage would be there at 10pm, is it to much to ask that it be secured in the baggage claim area?  The associates failed to do so.  I received an email that Southwest took no responsibility for my loss and  I might file a claim with a secondary insurance if I have one.  Thanks   for the advice! The value of my Pro travel bag and contents is than $3500. Of which it looks like I am plan out of luck!  So the fly free bag ends up costing me three grand."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Poor attitude,My fiance and I recently flew with Southwest and I was completely taken aback by the flight attendant's behavior towards my fiance. He was reading the paper during the start of her preflight speech but immediately stopped when she asked for his attention in a very rude manner. As she was speaking she stopped twice looked at him and rolled her eyes and acted like she was going to speak huffed out her breath and continued her speech. Both he and I were baffled as he didn't provoke this in any way.  He is so nonconfrontational! He actually asked me if it was his expression.  I assured him it wasn't and that there were other airlines with friendly staff that we'd utilize in the future. I'm at a loss as to what her issue could have been but it definitely put a pall over the beginning of the trip that he planned for his proposal. I would have objected on the spot if not for concern about being allowed to complete the flight. Well definitely choose a different airline next time.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,COVID Rules Not Enforced,The lady at the gate talked a big game saying everyone must wear their masks properly and let an entire family board while improperly or not wearing their mask at all.
Date of travel: August 2020,50,The service makes it.,Business requires travel 3 times a month. I hadn't been flying Southwest. But I did for this flight. Thier staff was really able to help me out. They gad the required resources to do so. I will definitely be looking to book more with Southwest. Top marks.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Most comfortable airlines,"- I like the option to change my flight in case of any issue. And southwest does it for free. - Also the free 2 checked bag is great.  I feel like all airlines should follow southwest. Boarding is different with Southwest, There is no assigned seating. I would prefer to go to  end of the plane. (Unless there is any urgency to get down the flight quickly. - connecting flights)"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Bad service,Traveled Southwest and flight attendant came up to us and asked us if we wanted to move because our kid was making noise and then when we said “no” 10 minutes later she decided to ask other customers on the plane to move to get more peace. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. Did not enjoy. Will not recommend.
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Things are going downhill at Southwest,"Apparently Southwest’s new slogan is, “If you don’t comply, you do not fly.”  Forget “Welcome Aboard” or the “Somebody Up There Who Loves You.” Southwest staff have always been considerate, pleasant and hospitable. No more. Now they are mask enforcers - thoughtfulness is over. Yes, we need to wear masks. We get it, but there is a way to manage it. Yelling at your paying passengers and repeating “If you don’t comply, you do not fly” fifty times is not it!  There is a kinder way to enforce the mask rule. Customers are not the enemy.  We are the people showing up helping Southwest stay in business.  Flying is difficult enough now.   If someone is not complying - speak to them directly; don't chastise everyone.  Southwest used to be the friendly airlines with people who liked their jobs and their passengers.  No more."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,The best service I’ve had so far!,"My southwest flight was my first flight ever. Among the horror stories, I had my worries that I would be one of them. Traveling by myself to Houston for specialty surgery was already enough pain and hassle so I definitely didn’t want anything else to make my trip unbearable. My departing trip was pretty much hassle free. First 2 bags check in free, snacks and water aboard the flight, phone was dead and an attendant gave me her entire portable charger for the entirety of the flight to use, and the seating wasn’t too bad on my back either. The flight was non stop and quick, just how I wanted it. News of the hurricane coming scared me though so all my surges got bunched together and the stress about flying back in time so I wasn’t stranded was looking over me. Southwest made it easy at first to change my flight time to get me home ASAP. When I arrived to the airport though, the service was spotty. Some attendants were rude and unresponsive while others were very cheerful and happy to help. I disregarded the rude ones seeing as the airport was so big and it was inevitable. But after waiting for a wheelchair because of my mobility issues, and not being talked to as I waited there, I ended up missing my flight and then being told I wouldn’t be able to fly out anymore. I spoke with several different people who gave me several different answers about flights before ultimately being put on a 6 hour flight which I wasn’t very happy about but I was okay with at the time because I would at least be safe from the hurricane. Flying out was a breeze and besides the pooping in my ears the entire time I was content for once.I wasn’t met with a wheelchair when I got off of the plane and had to limp across the airport to my next gate. Tired and out of breath I approached two attendants, Jose Acosta and Claudia Stokes who instantly noticed I needed assistance and spring into action. Claudia verified my tickets and apologized for not being helped initially.l while Jose quickly got me a wheelchair to be seated in. Not only were they very apologetic on everyone’s behalf, they were doing everything in their power to make things right. Jose wheeled me around to grab food and a drink while having good Candid conversation and Claudia checked in on me as well afterwards. They both are the very definition of customer service and accurately represent exactly what any company would want to portray. They have made my ENTIRE trip better in a matter of moments and have brightened my mood even after multiple surgeries solely with their smiles and friendly approachable attitudes. They are what the face of Southwest should be and everyone else should look high and follow in their footsteps. From the bottom of my heart, Thank you Claudia and Jose!"
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Oregon Trip,"Went from Philly to Denver and then onto Portland on Southwest recently. Booking was easy, middle seats were kept empty, staff was great as usual, had no problems with anything. I love flying with Southwest. They were only serving ice water and a snack but we always bring our own from the airport on board so we did not mind."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,DO NOT Work With Executive Office,"Long story short, a Southwest rep had to book my husband's flight. She said she put him on the same flight as me. She did not. I called back to have them fix it and they said they will not be fixing it. I can change his flight and pay the $478 difference. It was a $91 flight. I've always been happy with Southwest until this point. They've always been helpful and I believed they believed in their ideals. I was very, very wrong. DO NOT trust their reps to book a flight. DO NOT purchase Rapid Rewards points. DO NOT think they will fix their own mistakes. I am going to have to cancel my trip because I will not pay $569 for a flight that was $91 after they made mistake, after mistake, after mistake. If you call their 855 customer service number, DO NOT work with Jenna S or DeShone J. Terrible experience at baseline that could have easily been fixed. They have legitimately said, ""we aren't changing the flight"" after acknowledging the agent booked the wrong flight and didn't state the flight she booked on the phone."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Hassle free tavel,I was extremely nervous about flying during the pandemic. Southwest did a great job ensuring all customers were practicing social distancing and wore masks for the entire flight. I was extremely happy they did not fill the middle seats which was a plus
Date of travel: August 2020,50,So easy!,"Everytime I fly a different airline I always longingly think of how easy Southwest is to fly. I love the ticket pricing, the checking in the day before, (unless I forget :-) ), the way they board, that's the best and easiest. No fuss not muss. They always take off so much sooner than any other airline, no delays getting the people on and seated. Thanks Southwest, you make traveling a bit less stressful."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,BEWARE OF SW SCAMS!,"I called 8882187336 thinking it was the Southwest Customer Service Number. It was in fact a scammer posing to be them. First they tried to charge $$ for transferring one of our flights.  They ended up cancelling my flight and trying to get more money when I called back to get it fixed. Thankfully I figured out what happened and called the real Southwest and they made it right with zero out of pocket, even though it wasn't their fault. I have been Southwest's biggest fan. Now even more so!!!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,BE AFRAID,"Attendants not wearing masks, dirty tissues left behind, loose wires hanging out of the floor and all they said was oh, sorry about that.Do not fly this airline."
n/a,10,Didn't get what I paid for,"I booked a flight to Las Vegas to visit my mother who lives in assisted living. Since the pandemic the assisted living facilities around the nation have been on shut down. I worked really hard to get things in place to be able to visit my mom especially coming from Houston a known Covid Hot Spot. So my daughter and I agreed to have 2 negative covid test results 1 month apart but the last one being 1 week before travel. Then we agreed to take a covid test upon arrival in Las Vegas. So since my flight was a non stop and arriving at 9:10am I made an appointment for testing at 11:30am. Then when I checked in for my flight I see that I was put on another flight with out notice. No email no text nothing. So not only did the new flight have me arriving an hour later but it also was not a non stop flight. So now its so late that I can't move my test appointment for a later time because they are all booked up. The next appointment would be on Thursday the 20th but the problem is that it takes 48 hours for results and we return to Hou on Sat. Which is why our appt was on Tuesday  so results would be given by Thursday and we could visit my mom Thursday night and Friday all day. So now I have spent over $500 in covid testing, $789 for vacation rental, $329 for rental car, time off from work and I can't even see my mom. Oh and the kick in the face is when I called to change my departure flight out for Wednesday  night they want to charge me an additional $300+. So on top of being out of over $2000 and not being able to see my mom, I don't know when I will have the money to set this up again. I'm afraid she will die and I will never see her again. This could have all been avoided with a text or email about my flight change. Covid19 didn't prevent that from happening."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Great Social Distancing,I was pleasantly surprised with the social distancing during boarding and on the seating. Well done Southwest!
n/a,30,Not good with covid practices,Yes you have to wear a mask..but boarding is unorganized and no physical distancing; when you board and deboard --no  physical distancing. No real enforcement of masks on planes..they allow passsenges to demask to eat multiple snacks.Got planes( conecting flight via Houston) to destinations safe.
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Rude flight attendant. No concern passenger sat next to me.  Lets all wear mask but allow strangers to sit by strangers,Plane nearly loaded when 2 passengers came from back looking for seats. Wife and i together so her by window and i in middle seat.  Gal flops her butt down rubs shoulder with mine and giggles. I made a little racket No no no we aint doing this. She moved  she was getting out of aisle so people could move -- why wounldbt attendant have them back up the aisle and flop in seat by stranger? Proticol is empty seat.This is right after lead attendant finished the we care covid is our concern we have empty seats no alcohol we will call cops speel..... lead attendant was aware of these folks and helping them move around. He never said anything   I appriached him and said not happy he had sut in seat by me. His gruff reply was it was only a second no big deal..no apology.   He offered to get a manager involved or i could csll 1-800-complain. Course tgat would mean delayed flight at the least.      Not SWA i know.  Simple apology would have been fine.  I guess the policy forbthis guy is if u want to flop in empty seat while waiting on toilet would be awesome.   Lead attendant not a newbie.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Not Safe During COVID,"Southwest Airlines does not live up to their stated cleaning protocol.    SWA promises to clean planes between flights and offer sanitizing wipes.  Their protocol also states they will disembark in a distant manner.  NONE of these things happened.  Per the pictures below, the plane was not even lightly cleaned.  We wiped down our seats with our own wipes and the wipes were black by the time we were done.  The tray tables and window coverings were just as dirty.  No wipes were offered and the announcing attendant said a wipe down was unnecessary.  Had she even looked at the state of the plane?  She stated it was their last flight of the day, so perhaps they just gave up on the filth.  By the time I took this flight, I had already flown Alaska and United, both of which were good experiences, so I knew what to expect.  I do not know if SWA is responsible for the state of their terminal Denver, but it didn't look like it had been cleaned in a few days.  Seats were dirty and food droppings everywhere.  Unleashed dogs were walking around and one even peed right on the floor in front of us.  That's discussing even without COVID...  We will not be flying SWA for business or leisure until COVID is over.  I do not want to take my health into my own hands like that again."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,SWA got it together,"After numerous anxious moments from April until July, with re-bookings, cancellations, virus hobgoblins and reservation murkiness, we finally left for vacation! Left St. Louis for Denver and then on to Cabo. In flight service was water and bags of crackers/pretzels. Both legs in half full planes and flew on time. Coming back through Houston, same experience... on time and stretching room to spare. Cabin crews were kind of bored with nothing to do and were and pleasant. No big mask hassle, no bullying, no confrontations and no liquor, so no drunks. All in all, well done!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Service has dropped during Covid,"I am an A-List Flyer on SWA and today was my second flight since the partial reopening from the Covid lockdowns and I noticed the Southwest employees have been very helpful.   I used to travel every other week for business and choose SWA because of their business friendly policies but my last two flights, their attitude has been they are dong me a favor by letting me fly SWA.  PreCovid, it was the other way around, SWA employees were happy to have you aboard.  Not so much lately.  So much for trying to help out the travel industry."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,ADA compliance issue,"I was so sad to read about Southwest airlines kicking a family off their airline for a 3-year old autistic child  for not wearing a mask.  And, by that, he COULD NOT wear a mask. They were not being defiant. I hope and pray this family can find resolution via ADA compliance.  This is illegal to treat people this way.  I am not a sue person but this was clearly an infringement of ADA.  I hope they will pursue Southwest to the full extent of the law."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Worst experience ever.,Worst experience ever. My mom's flight was cancelled in May because of COVID19. We were told that we could not get a refund-even though we were all in limbo. We accepted a rescheduled flight 4 different times because the travel restrictions for this inadequate airline was not lifted. M y mom had to book through another airline to get home before her visa expired!. i called in June and spoke with a rep who saw our plight and offered a refund within 14 days. Its been 2 months and i call back only to find out that the request has been cancelled because my mom's flight has been cancelled and rebooked too many times! She didnt do that! you guys did after denying her a refund. Worst ever!
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Cancelation,"SWA, Cancels my flight, and rebooks me a new flight, I was supposed to get full cash refund, but because the person helped me and rebooked a new flight, SWA will not refund my money but only travel funds. This is not any my fault at all.customer relations is useless,"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Worst airline,Worst experience. Booked a flight ahead of time to avoid having to deal with high prices. Southwest cancels my flight all together and tells me then that my flight is sold out 3 weeks before flying there. I now have to fly a different airline with higher prices and they did not help in anyway in regards to accommodating their mess up. The only option they gave was to fly the day before or day after and didn’t give an option to cover expenses of having to stay an extra day. Will never be flying southwest again
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Cross Country Nightmare,"We were moving cross country 1 week before taking our oldest to college.  He was flying out on a round trip to help move in and we were flying back to drop him off and drive cross country.  At the last minute our movers didn’t show up and my son had to drive a second truck across country, so he missed his flight there, but planned on taking his reserved flight back.  Southwest just took the money and canceled his ticket.   We didn’t find out until the night before and had to pay again for an outrageously high ticket for him to be in the same flight hat we already paid for with the round trip.  Honestly, I will never fly Southwest again.  We have a complete nightmare and in my view they stole from us.  We paid for a round trip with our money, that seat is ours whether we use it or not.   Thieves."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Snacks?!?!  NO PHYSICAL DISTANCING,"I flew from Sacramento to San Diego in early August 2020 and was shocked at how crowded the flight was!  There were less than two feet between myself and the person beside me, the persons in front of me, and the persons behind.  One seat free in between each row is nowhere near enough space to ensure proper physical distancing during this pandemic.  I was further dismayed that ANY food/beverages were served aboard such a short flight-!  Water and pretzels??  Are you kidding me?  Most people's face-coverings were not adequate as it is, and then to serve snacks and water IN OPEN CUPS???  I have never been more horrified during this pandemic than I was to be forced to sit one seat apart from people taking their masks off all at the same time for SNACKING!  Absolutely absurd.I have another round-trip flight booked with Southwest for October but will cancel and fly with a different airline if this oversight has not been resolved.  I am deeply disappointed to see an article from CNN today stating that Southwest Airlines has reduced their cleaning in between flights to allow for faster turn-around times.  How many deaths have you factored into your current business model as acceptable in order to make a profit during this pandemic?  I have to travel due to family-matters related to COVID-19 and this makes your lax handling of the situation all the more distressing and problematic.Fix this, Southwest Airlines.  Have assigned seating STAGGERED with at least 6-7 feet between EACH SEAT and DO NOT SERVE SNACKS on short flights less than 4 hours!!  Please - use some common sense here.  DO NOT ALLOW anti-science outbursts to push politics into your business dealings.  This is about safety in the short-term and profit in the long-term.  If these things are not corrected I will not only NOT FLY in October with Southwest Airlines but will NEVER support or recommend this airline ever again.A long-time Southwest flyer and first-time-Karen,You know better.  Do better."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,They said we think no more Coronovirus!!,"I have never seen that kind of unprofessional airlines in my life! Stay away from this company! Unclean tables, seats etc!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Southwest cancel my flight,Purchased tickets in April to travel in September. Southwest changed flight 4 times and 30 days before trip cancelled my reservation completely. Spend many hours with customer no service department NO help. Tried to move my trip week earlier to match their schedule - they refuse to help. Always had good experience now will not recommend southwest airline. They will mess up your vacation
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Very Disappointed in Service,"It’s understandable Coronavirus is impacting airline travel. Made reservations on June, we had three changes by the airline in our flights.  There changes were unreasonable, ex. Leaving at 7:30 am three cross connects arriving after 9:00 pm.  Finally e-mail from SW in Aug. told us to complete reschedule on our own.  We were told if done with 2 weeks original no charge, could not be done on line.  Waited on phone 1:45 minutes.  Asked for refund.  Two weeks, SW needs to get control of their operations, customer service needs attention.  May save some money on luggage, is it worth savings, I decided NO"
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Stellar Service,I have been traveling southwest for 10 years. This week we took my 76 year old mother and father to Montana by way of Spokane. The Southwest people treated them so well. They had wheelchairs available and at the ready when we got to the airport and at every plane change. I really loved how they treated them with lots of kindness and respect. Southwest knows customer service!!!
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Come on SW,"My daughter and her husband and three young children flew yesterday August 4th on the only direct flight from Cabo San Lucas to Denver.  The whole experience was a total Sh** Show.  At least the middle seats were open but now I understand they are going to loosen their cleaning standards. There was no enforced social distancing at the boarding gate.  Only two of her family had their temperature checked and she noticed many others were not checked.  When she boarded a young couple sat across from her and the gentlemen was coughing and clearing his throat and blowing his nose profusely.  Neither wore their masks.  One flight attendant asked them to put their mask on which they did.  Within minutes they took their masks off as the man continued to cough and blow his nose.  No flight attendants said anything and my daugher had enough and asked them to put their masks on!  Not sure they should have been allowed to board given his evident illness.  Come on SW, you're better than this!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,ZERO STARS,"The absolute WORST customer service in the industry... You're supposed to get what you pay for. I had to compare them to Spirit because that's how CHEAP the service there is. I already vowed to them that I will NEVER fly them again, ever. Spare yourself and fly ANYONE else."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,WiFi refund,"Southwest refunded my WiFi bc it didn’t work very well during the flight! I didn’t ask them to or complain to anyone, but apparently they knew the WiFi wasn’t running and refunded me! Thanks southwest <3"
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Great Way to Fly,"Our 1st trip on Southwest Airlines and we have no complaints. We had travel funds to use and the App made it easy to apply my travel funds. Check in was easy. Ticket agents were smiling and friendly. Flight Attendants were helpful. When we boarded the plane in Oahu, for our transfer, agents held signs of appreciation toward us and it was very thoughtful. The flight was a quick flight, so no in flight service. Which I don't mind. I had my own snacks and drinks. I loved that the price was very reasonable and we got to our destinations safe and fast.Will choose Southwest over Hawaiian Air now that there are choices in the islands for interisland travel. Hawaiian Air is so expensive and the flight miles would expire before I could use them. Southwest's airfare is way more budget friendly."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Southwest Airlines rude rep at Customer Relations,"A large group had to cancel our flights for a wedding that had to be postponed due to COVID19. The other family members have already called, spoke to polite reps, and got their fare and early bird charges converted to travel funds, which will be used for the rescheduled wedding date next spring. I spoke to a very rude representative named Mary at Customer Relations. She screamed at me and insisted that the policy does not allow that. She needs training on how to deal with the public. She is a poor representative of the airline."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Excellent precautions,"I’ve always preferred Southwest, but I’m incredibly impressed with the steps the company has taken to ensure safety for customers and employees. I was very nervous about flying during the pandemic, but felt a bit more at ease knowing the middle seats would be left empty (unless you’re traveling with another person), planes would be boarded 10 people at a time, and masks would be worn the whole time. I had a great experience with Southwest, as I always have!"
n/a,50,Great service as always!,"Felt clean and safe. Not crowded.  Bag of crackers and cup of water, but plenty as we ate before we flew. Plenty seats on plane and in terminals. Called people on board by name in Tampa, and in small groups at other airports."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Southwest Airlines- best way to travel,"Despite of the severe weather expected during the summer months traveling to and from the Caribbean, our safety is always their priority. The pilots are the best at their job and not too mention the entire staff is super friendly."
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Need A More Positive Attitude ,"My wife and I often fly SWA and usually the flights are nothing extraordinary, nothing bad. However, I was disappointed in 1. the deplaning procedure, and 2. the flight attendants’ attitudes.Keeping the middle seats open is great. Boarding ten people at a time is good, provided that people line up IN THE  CORRECT  NUMERICAL ORDER. And I must be fair to say that we arrived 30 minutes early on our return trip.However, when it’s time to deplane it’s the usual free for all. It’s a rush to be the first one off the plane, with many passengers crowding together in the aisle (how hard would it be to change this procedure, just like boarding?).Also, once the bag of “snacks” and CUP of water is handed out,  the flight attendants seem to become very scarce for the remainder of the flight, and asking for a second water seemed to annoy one of them. So much for Southwest’s caring and friendly approach to customers.Will I fly with them again? Yes. Will I hope for better and friendlier service? Definitely."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Prejudice,"Southwest airlines has proved to be just as prejudice, if not more by telling me, among others, that because I cannot breathe, without constantly struggling, while wearing a covering over my face and am no longer allowed to fly with them. So it's ok for a company be racist towards medical conditions now? Good to know."
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Unbearable last 25 minutes of flight,"I love Southwest Airlines.  This review is from a return flight I had recently and I felt like I needed to say something. Typically I would always give SW five stars but on this particular flight, I struggle to give them three for the simple fact that the last 25+ minutes of our flight was sweltering. They turned off the cool air and the overhead vents were blowing extremely hot air! When I tell  you it was very uncomfortable, I am not exaggerating. They never offered an explanation just that they were sorry it was warm (um not warm - HOT) and that they would have air on soon. They finally had semi cool air on when we were waiting to deplane. Sorry SW but I am very disappointed. Will I fly them again, sure! But the last 25 minutes of this specific flight was horrible."
Date of travel: June 2020,40,No Complaints!,"I hope zero complaints about our Southwest flight. We booked it long before the virus hit and, as the months went by, the price came down, and down and each time it did, the airlines gave us a credit for future flights (let's hope the airline doesn't go bankrupt now!). We received several informative emails letting us know about what protocol the airline was following so we felt safe. Boarding was efficient and immediately we could see how happy the crew was to have us on board; their glee was almost infectious (maybe not a good word to use in these COVID times). Oops, one complaint was that there were no outlets under the seats to charge phones (since we had to use our phones for in-flight entertainment),.  Our flight was smooth, bathrooms were cleaned several times, all crew members and travelers wore masks, pilot kept updating us on travel times, crew handed out snack packs and cups of water (several times), middle row seats were left unoccupied, we were asked to wait in our seats to use the lavatory rather than line up in the aisle, and we arrived in Denver way ahead of schedule. Great start to what ended up being an amazing family hiking trip in Rocky Mountain National Park"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,DONT USE SOUTHWEST VACATIONS! SCAM!,"I set up a trip for my anniversary and had to cancel because the place I was going was not open.  They told me I would get a full refund.  It has been 62 days and no refund!  A lot of bureaucratic tape and you only get to talk to is  a flunky or a recorder .  No one returns your call, all they can do is say Im sorry!  Southwest Vacations is a front.  They dont actually run the site, it is run by Apple Leisure out of Chicago.  They want nothing to do with you and all Southwest does is tell you they will send a followup email.  Southwest air has already sent them the money for the refund of the tickets.  They did it 2 days later after I cancelled.  I have no refund.  DO NOT use Southwest Vacations, it is NOT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES it is only a front.    Shame on Southwest Airlines for doing this.  They are not a friendly company.  Also they required me to check blocks for this review.  No trip was taken."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Poor customer service at the check in,"On our way down the ticketing counter was great on both flights. Checking in this morning at the southwest in Norfolk airport the ticketing agent farthest to the left this morning with light brown hair tied back in a ponytail was extremely rude and unprofessional!! She advised the 2 self serve terminals were open i go up to it and she asks for my id before i can attempt to get my tickets and boarding pass. I ask her do i get all boarding passes before i can get that out she stops me mid sentence to say ""I wasn't talking to you"". She obviously should not be dealing with customers if she cannot multitask with checking in multiple people at a time. I'd hope someone addreses this lady about how to properly do her job at 545 in the morning."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Simple Model and Fantastic Customer Service!,"Never had issues with Southwest whether for business or leisure. Planes are always clean and efficient with seating. Unlike other airliners, they have the simplest and fastest boarding process. There are no tiers of boarding parties and there no seat assignments which are charged extra. Even changing flights are simple and hassle free when emergencies arise. You are simply the best airliner to travel with in the U.S."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,We need to change travelers due to medical reasons.  They will not let us swap travelers because their fares are unfair.,"NOOooooo on Southwest!  They will steal your money if you need to change travelers!  They will not allow us to swap passengers even though it is for MEDICAL REASONS DURING QUARANTINE!!!!  Okay - Southwest, you won!  You get to keep my $400.  However it will be the last $400 you will ever get from me and my family.  Good luck staying in business."
Date of travel: July 2020,40,Pretty good Covid-19 prevention,I was happy with the efforts of SW to adhere to the Covid-19 guidelines. Face masks are required and the boarding was done without crowding with the middle seats of a 3 seat row kept empty. We were informed that the plane was sanitized between flihgts. Not sure if they increased .the cabin air exchange. The only situation where Covid-19 prevention guidelines was not followed was deplaning. SW should consider US Air Force deplaning by seat number and row to have social distancing.
Date of travel: July 2020,40,Good choice for a COVID flight,"I flew with my wife and we felt relatively safe from a COVID perspective. Southwest is limiting the number of passengers right now so that no middle seats need to be used, which helps keep passengers distanced from each other. Also, they only board in groups of 10 at a time so we didn't have to stand close to others in a group during the boarding process. Everyone on the flight is required to wear a mask as well. If you're concerned about COVID, I think Southwest is a fine airline to fly with."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Problems with refund,"I have flown with Southwest Airlines almost exclusively for the last 20 years and I have never been so disappointed. I have waited over 90 days for my $4000+ refund for a cancelled vacation and after spending over 5 hours on several occasions on the phone, the customer care representative told me that something had not been submitted properly by a previous rep. The supervisor Laura told me that it would be processed as soon as possible. When I asked when I would get the refund she told me that we may get to it in the next few days. So I will be waiting on my refund for at least another week. They offered no compensation for my time and effort getting this resolved and blamed it on COVID. I feel a small travel credit or even a few drink coupons would have been sufficient. I feel very unsatisfied and this should be fixed. Thank you for your time."
Date of travel: June 2020,30,Poor communication,Reserved rental car through southwest at Payless.  Counter closed.  Had to get one at Avis for more money.Southwest complaint line said only that I wasn’t billed for car since it was not picked up.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest Airlines are worthy of Everyones business!,Southwest Airlines has one of best airlines for the amenities you receive.  The Staff are always accommodating and appear eager to serve your needs.  I appreciated that the Staff went out their way to adjust and help my concern that occurred through initial scheduling.  Thanks for the business.
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Good airline,"Best airline I’ve used, but I still cannot find one that doesn’t toss luggage around like it’s nobody’s business.  I make sure to use the zipper bags for my hair products and they always still end up outside of bags and exploded over everything.  Having curly hair, I can’t go anywhere without my products and I shouldn’t have to.  I could see the luggage cart from my seat on the plane and it says something like “We care about your luggage,” on the side. Haha!! No, you don’t.  Still, the stewardesses are always kind and the planes are always clean."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Fast Flight to Florida,We flew from Pittsburgh to Florida on June 13th on Flight 1106. Getting a direct flight from Pittsburgh to anywhere is a challenge even pre covid but Southwest is always a great choice. The flight left early and arrived early. Staff was friendly and the plane was very clean.. They left all of the middle seats open as a covid precaution. We took advantage of the two free bags and checked a beach gear bag.. I highly recommend and will fly Southwest again.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Purchasing multiple tickets,"Make sure you understand !! If you book tickets for multiple people on your expense. That if a cancellation or modification arises. Southwest, credits your monies to the multiple passengers you purchased tickets for. You don’t get the credit !! Craziest thing I’d ever heard !!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Amazing for families,"Southwest has been our go-to airline for years. We used to have the credit card because their point system is excellent. If you travel a lot with them, I highly recommend the credit card. It seemed like we were always getting free drink tickets and we earned enough points in a year to consistently get free cross country flights. I love how flexible they are with changes and cancellations, and their flight attendants are always happy and offer great customer service. We have not flown with them since COVID, but I also really appreciate that this is one of the few airlines that enforces the empty middle seat policy to keep everyone safe during these times."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Southwest stepping up,"Southwest, sling with Delta are enforcing the ‘no middle seat’ rule unless you’re traveling together on flights and they do not pack their planes. An unruly couple who were obviously also intoxicated were making fellow passengers uncomfortable as they demanded to sit in the middle seat next to a stranger in the exit aisle or be moved straight to the front. Southwest stepped it up professionally and took care of the situation, to placate the couple and escort them off, while ensuring the remaining passage fees are comfortable. I will always fly southwest."
Date of travel: April 2020,50,Southwest Air 844_24I__6364 Southwest Airline Reservations,For now Southwest is keeping the middle seat empty for social distancing which is a huge plus if you are traveling as an individual or couple . Families with kids can still seat together which is great if you have little ones. As always the cabin crew are super friendly and efficient even under all these new rules and COVID guidelines
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Great Flight,The new boarding process was super easy Just think A thru C. A being at the front of the aircraft  C being at the rear and B somewhere in the middle. For now Southwest is keeping the middle seat empty for social distancing which is a huge plus if you are traveling as an individual or couple . Families with kids can still seat together which is great if you have little ones. As always the cabin crew are super friendly and efficient even under all these new rules and COVID guidelines 😡This airline for me at least has either been on schedule or l have arrived early at my destination 👍
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Good Flight and Service. ,"We flew on flight #1988 from Dallas Love to Chicago Midway on Southwest on a 737-800.  The boarding went smoothly; however, I wish Southwest would allow assigned seating.  We found great seats but the middle seats were not occupied so there was a lot of seat selection.  The seats are a bit cramped but okay and I am 6’4”.  We were served water and snack mix.  The boarding agents and flights attendants were very helpful and nice.  Southwest is a low cost line but they do it well.  I highly recommend this airline."
n/a,10,The gate agent was rude to my 14 year old and I.,We were boarding and rhe lady taking tickets on Flt 2183 was so rude.  She asked my daughter in a snotty attitude to throw away her drink and she did.  I joked to my daughter that we would get another soda in NY and the lady rudely interrupted and said ugh.  I just could not tell what was in the cup....  The tone and the way she said it was nasty.  My daughter even looked at me like what is her problem....
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Boarding for active duty military,"My daughter and her Fiance were traveling on active duty orders.  Typically, they fly with other airlines, however I encouraged them to fly with Southwest Airlines, as I typically do. I am deeply regretful that I suggested this. Active Duty Military on any other airline is allowed to board priority after handicapped. Upon boarding, my daughter was informed that active duty military in UNIFORM only can board priority. Sadly, the airline should be better educated that the NAVY and the MARINE CORPS are not allowed to travel in uniform for security and safety reasons.   Due to this policy, my daughter and her Fiance boarded 3rd to last and were unable to be seated together. What disrespect to our military.  Please change your policy."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,Becky Peterson #27613,"Hi, Yesterday 7/5/2020 I traveled from SLC to Phoenix Flight #1332.. Leaving at 11:40am I traveled with my husband Manuel Flores and my two ESA pets. When we checked in to check our luggage and get our tickets I was not charged for one of my ESAs... I showed the ESA letter to two of your employees and was told I was okay to go on. We did just that and moved on to our gate preparing to leave SLC. We then arrived at our gate and proceeded to get our ticket scanned to enter onto the aircraft. This is where we met Becky Peterson #27613 She was very rude, saying she didn't understand why we had two ESAs and asked to check my ESA letter again (which she didn't even read/ just glanced at it) and then let on on the aircraft. It was a full flight in my opinion and we made our way back finding a row to ourselves because of COVID19 and we had two animals with us. As we were all situated I looked up and Becky came towards me with a confrontational, defensive and loud voice saying ""Kelsey, you need to get all your stuff, get off the aircraft and go buy your pet a ticket"". I was so anxious and embarrassed that she was so loud. I then asked her ""are you all going to leave without me?"" Becky then said ""that's up to you!"" "" You need to get up and get off immediately"" sweating with anxiety... I looked at my husband horrified wondering what we should do... 1.)I didn't want to get separated from my family 2.) Should I take all my stuff? what if they leave without me? 3.) I won't make it back in time  .. (Becky didn't let me know the ticket counter was... I didn't know the ticket could be purchased close by) I thought I was going to have to go all the way back to check in to pay for the ticket which would definitely have us miss the flight.  She failed to mention that to me.. and also failed to let us know that it was an easy fix that wouldn't take long and we wouldn't be left.  It was SO unnecessary the way she approached us, how she delivered her message and embarrassing us in front of everyone in the back of the aircraft!! After all, it was YOUR employee who didn't charge us in the first place!  I couldn't believe how we were being treated. This was the first time we flew with our pets so I was already anxious about it....This made the situation even more stressful.We quickly all got off the aircraft with ALL of our luggage and paid for the 2nd animal ticket.  Got back on the aircraft to find our row had been taken and we would have to be split up... one of the female flight attendants politely asked the passenger who took our row to maybe switch to another spot so we could have our row back.. which he did and I was so grateful for that. Two of the female attendants observed the entire situation and also agreed Becky was being out of line and mentioned they felt bad for how we were treated! My entire family and I have always chosen Southwest to Fly.. I know how you all conduct yourselves and what you all pride yourselves to be. I have never been treated like this before. I understand you have a strict protocol for everyone's safety and I respect  that but Becky Peterson is too harsh and it's only a matter of time until you get an employee like her with an angry passenger and then wind up on the news. I'm not sure if I will fly again with Southwest when going to SLC. It was humiliating. Please make sure your Employees are consistent when charging 2nd ESAS especially with first time Flyers with ESA(s)."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,I didn't fly anyway where just want to thank you,"I was watching on the world news that you SouthWest are the only flight sticking to social distancing. Congratulations, you are what makes humanity a great place to live in. If I fly, I'm flying South West! That's it.."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Excellent customer service,"I see no need for improvements for this airlines.They offer excellent customer service with friendly and helpful staff.They are very organized and everything went as planned according to flight times, security, baggage, and airline staff. I always fly through this airlines."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Awful Never Again,Our flight is at 6 am and Southwest ticket agents do not show up until 530! I have a car seat and two bags to check traveling with two children and I am expected to do all of this get through security and make it to our gate in 30 min
Date of travel: July 2020,10,I have never been treated so poorly,"I fly very often for work and leisure, I was traveling with a friend who has a certified service animal, and before you ask yes all of the documentation is legal, as we were boarding our plane we had a south west employee who raised her voice and used vulgar language because I was holding the service animals leash. When I glanced at her name tag she got inches from my face and waved her finger in my face, we remained calm the entire time. I will never be flying southwest again, the workers name was Carol Norton I believe. An absolute evil person. Do better southwest."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Steven from customer service completely rude! Unacceptable treatment,I am VERY upset.  I have owned a travel agency for 13 years.  We booked flights for our family to Lauderdale/Key west before the outbreak hit.  NOW Steven with customer relations tells me he will not reimburse me and that I have to take a travel credit.  There is an outbreak in United in the news today.  People on the news (today show) saying do not fly.  I have autoimmune disease and my son has asthma and with the suddenoutbreak in Fl we can NOT fly.  I need reimbursed. When we booked it Florida was not a concern.  I need reimbursed this is not an ok way to treat people.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Hey ScaryWorst.......you sure you have the flight schedules correct?????,"Have not even taken the flight yet and I am disgusted with these folks.  Was never a Southwest fan to begin with.  My husband used them in and out of Midway / Chicago on a regular basis.  So I just kinda went along with it.  They seem to have it together at the Midway airport......now Tampa, that is a different ballgame.  It's bad......really bad.  The day the September 2020 schedule went up, I booked two tix, TPA to RDU.  As of this date, both flights have been changed.  This first flight, OMG!!!  did that change upset me.  Day of vacation lost.  Hotel res out the window.  Car rental fees went way up.  And then their slow a$$ system would not let me in to make changes.  So 5:30 AM I as on the phone with an agent.  Thankfully, I only had to wait on hold about thirty seconds.  So that was good.  Admittedly, the agent worked hard to get me a better flight and no increase in air fare.  That was a couple of weeks ago.  Now tonight, another change is sent to me.  And this one, I can do nothing about.From so many of the comments posted, seems that the employees with Southwest go out of their way to make their passengers feel terrible.  Sorry to be such a bother to you.  After this trip, I will go back to Delta.  The aggravation you heap upon your customers is not worth the few dollars that is saved by having free bags."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Flight Attendants and Pilots Without Masks!!!,"Recently at a hotel stay near Washington DC I observed several Flight Attendants and Pilots not wearing mask in the hotel’s airport shuttle, food counter, lobby and elevators.  I’m a longtime customer and until this a big fan of Southwest. But the careless behaviour disturbs me."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service in Executive Office,"Southwest airlines has the worst customer service.  Clerical error on a passenger name and DOB was made.  As soon as the problem was discovered I called the 800 number to fix it. Phone agent said she could not fix it and said I had to call customer relations office when they opened back up.  Called and spoke to Jon (employee #E135149) who stated he would not exercise his discretion and fix the one passenger’s info that was mistakenly entered. I asked who his supervisor was and he stated “Lyndsay” but refused to provide me with her direct phone number.  Jon was rude and argumentative when I continued to just ask for the name and phone number of someone above him to address the problem with. Jon then said anyone in his executive office is going to tell me the same thing (despite him choosing not to exercise his discretion and fix the passenger info). Jon continued to refuse to give me the contact info for anyone above him to address the problem.  Jon then put me on hold without my permission claiming “let me know when you want to go through the call back process” and didn’t allow me to respond. I was on hold for 10-15 minutes, He came back and still refused to provide the information I originally requested."

Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Bag was lost, never recovered, and claim is 100% denied","Southwest has lost a customer that used to fly weekly. My bag was lost.  Never found.  Customer Service was atrocious, it was impossible to get help.  When I finally got the help I needed to file a claim for my lost items, the claim was 100% denied.  Southwest agrees that my bag was never found, but they refuse to reimburse me for anything- not even the bag itself!  I went shopping the first day of my trip and purchased a bunch of things that didn’t fit in my suitcase.  So, I bought one of those big $25 bags at check in (when I was returning home) and packed all of my new things in it.  Someone must have looked through this bag, saw all of the new things and decided “why not?”   So a whole day of shopping, with several new, expensive items.  And Southwest’s attitude is “you should have read our liability sign.”  I cant even wrap my brain around this total lack of concern for completely losing my bag.  Sigh."
Date of travel: June 2020,20,Southwest Airlines does not live up the the 'Southwest Promise'.,"I submitted a complaint to Southwest airlines over a week ago. Still no response."" I took a flight from Minneapolis to Denver on June 16, 2020 to attend a funeral. This flight broke all the rules of health safety that were advertised on your website when I booked my flight. There were a few rows with 3 people, and about 20-30% of people were not wearing masks. I asked the attendants several times to please ask the people to wear their masks. They did not. I asked the flight attendants why they were not enforcing the mask rule, and they said the same thing, ""we can’t make people wear masks, we can only ask them to wear them"". I chose to fly Southwest Airlines because of the health and safety advertised in the Southwest Promise. I feel Southwest has failed to keep up their promise. Currently it is NOT Southwest policy to enforce face mask wearing. United and American airlines announced they will ban people from flying the airline if they don’t comply with wearing masks. Southwest Airlines should do the same and take their customers health seriously, live up to the Southwest Promise."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Missed a funeral due to southwest Idiots,I will never book on southwest again. They closed the doors early and wouldn't let us on the flight. Missed my grandmother's funeral. F@#k you southwest!!
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Southwest Doesn't Care About Traveler Health and Safety,"I have never been treated so poorly as a frequent flier at ANY airline. If you have a Southwest travel fund, READ THIS. I have a Southwest travel fund for $167 that expires Sept. 17, 2020. I had planned to use it this Spring, until national restrictions due to Covid-19 prevented my travel. In May, a Southwest travel rep reassured me the travel fund expiration date was extended to Dec. 17, 2020. I was SO relieved because $167 is a good amount of money I didn't want to lose, and I couldn't travel again any earlier than October 2020. But when I tried to book my flight (in June), I got an error message that said my travel fund expiration date was Sept. 17, 2020. I immediately called Southwest customer service to explain that I was told the wrong expiration date by one of their reps and due to Covid-19 health concerns and regional restrictions, I can't use my travel credit until October 2020. FUN FACT: Did you know... Southwest is extending the expiration date for travel funds that expire between March 1 and Sept. 7, 2020, to now expire Sept. 7, 2022? That now gives travelers 2 YEARS to use their travel credit. I have to assume they've done this to protect the health of those Southwest fliers who don't feel safe flying any time soon and in the midst of Covid-19. What a nice, and very practical, gesture! Let me remind you my travel fund expiration date is Sept. 17, 2020. And because it falls 10 days later, my own health and safety is NOT prioritized by Southwest travel policy-makers. Instead, I'm forced to use my $167 travel fund by Sept 17, 2020 and risk not only my own health, but that of my friends, family and fellow fliers -- or it disappears forever. I spoke with several reps (including a customer relations manager) and none of them gave a damn that I couldn't use my travel fund, when I was initially told by one of their reps that it expired on Dec. 17, 2020. That doesn't sound like Transfarency to me! What do you think? It's no wonder Delta is my #1...they actually make exceptions in the interest of the health and safety of their frequent fliers. I wonder what Southwest cares about..."

Date of travel: June 2020,10,Never Again,"You definitely get what you pay for. Initially I was happy to see the free bag check-in policies and the lower airfare. However, my flight was delayed for over an hour due to generator issues departing Philly. The flight time is 1.5 hours so that long of a delay is brutal when you arrive to an airport hours in advance as recommended.And on the return flight, there was an additional hour and a half delay to fly back home to Philly. No reason given. No apologies. No kickbacks. I even upgraded my seats. Never again. Worse than Spirit.One thing I do know is, I’ll pay a higher price for airlines that are on time and organized."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Southwest does not equal great customer service,"I'm not sure why Southwest gets rave reviews. On a recent trip we wanted to change our flight to one that left 4 hours earlier. Plenty of seats due to COVID.  The gate agent quoted $680 to change two return tickets, when the cost per ticket return was $199 each  online - full price. And we had already paid for our return flight, so where did the $680 come from? They said it was due to COVID? Since when are airlines charging almost two times as much as the published online rate to change to an earlier filght - 4 hours earlier? What happened to the famous Southwest customer service? The gate agent apparently could do nothing as they can't override the system that said $680. They obviously were charging some kind of change fee, which they say they don't - and while they supposedly pride themselves on allowing employees to make decisions to please the customer this didn't happen."

Date of travel: June 2020,10,Worst flight and company EVER!,"Southwest Airlines is the absolute worst company ever! Left St. Louis at 5:00PM. This was the first flight, which was only an hour (to Houston). We have now been in Houston for 3hrs waiting on our second flight, on three different planes, and now still waiting to get on another flight. Worst flight and worst company. I will never fly southwest again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,SW Gate Agent Was So Compassionate,"I'm very claustrophobic so I can become very uncomfortable on a full plane. I always buy an upgrade so I can board very early. If I can get a seat up front it reduces my anxiety. In February, when I asked to buy an upgrade the gate agent said I didn't need one because the flight would only be half full. I thanked her, returned to my seat, and then I went back. I confessed that I have terrible claustrophobia and I did need the upgrade. With so much sensitivity the gate agent gave me a pre-board pass. I didn't know I could ask for that. I boarded early, found a seat near the front, and felt so much better. Thank you, Southwest."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Southwest has been my choice of travel since I was a college student,"I have flown with Southwest on roundtrips twice since the Covid-19 pandemic. To be honest, they have not disappointed. If a patron doesn’t have a mask, they will supply you with one. The planes are cleaned, they keep the middle seat open for social distancing, the planes were on time, and the flight crew were properly wearing their masks and gloves. The food service currently is a can of water with a straw, and a pretzel mix. Also on flight 258, it was an all male crew. Kudos to them. On our return flight we actually arrived earlier than expected. Thank you for staying in service during this current situation the world is in."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Life saver,I would like to take the time to give a very very very special Thanks to Mi at the Dallas Southwest airlines center. She went above and beyond to make sure my son got his baggage in time for next flight which was a 45 minutes turnaround. I can't explain how deeply grateful I am to you Ms. Mi 🥰 Thanks a million. 5 stars I will recommend Southwest to friends and family
Date of travel: June 2020,40,"On time, but late","The flight left a few minutes early and I had high hopes of making it on time for the first time in a long while, but as we landed 7 minutes early our gate was not ready and we waited on the tarmac over ten minutes while they figured out a new gate for us. So interestingly the flight was early, but by the time we waited and changed gates we were late."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,HAD TO CANCEL MY VACATION! THANKS FOR NOTHING!!,"This is an airline that shouldn't make it out of the Covid Crisis. This country finally opens up, so that we can stop being cooped up at home, and Southwest decides to cancel my vacation flight. The explanation was, that due to social distancing, I would have to fly a different flight, as the one I had booked was too full.  When I asked why they sold me the tickets on that flight, when they already knew the flight was overbooked,  I was given no answer. My choice was to take a flight that arrived after 8:00 pm or cancel my trip. As we already had plans scheduled earlier than 8:00 pm, I chose to cancel. I believe that Southwest is willfully overselling the better flight choices and then trying to force people to take the flights that they cannot fill. They waited 2 weeks to inform me of their changes, hoping that I would settle for the lesser itinerary."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Great flight,Felt safe and flights were on time Flight crew was polite and courteous. Return flight was as well.  The plane was clean and the airport felt safe also.
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Nice Flight,"Everything about the flight was very good. Southwest does a great job and the flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Great flight! During the restricted period of the virus, SWA is doing extremely well."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for, don't expect much from this airline. They have cheaper prices because they have 0 customer service. Buyer beware, you have been warned!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Flight attendant was the worst!,"Normally Southwest is great, but we had the rudest flight attendant this flight.  Before we even took off, she started yelling at my kids who were just sitting there on their tablets.  I told her they were not bothering anyone and she snapped at me. Seriously?  Worst customer service I've ever had on a Southwest flight.  Will never fly Southwest again."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Southwest flights unsafe for COVID worriers!,"Totally outraged that Southwest did not adhere to its plan to sell only 50% of its seats till the end of June. As a senior with underlying medical issues, I trusted Southwest to fly me safely home from Palm Beach International Airport to MacArthur Airport on Long Island. I spoke to a representative on the phone four days before my scheduled flight and was assured that the flights from West Palm Beach to Baltimore, and then Baltimore to Long Island, would be capped at 50%. That was absolutely not the case. To make matters worse, the person who was scanning boarding passes announced to the assembled that masks were requested to board and fly, but that Southwest could not enforce that. And, when I asked the flight attendant on the second flight segment why capacity was above 50%, she told me that they could seat 102 passengers on a plane built to fly 143. That math does not add up! Additionally, she announced several times that middle seats were not blocked, that if someone wanted a middle seat they could have it. Blockheads, the lot of them! I have been so careful to isolate for weeks and weeks. Now, I have to quarantine for two weeks AND worry that I will get COVID 19. Southwest, I’ve been such a fan. I fly your airline everywhere I can, but you broke my heart. I’ll think twice next time I choose an airline to fly."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,STEALING from luggage,Unpacked my luggage and found they stole several brand new pieces of clothing and 2 brand new winter vests!!!!  I hate we can’t lock our luggage or trust people! Thanks Southwest Airlines!!
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Prepare to be dissapointed!!!,"Southwest used to be an inexpensive high quality airline with great customer service. In the last year or so, their fares have increased, and their service has absolutely gotten worse, along with obnoxious! If you choose to fly them, prepare to be majorly disappointed! U can find way better quality, service and prices elsewhere!"
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Southwest Airlines Vacations (Avoid like the Plague),Flight Cancelled and they will not refund my money for the flight and 90 days wait for the hotel refund and still no refund.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Easy and good price,"I've never had an issue that wasn't resolved quickly and with a kind smile. Doesn't matter if you are talking to the gate agent, flight attendant, or calling in. They are always courteous, even when there are terrible storms"
Date of travel: August 2019,10,Poor Customer Service who Provided Incorrect Information,I lost out on $215 because the agent I spoke to (6 months after cancelling multiple flights—due to moving out of state) told me I didn’t have any more funds pending. I’ve re-booked multiple flights and tried using all my vouchers but the SW website was giving me errors on all of my confirmations which is why I initially called then. So I Reached out to their customer relations Via email because no one else can help me—and all they can advise me was that on the original confirmation stated the expiration date. HELLOOOOO!! That’s why I called SW to help with what funds I had pending instead of typing 10 flights on the web and getting an error message. This is absurd— I was told by THEIR AGENT who said I didn’t have anymore available funds and had lost out on my money.
Date of travel: May 2020,50,CANCELLATION DUE TO COVID-19,"Our flight to Cabo for June  2020 was cancelled in May 2020. Southwest within days issued travel credits to our friends, reinstated our points used and refunded all of us our early bird checkin fees. Once we found out that travel ban is still in place to Mexico and no replacement flights yet, we requested a refund for friends instead of travel credits since trip cancelled. Within 2 days our friends received their refund. I did everything by email instead of sitting on hold on the phone. It was so easy and all handled very quickly. Very impressed with the ease of handling all the cancellations for this trip. Hope we can rebook soon."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Dropped from Flight without contact,"3 time flight was pushed out due to covid cancellation. Not once were we contacted. This last time I finally got them on phone to get cancelled flight rebooked for my husband and myself. No idea why but rep rebooked us onto 2 different confirmation #s. 10 days later I guess they cancelled my seat. Again, no contact so I'd know. 6 weeks later I'm noticing all June flighs gone from schedule yet it shows my husband still has a flight. Email, Call regarding my lost seat without response for several days. So I call again to ait on hold to be told I don't have a seat that there's been a 50% reduction in seats. No idea why I wasn't contacted except that my FF # was not associated to record but she'll enter it. Then talked to supervisor who says I had been contacted but strangely there's no Email in my inbox. So she forwards me email that say's I'd cancelled my flight which was not the case - remembe rmy FF# had not been associated which was NOT my fault. So all I get is a sorry we're booked but I have a refund credit that I can use for my seat in July but my husband has his seat and we started this on same ticket. SORRY that's all they had and keep checking on availability and when the fligts higher priced to call back in and explain so they can book it for me for my credit of course at this point after waiting for a customer service rep the flight will probably be gone.  To think I bought more stock today. Selling tomorrow - this airline has joined the ranks of the rest."
Date of travel: May 2020,50,Customer service surprise,Made reservations in November 2019 for a wedding in May 2020. Flight was cancelled by Southwest due to Covid-19 issues. I was hesitant to request another flight due to changes in dates and times.I contacted customer service regarding refund due to Southwest cancelling flight. I was told it would take 30 days for Southwest processing and then 30-60 days for credit card processing.Surprise was that Souhwest processed credit in 2 days and my credit card was processed in 3 days. I was very impressed with Southwest and bank handling this issue as fast as 3 days. I will once again use Southwest services.
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Flying Petri Dish,"I couldn't believe my eyes. Everything seemed on point as we boarded the plane in groups of 10. But once I took my seat, all of that changed. The plane was packed except for the middle seats, and inexplicably, they blocked off the first three rows. Why? So basically, I was less than 2 feet from the person in front of me, behind me, and beside me. Thankfully, everyone was ""required"" to wear a mask, though it was loosely enforced. Some too-cool-for-a-mask young guy sauntered off the plane without a mask. Needless to say, you can totally forget the 6-foot rule on Southwest. I thought, at the very least, that they'd only fill the planes to half capacity. Oh no, can't have that. Gotta make those big profits for the shareholders. The ultimate irony? SWA goes through their usual ""in case of a water landing or loss of cabin pressure"" PSA but completely neglect any mention of the virus. Why? Is it some dirty secret?Which brings me to the most unbelievable parts of the trip: the deplaning from both flights. As soon as both legs of my flight landed, there was no -- nada, zero -- deplaning protocol. Virtually everyone just stood up and packed the aisle to get out like the pre-Corona days. I couldn't believe my eyes. I mean, what's the point of an orderly boarding process if there is absolutely no deplaning protocol? Totally makes all the other ""measures"" completely useless. I was expecting waaaay more from SWA, particularly after its CEO, Gary Kelly, touted the careful steps it was taking to combat the virus. Careful? Try careless, try half-assed, try pathetic. Shame on SWA! Makes me want to reconsider ever flying with them again. I was appalled."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,My Favourite Domestic Airline,"I have flown Southwest Airlines once before my trip to one of my favourite cities on the west coast, San Francisco. I'll admit that my main attraction to Southwest Airlines was the fact that 2 bags fly free in economy, but I was pleasantly surprised by the plane's cleanliness, comfort, and friendly flight staff. I would recommend this airline to everybody, especially those that frequently travel with baggage and those that hate delays as I've never had a delay with Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,"They got my luggage missing since 12/25/2019 and have recused to find it or compensate for it. They have treated my family with so much injustice, inhuman and racial discrimination. i just received a reply from them that they will not find my bag that they got missing since December 25 with all my valuables and my childrens clothings for christmas. They have denied my kids  my family the opportunity to have a decent christmas and every time I call them there is never anyone who Knows who is dealing with my case until I had to go on social media before I get a response. THEY just replied me that I will not be refunded for my bag and valuables and they will also not be finding my bag for me. Please is there anyone out there with same experience and what advice can you offer? I am considering all options to get my bag back cause It’s been 5 frustrating months dealing with them."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Overweight Bag,Unfortunately traveling for business & was just charged an overweight fee for 4 over the limit. There is barely anyone on the plane due to the Pandemic. Will my little bag really make that much difference? Very disappointed.
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Bait and Switch Pricing,"Southwest arbitrarily canceled our flight 2230 reservation on 7/6/2020, changed it to 7/5/200 when we were to attend a wedding because we had a low cost fare that was purchased directly from them.  We were told the flight had been cancelled.  I just checked the availability for this flight and it shows seats available at higher prices.We had to extend our trip by one day which increased our hotel and car expenses.DO NOT TRUST sOUTHWEST AIRLINES IF YOU BUY A REDUCED FARE!  IT COULD BE A BAIT AND SWITCH."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Wonderful staff!,Positive experience. Will always travel with Southwest. Hope they have more flights to Europe in the future!
Date of travel: April 2020,50,Accomodating during time of corona,I'd fly southwest any day. Reliable and accountable. Solid option domestically. I hope they survive and make it to the post corona world!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Generous airline,My dentist in the DMV area and i live in a different state. I always do these quick trips to and from and Southwest is always reliable and generous with their bag allowance. I will continue to fly them for my personal needs.
Date of travel: May 2020,50,Reliable airline.,"This flight was quick and smooth, basically empty airport and safe trip. Traveling during this is scary but i had no one near me and masks were on."
Date of travel: May 2020,50,Wonderful customer service from Jen,"We are Australians and have flown Southwest previously to visit our friends who live just outside Albany NY.  This year we were scheduled to vacation in the USA and would have been flying from Memphis to Albany in July .  We cannot fly out of our country for the forseeable future and when I contacted Southwest for a refund (via Facebook and Messenger) Jen reached out to help us.  We did not want it in vouchers because we are not sure if we will be able to travel to the USA again (due to age and other factors).   Jen went out of her way to check our bookings which had been changed as recently as last week due to Covid-19 affecting schedules,  and advised she could refund our money, which will be back in our account within 30 days.  This was all achieved in about 10 minutes.  To be honest I was totally blown away by this amazing service and given the chance to travel to the USA again we will undoubtedly choose Southwest as our airline of choice.  Again thank you so much Jen and Southwest."

Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth flight and great crew,"the flight was pretty empty, which allowed for a relaxing trip. The crew was funny about dealing with the passengers and making sure everyone spread out to give people space. Always great to have a laugh before takeoff. Would recommend again!"
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Zero Customer Service,"Wish I could put a zero for likelihood to recommend....Even though my return flight was canceled, there was ZERO refund was offered.  Now $565.92 of my money is being held ransom in the form of travel vouchers because the flight times that worked best just so happened to be “wanna get away” fares. I don’t want your crappy travel vouchers, I want my money back. I don’t care how long the vouchers are extended... who knows if you’re going to be in business when this is over?  NEVER AGAIN!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Won't flight Southwest airline again,"Our family won't flight with Southwest airline again. Cancelled trip during COVID-19 but didn't get refund. Instead, we got 1 year extenion from the original date of purchase.This company took billion of dollars from tax payers bailout and they don't help out their customers. And the worst, if we choose to transfer this ticket in within a year to other family members, we have to pay $100 transfer fee.Our sibling families whom planed to have vacation with us, they purchased from American Airline with the same ticket class. After their discussion with AA customer reps, AA issued 100% REFUND to my them.Our family is the only one purchased with Southwest and we got screwed over!!!The worst, I was tricked by Southwest services reps twice ( I called into their servic center and spoke to 2 different Reps, both of them told us ""we will get 100% refund if the place we plan to attend is closed by COVID19. Guess what, both of the places we plan to visit were closed by COVID19 - Universal Studio in LA and Disney Land in San Diego area) but Southwest still refuse to issue a refund.WILL NOT FLY SOUTHWEST AIRLINE AGAIN !!!"
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Genuinely The Worst Customer Service I Have Ever Experienced,"I am absolutely appalled at the customer service me and my girlfriend received at the Philadelphia airport. She had purchased a ticket for a flight on April 24th about a month or so in advance and it got canceled within a week of said flight. Okay, not the end of the world. The very next day she rescheduled for a flight on April 25th. This flight was then also cancelled. But then, it wasn’t. It was available for scheduling again on the website, so my girlfriend just rescheduled for the same flight again. It was odd, but the flight was available again, so we just went with business as usual. So we drove to the airport, an hour and a half drive, and when we get there she types in her confirmation number and it says the flight has been canceled. Now, the previous two cancellations came with a notification saying the flight had been canceled. My girlfriend checked for one the whole drive there and did not receive one. Needless to say after the drive, this was a frustrating revelation. We spoke with an attendant at the nearby counter and explained the situation, and she told us that the only thing she could do was book us a flight for the following morning at 7:00 AM. We’d need to be there at 6:00 AM which meant we’d have to leave at 4:00 AM. This was not convenient for us, and it meant we’d have to make another 3 hour round trip drive. So we found ourselves speaking with a different attendant regarding what happened and asked if we could be transferred to a flight with a different airline, something many other airlines do in these situations (my dad, a million mile flyer, can attest to this) only to be told this was impossible, despite there being an American Airlines flight in a few hours with lots of available seats. I explained my lack of confidence that the flight the next day would actually go out, and the attendant expressed that she also was not confident. As the conversation went on, things got heated, with a supervisor stepping in as the original attendant began yelling and accusing us of lying and saying that we known it’d been canceled before driving an hour and a half out to the airport, which makes no sense. The supervisor told me he refused to speak to me because I wasn’t the passenger, despite this nonsense affecting me too since I have to drive and house my girlfriend for the remainder of her time here. We were told that our options were to keep the flight for the following day (the one the attendant originally had no confidence in, but now in the presence of her supervisor couldn’t accurately say how likely it was that it’d go out) or to get a refund in the form of a voucher for another southwest flight. Neither was a satisfactory solution given that, as far as we could tell, this was an error on their end. I’m struggling to convey the rudeness, hostility, and apathy we were met with in this situation, but I can promise you it was genuinely upsetting, with my girlfriend choking back tears during the exchange before breaking down in the car afterwards as we drove home. I’m left expecting a similar experience for the following flight, and the whole experience has left us feeling as though we will never travel with Southwest again. This behavior was absolutely unacceptable, hurtful, unprofessional, and unaccommodating."
Date of travel: May 2019,10,Unexplaind cancelling my flights for all 20 of us in June and July. TWICE!!!,Me and 20 other people in my group just got our flights cancelled again after you cancelled our flights in June and we had to reschedule our trip reservations and the flights for more than 30 days later in July. Now again without notice you cancel our flights for a second time!!! What the hell are we suppose to do now? We will lose money changing all of our reservations again in Punta Cana. We need an explanation!!! I am sick and tired of this poor behavior and lack of communication from such a big company who we have been so loyal to. This makes me sick!!! The Flight has been Cancelled so now we are stuck taking a lost. The first flight was for June 14th 2020 and the second flight was for July 19th 2020

Date of travel: January 2020,10,No Refund for Canceled Flight,"Southwest is taking advantage of passengers by creating different fares before cancelling flights in order to get around their obligation as outlined in the *Contract of Carriage”.   By doing this they claim that the lower fare credit cannot be “refunded” because it is not the price of the current ticket.  This is done to avoid giving their customers a full refund.  There is no other reason.  Look, I know times are difficult for all airlines.  However, for Southwest to stoop this low is despicable.  They cancelled my flight, booking #s and flights were not changed between advertising a lower fare and cancelling.  Below are the details of these transaction.  Why should Southwest keep my $122.00?  Shame on southwest for acting in this manor!!!

Date of travel: September 2019,50,Absolutely love to fly Southwest.,"Travelled to Antigua, and Barbados in September of 2019. Loved both Islands. Antigua is small and not a lot to do but Barbados was bustlying. Entertainment every night at Oisten."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Longtime fan, first-time reviewer","I live in a household divided; my spouse finds Southwest's no-seat-assignment policy stressful, but I love the order and ease of just finding your spot in line and shuffling into the plane. I appreciate Southwest's brand of warm-and-casual onboard service, and I like that the seats don't feel as small as those on many other airlines. I've flown with Southwest probably 100 times over the last two decades, and this has been my consistent experience with the airline."
n/a,10,Unrealistic policies during global epidemic,"Southwest used to be my fav, but today it showed as the worst airlines out there. My son(14 yo) and i were supposed to have a 3 week trip in June for his 15th birthday going to Hawaii, then Home state of Connecticut, then back to Florida where we live now. Well, family in Hawaii said nothing is slated to open back up until ""unknown"". Defintely not by June. United Airlines was nice enough to give us travel credits for 24 months and no resch fee so as to not interfere with my sons Freshman Year of High School (August 2020). Southwest stated that  they are sticking to there normal policies( despite abnormal circumstances) and would only allow 12 months from the DATE OF PURCHASE of tkts. I bought in January for a flight in June!!! So why cant Southwest extend the same courtesy as the other airlines about rebooking? The soonest my son will be able to travel again will be June of 2021. Id rebook everything now 0for june of 2021 if i was able. I still plan on taking him. I dont want the money back, just give us more time to reuse it like the other airlines... Nope... Got told repeatedly this is SW policy. Literally thought SW was the best, but now I stand corrected..."
Date of travel: April 2020,50,Escorting a Fallen Soldier,"Yesterday I escorted the remains of one our soldiers from Kansas back to his family in Washington state. I wanted to take a moment and praise how absolutely amazing Southwest Airlines was. The staff members along the three stops I had to make were absolutely amazing and generous. I couldn't even pay for my own food. The teams were extremely accommodating, friendly and engaging, and took the utmost care when handling the coffin. This is one of those sad but rare instances where we get to see how amazing a company and its employees can be. I also asked just about all the people I talked to about how much they liked working for this airline and they told me how much they have been taken care of and they appreciate what corporate has done to help them. So thank you again Southwest and everything you did to make this trip happen."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Southwest Refund Policy,"After requesting a refund for a trip, Southwest would only give me a flight credit because I cancelled my reservation before the flight was actually cancelled by Southwest. I submitted an inquiry about this weeks ago and never got a response and Southwest is still refusing to give me a refund instead of a flight credit."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,A1 flight,"Flight was great as usual. Flight was full, but flight attendants did a great job and kept the passengers entertained and engaged.  They were very efficient and friendly.  Captain kept us informed, and flight time was under what we were told.  I always fly Southwest and have always been pleased with the service."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Won't refund,They said they'd rerfund earlybird fees;  what bs!   No refund!   I sent email (as they instructed) and got back email saying to call them;  on hold for an hour.  Terrible
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Christmas/New Trip to Disney,"My husband and I flew to Orlando Florida to Disney World to spend a week at our favorite get away. We love flying Southwest because they make it so easy. We don’t have to figure out hidden costs host for baggage, snacks, leg room etc...  we love how friendly everyone is and often times we get special entertainment from the flight staff. We are usually on time and often times arrive early. I feel that for the most part the prices are fair especially with the number of bags you can check for free and again not having to miss hidden fees or missed fees for upsetting surprises at check in. Being able to fly with ease can make a vacation or traveling to an from a destination more pleasurable or miserable. It’s great to know I have a favorite airline I can count on.  Thanks Southwest keep up the great work."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A seamless flight,"I've flown with Southwest a number of times, and have always enjoyed it. This flight was seamless--we caught a cotton-candy sunrise as we flew over the Eastern Sierras and even landed ahead of schedule. I will definitely be booking with Southwest again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,I love this airline,"I flew down to visit my parents during spring break and we went with Southwest. By far, Southwest is the best airline I've ever flown with. I liked the open seating on the plane, the friendly service, and the on-time arrivals. Southwest is definitely my first choice of airlines"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,SWA helped during one of the roughest weeks of my life,"In August 2019, my mother had was put in the hospital.  After helping me change our flights to get my middle child and I to Texas without charging extra, two days after I arrived, she had been placed on Hospice.  Our original plan had been for my husband to drive down that Friday with my other two children.  (It was the first week of school and my husband still had to work - middle child attended online school).  That Wednesday, the nurse told me that if I wanted my mom to see my other two kids to see her, they needed to get down there - today.  There were two flights out, one to Houston - landing at 6:55, one to Austin - landing at 2:30, but it was to take off in an hour and a half and we live almost an hour away.  My husband grabbed my kids and they jumped in the car while I bought the tickets.  I explained the situation to the lady at Southwest, we all understood how difficult it would be for my family to get to the airport in time.  I also let her know the passengers would be a 15 year old boy and an 8 year old girl, I asked if she could let the crew know so that, if possible, they could get them close to each other or at least for them to keep an eye on my daughter.My husband called me several minutes after the flight was supposed to take off, ""They are on the plane.""  I asked if he had made it in time, he said, ""No.""  My son later told me that they ran through the airport (my husband carrying his shoes and belt) and as soon as he passed the threshold of the plane, they closed the door.I don't know for a fact that they held the plane.  All I know, is they did not make it in time.  And more importantly, my mother was able to see her other two grandchildren on the last day that she was awake.Thank you Southwest, I will never fly another carrier."
Date of travel: April 2020,50,I’m not flying Southwest today.,"This is my review to appreciate the crap out of Southwest Airlines, who I have never appreciated so much before. I always fly Southwest. They are courteous, you can check bags for free, and they always try to help where they can if something goes amiss. They are awesome. Today I flew American because it was cheaper. Worst experience. First, they double charged me for my flight and when I called said they “had already requested a refund” but have no clue how long that will take. Then, they said my 22” carry on was too wide because of the wheels (this is the same carry on I have taken on at least 3 Southwest flights). Despite there only being like 30 people on my flight, they charged me 30.00 to check my bag. Am I in the air? Yes. Has anyone been particularly nice? Nope. All of the American people at the airport were rude as heck with the exception of the ticket counter lady who was at least cordial. I get it. The pandemic sucks. I wouldn’t be flying if I didn’t have to. But when customer service is your JOB, be nice to people. I swear, every Southwest agent, ticket person, flight attendant has been amazing compared to American. I will NEVER fly American again after this."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Refused to give a refund during the public health crisis!,"I was suppose to go on a trip for a friend this month but obviously can’t due to the pandemic. I called southwest and explained that Fox News stated that all airlines are suppose to give refunds for flights that people want to cancel. I was told unfortunately I could not do that because I bought a non refundable ticket and that the best they could do is give me a credit to take a flight another time. I told them that they should be be making exceptions due to the pandemic. I also spoke with a supervisor (Mike, #30) who was extremely rude to me and I told him that we don’t know how long this thing is going to last and that I can’t afford to just give them $300 for a flight I may never be able to take. The supervisor (Mike) said “we’re not changing our policy and you’re not getting a refund”. WOW!!! I have never been spoken to so rudely in my life especially by someone who is a supervisor in customer service. I will never be using southwest again! They do not care about people at all!!!! I would not recommend them and never will again!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Just another routine flight, the way I like it.",non stop to and from MCO. Can;t beat it. Only airline I take. No additional fee for luggage and reward points add up faster. Many options available like a screen with lowest prices available through out the month.
Date of travel: April 2020,10,They ruined my weekend.,"One of my best friends is getting married in Tulsa, and I booked a flight months in advance so I can be there with plenty of time to pick up my suit and make it to the rehearsal dinner, as I am in the ceremony.  However,  Southwest goes ahead and RESCHEDULES my itinerary without my knowledge to a time that will have me missing the time available to pick up my suit as well as missing the rehearsal dinner all together.  I picked that time for a reason, and then they just go ahead and cancel the flight.  Not professional and not cool."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Very Poor Customer Service,"I booked a flight for my daughter, who was home due to her dad passing away, she originally flew into Denver from Korea to attend the funeral and then came to Tennessee to spend time with me before heading back.  As the date for her flight approached, due to COVID19, SW canceled her flight and we had to reschedule her domestic flight and her international flight.  When rescheduling her flight, since the new flight was less than the original flight purchase, instead of refunding the money of the $82.00 difference, they are holding the money as credit for future use.  This is an example of poor customer service and I will never use SW again. They are the ones who canceled the flight and recently received a great bailout but want to hold onto my money."

Date of travel: January 2020,10,Rapid Rewards Companion Pass Scam,I only gave one star because I can't leave zero. Their rapid rewards card and companion pass program is a total scam. They delay posting points that you legitimately earn and delay posting them for months so you can't use the pass that you rightfully earned. I had read that about them and should have listened. They blame everyone else even though it's their own program. I spent 3 months calling to get the points I rightfully earned and then they would not back date the pass to start when they finally issued it 3 months time lost! Can't fly now anyway! Run actually fly to a different airline!
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Disappointed,Very disappointed with this airline. With everything going on today I would expect to see southwest to have a little compassion and understanding with people needing to cancel their flights. My wife is 30 weeks pregnant and had a baby shower planned in April to fly to. Obviously that got cancelled. Southwest was at all no help and would not refund us. Thanks.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Highly Recommend,"Over our entire trip we flew with numerous different airline companies and Southwest was the best of the lot. It was not even a one-off lucky trip that we took but we made multiple journey's (6 in total) within the U.S with Southwest.Tickets were always priced at the same amount as competitors, yet Southwest was the only airline offering free checked baggage (2 per person!) meaning for our travels, with a suitcase each, for myself and my partner price-wise this airline was by far the best option. Their app is very useful for check-in and keeping updated on flight status, gate changes etc. Online check-in was a breeze, we never paid for priority-boarding/early-bird; Southwest operate a 'open-seating' policy so the earlier you check-in, the earlier you board and the more choice you have, however on all but one flight we managed to find two seats together despite being lower B group (just ensure you check-in quickly when it opens online 24 hours prior to departure).The seats always looked clean, although having been on two continuing flights (where you remain on board), it was evident that they didn't do too much cleaning between services which could be improved (though hopefully given the virus pandemic they have increased their cleaning standards). Check-in physically at the airports was also simple with the self-serve kiosks, and we didn't once have to wait in a line. Overall, I think 5 out of 6 of our flights departed and arrived almost exactly on time. I had one cancelled flight but this was due to the airport closing as a result of inclement weather, and through the Southwest app I managed to contact a customer representative and still get to my destination later in the day on a different flight once the fog had cleared and the airport was open again. The app is a stand out feature of the airline as despite not having TV's on-board, the app, when connected to their WiFi, allows free access to fantastic in-flight entertainment and even some live TV channels! (Ensure you download the app before departure). Internet browsing itself is $8 for the flight, but  the movies and TV are all completely free and you do not need to actually purchase the WiFi to access them. In addition, they also provide a complimentary drink and snacks on any type of flight i.e. it isn't just restricted to long haul, which we warmly welcomed.Finally, the staff were always friendly and cheerful and happy to assist with any queries. If I return to the U.S I would undoubtedly fly with Southwest again where possible."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,So Disappointed,"We had reservations to fly on Southwest on April 10th from Reno to San Diego, but due to Covid 19, we had to cancel due to the “stay home” directives. Under these circumstances, I fully expected Southwest to give us a full refund for the flight and early bird fees.  I have spoken to 4 agents at Southwest and have been told we won’t get our early bird fees back which amounted to $80.00.  Really?  I am sure Southwest will be getting relief from the federal government but to heck with the passengers in these horrible economic times.  The decision to cancel was made for us by the government not by us.  The last agent I spoke with said she could credit our Rapid Rewards account with 1000 points.  If you wanted to buy 1000 points it would cost you at most $30.00, so Southwest gets to keep  at a minimum $50.00.  If they do this to a million customers they will be reap many benefits.  I hope the federal government looks into the benefits this airline is gaining before they give them a huge bail-out package."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Awesome customer service,"I had to cancel a trip due to the virus that is sweeping the globe.  When I called, I got the most helpful, caring associate I think I could have gotten.  She was able to help with a refund in light of all that is going on.  A shout out to Victoria T., and the entire Southwest family!  Thank you for what you are doing for your customers."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,When you need an Airline help you out,"Our March 2020 trip to Denver was fantastic in spite of the unexpected need to push up our Southwest flight reservations originating in Philadelphia. The objective of our trip was to formally introduce ourselves to Joseph Michael, our new grandson. I suspect the little guy had a premonition of the coming Coronavirus and opted to make his appearance 2 weeks early. We had previously booked our Southwest flight to Denver based on the original due date; fortunately Southwest reservations were fantastic and made it easy it was for us to change our flight plans.  First there were no flight cancellation fees. When we called, a bit frenzied, and explained our need to quickly revise our flight plans, the reservation representative was calm, knowledgeable and very polite.  He immediately said “congratulations, this is great news and I’m going to get you to Denver as quickly as possible so you can meet the new little guy”. Not only did we get to move up our flight; but the new flight was cheaper and we got a credit that we’ll use to fly back for Joey’s 1st Birthday (hopefully sans any pandemic outbreak). As our daughter had a difficult and complicated delivery, it was fortuitous that Joey came early, given the Coronavirus concerns and the potential to strain the Nation’s acute care facilities. Both Joey and his mommy are fine and Mom Mom was a big help to Joey and his parents.  Pop Pop, well not so much.  Concerned that domestic flights might be curtailed, we decided to shorten our planned 3 week stay; despite that the supply of Bushmills was still ample.  While I’m sure that an extended stay by Mom Mom would have been desired, my daughter offered to pay for any increase in fare for my return flight.  Hmn, was there a message there?  Once again, Southwest came through and we got back to Philly with no cancellation fee.  Southwest showed extraordinary concern for their passengers as they retained our scheduled flight, despite there were 160 open seats.  We thank all the employees at Southwest Airlines who made it a delightful trip so we could welcome Joey."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,wedding cancelled,"The wedding was cancelled, we had to cancel our hotel and flight.  This was all due to the Corona virus.  My husband, daughter and I had purchased tickets with Southwest with early bird access.  When we cancelled they would not give us our early bird back with the future ticket.  They said they could not refund the early bird.  Every other airline that never gives credit is now giving credits, due to the dilemma we are now facing.  Except for Southwest.Also, I was told my ticket is only good for six months.  Why is Southwest not realizing that we had something that we desperately wanted to attend cancelled beyond our control?  This is not the customer service that we expect at a crucial time we are facing.  Unhappy with Southwest!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Won’t refund early bird fees,"What possible justification would they have for not refunding the $80 Early Bird fees for my wife and I? It makes no sense. Vegas is shut down, the govt says don’t fly, and this? Greed pure and simple. While me as a taxpayer is bailing them out. I say screw em. U made your bed."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,No Gluten Free options available,"I try to fly Southwest Airlines as much as possible.  Always, clean airplanes, no hassle to board, seat etc.  But for a long flight, like this one, they have no gluten free options for passengers suffering of celiac decease."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Buyer beware,"SHAME ON YOU Southwest Airlines  we were supposed to go to Florida March 17-March 24, OBVIOUSLY with a two year old with asthma who sees a pulmonologist for it every 3 months, a 6 MONTH OLD BABY & someone who is 69 and people with underlying conditions, we unfortunately had to make the choice to stay home during all of this...They will NOT refund our flights because we booked as a “group” we still paid $260 a flight and the best they will offer is new flights to go by May 30- in the middle of a pandemic...SICKENING that they care more about money than the safety of HUMANS- please share this because what they are doing is wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously disgraceful- atleast 5 of us have called them and got the same response that “you can email them but they don’t know if they will refund you” (my sister just got the email response that they will not) our kids are already having a hard time with us having to cancel, disgraceful. I will never book Southwest again and before you do remember this please!!!!!!! 7 on your side"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good service ,I was on one of southwest flights in July 2018 and the crew members were nice and friendly and service was pretty good.😀
Date of travel: March 2020,50,I always fly with Southwest,"I am usually loathe to fly with any other airline, and only do so to places Southwest doesn't fly to. Staff has always been friendly, and I've always thought the fare is reasonable. It may be more expensive than Frontier, but they are less expensive the United and Delta, and most of their policies are far more flexible."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,#1 Airline,"Southwest is my #1 airline, and has been my exclusive airline choice for a decade. The flight experience is always superb. Kelly is a super CEO, and the whole crew is upbeat and attentive. Having the freedom to arrange ourselves allows miracles of companionable connections to happen on a flight (ten years of testimonies). Free luggage and free flight changes are very valuable perks. Reliability and punctuality are unmatched. This airline has the happiest employees, and that is important to me. ❤️💛💙"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"safe,clean and on time","We flew both ways , the flight was on time to the minute on both flights, very clean  and the staff was very freindly.. also love the fact bags fly free.  will book again in future"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,8th grade school trip,"My sons 8th grade fieldtrip was to go to D.C. Instead it was canceled due to the COVD-19 pademic. Southwest refused to refund the tickets. This left many families wondering what to so now that they were also out of work. This company does not care about its customers, just its bottom line. The class didnt just deside to not go, the desision was made out of the safety for our kids. This is poor business practices, and if the government bails them out they will have they will have conned even more money from the government too."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good experience,Flight was on time and smooth. Staff was very helpful and friendly. The flight was not full which made it possible to spread out a bit which was appreciated.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Laughter was the Best Medicine Flight 1439 TN to IL,"In todays world where everyone is taking off for 15 days how refreshing to have a lively, funny Southwet Airline Steward by the name of Robert. He had the plane laughing from the beginning of the flight until the end. His antedots reminded me of a young George Wallace in the making. Thank you Robert for making the flight in the midst of a panademic seem close to normal. Laugher was the Best Medicine! Tan Griff"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Policy in the midst of COVID-19 does not honor customers,"Because Southwest Airlines has a horrible tech system in unable to combine confirmation numbers I am forced to loose $200. They will not allow us to cancel our reservation for future credit issued to purchaser. They are issuing a credit to a minor in the amount of $231.98 but that’s not all she has a separate voucher for $99.89. Now the trip was booked as a round trip flight and I’m not sure why it was separated in two vouchers. Except to purposely cause customers to loose money. They told us when we called to notify them of our shelter in place order from the governor of Louisiana, there would be a $100 charge per Voucher to cancel these flights and transfer credit to a general voucher. Well one ticket said less than 100 so I would owe them to cancel and transfer to my name. The other ticket would only leave 131.98 to be transferred to my name. Therefore I’d loose $200 when I paid over three for the minor’s ticket. This is ridiculous she’s ten. She will not be traveling anytime in the near future. And now I’ve spent about $331 dollars to fly Southwest but after cancelling due to Covid19 I only have a $131 voucher they gained $200 and I lost a vacation that no one is going to reimburse me for and I can’t reschedule because now kids will be in school during the summer because of the shut down. Thank you opportunist airline. Winning at the expense of others literally."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Cancellation due to deadly virus,Flight canceled due to corona virus.  I want southwest to refund my funds not an extension.  Do not fly Southwest Airlines.  As executives pocket our money they have no empathy for their customers.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,You don’t have to pay for luggage!,"Southwest Airlines is a great airline to take if you are going skiing and have boot bag, 🎿 skies,heavy coats, etc.  My complaint would be the planes are generally loaded, except on our way home (since Covid-19 had started up)!  Their employees are generally very friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,A pleasant surprise,First time flying with Southwest — I had to leave my bags behind at an airport due to the urgency of travel and cancellations at every airline (corona crisis!!) I reached out to Southwest and they were very helpful when I called about my situation. Within 1 day I was able to pick up my bags at my nearest airport with no issues! I was impressed with the friendliness of staff and high communication levels. Before this I would’ve never thought to fly with them. But now I will definitely be a returning customer!! Great prices and my two checked bags were free!!!! More personal service than the larger airlines!
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Early Bird Refunds,"I was a Delta Platinum traveler for many years when I owned my laast business. After selling it a decade ago we pretty much switched to Southwest for price & convenience. We always pay for Early Bird Check-in for each leg of our flights, $20 per. Due to a sudden diagnosis of breast cancer for my wife, I had to cancel a flight for a family visit, then only a few hours later was able to re-book after we scheduled doc appts, etc. unfortunately only to have to cancel agao w/in a day due to an unexpected surgery opening that came up on doc's schedule that we chose to take advantage of. I was under the understanding that SW applies your previous purchase $$ to subsequent bookings, actually 1 reason we use them. When CC statement arrived I found out they did NOT refund or apply the $120 Early Bird fees on any of the legs. OK, I guess, for the 2nd reservation as we never re-booked, but the 1st one was cancelled & re-booked literally w/in 3 hrs. One phone rep told me we should get our $40 credit, another in a diff department said ""no"". Turns out we had to change the flights on the 1xst reservation to what we wanted on the 2nd rather than re-book on a different itinerary as we did. Wasted $120....which will definitely come into play when making future reservations on SW for sure."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Happy to Fly Southwest,"I LUV them, it was a smooth flight even with every seat occupied.  The crew handled every one with ease and managed to find overhead space for all the carry-ons.My wife requires assistance getting to the gate and the lady who helped us was really nice and very efficient.  One thing about SW is you see all the costs upfront, no gotchas with baggage or preferred seat charges.  One year we tried a ""discount"" airline and they had a charge for everything.  Never again."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best Airline Ever,"Due to the corona virus situation, the airlines had to cancel flights out of Mexico. We had planned to fly out of Cabo San Lucas on April 7 but after receiving emails from Southwest, we accelerated our departure to March 22. We ended up on the last flight out of Cabo on Southwest, which was a direct flight to Oakland. We assumed that the plane would be full, but there were only about 80 passengers. The flight crew were very professional and distributed canned water only (no other drink service) and snacks. We love Southwest and are very thankful that they brought us home during these difficult times."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Flight was good, still don't love the check in process","Our flight boarded , pushed back and arrived on time.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was not a fully sold out flight so there were some empty middle seats in the mix.  The plane was clean, the seats were moderately comfortable (a little narrow for my taste, but not terrible) and the cabin service was friendly.  My only constructive criticism of Southwest is the ticketing/boarding process.  I am uncomfortable with the unknown of where I will be sitting so I always pay for the early bird ticket.  However, even with buying early bird months before the flight I am often left in the ""B"" group.  This is particularly frustrating as Southwest is no longer the definite best deal for travel and I really think hard between booking with them vs. a traditional airline.  I would prefer that there were either fewer groups for 'pre-boarding' OR your early bird price was based upon the group you would receive (one cost for A, a different cost for B, etc.)"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Stops vs. Airports,"We choose Southwest because they leave from an airport that is much more convenient  and user friendly than the other New York airports.  They have very few flights that are direct to another destination, But the layovers are usually brief and the luggage has never been lost.  The boarding process is not my favorite.  No reserved seating - when you check in, you get a group number (like A31).  You can pay an extra $25 to insure that you get on early and have a choice of seats (which is why they have this system).  Not something I relish.  Air travel is a hassle on any airline - going through any airport, it's a matter of picking the lesser of the evils."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Fantastic,"Although many are upset because of these trying times, I have to say while we flew Southwest Airlines from Mdw to Punta Cana flight 2692 and had a great flight. We had our grandchild with us which was his first flight and the crew could not have done enough.  While in the Dominican we started hearing so many rumors that the borders were being shut down and we were basically being abandoned.  Well Southwest answered their phones confirmed our flight back to the USA and yes we called numerous times as United abandoned everyone at our resort and many people were left scrambling for any airline to please take them back. our flight was the second to last flight back to the USA, and we had a first row seat and I cannot tell you how many people arriving on the plane Flight 517 kept on thanking Southwest for taking them home. Our family witnessed this personally and Southwest had flown many planes empty to the Dominican to bring our people home. The best part was the crew of this flight showed all of us so much attention, and treated everyone great.  One passenger had her birthday party sung to her by the whole flight and the crew gave her a bit of a funny gift and one of the crew also sang, to the passengers. By far the best flight I have ever been on. I thank the pilots for their hard work and the crew who put so many people at ease for the great time and flight.  I have and will anytime always fly with Southwest due to their great service. If I could I would give them more than 5 stars."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest has never failed me in 4 years of monthly travel,"I love flying with this airlines, they have the best prices, polite and funny flight attendants! I like how you choose your seats when you get on, that helps me not to feel stuck sitting by someone."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Trip to Tampa,"Good direct flight to and from Tampa, FLa, . Staff and crew all professional!  We didn't  have any turbulent weather. Flights were on time or early from expected arrival time. Will certainly use Southwest air again!"
n/a,50,"Friendly, great service despite ""global pandemic""","Southwest has come to be known as the No Frills Airline but with today's fearful public personality Southwest performed with calm, cool, respectful actions.  My plane was running late taking off and half full, but the flight comfortable and uneventful.  The pilot made up time, ultimately landing on time in San Francisco.   Yes, I will continue to fly Southwest,  even in these uncertain times,  when necessary."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,No reason to fly any other carrier in the continental US,"The one daily direct flight from New Orleans to San Diego is at a very convenient time and I made sure to take it.  There is a lot of flexibility with Southwest and if you are flying from or into a major hub to another major hub or city, you should have no problems finding alternative flights should you be delayed due to some reason.  I have never been treated badly with Southwest.  While many people may not like their way of boarding, if you plan correctly, you will get a good seat.  In addition, their low fares make seeing the United States more affordable.  My favorite airline to take within the 48 continental states."

Date of travel: February 2020,50,LOVE Southwest Airlines,"It was a typical Southwest flight. An airline that thinks you should get t.o take your belongings with you! Efficient and, on-time. We had no issues. We fly Southwest when we can. I booked our whole trip through Southwest Vacations and saved money. We got some extra perks, too!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"When it works, it’s great","We wanted to go to Austin for SXSW and missed out on direct flights so we ended up going through Dallas on the way down and Chicago Midway in the way back. The prices were unusually high due to demand for SXSW but we understood. Even though they cancelled SXSW we wanted to go to visit our son. The flight down was packed but we paid extra for early boarding and got the seats we wanted. Going back the flight was only 30% full and we definitely had our choice of seats. On all flights the attendants were personable and funny. They did their best to make the flights enjoyable. On the whole, I would fly them again without hesitation."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Way to go Southwest,We flew to Costa Rica in January and came back in March 2020. We loved the fact that you could have 2 checked bags at no cost plus your carry ons. We weren’t sure about the no seat assignment but we paid for the early bird seats and had no trouble getting seats together as we were in the first zone to get on the plane. The planes seemed to have more leg room then other planes and the flight attendants were amazing on all flights. I will definitely travel with them again. Good Job everyone.

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Early March flight with no problems! Southwest!,Nice flight on Southwest early March. Made it back home before things got crazier with the Covid19. No problems. Southwest always delivers!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest is the best,"On time, pleasant and often humorous crew and staff. No hassle baggage policy and best cancel/change policy if any airline in my opinion.   They were sensitive to heightened concern with Coronavirus.  Nearly all passengers were wiping down seats and trays.  Everyone was considerate of others.  Had to cancel another upcoming trip because of the virus confinement measures. But no worries since they extended their credit policy even longer during this period."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Very ruse flight attendant,"I was traveling with my girlfriend to Oakland about a week ago (03/11/2020) and we were so excited for our trip to California. As we were getting on the plane, Southwest is open seating so we were trying to find a seat together. There was a flight attendant named Gabrielle who was standing in one of the rows that had 2 seats together. We politely asked if we could sit down in those seats and her response was, ""You want to sit HERE, out of all the places?!"" She was so incredibly rude and it made my girlfriend and I feel like we were less then. I feel as though since Southwest is open seating we should be able to sit wherever we would like, especially since we wanted to sit together. The entire rest of the flight she checked on everyone around us in her section, but would skip us for some reason. We had to get the attention of a different flight attendant, who was more than attentive and showed us great customer service. We were extremely disappointed after our flight that we didn't want to take Southwest back home. If there are flight attendants like this on this airline, I will never choose to fly with them."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Airline Experience,"This was a good experience.  I was apprehensive about getting a boarding pass, etc. at the airport, but a pleasant Southwest representative offered her services, and it was very easy.

Date of travel: March 2020,10,Customer NO SERVICE & Deceitful Agents!,"Southwest Airlines SUCKS! Understanding the issues going on today, it was no surprise they changed our flights for later in May. What I didn't appreciate was them changing my wife's flight through one city and mine through another!To make matters worse, the fees I paid for early boarding was no where to be found on my new itinerary. So when I got a hold of customer NO SERVICE 25 minutes later, they claimed I was issued a credit, losing my place in line from earlier and told I could purchase again. I insisted I did not get a credit issued, and asked for someone who could fix my reservation. While the agent put me on hold she slyly issued the credit to which I immediately got another email! WTF! So I waiting 20 more minutes for what I assume was her supervisor who was even less help and admitted that the original agent submitted the credit without my consent! She said she had no way to correct her own employee's deed, so I demanded that I speak to someone who could fix this for me, and they put me on hold for almost 40 more minutes waiting for Customer Relations who claimed they could do nothing more than file a complaint to correct the agents behavior! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to make their customer whole from what THEY DID! Hey Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly!!! If this is how you run your business I hope this crisis runs Southwest into the ground, you don't deserve your customers if you have no one willing or able to correct your own employees screws ups!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest Airlines Is The Best!!!  5 Stars *****,"Southwest Airlines is # 1 !! They were so helpful in getting us back to California. There was a very short ""Q"" for phone help. Susan, a SW rep was so very kind and helpful.  She got our flight changed, checked us in, and told us our boarding placement.  Our trip home was smooth and uneventful! All the flight crew from beginning to end treated us with respect and kindness.  They carried on as if it was an ordinary day~which, of course, it is anything but!! All were pleasant, smiled and spoke kindly. All positive attitudes on Southwest Airlines.  We will always be your customers!!! Thank you!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Courteous and reliable evry time.,"You can expect the same experience each time you fly Southwest. ISP is almost always on time, the staff goes out of the way to be helpful, and the planes are clean. The wifi is regularly out of order, but I don't use it so I won't take points off for this deficiency. Perhaps more important is the ease of online purchase and changes, and of course first two bags free and the generous rewards program. Attendants could tone down the humor....it gets old pretty quick...being courteous is enough."

Who’d want to drive & look for parking down those narrow streets! Plenty of places to eat, shop, and be sure to go on a ghost tour in the evening! I felt very safe walking around, but you will see folks asking for $- now & then on the more quiet, deserted streets, esp. at night, that’s why I recommend a ghost tour for night walking; you will be with a group.   But I still always felt safe.  DO NOT MISS THE FRENCH MARKET! There’s a restaurant kiddy-corner from the market-not in the market-on the corner-I thought the breakfast prices were very reasonable. Grits were heavenly! Oh, I just HAD to have those blue suedes- from John Fluvog store-a birthday gift for me.  And maybe this fall, I will wear them out, after this is all over..."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,A Tale of Two Flights,"In the midst of a pandemic I had two experiences on one airline: Southwest. The flight crew on SW is almost always amusing and the first flight was no different. Making light of a serious situation can provide comic relief, literally.The plane was clean but just to be cautious most passengers brought their own sanitary wipes . The crew was professional, courteous, and friendly. They were responsive to passengers."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Direct Flights... NO!,"As much as I love Souhwest Airlines what ever happened to the world of direct flights. It took me 12 hours,to fly from Philadelphia to Vegas with two layovers. I can tolerate one layover but this flight was ridiculous.  A layover on Nashville then another in Demoine Iowa! It took me longer to go to Vegas than on my previous flight with them to Pureto Vallarta"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"friendly staff, run on time, one bag checked free","We left on time, we arrived 10 minutes early.  Boarding was smooth.  Flight was not crowded at all, thanks Corona!  Reasonable price despite booking last minute"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,4 stars because NO US airline earns more,"Checkin ok, needed wheelchair, long wait, finally walked, almost missed plane. Change of planes in Denver, no problems. Flight attendants on both legs were good and gave extra pretzels. LOL  We have seen the US airline industry decline in service, attitude, plane design/comfort over he last decade. Have flown international and really a difference in attitude and service."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Southwest flight 3/6/2020 from Cancun to Phoenix,"I was impressed with Southwest being so proactive before The Chinese Carona Virus had hit full force. The crew were all whitegloved. Drinks were placed on a tray and one passenger did not pass a drink to a neighbor nor did the attendant hand it to you. You took it off the tray. As I was using a lysol wipe on my seat, buckle and tray before sitting I looked across to see a lady with Clorox wipes doing the same. The attendant applauded us and said we are doing this when people depart. The crew was light hearted but definitely reminded passengers to wash their hands if using the restroom, and added the precautionary practises they were implementing. I injured my knee the last day of my trip and the wheelchair assistance was excellent. 2 bags still checked free is another reason Southwest remains to be simply the best airline out there.  Employee owned...always works well."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Reliable in this unreliable time,"We were supposed to fly from SJU to ATL through MCO but with the San Juan port closed, our ship was rerouted to Port Canaveral.  Different flight but still MCO where the counter staff was friendly and helpful to the flight crew who were every bit the same.  Between business travel plans and this personal travel plan, they have been nothing short of accommodating and helpful.  I'm definitely loyal to their brand."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"2 Bags fly free is great, animated & borderline inappropriate flight attendants = not so good","The biggest plus with flying Southwest is that you can check 2 bags for no cost.  Delta charges $30 for the 1st checked bad and $40 for the 2nd.   So I saved $140.00 Round Trip.I guess overly animated flight attendants is the ""theme"" for Southwest and it's funny at first, but it gets old and tired VERY quickly.  Most people, especially those like myself who fly for business at times, just want to get to their destination and back home with as little nonsense and drama as possible.I certainly don't want to feel like I'm in a damn comedy show when I've got a very late flight back home and I'm tired as hell.Also, the lack of amenities like watching TV or a movie for free like you can on many Delta flights kinda sucks.I really think that the pilots take joy in rough landings..or maybe it's the planes that need replacing or servicing?   Maybe they should look at replacing the planes or the damn landing gear (or maybe the rough landing is part of the comedy show?)"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Love South West but planes to Aruba need to be upgraded,We flew from Islip to Aruba through Baltimore. The seats were awful. None could recline and they were very old. The attendants were the best part of the trip.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Mexico vacation,As always we were right on time. The cabin stewards were polite and helpful. When turbulence occurred the crew kept us informed and service resumed when the ride calmed down enough to do so. A very good flight at a great price.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,BWI-MSP,There is no better airline than Southwest Airlines --- Staff wise and the onboarding with NO RESERVED SEATS is such a plus in getting on our way..
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Crowd,Staff is great. Seats are to small. All airlines need to stop cramming more seats into the planes. There is no way anyone could get out in an emergency. There is no leg room and if anyone reclines a seat they end up in  the person's face behind them. This is not only uncomfortable but unsafe and unhealthy.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Check in is so easy. I can choose my own seat. No baggage charge. No fee for changing flights.,Flight attendants from Detroit had such a great attitude and sense of humor. The plane was clean at least as best as I could see.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Amazing cabin crew ..especially Mr Kevin .,"The staff was very cordial,especially Mr Kevin who went out of his way to make passengers feel special and looked after ..Very impressed .."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,No budge on Global Crisis,"My trip with my wife got canceled due to the global pandemic.  My hotel refunded, my rented car no problem, but Southwest no help.  I called customer service and  corporate but no budge.  No refund. No extension to when I could use the “Travel Funds”.  I even wanted to possibly use it for a cheaper trip with my wife and two girls but the remaining balance of the travel fund to transfer to my girls tickets.  I don’t fly much but when I do I usually would fly Southwest.  That has now changed."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,I didnt Even fly with them ever,"First off we are currently in a state of panic , and there isn’t any way to get my money back from a purchase before all this stuff went down and now they are telling me it’s non refundable????? I’ll never travel with you guys no points at all and no sympathy in regards to what’s going on ! I NEED MY MONEY SOUTHWEST YOU guys are terrible and customer Service is ridiculous"
n/a,50,Great Flight,We flew from Omaha to Phoenix. We were greeted by friendly counter help upon arrival. The checkin process was fast. Security line was no wait. We boarded on time and arrived on time. Flight attendants were great.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,BEST AIRLINE,"Great airline.  Large planes where you choose your seat (comfortable seats), if you have to cancel plans they give you a credit for up to a year, you get free snacks and soda or water, and you get 2 free checked bags.  They are amazing!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Southwest Airlines in the face of a crisis,"As we all know things have become a lot more difficult these past few weeks. We are living in a global crisis. But. Southwest Airlines could care less so long as they get paid. Trying to cancel a flight that was booked before everything shut down. Before the threat of disease. And I’m told I can’t get my money back? This isn’t a regular circumstance. We are dealing with a global pandemic. But again. Nobody matters more than the almighty dollar. Nothing matters more than keeping those pockets lined does it? And people wonder why nobody has any faith in American consumerism. This is why. Because the only thing that matters is money. I will never do business with your institution again. Nor will anyone I know. That I can guarantee. At the end of the day, you guys can keep your measly $500. Add that to the money you’ll get when you receive your bailout money from the government. You know, the money you “need” because, wait for it, we’re facing a global crisis. Imagine that. Quick to receive something because of extenuating circumstances but just as quick to hold fast to their “policy” when they have to do their part. Ah yes. Corporate America has never been brighter. Two words. Never. Again."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,DISAPPOINTMENT,I have always liked the way Southwest handles themselves when facing a challenge before today.  Today I called client relations due to a conference being rescheduled with the coronavirus. All I asked was to have my early bird as a credit so when I rebook I do not get hit with the fee again and I was told there is nothing they can do.  I will be reconsidering ever flying with them again. I can appreciate canceling do to your own personal reasons but this is outside of my control and I just want to be able to use my hard earned money towards my future flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Sacramento -San Diego,"South West Air lines always hs out standing Fight service their staff is always polite,Courteous,and always make you laugh,their airline is the only airline in the world that is always on time if not early to their destination."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Easy Direct Flight,Hobby is closer to us and convenient to access; flight-attendant was entusiastic and made it feel as the flight was even shorter than a little over 2 hours.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Full Flight but Great Service,"I had originally booked a flight on Southwest for a trip to Fort Lauderdale that was canceled due to changes in our plan. Southwest has one of the best change policies in the airline industry and I was able to use the credit for the trip on a future flight booked within 9 months of the originally purchased flight.My wife and I booked a trip to San Francisco to visit Napa this March using the original credits. The booking process was fast and easy and I was able to complete everything on-line. There was roughly an $80 per passenger additional charge for the new flights but my credits carried over so I only paid the difference.  We fly Delta most of the time and love how Delta does business. It has been several years since I last flew Southwest. I absolutely hate the Southwest seating and boarding policy but it is what it is and I chose the pay the A-List priority boarding for this flight. Paying the extra did make the boarding process a bit easier and helped ensure overhead bin space. But, with the cost of the flight, the priority boarding passes our flight came out roughly $187 more per person than a direct flight to SFO on Delta would have cost. The plane was not clean, areas around the window were dirty and it was apparent this area is not cleaned. There was trash in the seatback pocket left by a previous traveler. I understand Southwest does quick turnarounds but we had the first flight of the day departing at 5:50 AM EST. The steward staff did a good job on a long flight. They made several rounds with drinks and snacks during the flight. Our take-off and landing were smooth and flawless. Our flight was on time and although there was turbulence the flight crew did a great job.Personally, we will continue to fly Delta for most if not all of our travel going forward."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Southwest flights,"Flights to & From San Diego were as expected. Service fine, even one flight had mechanical delay but everything was fine. Unhappy about having to pay for extra 2 lbs on luggage, but it is well advertised and waas still probably less overall  than another airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,LUV Southwest !!,"Love Southwest. No cost for change of flights. No charge for your first 2 bags--and up to 50 pounds each. 2 carry-ons allowed. Some people may say that their fares have creeped up over the years, and this may be true--because they include the aforementioned features. However, you board fast, get off fast, and the crew is always hysterical and wonderful. My one complaint is early bird. You pay $25.00 per person for early boarding -- and we choose this option. Some people abuse the system and buy one early bird for a family of 3-4 people. Then, the one person boards and holds multiple seats for the family that is coming on later. SW needs to figure out a way to stop these greedy people from being allowed to hold seats. Other than that-- great airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good Flight to Florida and back home to Indiana,Flight was good both ways! The shortbread cookies are great!! Only complaint is the seat space. Just a bit crowded for tall people!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Efficient use of time,Flight arrived early and we turned around and left early arriving early at our final destination. All while being positive and engaged.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Non stop to Aruba,Nice that the flight was non stop.  Unfortunately we took off 90 min late.   Still worth going nonstop.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flights Home,"Efficient and on-time.  They were very aware of health risks, and continuously collected trash.  Passenger load levels were down so plenty of room to stretch out and maintain some distance."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very nice!,"The advent of the coronovirus brought a very clean and sanitary airplane.  I brought sanitizing wipes and wiped down my area, however I did not have any dirt on my sanitizing wipes."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Cancellation policies,Booked a golf trip January 2020 for a May trip.  Canceled due to Coronavirus. They now tell me The 12 month credit is from when I booked.  So I only have till January of 2021.  Most likely no trips will be safe this year and no extension due to this virus.  But the airlines want us tax payers to help them out ?   How about you adjust your policy for us?Not very happy about this service
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Normally I reallylove Southwest Airlines, but...","I really really love the airline, but when I flew with them, and used their wheelchair services I was shocked in this time of virus emergency that their wheelchair people had NO gloves and were provided NO sanitizer. They are out working  without any protection, handling thousands of passengers, their belongings, their clothes, their person, and have no help to keep them from carrying home to their families some deadly virus, and passing it along in the process to other passengers. I tried to call both the line, and the airport, the mayor, and the governor - no one would accept responsibility for a policy, nor is there any way for a regular person to reach someone who could make a policy change. Phooey on them! Disgusting to treat people that way."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Galveston, Texas","Wonderful, I like to fly Southwest.    Went to Galveston Texas, hopped onto Carnival Cruise Dream to fulfill a 7 wonder of the world - Chichen Itza.   It was wonderful!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Super friendly and pleasant flight,"I had to fly to Atlanta in a hurry to help my daughter move from her dorm room. The flight and desk staff were super nice and friendly. From the moment I got on board, I was welcomed like it was my home. The staff was smiling and laughing and joking with the guests as they got on the plane. This trip was a very nice experience."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Recent trip on Southwest,Made a trip to Portland from Ontario this past week.  Decided to come back a day early and was able to change my flight in 5 minutes using Southwest's website.  Their policy of no change fees is fantastic and we actually saved money on the booking change which they deposited in our account.  Also like the no charge for bags policy.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Rudeness,Some old white guy was a flight attendant and he was very rude.It took an hour to get a drink of anything.Our flight was not economy it was business select.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent airline,Friendly service in person and online with employees always willing to do what they can to make all aspects of the flight enjoyable. The boarding process is most efficient and is the only airline I know that still allows two free checked bags.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Poor customer relations service in regards to the state of emergency experience-covid19,"Our recent trip was cancelled due to the state of emergency and the level 4 advisory rules by the government during the covid-19 virus in March of 2020. I called to speak to Southwest regarding our flights because they had to be cancelled because of the closure of borders, travel restrictions  and everything covid-19 related. Southwest offered me a credit which we were fine with until they told us we had to use it in a certain time frame which was within 10 months. (completed travel) My family and I travel on march break which means they would expire and I would lose out on 2100$ Canadian. The lady said if they allowed us to extend our travel time on these tickets come January  and I would not know until January 2021 when they were due for expiration then I would have to pay 400 dollars us funds to extend them.  This is not ok and considering the travel restrictions and the safety of everyone including my family, I should not have to pay a cent to extend them or wait until January to know if they will allow the extension at all. I find this very poor customer service on southwest's part considering the government ordered no travel unless its essential and we could not travel for the safety of us and everyone else. This was not our decision.....!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,excellent service and always on-time!,Check-in as soon as recommended and take advantage of 2 bags checked free per-person.  Really ejoy the snacks and listed of free beverages. Super friendly staff.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Will not extend flight credit,"Southwest is basically PROMOTING travel when  everyone else is advising against it due to the Coronavirus situation! I called in to cancel our flight to the Dominican Republic for March 21st & all i asked was for a credit (not a refund) b/c we plan on re-booking our trip as soon as we can travel. They told us that the travel funds we used to book would still expire on March 30th and there was NOTHING they could that they would still expire. They said I could call after they have expired and see if they would extend  the expiration date but there would be $400 fee  and they would only extend for 6 months. This is ridiculous! They said ""We are still flying, so we  are holding up our end of the bargain. I'm sorry  that you are choosing not to travel"" direct  quote! All i am asking for is for my travel funds  expiration date to be extended for another 6  months. I am not even asking for refund of ANY of  the money, just the opportunity to rebook when i  can travel again !"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Orlando is a horrible airport to fly out of,"The rude and cold attitude that permeates TSA and other services at Orlando  international airport finally affected the ticket agents at Southwest.  This has been my only negative contact I have ever had with a Southwest employee,  perhaps she was a former TSA agent!   She was very rude, impersonal and unresponsive when asked a question.   The gate agents and air crew were great and exemplified what I have come to expect from SWA."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent,"When I travel I always look to Southwest before any other airline.  Easy to check in, no hassle seating or paying extra to sit next to the person you are travelling with.  Grat concept and bags fly free!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Love this airline!,Flying at this time is for the faint of heart. The staff was great and the flight great. I love flying SW.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Terrible customer service at this time of coronavirus,"So let me tell you what our experience was like travelling today from MSP to BNA.  My family of six went to check our bags.  We had two bags overweight by only 5 pounds.  We had room in the other bags, but when we packed we attempted to put most of the weight in my husband and my bag since we are traveling with two autistic children and wanted to make it easier on them from a sensory prospective.  They told us that we would have to shift stuff to the other bags.  The only place to do this was on the dirty floor.  Meanwhile, they were talking about having no more cleaning supplies (Lysol wipes) so if the counters around them weren’t clean, I really didn’t want to sit on the dirty floor.  We asked to speak to a manager.  There were 3 employees standing around.  One went to get a manager. The employee came back out and said they were in a meeting and would be out when done.  Meanwhile one of my autistic children started having a meltdown from waiting.  I asked the employee if she could try to ask them to hurry given our circumstances and her response was that “their employees have stuff to do too.”  The manager finally came out and said there’s nothing he could do.  If we could get the weight down to 52 lbs, he’d be fine with it.  I explained that still required us to get on the floor.  He had no solution.  Meanwhile, my husband was trying to talk to employee to explain about my sons autism and she put her hand to our faces and said “we all have things going on.”  Since I wasn’t going to put my family at risk and didn’t want my son to continue to have to wait we paid $150 for the luggage.  It makes me so sad that they had total disregard for our situation and I don’t plan on flying with them again without some sort of apology and reimbursement.  I have the managers name should someone at Southwest care enough to contact me."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Wonderful Crew,Huge shout out to the crew on flight 784 today (Detroit to Nashville) and especially JP. We fly Southwest quite often and this was definitely the best group of flight attendants we’ve ever had.  Thank You! These guys are the reason we always try to fly Southwest!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Top notch travel experience,The personnel at DCA and Dallas Love Field were top notch.  The flight and flight staff were excellent.  This was my wife’s first experience with Southwest and she was hooked.
n/a,50,The Reason that we use Southwest,"Booked a ticket for my granddaughter from Lubbock TX to New Orleans for spring break.  Changed the dates on the ticket with no charge on their website.  Made another change to fly from Dallas TX and received a refund on the price.  Made another change to fly to Dallas and not Lubbock, with another refund.  There is not another airline in the world that would allow you to make those changes with no charge, much less give you 2 refunds on the cost of the ticket.  Think about that the next time you pay for your bags."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest ALWAYS Rocks,Haven’t flown in awhile. TheSW terminal at LAX is awesome.  Glad to see SW staff and crew still have the best attitudes around.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Easy Breezy,"Non stop flight that made a perfect trip over to Jamaica. The flight attendants told us up front not to purchase wifi because once we got over the ocean it wouldn't work. Other than that, no worries and quick and easy flight into Montego Bay."
n/a,50,Great service!,I love flying Southwest. They allow 2 free checked bags and offer great pricing. The employees are always very friendly and willing to help. My last flight had a US Marine flying with his service dog. They made sure he boarded first and was settled before bringing the wheelchair passengers into the flight. The flight had many empty seats so the flight attendants encouraged passengers to spread out . The entire experience was excellent.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,A Change in Attitude?,"After an initial 30 minute delay,  my flight from NYC to Chicago was in taxi mode for TWO hours due to a mechanical issue. That meant no one could use the restrooms.  Upon arrival in Chicago, it was apparent that I had just missed my connection to Phoenix. I was sent from one nonchalant employee to another. Finally at an ADDITIONAL cost of $50 I could regain my A boarding pass. Southwest used to have an attitude of caring and courtesy with a touch of humor. Is that changing?"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A Really Great Airline,A really great airline to fly withfriendly polite staff2 FREE BAGSsoft drinks and snacks were goodclean comfy seats
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest continues to be our 1st choice out of Chicago,"Round trip flight( 3-3-20; return, 3-12) went smoothly both ways. Arrived early both ways, luggage handled well (and no charge , of course). Flight crew efficient and friendly, as usual. What more can you ask for?"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Spokane to San Jose and Back... Direct.,"American Airlines has always been my first choice, mainly because I used to travel abroad regularly, and have built up some ""status"" with them.But when I learned, that I could go from my front door, in Spokane, to the office door of my newest employer, in Sunnyvale, in less that three hours of total travel time, I had to try it.I wasn't disappointed.The limiting factors? TSA (Yes. I do have TSA Pre-Check.), Bay Area traffic, and the flights are a little late in the day.But, yes. I will definitely be doing this again."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Easy flight,Everything went smoothly from entering the airport to getting off the plane.  This includes dropping off my bag that liquid in a glass container.  Received my bag back with my glass container in one piece.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent Service,"Had a very good experience when taking a trip home from Orlando recently.  First, I followed Southwest's policy of reserving space in line by contacting Southwest 24 hours before the flight.  I went online and hit the reserve button right at the 24 hour mark, and ended up with a waiting-space close to ""first in line"" at the airport.  I used the barcode on my phone to check-in and proceeded to my chosen seat.  Very easy.  Seats were comfortable and attendants courteous.  House drinks (coffee, tea, sodas) are free on the airline, as is free Wi Fi...movies, TV, etc.  You do have to download their app before flying, though.  I like these little bonuses you get on Southwest.  Flight was comfortable and prompt, no delays.  Plenty of communications from the pilot during the flight."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Still a better deal than the Legacy carriers,"Southwest airlines is still a better deal than United, American, or Delta.  They introduced basic economy fares to compete with Southwest prices, but Southwest still lets you check a bag, and their pick your own seat means sitting together is much easier than basic economy.  Frankly, lining up to board is more orderly than the other airlines anyway.  I feel like the seats are a little bigger.  There aren't screens, so you have to entertain yourself.  I still miss Airtran though."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Always great,"Our flight was a small flight. It was probably the beginning of the panic going on right now. They made sure everyone was comfortable. We were seated quickly, left quickly and arrived on time. Great flight!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Southwest is stealing from it’s customers,Do not fly Southwest! In the middle if a National crisis Southwest is unwilling to be flexible with their cancellation policy. I have $2400 in tickets to Washington state where it has been advised not to travel and the government canceled the event I was supposed to go to. Southwest will not refund my money or even extend the voucher date so that I can use it when the event is rescheduled. Other Airlines are being accommodating and helpful Southwest is not. Do not fly with them or risk loosing your money too.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Disappointed and mad!,"Wish i could give zero stars! Due to the pandemic, my husband and I had to cancel our vacation to Disney World. Disney closed its doors before we decided to cancel our flights. I canceled, naively believing Southwest would be accommodating in extending our Travel Funds expiration date, and to my surprise, they did not. They have been anything but accommodating during this crisis. They are outright refusing to make any exceptions to their policies, even with this very unique situation happening globally. If they don’t open their eyes, I can promise that I will never fly with Southwest again. I’d rather give my money to another airline who respects customers than to one who is so greedy and selfish, they can’t accommodate during an especially hard time. Never again Southwest."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Service,I have been flying Southwest for years and will continue to. The staff are very nice and friendly. My new luggage was damaged when I arrived in Rochester. I had no issues getting a voucher for the damage.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Still a Cattle Car,"Southwest has always been a ""Cattle Car"" experience when flying.  In the past, the lack of assigned seating was offset by the low airfare.  Over the years the prices have gone up markedly and the overall service has not kept pace.  Fortunately they offer a multitude of scheduled flights that will accommodate most itineraries.Nothing special but they will generally get you where you are going on time."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Customer of size,My hubby and I only fly southwest. My hubby is a big guy at 6'5 and we alway buy an extra ticket and once our trip is complete we are able to apply for a refund when the flight isn't overbooked. We get to pre- board so we get on the plane first.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Cancelling a flight,I just want to say thank you!!!!! It was so easy to cancel my flight in the midst of all the coronavirus craziness.  I can not thank you enough!  One bright spot in my day.  I will definitely book through you again.  Take care!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great flight to BWI,Had a very early flight to Baltimore from the Denver airport. All of my interactions with the Southwest personnel were the very best. Very friend and professional. Flights were on time and the onboard experience very good. Definitely recommend Southwest!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Satisfactory,We always fly Southwest if we can.  In 10 years never really had any major issues.  The only thing I think would be better is if I could pick my seat ahead of time.    I do like the fact that bags fly free.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Best Airline to Hawaii,"Southwest Airlines was wonderful to fly. Their ground personnel, flight attendants and service were all outstanding. The planes were sparkling and comfortable. We took the trip in May, 2019, We were so pleased with them we just returned from Kona, in February, 2020 on them."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flying Southwest Airlines,SW has always impressed me with their service. When we got on the plane it definitely smelled and looked very clean. Obviously they were on the ball cleaning with the Carona thingy.  Our 11:30 flight was canceled so we had to fly at2:30.  We figure they had too few for the flight or they had it out for cleaning. They did refund our early bird boarding
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best Airline,"Southwest is my favorite airline and Love Field is my favorite airport!  Southwest Airlines offers great prices, no charge for changing flights or for checking luggage. We are always treated with courtesy."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Florida vacation,"We flew from Pittsburgh, PA on February 22, 2020 and returned from Fort Myers, FL on March 14, 2020.Our flights both ways (#3432 and #5496) were excellent as always.  We fly SW about 1 or 2 times per year.  I have never had a bad experience!  From the baggage check in to the baggage pick up, the employees of SW are always very helpful.  I will continue flying SW."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Affordable friendly travel,"We did a round trip to Puerto Rico from Baltimore, Md. With our two babies 3 & 4 we where cautios do to the Corona virus, but it seems that SW desinfected the morning flight since it could be smelled, we also wiped down everything.  The staff was very friendly and the boarding procedures having children's was very convenient."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Smooth flight - Great pilots,"This flight was so smooth flying across country. The weather was  bad across the nation, snowing when we landed. Great pilots.I fly a lot, I was impressed"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,My favorite,"What I love about Southwest is, of course, no cost for bags. You get the flat price for your ticket without other additional gimmicks so common with many other airlines. The service is professional, sometimes even entertaining. I wish I could fly to more places by my favorite Southwest."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,We pay for a basic flight experience and we get a basic flight.,"Southwest is nice..no charge for checked bag, enough overhead space. I am under 6' tall so legroom was OK for me.  The Crew was OK;   Very much a standard, non-frills, flight.  What would I add? Free beer? Free meals? Free Magazines? Sorry, but no one gives these items in coach.   Our SouthWest Flight attendant suggested that he flies Delta when he wants a premier experience."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,First trip to Tampa -St Pete,Southwest is my go to airline. Almost exclusive. Due to the virus the flight was slightly lighter than usual. I changed my return flight and was given a credit of several hundred dollars. I will be using the credit soon.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Safe trip,"We boarded fine, had a seat from being B-2,3.  We ere delayed at the runway for about 10 min.  The take of was good and a few turbulence because it was raining.  Arrived in San Jose a few minutes late but good flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,On time,Although there was inclement weather we took off on time. We also landed safely which is always a positive for me
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,We used Southwest Airlines this February all the flight were on time and using the early bird was great got the 1 st row 3 out of 4 flights and we were back as far as a 32-33 and got the first row .all great flights
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Nearly perfect, except ...","Traveled on 24 Feb 2020.  Boarding experience was positive.  They allowed early boarding for special needs.  Service was very good.  Flight landed earlier than schedule.  Only problem was as we got ready to get out of the cabin, a fire was identified in a seat in the back.  The doors of the plane were still closed and seems that the attendants, because they could not see smoke from the front of the plane were questioning the call.  It was apparently a device battery that caught fire.  Someone from the pilot's compartment came out to assess the situation and instruct the attendants to open the door and get people out expeditiously.  I was in the very front so never smell the smoke or saw flames.  I wanted to get out of the plane ASAP.  I can't tell what happen with the rest of the passengers since we were asked to just keep moving fast into the terminal."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Great Flight both ways,"Round trip flight from Denver to Pheonix.  Left Denver at 1340 on Sunday, quick flight, rented car for week at airport, drove to Scottsdale (35 min ). Had great week at Scottsdale Plaza Resort, then back to Denver on flight leaving at 1320.  Another uneventful flight to Denver.  All in all great Southwest service both ways.  Love this airline."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,The friendly skies to Houston,You can never go wrong with Southwest. They are so good at wading any travel anxieties with humor! I almost missed my flight and the gate agents assured me that if I could make it through security and “run like the wind” I would make it. They must have called ahead to let them know I was coming because as I arrived at the jet way they opened the doors with an expectant smile and welcomed me aboard!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,They changed my flight!!,"I love Southwest and use this airline whenever possible.  When I originally booked this flight I booked a flight one layover and it was scheduled to take 7 hours.  The day before when we went to check-in we realized it had been changed to 2 stops and a 9-hour journey.  Saying that however and in light of the health emergency going on in the country the staff was fantastic, and everything went smoothly.  The flights were not full and they encouraged us to spread out on the flight. thumbs up to Southwest during stressfull times."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Excellent services, not too crowded","I flew to Cancun from Ft Lauderdale Feb. 26, before the recent corona virus troubles began, so I assume my flight was more typical than such flights may be now in mid-March. The 2 pm flight was about 3/4 full, so very comfortable. (The flight back on March 11 was about half full.) It was on time. We had plenty of time to rent a car and get to our hotel 13 miles south of Cancun before sunset. Well done."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest Customer oriented,"Southwest gives the ""best"" customer service.  Other airlines should get their training.Very helpful in getting passengers on board and seated quickly."
n/a,30,No customer service help,"Let me say that I was late getting to the airport for a 12pm flight but you can get thru Memphis security in literally 3-5 mins. We arrived at the airport about 20 mins before the flight left.The customer service agent wouldn't even call to see if we could still board the flight. They just reschedule us for an connecting flight an hour later (we were on a non-stop). This added 3 hours to your travel time.We get thru security and to the gate, the flight is still there and the door isn't closed AND they are still calling for people to board. We try to get your flight switched back and they would not do it!! We didn't care about the luggage being on a different flight.It literally would have taken just a call on the radio to get us on the plane. To me that is poor customer service!While I was truly pissed off about this flight, my flight going to Memphis was great!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest consistent,"Southwest is terrific..no charge for checked bag,can change flights wo a fee. Friendly crew. Very much enjoyed."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Business as usual,I am a frequent flyer on this route . Its pretty quick and painless. The crew in PVD is always so helpful cheerful ...
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Plenty of knee room,"I like the B737-800 aircraft.  The magazines and brochures are in a slot above the tray table.  This leaves the seat pocket for my things.  I had a good 2-3 inch gap between my knees and the seat in front (I'm 5'10"")  The flight was on time."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Fly on Tuesday,"We have been booking our flights and purchasing the early bird option because it takes the stress out of the no assigned seats. It’s worth it to us. But we flew on a Tues, with 2 legs of the trip, and the plane was only half full. We were able to spread out ... on both legs FLL to HOU and HOU to CMH. Don’t know if that’s normal for a Tuesday but it was AWESOME!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest Denver to OKC,As always Southwest provides great service with free bags and easy check-in online.  I was able to get a comfy exit row seat to stretch out my legs and the flight went by so quick I didn't realize we even left.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Comfortable, caring employees and on-time!","Southwest does a great job of departure activities, boarding, taking care of passengers during the flight and being on-time! The flight crew predicted a 3 hr, 58 minute flight and they landed exactly on-time!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Comfortable and quick,"Love the fact that I can get non-stop flights to Milwaukee with Southwest from several locations. This flight took off on time thanks to the quick and easy way boarding is done on Southwest flights (and arrived ahead of schedule). You take your assigned place in line prior to boarding, and then pick any available seat once you're on the plane.I also find their seats seem to be a bit wider, with enough leg room for a 6'1"" person, than other airlines. Not to mention you can check 2 bags at no extra charge. Even if you only check one bag, their ticket prices become cheaper than other airlines' most of the time.The flight attendants are often quite funny while going over the safety features of the plane, which puts you at ease.I always try to fly Southwest, if possible."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,On time.  Very clean.  Updates constantly with precautions they are taking.,02/08/2020 - Flight from ABQ to HOU (SW 3605) connecting to SW 0870 HOU to SFD.  On time.  No special screening.  Arrival in Los Caboseasy however they would not accept the customs paper work that we always prepare on the forms provided on line previous to our flight.  Will need to do it on flight in future.  Return :  02/15/2020 Flight 0861 SJD to Houston.  we were treated as criminals with contraband at customs as we had a ham sandwich with tomato.  Taken to a secure room with many other unsuspecting travelers & not permitted to get our luggage until they brought it to.  Good that we had a 2 hour layover before SW 2583 HOU to ABQ because it took us an hour to clear customs.  Warning:  don't bring any animal by products or tomatoes into US from Mexico.  We should have known this but what was so surprising was the rough gtreratment we received.  This was not the fault of Southwest.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Trip to LA,Good flight. On time and reasonable boarding process. Not sure I like to hunt for open seats on Southwest. Overall good.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Nice flight Fl to Ok,"Flight was on time, check in easy, employees friendly. I’ll take this flight again. I like Love Field as it is a small airport. Many nice eateries there."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Tampa airport,"Beautiful, but poorly marked. Trying to get from Enterprise Car Rental to passenger pickup took an hour longer than it should have. The 2 year employed Enterprise rep gave us bad directions.. twice! The hotel rep had never been to the airport, but tried to direct us anyway. Dead end! We didn't even know there was a train. More signage and information personnel , like DIA, would help!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Extra Special Serevice,"I have a health issue and use a folding mobility scooter to get through the airport. This scooter gets me right to the door of the plane folds up and is taken to the hold of the plane.  From check-in at the counter to boarding, the staff went over and above to make sure I was taken care of, on and off the plane.  Southwest, Thank You."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,First time flying with kids,This was my first time flying with my kids and my second time flying as an adult.  PHL was a nice airport.  It was not busy.  THere were no lines for security and we went through very quickly.  THe flight was good.  A little bumpy coming down but not bad.  The kids enjoyed it.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Direct flight is the way to go,"We are a family of 4, with kids ages 7 and 5. We took a direct flight on Southwest from Albany NY to Orlando FL in February. Direct flights are the way to go. No layover no delays no cranky kids!! I love that they give preference to families. It made it much easier to find seats together. It’s a 2.5hr drive for me to get to that airport but I would rather drive that distance to fly direct than use a closer airport that doesn’t have Southwest!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Fort Lauderdale & Back,Round trip to Florida and Back. Departing February 21st and Returning March 1st. No Peanuts but pretzels and rits minis. Stewards and Stewardesses were great.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best Airline,Still the best airline out there. Our flight departed exactly on time and arrived to destination precisely as projected.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest trip from Mdw to Den—— empty!,"Flight left 2 minutes early and arrived 14 minutes early at destination.  Because of the coronavirus panic, our plane held 175 people and there were 73 people on the plane!  SW asked us to balance the plane by sitting 25 in front, middle and back.  Spread out were the words!  We had a row to ourselves, no in flight issues, smooth flight,   SW is the best and all that I fly....."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Business Forum,I had forgotten how easy it is to fly on Southwest. The meeting I was attending was changed a couple times to different dates due to changing business schedules. There were no change fees or price changes for these last minute date changes! No $100 change fees common on other carriers. Just positive friendly service.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Southwest hospitality,"We have flown many times on Southwest.  We find it is a different boarding sequence, but if you check in online as soon as it becomes available (within 24 hrs) of your flight you get to be in the first third of boarding passengers.  it is very quick and efficient way of boarding, you get to pick where you want to sit and the leg room isn't bad in normal sitting areas.  If you need the extra room, you always have the option of paying the extra to get early boarding.  We always find it entertaining when you get a flying steward or stewardess that does the safety information with humour and makes the flight enjoyable.  We like Southwest, not everybody does.  If you need to know what your seat is etc. than pay the extra so you get first pick.  Other than that we think they are great!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Non-stop comfort,"Had my arm in a sling from shoulder surgery, so I was allowed to pre-board.This was very accommodating, and allowed me to pick a seat for my 4 hour flight.THANK YOU SOUTHWEST!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Still the Best Airline,"Like all airlines, Southwest has been significantly affected by the virus pandemic. But cruise and staff at Southwest airlines have been very professional, and accommodating, as 20 to 30% of people flying today are carrying disinfectant wipes. The staff comes on during the pre-board and tells everyone that they will collect the wipes before takeoff and that they appreciate everyone being sanitary. Flights have been less than full which is kind of a break for us serious travelers who are on that plane every week, but the on-time delivery and the experience of the pilots is extraordinary. I'm hoping we all get to go back to business as usual in a very short few weeks. But my hat's off to Southwest airlines!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Quiet,I am a small person and my seat was uncomfortable. I may have sat in a hole who knows but my hips hurt half way thru the flight.  Only one baggy of snacks the fewest ever offered.  However the flight was so quiet it was awesome.  No one barely even talking in fact. Loved that.  Stewardess were pleasant.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Like old comfortable shies,"In my eyes there is no other airline, never a hassle never a problem. Add in no added charges why fly anyone else."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,COVID-19 Attempt to Receive Refund,"Worst airline ever. Considering every other airline is refunding flights because of the COVID-19, you would think SouthWest would too. But NOPE, they are giving you future credit to use before the date you PURCHASED the tickets. Oh, and if you bought early bird? Sh*t out of luck, you are beat out of money. I will NEVER fly this airline again after this experience. Don't waste your money or time. You will be sitting on hold for over an hour to speak to a representative who so clearly wants nothing to do with the conversation."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,March home,"I love Southwest Airlines, they are reasonably priced, If you book early the savings are substantial.  I know there is not a lot of time between flights but it would be nice if they could wipe down the surfaces between flights.  They are always on time, well run company."
Date of travel: April 2019,10,South west doesn't care about Coronavirus,"We have been loyal to sowhthwest for years. In general have had good travel experiences, but have had southwest cancel flights on us while at the airport with no notice.  And no compensation.  But we can't  belive the experience we just had. We had a trip booked with my work to punta cana.  With the corona virus issues my company canceld the trip.  Southwest will not refund anything.  They gave a BS credit but I have to travel with in 9 months. Why only 9 months, because we booked early and were loyal to southwest.  This is not a trip I chose or would have chosen to cancel. I can not get vacation to book another trip before next April, so essentially I am out $900.  Andrew a customer service manager said a national emergency declared by the president did not warrant a refund.  I asked him if 911 would have warranted a refund.  He said he wasn't with the company at the time, but 911 would not warrant a refund.  Unbelievable.   Southwest has gone downhill since there founder passed away.  If I could give them a negative rating I would.  In this case I give them a 1 because that's the lowest rating I can give."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,No Issues,"We took off on time and arrived early both on our way to NOLA and our way back.  Seating was too bad, better leg room than some airlines.  I hate not having assigned seats but when you get a fare as low as we did I am not going to complain."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Safe Flight,"Despite some turbulance early on, flight was non-eventful.  But, upon landing and receiving luggage, majority of the luggage for all was very wet.   Seems like it was all left out int he rain in Vegas--not good."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Not willing to refund fares for flight cancellations related to COVID19,"Recently had to cancel a business trip because of COVID19.  The University of Colorado has restricted all travel due to COVID19, including my trip.  I am a physician and frequent traveler and all other hotels/airlines have refunded fees due to COVID19 related travel restrictions.  Southwest is alone in not doing so and should be ashamed of themselves."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Pleasant FLIGHT !!,"Crew was truly really FRIENDLY, COURTEOUS and ATTENTIVE to all of our request the all time.  Could not have had a BETTER experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nashville- aka Bakersfield East,"I love Southwest for several reasons; they care for their employees, they don't charge for baggage, the no frills-no charge approach saves me money.  I do however feel that they have compromised some comfort for economy.4-5 hours is a long time to sit in such tight conditions. The returning flight, although only slightly more roomy seating was significantly different (better). Nashville airport was great!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Great airline /w direct flights, on-time service and happy employees",Great airline with on-time service and happy employees.  Love their comfortable seats and direct flights.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Wonderful flight and Airline!,"Took off on time both ways and had no issues!  We booked ahead and got the ""Want to getaway Fares"".  They make everything seem so easy and effortless, maybe other airlines can learn from them."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Cancellation Policy!,"Thank you for caring about the wellbeing of your customers and having a flexible cancellation process when NOONE else does, especially in an unprecedented time during a PANDEMIC! Will always be a customer!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Lost $250.00 due to them  not welling to apply our credit to our new flight date,I called south west on 3/12/2020 due to Walt Disney closing its parks and us not able to go there.   The south west agent was rude and not welling to help us use our $250.00 hard earned money credit with them to apply to the new date for the trip due to the out break.  They will not help or make exceptions due to there May deadline for the credit.   THANKS FOR SCREWING US OUT OF $250 OF OUR HARD EARNED MONEY!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great flight,We always fly Southwest. It just seems more comfortable for us and also by the time I pay for my luggage on other airlines it costs about the same.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Comfortable flight without breaking the bank!,"The ticket price was quite reasonable and we certainly got what we paid for.Movies and TV available for free and internet at a minimal cost.  The flight was nothing fancy.  Free beverages and snacks (pretzels, corn chips or cookies),alcoholic beverage available at a charge.Paid the extra 25.00 for preferred seating and it worked out great.  24 hrs. out you can get your boarding pass, but don't wait.  First come, first served!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Friendly, on-time service like always",SWA loaded and left on time; the flight crew were friendly and helpful as always.  Certainly our preferred airline.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nashville Tennessee,I loved that the flight was on time and that I didn’t have to pay extra for my luggage. Also I had plenty of room for my feet
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Good service plus no baggage fees,"Overall, I like Southwest.  The bonus is with my golf clubs for this annual trip, there is no charge for baggage.  Checking in 24 hours in advance for your seating priority was exciting, and you could typically get a decent seat if you did it timely.My issue is that they allow people to “save” a seat for others.  I now pay extra for early bird checkin to get a decent seat.  I heard in the terminal that some people are saving multiple seats, or paying for early bird checkin for one person, and not for their partners, but reserving seats for them anyway.  The attendants do not get involved."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,A Nice Flight,"I don't usually fly Southwest because they are often more expensive than other major airlines wherever it seems I'm traveling.  This time there was a very affordable flight to Denver so I took it.  I love the leather seats and the free checked bags.  The flight crews on Southwest are always pleasant and often fun.  The terminals at both LAX and Denver are newer with plenty of food options, places to plugin, and seating.  I usually pay the extra $20 bucks to load in Group A, before most others.  I'm amazed that more people don't do this."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Typical SW experience, which is to say pretty good, no real complaint","SW is my go to - free bags.  I'm actually fine with the cattle call seating, and although I made A list, I was fine before.  Generally I check a bag, so no worry about deplaning first (we all wait at the carousel) and I prefer sitting in the back generally anyway.  On this specific flight it took a little longer than usual for bags to drop, and the flight was listed as slightly delayed - but actually was not."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Usually great. Issues this trip,"When we arrived at the airport to fly home Thursday, the ticket agent told us our flight was cancelled and rescheduled for 3 days later.   She was so very unhelpful!  After calling her supervisor she said she would book us on the Friday flight, but we would lose our early bird check in.   (She never did ).  There’s nothing more unnerving than being stranded in a foreign country.  We asked her about accommodations and her only reply was “ it’s a weather issue so that’s not covered “. A better response would have been ‘there’s a Hyatt next door ‘ .  Fortunately the ticket agent we encountered on Friday (Sharlene) was incredibly helpful and truly represented the Southwest Airlines favorably. We fly exclusively Southwest 2 or 3 times a year. Our faith was shaken, but renewed."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great airline,Great airline. Love early boarding. Not fan if you have large family with small children boarding on C line. Otherwise efficient and funny crews.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Great flight, easy to book.","Southwest makes booking flights easy, & they do not charge extra for checked luggage.  The check in 24 hrs. ahead couldn't be easier, it's a click of a button on your phone."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great trip to Southern Ca and return to Omaha,Getting older (91)  I had to have wheel chair to gates-they did wonderful in getting me where the gates were-both changing planes in Phoenix going and Denver returning-The flights were on time and the crews both ways were very helpful-They do not charge extra for checked baggage which is a plus to credit them for-
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Customer Service in a difficult time...,"Sadly we had to reschedule flights that coincided with a planned cruise in April due to the Coronavirus . Online services were sluggish due to so many folks in the same situation. I ended up calling Customer Service twice for assistance. They called back at the time I was given, and were so helpful. They assured me where needed, and asked how else they might assist me. Both agents were friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to help. Excellent experience with Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Quickie Vegas Trip,"The attendants on Southwest can not be beat! They are friendly, funny, and helpful. They always make you feel comfortable."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Florida,Great flight. Crew was very good. No problems with any part of our trip. Ice storm in Kansas City made us extend our stay. Perfect.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The crew is always friendly,The crew is always friendly and there to make your trip enjoyable.  They are usually on time or a little early.  Seats are comfortable and leg room is ok.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The Typical Great Flight,"I flew from Philadelphia to Denver and then from Denver to El Paso.  Both crews were fantastic and the flights were uneventful, just smooth and relaxing.  And the best thing was a short layover.  Would certainly fly Southwest again and again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Good flights,"On time departure, painless boarding, early arrival, and a cheerful crew helped make this a very good flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Prefer to fly Southwest,"Always like to fly Southwest.  Friendly, reliable and the prices are decent.  They allow 2 carry-on bags and I've even had  to cancel a flight and they gave me credit - no problem!  Also, I really like the way they do seating - no assignment, just line up and take an available seat."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best Airline,"Southwest Airlines makes traveling fun and easy. They have better prices, and they offer more non-stop options than other airlines. Their boarding process is organized and efficient. The staff is friendly and helpful. If you're a frequent traveler, you'll have some perks- free drink coupons, and you'll eventually  become an A-lister where you'll procure a better place in the boarding line. I try to fly Southwest on all my trips. When I have to fly another airline, I definitely notice the inferior service."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Still the best airline to fly!,"Southwest has always been my airline of choice but sometimes there were other deals out there that would save me more than $20 or $30. This time, they had a good deal and I was able to book my trip with them. The flight attendants are always very nice not like some of the cheaper airlines that treat you like they're doing you a favor. I don't like it when I'm paying for a service and no one even smiles at you or thanks you. The Southwest pilots are even friendly. It's always nice that they offer 2 free checked bags and a carry on and don't nickel and dime you to death. I totally recommend!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,BIRTHDAY FLIGHT,"O.M.G.,!! The flight left late due to a plane issue in Vegas, when we got to the airport LUCKLY the gates were across from each other, we were 2 of the last 7 to get on the plane. My wife was a little behind me when boarding, THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT.About 2hrs. Into the flight, one of the flight attendants was making an announcement,About a very important person on board, so of course EVERYONE ( including myself )Is looking for a president, rock star or just someone of importance, WELL, when theySaid a BIRTHDAY BOY, I knew who they were looking for.!! The crew had ME come foreword, Gave me a cake made from a roll of NEW  toilet paper and a crown from pretzel bags. once I got up front, they had everyone close the window shades, turn on theLight for a flight attendant and sing happy B/Day. I can NOT remember the last time I laughed that hard. 300 strangers at your birthday party is kinda cool, when we got off at Bradley, peopleFrom our flight we’re still laughing and wishing me happy birthday.!!,!!Thanks again to Southwest Air.

Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flying for wedding party,Our flight was awesome. No hassle.We enjoyed it while other airlines had significant delay.It was really cool.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great flight,"It’s the best airline as far as I always use it. I did write to the company and told them my dislike. I think not charging for Bags is the best deal. Since most of the people  rather bring on it on top is a shame. I told them if it should be reversed. It should be reversed. Free on top and pay on the bottom. They answer and said that they have to make customer happy. What about the people that are in their seats, the last 2 trips I I took a guy with a bag tried to put it on top but did not fit. When he put it down and hit my shoulder. Than this past trip on 29th of feb. A back pack hit my glasses and the stem hit nose.still red."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Southwest baby,"I like Southwest. The seats are comfy and there's more room between seats.Straight through flight and beverage service included. However, asked if we could catch earlier flight and they said we'd have to buy new flight. Quote:$700. We waited. First come, first serve on seating so be ready to sit in the middle if your scheduled to board C section."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Major delay due to mechanical issues,"The flight started in Kansas City and actually landed a few minutes early in Nashville.  However the connecting flight from Nashville to Orlando was delayed an hour due to ""mechanical issues"".  During that delay, a storm developed between Nashville and Orlando and the flight was delayed an additional 3 hours, with nothing provided to the passengers for their delay and frustration.  On other airlines when this has happened I've received complimentary beer or wine, but not on Southwest!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Hobby to Oakland,"This was an easy trip. Four hour flight was much better than having a layover. Friendly people. As always with southwest,there is no seating assignment."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Beware of cancellation policy,"My convention was cancelled due to the Coronavirous-19 scare.  Even under these unusual and extreme circumstances, non-refundable means non-refundable. Their offer of keeping the money and using it for a later date is hooey.  I am not a frequent flyer and have lost over $300.  Cheaper is not always best."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,The Only Way to Go,"Southwest is my carrier of preference when flying to and from Cabo. They are Great Customer Service and they do everything in their power to accommodate your every need. The planes are always clean and well serviced. I always pay the extra fee for Early Bird but you don't need to do that, just check-in 24 hours before scheduled takeoff time. Great Airline and worth using."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Lite Load,Admit it.  It’s great when you hear that the flight only has 85 people on it.  Sorry for the revenue hit but it’s so nice to have no one in the middle.  Great crew took excellent care of us.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Love SWA,Usually if SWA doesn't fly there I won't go.  Love this airline. The employees make my trip a joy. Love this airline.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Stewardess very proficient and attentive,All aspects of my flight were handled in an excellent manner Cheese crackers were fresh and plentiful.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Visiting Georgia,"Had a pleasant trip!  First flight from LAX to Atlanta was on time, my sister was in a wheelchair and they aboard first I was able to get in with her and able to seat together had a nice time, friendly staff and helpful. Peaceful trip.On our flight back from Atlanta to LAX we were not able to seat together cause I couldn't go in with her, no big deal. However, we were 30 minutes late waiting for very unconsidered people who where late arrivals. Great for Southwest to wait for them, bad for us who where on time and had to wait seating there and some people were getting antsy. Overall our flight was good."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Overcharging and total lack of accountability by Customer Service and Customer Relations..,"Overcharged by Southwest's miss-leading website as admitted by their Customer Relations rep. However not able to resolve?!? Overcharged by SW's miss-leading website. Called Customer Service, they said we cant do anything call customer relations tomorrow! I did and after spending about 20 minutes explaining what happened she put me on yet another 15 minutes hold to talk to specialist, etc. Then she comes back and says, we apologize, the overcharge was due to a system error (costing me $200 extra) we can give you $50 volcher!!!? I said if it was a system problem as you said why don't you refund me in full, adjust the charges, she said well you had to call right away so we can help you!?!? I said I did, and your CS person gave me your number instructed me to call tomorrow to talk to you the Customer Relations in Dallas TX.! She said since there is no record of that!: ?!?!? meaning we don't keep record of our customers's issues or complaints!?!?! Sorry, $50 volcher is all I can do?!?! Admittingly overcharged me about $200, and saying sorry here is $50 volcher?!?!? What? This is same as hijacking and robbery. shame on you people, Im a customer since 2009 and this is what I get. Also - your CS phone system gave me the option to hold for 32 minutes or leave my number so when a rep is available they call me right away, os I said OK and followed the instructions. I got a call after 32 minutes, with an automated voice keeping me on hold for another 45 minutes!?!? while pushing SouthWest's ""oh We Care"" messages over and over!?!? what is the point of this call back system?!?!? Of course after all that no one could resolve this Overcharged by error problem! By the way, have not seen the $50 volcher yet?????"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Good price, good schedule Bay Area to Tennessee/Mississippi","SWA roundtrip from Oakland to Nashville is one of the few ways to get a direct flight from the East Bay to that area at a fair price. We flew American outbound  from Oakland to Memphis (via Phoenix) for the Cal v Ole Miss game. That took most of a day. After the game, we drove to Nashville for a few days, We returned on Southwest,   Nashville direct to Oakland.  That leg was reasonably priced, much faster, and much easier.   If we do it again we'll likely fly Southwest round trip, Oakland to Nashville, and drive from Nashville to wherever we need to go in the region."
n/a,50,Love Southwest!,I pretty much only fly Southwest Airlines these days.  They are very friendly and accommodating.  I like being able to check two bags and the ease of changing flights.  They also still offer drinks and snacks.  Great customer service.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"1st time flying Southwest to Cancun, Mexico","Took Southwest Airlines flight to Cancun for the 1st time.  Left a little late, but everything else about the flight (to and from) was without any problems.  Did not know they flew to Cancun, but would use them in the future."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Love Southwest,Southwest is always on time and crew is very friendly. Easy check-in and I like the idea of being able to take two bags free.  Would like a little more room for legs and seating.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Service......on time,"Southwest is consistently the best for domestic travel.  Almost always on time, no baggage fee & friendly staff.  I always check Southwest first.  Never disappointed."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Trip to San Diego with my family,"Took my 2 daughters, son-in-law, and grandson to San Diego for a fun time with my old ships crew..It was a great flight, and we were all pretty much able to sit together..I'm not the best flyer, but SouthWest ALWAYS makes sure I have a comfortable flight!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,First  Time to Florida,"We had a stop in Atlanta going to Orlando. We landed 2 gates over from where we had to board, so we had time to use local facilites get some food, and be ready to go.  The return trip was a direct flight, not full, so we did get a window and isle row, to ourselves.  HOw ever, it being an airlne that serves Disneyworld, we did have 5 or so familes on the return trip with crying babies all the way home. Not the airlines fault I know, and all in all a very good flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,ANOTHER GREAT FLIGHT ON SOUTHWEST,My wife and I flew from Orlando to San Juan Puerto Rico on Feb 20th. The flight was great and the crew did an outstanding job. I was impressed to see the flight attendant say everything in both english and spanish. I am sure that was very helpful for the spanish speakers aboard. It was a very smooth flight into San Juan and we ended up being 25 minutes early. Great job Pilots and crew. My favorite airline to fly.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Flight,No complaints on my latest southwest flights. I haven't felt this way about every flight on Southwest but this one despite a short delay on departing flight. I do however wish I understood how you can check in right at the time and still get a loading position in B zone :(
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Very nice airline,"On time departure, good passenger treatment, great carryon luggage procedure. Southwest airlines always meets/exceeds expectations."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Tampa Trip,"Great trip! Southwest is generally my go to carrier. There staff is helpful, upbeat and friendly. Wish they would fly to Europe!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Southwest makes it easy!,"Took my family of six on vacation to Florida and flew Southwest. I used the Southwest app on my phone to book the flights and also check in. We hadn’t flown for several years and had some questions. The Southwest folks we talked to helped answer any questions we had and were very friendly. I love the fact that there wasn’t a bunch of extra fees for bags and assigned seating, just sit where you want. Boarding was easy, just know that the sooner you check in within the 24 hour window before your flight, the closer to the front of the line you will be for boarding. Seating is first come first serve. There are 3 seats on each side of the isle, so have a plan for your seating arrangement if traveling with children. The flights there and back were comfortable and all Southwest staff we encountered were great! We can’t wait to fly Southwest Airlines again!"
n/a,50,Simply the best.,If you are looking for a reliable and efficient way of getting from point A to point B Southwest Airlines is the way to go. We have flown on their planes multiple times to several different locations and have never had any issues. So for a great price you can get where you're going on time with very little trouble.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Another Great Trip !,"We left Florida and the bright blue skies and made one quick stop in Baltimore before flying to Buffalo. Flight was smooth, the plane was very clean and as usual, the crew was very friendly. It was 74 degrees when we left and 34 degrees when we got back . . . welcome home !"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,San Antonio,We always tend to use Southwest Airlines.  The flights always seem to be ontime and the attendents are friendly.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,We had to change planes in Florida. the gate we came in on was the gate we caught our next flight from. No running throu,We left on time or early and arrived early. Our connecting flight was at the same gate that we arrived at. so no running through the airport to another gate.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,A long weekend to Florida,"I always love flying Southwest.  It is my go-to airline.  I love they allow up to 2 bags to check and they also allow you to choose your seat.  Always pay the extra $25 for early boarding, it is so worth it!!!!!  Actually don't, that way I get a better seat :)"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest the Best,"Southwest is a great airline to fly.  The price is usually reasonable, the service is fine, and there is no charge for two checked bags.  The flight left on time and arrived on time."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Flight to denver,We have flown several times around the same time of year to go skiing in Colorado.The experience with Southwest recently was far superior to the last several flight experiences all on other carriers.Curbside baggage check-in was a breeze and all flights were on time both with take off as well as landing.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Aborted landing in FLL,It took pilot about 5 minutes before he explained details   Stated heavy winds and Just didn’t feel right.  We made a Circle and landed second time within 10 minutes. I recommend sooner details.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Friendly Sky's,"It took a while to figure out the boarding system. Once we did everything went smooth, managed to get great seats and the Flight Attendant was wonderful, she was very friendly and fun to talk to, she even let us see her Tablet to trace our flight as we went. Great trip, we will fly Southwest again!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Like clockwork,"Ever since I started flying Southwest, the joys of air travel have started to outpace the pain.  Out of 16 flights I took between June and February all but one were on time.  The self service check in is easy and always functioning.   The added bonus is the multi-talented staff who happily stray off script with witty remarks, poems, even the occasional song."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flight Experience,Great flight. On time both ways.  Plus I received complimentary upgrade to A-list for 3 months.   Very sweet.  Thank you Southwest
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flying,Great flight.  Left on time and arrived early!  Attendants were friendly.  Bags were on the carousel waiting.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good budget flight,"I've been flying on Southwest on a weekly basis between LA and SF for a few months now. The airline has been consistently decent. Not fancy by any means, but efficient and polite. They are usually pretty punctual."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Trip to Las Vegas,Very quick and easy.   No issues.  We checked in bags no issue at kiosks.  Everyone helpful at both airports counters.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Short Visit,"Southwest has been our ""Go to Airline"" for most of our domestic trips. Their routes are limited but a few of their secondary destinations, like Albany, NY have worked out great!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Only fly southwest,"I love their bag policy, I love their policy for canceling and re-scheduling flights. I also love the rewards from the credit card. I even stick with southwest when I can’t get a direct flight. They are family friendly"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Pleasant,"The staff was very efficient and helpful, even with the plane being full. We felt like we were safe and taken care of. The plane was clean."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,good flight,"My flight was on time and very comfortable, the service was very good, the staff was very efficient."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Southwest airlines,"We always fly Southwest from these locations.Prices are usually very very reasonable and i can get flights at times of day that I like.  Also i pick non stop as i do not like flights with layovers as some airlines have most of the times.  Service is minimal, drink and peanuts, but the flight is only 1 hour and 20 minutes too.  Driving would be at least 8 hours.  So i can easily survive on diet coke and a bag of peanuts!!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Southwest travel with bizarre rules,"I’m a seasoned international traveller and my recent flight with Southwest was intriguing. On the way to Punta Cana we were not allowed to queue at the front of the plane to use the toilet, on our return we were unable to queue at either end of the plane ‘because of 911’ (direct quote from air stewardess) I have discovered that there IS a rule that says you can’t line up to use the toilet near the cockpit, and there is a U.S. Security directive for international flights returning to the U.S that states that passengers may not congregate in any area of the cabin. There is a clear difference between congregating and queuing for the toilet, & I know that I have ‘hung out’ in the bar on Virgin transatlantic flights without being chased back to my seat!I’ve also stood in a small queue on a recent BA flight to Chicago from London so is this only a US based airline rule?Anyway, I’m used to European airlines insisting that window blinds are raised for take off & landing, not enforced on Southwest, ditto with ‘arm rest down’ & the guy in front of me was in recline mode from we boarded in Punta Cana until we were about to land in Chicago ......... all rules that are enforced in the EU. So apart from that, boarding is by letter & number & mostly works, it is a ‘free for all’ to get a seat, snacks & drinks are free of charge & there is a constant supply of free water on a 4 & 1/2 hour flight (which leads to needing a bathroom!) Crew are pleasant, the seats aren’t particularly comfortable but the company fly 2 bags FOC per person, & allow changes, so flights work out a reasonable choice for travellers. Would I fly them again? Yes IF they were the best value, but I wouldn’t use them as my ‘preferred carrier’"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Quick boarding and take off.,We got the heads up from the Tower that Air Force One was scheduled to land at same time as us in Phoenix we would be circling for up to an hour if we could not beat the window allowed by FAA.We did and I actually saw the plane and 45  as I was leaving the airport getting unto I17.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Las Vegas Experience,"The seats were not comfortable, the boarding process was okay, I paid extra for early boarding, I didn't see the need to pay extra, I would travel with Southwest again, as the ticket was the a lot cheaper compared to other airlines."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth flight!,Great experience!  Flight was smooth and 45 minutes early which I've never experienced.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Non-stop flight is definitely a plus!  I highly recommend Southwest Airlines!
Date of travel: April 2019,40,ok for the price,really tight seating but they don't charge for bags so it's a wash.  nice flight attendants and a clean potty
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Comfort — no hassle Flying,"I’ve flown all major airlines, Southwest ranks above the rest💖. Stewards & stewardesses are pleasant and accommodating.  Directions are uncomplicated and direct.  Food & beverage service excellent.  Pilot had a sense of humor; greeting everyone as we disembarked.Much better than other airlines"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight was Awesome..CREW on Southwest are the BEST..Especially Cletus,"Flight was Awesome..CREW on Southwest are the BEST..Especially Cletus...Southwest is awesome. Crew always is efficient, personable and professional. Special acknowledgment to Cletus....he was truly one of the best crew in the skies!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,My Airline of Choice,"Once again, Southwest met every expectation. The staff in the terminal and aboard the plane were professional and attentive. Whenever I have a choice, I fly Southwest."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,An Airline that still cares,"In this day & age of air travel where other airlines charge the travelers for seats, luggage, carry-on luggage, food, flight changes, etc, and soon (hopefully not) the right to use the onboard toilets, etc, Southwest still puts its passengers first. They do not nickel and dime the passengers for the basics, and understand it is not a low cost bus service in the air, but a full air-travel service they are providing us. Despite the low fuel costs, other airlines still charge a surcharge carrying on from the dark ages of air travel, as well as a lot of other make-belief, padding-of-their-bottom line charges! Southwest’s personnel are pleasant, smiling, and hospitable. This is coming from a life-long American Airlines flyer who switched over to Southwest after being slighted way too many times. I root for Southwest and hope they uphold their pro-consumer transparent policies."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,The new carrier from Long Beach to Oakland,We had to switch to Southwest to fly to Oakland as Jet Blue gave up their slots to Southwest.  We are now learning the rules and ways of Southwest.  No assigned seating.  You get two free checked luggage.  Seats are closer together.  You have to balance the wait for airfare sales and making sure you get the desired time.  There is no change fee but you might pay more for the  fare difference.  I paid $15 each way for the two of us to get into the A group.  People who pay for the premium seating are automatic A and those who fly more frequent are upgraded to A group.  I know you should try to check in as soon as possible.  At home I received 48 and 49 positions.  Up in Oakland  I used my smartphone to receiver 28 and 29.  You are told to line in the numerical order of your boarding pass.  In both cases we were able to be at the front of the plane.  I. will continue to use Southwest in the future.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Trip to Baltimore for COnsultation,TRIP LEFT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.WE actually got in early and had to wait to get into our gate.The trip was smooth and the crew did a good job keeping all of the passengers comfortable.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Great experience, great service","Southwest continues to impress me with keeping he main thing the main thing. On a recent trip, they were friendly and efficient in the mundane task of loading a  flight. It’s refreshing to have good solid customer service."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Southwest never disappoints! Free Luggage check!,"As always, Southwest never disappoints. you board by ""groups"". In order to get a good position in your group, you either have to purchase an ""Early Bird"" ticket ($25 per flight) or check in EXACTLY at 24 hours before your flight. Still, with no cost for luggage, it is well worth it!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Flight from Atlanta, GA to Fort Lauderdale, Fl via SouthWest","A first-time flier with SouthWest Airlines during the Christmas holidays. With many gifts for the grandchildren, the free two pieces of luggage plus carry on was a huge motivator.  Price was comparable with other airlines. The inbound and outbound flights were on time. The crew was courteous and service comparable to others. I will definitely fly with them in the future."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Need wheelchair in the airport? Read on!,"As usual, organized chaos at the Orlando airport, but SOUTHWEST’s procedure’s work very well. Unfortunately due to new medical issues we had to use the wheelchair preboard and even less fortunately at our destination they were not informed of the need for 6 wheelchairs at the gate so a long wait (while those needing wheelchairs had to stand in the jetway since we had already exited the plane) and then not enough staff to get more than two at a time up the jetway ramp. Of course this was complicated by the fact that the airline is not responsible for getting the wheelchair person anywhere except up and down the jetway. Not Southwest’s fault in any way for that rule! But if traveling and need a wheelchair, be aware that you should allow LOTS of extra time at both ends, and can only get preboard on your ticket in person at either the checkin counter (not kiosk), or at the gate counter. Also some airports  will allow the companion to manage the wheelchair but others (including Indy) will not, for liability reasons. Southwest, and I would think other airlines, require staff to handle the jetway travel due to the steep ramps. Quite a learning experience!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Great, consistent service","Typical number sequence boarding. Staff on ground and in flight easy going, fun to engage. On time, fast off boarding."
n/a,40,Good Flight,"Have been flying Southwest for years. Always consistent and as expected. No frills, but efficient. Seats are comfortable and staff is always friendly. Like the shortbread cookies better than the pretzels they usually give out."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Reliable flights,Still not sure I agree with their boarding process. I may be cheap but I hate having to pay extra to check in early. Going online exactly 24 hours prior to departure and never getting closer than B 30 is a little frustrating but getting a decent seat on the plane even that far back is not an issue. I almost never have carry on luggage so when I get on the plane is not a problem.It was rainy and our luggage was wet. Prices are very good and service is good. Do not like the on board entertainment setup. It's easy to get their app but you probably need at least an i pad to be able to enjoy the films or TV. Availability of flights is a plus but it would be nice to be able to book more months in advance than currently available on line.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A pleasure to fly with them.,So amazed by the friendliness of the staff.  Easy check in and the 2 free checked bags is awesome.  Love flying Southwest
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Customer Service,"With the ability to check in with your phone, no hassle seating, (no assign seats), nice flight attendance, and clean planes Southwest is a great ""Puddle Jumper"""
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Florida trip,Plane left about 5 minutes early and we arrived about 10 minutes before scheduled time.  Pilot kept us updated on arrival time and weather in Hartford.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Enjoyable,"On time departure/arrival.  Friendly and helpful airline personnel.  Speedy baggage service in Nashville-two thumbs up for the baggage handlers there!  On the other hand DCA was a mess as always in baggage handling, wait was long and announcement on baggage arrival was scarce at best."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good inter-island Hawaii Flights,"There was a cancellation of our original flight and we were re-booked onto a flight a few hours later.  We were notified by text well in advance so we did not have to wait at the airport.They gave us $200 each in airlines credits, far more than we paid for the original flight!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flying with grandkids,"Traveling with little ones is always a stressful time. But getting to board ahead of most of the travelers was a big plus. To pass time, my 8 year old grandson and I compiled a questionnaire for the cockpit crew. A none uniform pilot was traveling in the jump seat and took the time to come to our seats and answer the questions in person! My little grandson is interested in aviation and got to fly in a small plane while visiting with us. So getting the attention of a professional on the flight was a real highlight and something my grandson will remember for the rest of his life!This is the kind of service that is highly appreciated!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Functional,No frills flying. Planes were on time both ways. Staff was nice. No issues. Everything went as scheduled and was smooth
Date of travel: March 2020,40,reliable,"Southwest is reliable, simple, inexpensive, and friendly.  There are few extras to buy even if you want them., but the overall flight experience is nearly always good."
Date of travel: September 2019,20,nothing special...annoying boarding system...,"flew on my birthday.  no acknowlwdgement...hate their boarding system...flights delayed,,,dont know if there's any better airline,  what happened to friendly faces and decent customer service???"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Feb Las Vegas Vac,As usual our round trip flight from Houston to Las Vegas on Southwest was great.  The customer service was great.  Already planning our next trip and as usual will fly SW.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Missing Home,"Flying with Southwest has ALWAYS be a fabulous experience for me, but this trip was the first for me and my youngest Son who not only was excited to fly for the first time since he was a Baby but actually got to visit nthe Cockpit."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Fast flight and no delays,"Originally the flight showed a delay due to weather. No problem they just grabbed a ""spare"" plane and took off on time. The flight crew also was deplaning in Phoneix for more tasks. You know in advance that youtake your chances on seats but that is teh price you pay for the balance of the good stuff from Southwest."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Good price,Our flight time was changed the day before the flight and then delayed by 20min. No option to pick assigned seating but we were lucky enough to get the last 2 seats together in the last row in the back of the plane while others had to sit separately wherever they could find a seat. Attendants were all very friendly and helpful. I would recommend Southwest to friends and family.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"Normally, I love southwest...not this time.","Southwest changed gates and never sent me a text telling me.  When I arrived very early at the airport, the gate had not changed.  When I looked at the board early, it was the original gate.   I never noticed it changed.  They paged me, I was at the gate I thought it was, and I never heard it.  I almost missed my plane...I was the last one boarding the plane, and I had paid to board early.   So my fault for not checking again, and their fault for not texting me the change."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Decent Flight,"For most of the year, Southwest offers the only non-stop flight from Baltimore to Oklahoma City. For some reason, no non-stop flights are available during February. Even with the stopover and change of planes, the total flight duration was much better than other airlines are able to offer. Since  Southwest does not pre-assign seats, boarding is a free-for-all that can be pretty stressful at times. This flight was not full and arrived on time. Basic refreshments are free but they don't offer peanuts anymore."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"trip to palm springs,ca",no problems with our flights! Staff through out travel provided excellent service! I would recommend this airline to any one!!!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest During Coronavirus Scares,I love Southwest.  They thanked everyone for wiping down their trey tables and arm rests (as everyone seemed to be cleaning their area) and even came down the aisle before take off to collect all the dirty wipes.  We were on time both directions and the attendants were all super friendly.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,good all around,"great airline, great price, 2 bags free,  plane left on time, got to where we were going early,  will definitely fly with them again."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,southwest is on time and quick loading,I like southwest because they are almost always on time.  & quick loading.  I get to sjc airport about 15 minutes before they start loading.  So I do not waste time hanging about.  The TSA pre line is never more than 5 minutes.  just do not show up later in the evening when the shut off the TSA pre line.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Luv Southwest,"First, the ladies at the counter where I checked my bag were phenomenal. I had some questions; they were very patient and helpful. The flight attendant who gave the safety briefing on the plane made it fun; I wish Southwest always did this! (It seems it's more the exception than the rule nowadays.) Thank you!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Terrible Service,"I have always flown on this airline, and almost every time they have been rude, inconsiderate, and overall unpleasant. Like they say, you get what you pay for."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Airline to Fly,"Southwest is always a pleasure to fly. It's easy to check-in, board and the crew is always wonderful. Often the crew will be very humorous which makes it even more enjoyable. It's comfortable, and it's a very reputable airline. Almost always on time leaving and mostly early landing."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Mediocre Experience as Usual with Southwest,"My wife and I were somewhat disappointed with Southwest Airlines.   While they do have a two bag per person rule which is good, you have to pay extra to get priority boarding.  It seems like almost everyone on the flight had paid for the priority boarding privilege which pretty much negated the benefit.   Southwest needs to enforce the baggage rules more stringently.  Too many people carry large bags on board rather than use the baggage service and they take up too much room in the overhead storage area."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Easy round trip,"they really make things easy, flying with my one year old was smooth which was important to me. They also include the baggage so thats awesome"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Book early for best prices on airline tickets,"Flew out of SJC to MKE with a brief stop in STL, total flight time was about 7 hours. If you book early enough, you will have a good chance of saving money on the airline tickets. I flew the week after Thanksgiving to visit my newly born grandson and there were many travelers during this time. With Southwest Airlines, it's more like a bus service with a very small bag of peanuts and half of a canned drink unless you request the full can. There is not much legroom and the seats are not very comfortable for long flights, most of the flights are oversold so expect to be packed in like a sardine in a can. The flight attendants are friendly and pleasant. Try to check in larger bags if you board in the 2nd or 3rd group it is difficult to find overhead bin space for your carry-on bags. Some people fly with their pets, expect to be seated near someone's pet. The great thing about Southwest Airlines is that they have open seating, sit where you like. Although you can pay more for the priority boarding."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest never fails to please!,"On-time departures, exceptionally helpful and happy flight crews, and very clean planes combined to make a long travel day very enjoyable! Southwest is our favorite airline because it is the BEST!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,staff of southwest was very friendly and helpful,Only issue with southwest is in gatoo area and far from normal airport. Flight was good. Free luggage check in is helpful for long trips.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Vacations,"Highly recommend using southwest airlines... amazing workers always respectful,clean facilities,all around good flight 👊😁"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Easy Peasy,"Despite being delayed for 30 minutes, we were boarded quickly and had excellant seervice on board and one of the  best landings that i can remember."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Luv Southwest Airlines,I flew for the day to Houston to take my uncle out to lunch for Valentine’s Had a very pleasant flight both ways due to flight attendants and their love of their jobs Thank you Southwest
Date of travel: February 2020,40,First impressions of Southwest,"Been flying for 50 years, first time on Southwest. Never considered them before as I didn't think I would like the cattle-call boarding. It wasn't that bad, but I purchased Early Bird so I ended up around A30 or so. No problem choosing seats as long as you didn't want the first 10 rows. Flight was uneventful. I watched a movie on their wifi. Cabo airport must have all international flights land within a 15 minute window as customs was packed. It went fairly quickly all things considering and we went out to meet our arranged car. Highlight of the trip was the stop by the outdoor bar for what had to be the best margarita of the week. Wasn't cheap, mind you, but it was good."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent flight- announced delayed departure 12 hours before flight,"Southwest announced 12 hours before departure that the flight would be delayed an hour. This pre-announcement allowed passengers to adjust their schedules. The actual departure time was some minutes before the announced delayed departure. While a flight delay is always a disappointment, the quick action by the airlines to inform passengers of the delay allowed everyone to plan accordingly."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest is great when you,"Southwest is simply the best.  I had to make an emergency change because my son had an operation, and they facilitated the change immediately.  Of course, there was no change fee  and because I dropped down to a cheaper ticket, they gave me money back!  Only Southwest cares this much..."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,On time - and dependable,"Southwest from Chicago midway continues to be a very dependable, easy to book and easy to travel on airlines.  The ability to check 2 bags, allows me to drop by wife and kids and check my bag with hers..."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Southwest lied,"Our flight on January 29th leaving Cancun for Houston was delayed because of weather. So I check in with the desk and they said Southwest is not giving vouchers. 4 related weather conditions. So I went ahead and made a non-refundable. Hotel reservation in Houston going to get there till midnight or after. Original flight was 5:30. Pm. When we landed in houston they were handing out hotel vouchers. This made me a little upset I talk to Southwest at Houston. They gave me a number to call in the morning and explain to them what happened and they would refund me for my hotel. I did when we got back to Kansas City on Thursday. Southwest told me it's not their policy to give out hotel vouchers for weather related conditions, but Houston Airport decided to at Southwest counter which I inform them in that part of all Southwest. And they said individual. City counters have their option. I was very upset. Cost me an extra $120 Which I don't think I should have to pay for. Thank you.Adam Williams"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Easy in and out,So convenient to fly out of Burbank.  It's only 10-15 minutes from home and we miss the big city traffic of LAX.  Coming back was just as easy despite the hour drive from Lodi to Sacramento.  It made a weekend trip so much more enjoyable.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Very average and difficult to get seating unless you are a big flyer with them.,We have not flown with Southwest much and were one of the last to board.  We got middle seats and the flight was not great.  Very Crowded.  No movie or anything.  Thank goodness I had a book.  My husband and I were separated and our luggage was not near us which created extra time to wait for other to leave the plane so we could get our luggage.   Overall not a pleasant experience.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Services,The wonderful pilot waited an extra few minutes for my husband to return from retrieving a luggage bag mistakenly left at parking lot stop. This extraordinary compassion prevented us from missing our flight together. I should have gotten his name but was quite upset at the time and it slipped my mind upon arrival to Jamaica in route to Sandals Negril. I will always appreciate his kindness. It was our 39th Wedding Anniversary and he saved us from what could have been a delayed and disappointing occurrence. Thanks for all the wonderful people who God uses to enable happy endings!😊🙏🏽✝️
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Basic budget airline.,Well it is budget after all. Cost is low to fly. Buffalo is a nice airport to fly out of due to relatively small size.  Leg room was reasonable.  Plane in decent shape. No entertainment. . Crew reasonably nice.  Boarding area in Tampa was very small and overcrowded.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good Flight as usual with Southwest,We landed a half an hour earlier than listed. Always better earlier than later. Flight attendants friendly and informative.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Everything Is Included,I love Southwest Airlines! The price includes 2 free checked bags as well as a personal item & carry-on. You don’t even have to buy a seat! You can actually cross your legs while seated because of the available space between seats. Personnel are efficient & funny. A very enjoyable experience.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great price,"Great flight on time and arrived 10 minutes early Got thru customs fast,also got luggage fast,and nice warm weather"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent for everyone.,"Best airline for families! Children can sit with their families without paying extra; as it should be with all airlines.   We paid extra for early boarding.  But, since I am handicapped, I did not need to get early boarding.  But, my son also paid extra for early boarding and is very pleased.  This is a very efficient, polite, thoughtful and easy to use airline.  As with most airlines,seating is crowded, but there is no first class or other classes. This was only a 2 hour flight and we left on time and arrived on time."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,America’s Very Best Airline,All passengers are treated equally. All seats are the same. Everyone knows and follows the operating system. Food & beverage delivery is civilized and streamlined. All attendants and personnel are friendly. It feels good to fly this airline!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Flight and Great Price,We take this trip most every year as it is a direct non stop from Baltimore leaving at 8:55 in the morning and landing in Cancun at 12:50 or so. We leave our home before rush hour and we are checked into our hotel and in the water with a drink in our hand before 2:00 on the same day. About $400 give or take round trip and the service is always friendly and easy. Southwest keeps it on time and very affordable.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"Conference canceled due to Covid-19, waiting 7 hours for flight - as 4 earlier flights (half full) depart without me!","I am normally a big fan of unbundled flight options. I particularly like Southwest's cheap fares, flight frequency from San Diego, and their friendly staff. It is also a great option when you are advised by work to travel on short notice. On Sunday, I flew from San Diego to Austin for a conference. Upon landing on Sunday afternoon, I learned that the conference organizers had cut back the hours by half.After spending 70 minutes waiting for a rep on the phone, I learned that I would have to pay $350 to fly home 5 hours earlier today. I took a cab to the airport, hoping they would understand that my conference was affected by COVID-19.In this case, I read a news story that stated that Southwest is honoring flight changes for those affected by the coronavirus. So, was shocked to learn at airport that they are not being advised to waive fees. Standby is for A listers only. I would owe the difference between what I originally paid last month, and the price of a last minute one-way flight ($576).The PR spin does not synch w reality, Southwest!  It is so not cool to advertise that you never charge change fees when in fact you do.Good luck to you, Southwest. I had 17,000 miles to go toward A list status, but now will take my business elsewhere.Written from the Austin airport entrance. I am unable to check my large bag until 4 hours prior. Ugh!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,GREAT FLIGHT,"great flight, being handycapped i used a wheelchair they got me thru to the gate in 15 min. all personal were pleasant and helpful on both ends of the flight was on time"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Easy organized flight,This was a delightful flight with a great tail wind . The ride was very  bumpy but the pilot communicated on a regular basis . The staff could not complete cabin service but were able to quickly get drinks during the last hour . The staff was friendly and helpful .
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best Domestic Airline EVER!,"I have always loved SW, because of their laid back efficiency, but this last flight was the best ever!  While I was in Denver, I had a medical emergency and had to cancel my return flight, not knowing how long I was going to have to stay.  The day after I was released from the hospital, I called SW at about 8:15 AM to see if they could get me home that same day,  5 Hours later I was HOME!  AND, it was a very pleasant flight, on time, no waiting. I LOVE SW AIRLINES!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Visiting my sisters,Just your regular enjoyable flight. On time friendly and clean. Checked my bags as soon as I arrived at both airports
Date of travel: March 2020,40,swest,normal flight going reasonable price free check  baggage  nice service for disable traveler this flight for price had a long lay over  crew was very friend minimal food service
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Phoenix family reunion,"Southwest flights are always packed but in spite of that, the crew does an excellent job of keeping passengers safe and happy. We love Southwest!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,SWA to Hawaii,"New plane, courteous and friendly attendants, were concerned about food since SWA gives snacks only, but due to the length of the non-stop flight their snack packs were ""heftier"" than the usual Ritz bits or cookies.  They had some cheese and some crackers (and I wish I could recall what else, but it was decently filling).  Bring a laptop or iPad so you can log onto their entertainment since SWA does not have seatback video units."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great fun,What a joy to be able to board the plane at the front and the back. Wish other airlines were as smart and thinking of their passengers comfort more.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Fantastic Flight,"Again, no problems with flight. Only problem was with airport. We could not check luggage until 2 hours (or maybe 4). We had to sit on floor."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"VIP Treatment, temporarily handicapped","Due to an ankle injury I had to use a wheelchair. A sky captain from Southwest met me at terminal door, helped me through security, and brought me directly to my departure gate. Then at my arrival a sky captain met me at the front door of the plane and he took me to baggage and picked up my luggage. Maybe this is typical of all airlines but I was very impressed by the service that I received."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent,"As always, great. Especially this time. I required wheelchair assistance and staff was prompt, kind, helpful, friendly.  No improvement possible. Aircraft was clean.  Flight attendants were very friendly and cheerful, yet professional."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,So much better than the rest,"I flew from Richmond, VA by way of Atlanta, to Midway, IL. The gate clerks and flight attendants were the best I've ever seen. They were all professional, friendly, helpful and courteous. After flying on Southwest, I may never fly on other airlines again !!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Was my first choice,",I had a slight problem due to a snow delay in Minneapolis which caused a delay in Chicago.  My flight was Philly to Chicago to Oakland.  I had wanted to participate in a political rally in Oakland.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight to Ft. Myers from Indy,I prefer flying Southwest for the ease of making a reservation and booking a seat early as well as free luggage.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight attendants  are courteous and will help you if you ask them.,"I asked for cranberry juice for the flight's refreshments and as usual, I received a cup of cranberry juice loaded with ice.  So after drinking what little liquid was in the cup,  I asked for more cranberry juice and the flight attendant brought me an entire can plus a new cup.  Thanks!I also witnessed a request from the flight attendant for a passenger who wished to seat next to his family and sure enough other passengers moved so this request could be granted."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,San Antonio flight,"My wife flew to San Antonio to visit relatives in Kerrville, Tx.  The flight was a little over an hour long.  It was a full plane of passengers.  Our flight back only had 28 passengers.  If it was any other airline, I beleive our return flight would have been cancelled.  Way to go Southwest Airlines, way to go."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest is Best,I always enjoy flying Southwest Airlines and they are now my “choice” airline.  The seats are roomier and more comfortable than with certain other carriers.  The staff is always cheerful and provide very good service
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Why I love Southwest Airlines,"I have flown Southwest for years, in fact my first flight was to Dallas, TX. Love the fact that I can pack and check 2 bags for free and have a carry-on too.  I tend to over pack when flying, I never know what I want to wear and not having to pay for baggage is a lifesaver, plus early check-in and TSA clearance is very smooth. Will be flying to Cancun on SWA in April and it's a quick flight. Love SWA."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Leave the worrying to Us!,"If Southwest Airlines doesnt fly there then I can't go! Two free bags,economical fares! The gates to the airport are located in very convenient locations and easily to get to them once you get through the security check point."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Service, value, enjoyable to fly with SW","Love flying with Southwest.  Its a quick, pleasant flight from Detroit to Baltimore.  I travel it often.  I use SW often for many of my flight.  I am a rapid reward member, so I do get to board with group A always.  Some people don't like the free seating, I love it.Flights are on time, the crew is pleasant, and the planes are clean.  Price is always competitive as well."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Overall - it's all good,We fly Southwest all the time and it's always good/great. The only thing that ever causes issues for us are other travelers which is beyond the control of Southwest Airlines... maybe. Rude people and their horrible travel activities cause issues for everyone. From TSA to getting on and off the plane people can be a real issue. Don't be one of those people.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest the Best,I travel with numerous luggage unit and with Southwest bags fly free. Secondly you can checkin 24 hours in advance and recieive a group checkin to receive a good seat and if  you are not tilmely you can pay a fee to receive a optimal line up in boarding group A or B.  This guarantees you a better seat.. Southwest personnel seem to enjoy their work and working fir a wonderful employer.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight experience couldn’t have gone any better,Our trip to Cancun via Southwest Airlines was seamless. Even our return flight went without a snag. I was hesitant with an 1 hour and 1/2 layover in Houston on our return but between leaving Cancun timely to the Southwest Houston staff to Customs and TSA staff the entire experience was perfect. I will take this same route the next time I go to Cancun (hopefully soon!!)
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Fly the friendly skies . . .,"When I travel, I always check with Southwest Airlines first to see if they are flying to my destination. There are numerous non-stop flights available.  Baggage is FREE and the crew enjoys making the flight fun!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Phoenix to attend the Arabian Horse Show,"What a wonderful flight.  There were 30 empty seats on the plane and I was fortunately to have one of them next to me.  It felt like I was flying first class!  And Southwest doesn't charge extra for bags so many of the passengers check their luggage instead of using the overhead bins.  This makes for faster loading and debarking.  The employees of Southwest are very nice and since I flew on a 737-800, I had access to a wonderful in-flight television show.  It was on time.  It was a great experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Spring Training Baseball,Check In was easy and staff helpful. It helps to be early. I had a middle seat on the way there and was able to sit with my daughter. My son and his friend got to sit together as well. On the way back we were not able to sit together but close. I had a window seat which was nice. Service was Ok with snacks and drinks.Baggage pickup was fairly easy.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest,Love Southwest and their staff....they are outstanding.... deals are great if you can plan ahead....only drawback is the cattle call boarding but it gives you options of seating.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Second Trip to Aruba,"Wonderful flight even if it was a 6:50 AM flight.  This leg of my trip took me to Ft Lauderdale, FL.  Excellent service from the cabin crew.  Good flying of the pilot."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Easy and super-convenient!,"Being able to book with a day's notice to fly inter-island AND for less the $50 is a great value! I LUV Southwest's flexible rebooking policy. AND 2 bags fly free--you can not beat that flying in Hawaii. Excellent service, fast & efficient (has to be on 35 minute flight!) makes SWA an easy choice inter-island."
n/a,50,"Another perfect flight, despite virus fear","I have rarely had any issues with Southwest, and this trip was problem free other than being worried about catching the COVID19 on my late in the day flight. The plane was not full, as you might imagine. Is recommend flying early in the day, closest to the overnight sanitizing, to have less of a chance of catching the virus."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Comfortable flight with no delays or problems,"Southwest airlines provides fast and economical flights, friendly flight attendants.  If you're need to cancel they do not charge rebooking fees."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,January 2020,"We love Southwest. The flight attendants are friendly and funny. And, they have open seating, no assigned seats. And we can get pre-boarding. And they don't charge for luggage. Bags fly free."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,A breeze thru Dallas Love Field,"This was a three legged trip at a date way after I had booked Phoenix and it was SO easy to switch to what I needed with Southwest and with no extra $$$$ that it made lasting impression on me. I have flown with SW now for several years and love the way we board - seems to take at least 15 -30 minutes off the boarding time and with the early check in get the seat I want (aisle for me).   Do wish they would go back to peanuts!!The layovers from Denver to Ft. Myers and from Ft. Myer to Phoenix at Love Field was actually enjoyable.  Really nice airport, easy to navigate and good food."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Love this “Get Up And Go “ airline,"Love this airline. Bags free, outside service, no problem, drop off , great. Getting ticket at the machine, well if I can do it, anyone can do it. Setting great, even on the three and three. I do not mind the middle and that’s what I sat in. The guy who was getting on as one of the last passengers in the last group, could not believe he actually got a aisle seat. I do believe I made his day. Up in the air immediately, down and at the gate before you even knew you landed. Baggage not a long wait at all. The husband travels mostly America and has over seven million miles with them, but give me Southwest anytime and I’m a happy camper. Oh and the airline Stewarts and stewardesses cannot be beat. Happy people, helpful people. Thanks !"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Free bag, not so easy to change flight","I usually like flying Southwest because they let you change your flight without a penalty but on this occasion, I got to the airport early and wanted to get on an earlier flight and they said it would cost $200 extra.  So, I sat for 2 hours at the airport and got on an almost empty flight.  I like that passengers do not pay for the first bag and it is usually fairly inexpensive."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Always a pleasurable experience. 5 Stars.,Southwest Air is always:. On time. Polite. Professional. Friendly. Accommodating for changing flights and times. There are my number one airlines to fly any place in the USA.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Getting to Port,"Not an awful lot to say about Southwest! When my wife and I travel, our first choice is always Southwest. First because of the value, second is the free luggage allowance and thirdly and more importantly their customer service. Both the terminal personnel and the flight crews are always pleasant and professional. In my opinion, Southwest goes above and beyond in customer service. I also believe the boarding system is the most expedient and efficient, you want your choice of seats, check-in first. Additionally, for a nominal fee they will check you in before regular checkin time which pretty much insures that you will be in the A or low boarding que."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Over and above,"Traveling with a group can be difficult.  When the 56 passengers in our group were delayed getting through security because of difficulty checking in (even though we arrived 2 hours ahead of time), they were helpful in getting us all on board before departure."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Efficient,"I just love Southwest for their efficiency. From the preflight notifications to checking in, free baggage, boarding process and inflight entertainment, al at a very reasonable price. My first choice for a domestic flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love the free two ckd bags,"We found seats together with another couple quite easily, even being halfway thru Group B for boarding.  Always pleasant flight attendants.  Leg room and seat space seem better than some of the other airlines that cost more, and you can pick your seats ahead of time.  Easy ck in at the terminal.  I always ck if SWA has a flight to my destination first, when booking airfares."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Early, Non-stop, smooth and on time","Long time customer of Southwest due to destinations and ease of access at STL Sky Park parking and shuttle to/from Airport. While I had SW Rewards Visa, the cost was much higher on this trip even though I researched all airlines far in advance including SW. Used up all my points plus!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Atlanta Marathon trip,"As usual we always have good experience with Southwest team.  Web page easy to use, flight staff good and flight associates on the plane. Eye nice and planes clean"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,SusyBDMx02212020gs,"Southwest staff is the very best! I enjoy checking in my luggage inside (rather than curb assist) because I get to chat and ask questions of the staff. My flight was delayed several times, so I stayed in the airport for over 4 hours, catching up in my steps and relaxing as much as possible! I surprised my child late in the evening and it was well worth it because she had no idea I would arrive so late :)"
n/a,50,Twenty Year Customer,"Southwest is my carrier of choice. Planes are clean, flights arrive on time, people are nice. Because most flights are under three hours, the thinly padded seats are tolerable. SWA not reccomended for long flights."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Terrible service and inconsistent policies,Very poorly trained customer service representatives.  Was told different policies by various reps regarding military travel.  Customer relations rep put me on hold multiple times to look into issue and then came back and contradicted herself twice.  Bottom line I’m out $200 for travel paid to Southwest I was told I’d be able to use at a later date.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,excellent flight,great airline - i definitely will fly with them again.   love the free luggage!!  Not sure why i've never flown Southwest before!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good flight,We boarded and departed ontime. We landed ahead of time. There were no issues. Flight attendants were freindly and helpful.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,GEG to LAS smooth and Non-Stop.,Loved this being a Non-stop flight.  Bags flying free is always attractive.  The seats are cramped but for only 2 hours it's doable.  WE have always had great flight attendants and this was no different.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Problem free,"Everything went smoothly. No problems, but still don't like the cattle call approach to loading. Planes are Boeing 737 and communications with the cockpit was very good."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Checks all the boxes,"Yet to have a ""bad"" flight on Southwest.  Free bags are a plus and the crew is very cordial and fun.  Regularly on time and seating is comfortable enough."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight with a senior,"Off to a wedding with a  grandmother of the bride . Needed  wheel chair to and from. Southwest and the airports were great. Flight was half full so the three of us  found a row together. Never happens on southwest. The service on the plane was very good, the grandmother had not been on a plane in a long time. Great job flight attendants ."
n/a,50,Retired,"I recommend southwest airlines over most airlines. They have the following: always departing and arriving on time, never have delays, no baggage charges, and baggage arrives in the airport carousel on time.   Their airline prices are reasonable. Unfortunately, no refunds but can use the money for future tickets."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,I love this airline!,"I always check w/ Southwest flights 1st.  Everything from reservation process, notifications via email,  to destination has been excellent.  The employees are friendly and accommodating - very refreshing!  While I rarely have to check bags, my college children can, when coming home for extending time frames at NO EXTRA COST!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Smooth flight,"Early morning flight with a short stopover in Oakland--friendly crew, get flight.  Airplane was clean."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Always the best,I usually guy with SW and have found them to be very accommodating. I have some health issues and need W/C assistance. At our layovers the staff and crew are right there to assist me in making connections. Most times our connection is in BWI and MBJ the folks at these stops go above and beyond duty. Thank you Southwest.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,ALWAYS THE VERY BEST!!!,"Southwest is our ""Go To"" Airline!!!  Service, from the time of Booking till the end of the flight, is ALWAYS a 10+++!!!  The whole TEAM makes you feel like Family, and for that I am truly grateful."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight getting us to a cruise,Quick easy flight getting us to and from our cruise destination.  Smooth checkin and security.  Friendly staff.  No delays or problems.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Not for everyone....but we love 'email !,"If you don't mind not having an assigned seat, this is a great airline.  Usually on time - free bags - and excellent employeds."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent Service,It's always great when you arrive early for a flight and they move reservation to earlier flight with no charge.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest has never disappointed,Southwest is always my go-to airline.  I've never been late to a destination or connecting flight.  I like not paying for my luggage.  I like the affordability and destinations offered.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Round trip to VegS!!,"Great flight, both to and from Las Vegas. Service is always right on.  We had a 3 hour layover in Baltimore, MD on our way to Vegas and a 5 hour layover in Baltimore, MD  on our way back to Manchester, but the price was right and we had the time.  Whenever possible, I fly with Southwest Airlines."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Holiday Travel on Southwest: Not Recommended!,"On Christmas Eve day, I arrived at San Francisco International Airport 2 hours before my flight was to depart to Burbank (Southern California).  Departure time was 1:55pm, arriving BUR at 3:10pm. At 12:32pm, I received a text message from Southwest with a new departure time (3:05pm). Then within minutes another text from them with a departure time of 4:00pm. A few minutes later another text with departure time change of 3:30pm. Then, minutes after that, another text that the flight was cancelled. Absolutely unacceptable! There were NO weather issues in San Francisco at the time. The agent at the gate said it was ""likely due to weather, possibly regarding the aircraft that was arriving from another airport"".  That is hard to believe, since the flight was cancelled less than 2 hours before departure from SFO. Also, it couldn't possibly be a mechanical issue because the aircraft we were supposed to be boarding wasn't at the gate, and because it was so close to our scheduled departure time, the aircraft supposedly coming from another location had to have either already been in flight, or never left the ground. This is Christmas Eve. Most people flying on this day have very important commitments and family gatherings. There was no offer to fly on another airline. No other Southwest flights were apparently available to depart out of SFO. There was NO compensation offered, not even shuttle service to another airport. The only option for me was to get rerouted to Las Vegas then from LAS to BUR. The SFO-LAS flight didn't depart until 4:55pm and connecting flight got me into BUR at 9:15pm! That's 6 hours later than when I needed to arrive.  I was unable to see family members I have not seen in over 2 years due to completely missing a very special holiday gathering. It was the ONLY time I could have seen these family members, and I missed it. It will likely be another 1 to 2 years before I will see them again.  This is tragic, and all because (I came to find out) Air Traffic Control instructed Southwest to cancel this flight on Christmas Eve within less than 2 hours of departure.  So, it was an issue with air traffic, not weather.  ATC cancelled this flight probably due to departing and arriving aircraft congestion at SFO.  I never received any communication from Southwest about this. Not a word of apology, nothing about the reason for this cancellation, not a single offer of compensation.  I will tell you that in the future, I will NOT book a holiday flight with Southwest Airlines again. My experience that day was unreal, and has left me with a devastating loss of a missed opportunity to be with family."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Happy,"No luxury but everything I need is provided.  No baggage fees, flights on time, and good enough leg room. Sometimes the airfares are ridiculously expensive, much more than transatlantic flights with other carriers, but most of the time I am happy with Southwest."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"It's nice to be able to check your bags free, especially if you're bringing stuff home and need an extra bag to check.","I've always enjoy flying SW airlines, especially if I can get a direct flight.  I appreciate the free baggage check.  Checking in early is important so you don't get stuck boarding in the last boarding group.  I also have TSA which is wonderful to get through the long lines at airport security.  I highly recommend getting TSA pre-check!  =)"
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Family Mexico Trip,Great service from a friendly staff. No other airline that I have been on offers free  wifi with free movies and plenty of snacks.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Incredible hospitality,"I was a little concerned about flying with all the hype about theCorona Virus, but was very impressed with the cautions that the SWA staff and crew took with monitoring passengers for symptoms and the cleanliness of the aircraft. As always it was a very enjoyable flight due to the pleasant and entertaining crew."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Visiting Family and exploring new places,We paid extra to be in section A. We were happy with the boarding system and the flight. This beats driving any day. The flight was comfortable(who knew the seats were so small) and the departing into Austin easy. What a clean airport.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best airline experience!,"I have traveled every 4-8 weeks in last two years, using 3 different airlines.  Southwest far surpasses the other ones I’ve used!  Customer service is superlative! When I’ve had to make changes, it’s been handled pleasantly and no change fees! I lost money using another airline because I didn’t meet their criteria for change! (Death of my husband’s relative)  even though I bought the travel insurance!Southwest allows two free bags, and doesn’t charge more for a seat Their cabin attendants are friendly and service is great. I don’t know the statistic but my flights have all been on time  or early! Every aspect of my experience with Southwest, from their website, phone customer service, ticket agents, flight crews, & baggage handling, I give them A+!I LOVE SOUTHWEST ❤️"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,Southwest is always the same good quality at a great price. Plug two bags fly free. Everything was on time.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,I Always Come Back to Southwest Airlines,"I think, thanks to the Corona Virus, I finally had an empty middle seat next to me round trip. The flight itself, it’s attendants, and staff were pleasant and attentive as always. I appreciate booking flights without facing all the extra costs!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Organized and Friendly,"Although we fly on a regular basis for leisure, it has been a little while since we have traveled on Southwest (mostly because they do not have flights to places we have visited). I had forgotten how organized the process was to get on the plane. We usually pay the little extra to be seated in the first group and enjoy having everyone in a numbered line instead of ""Zone B"" being called and everyone rush to the line as other carriers do. The staff is friendly and fun, and snacks are included. The price was also excellent as we used the ""Wanna Get Away."" We try to fly Southwest whenever we can...just wished they went to Europe!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Comfortable,Great job to the pilot and staff of both flights to and from. All my concerns were addressed . The Flight was smooth and almost turbulent free(though im sure a pilot cant control that). I will definitely fry with SouthWest again and again.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Seat Belt was ALWAYS on.   Friendly and Attentive Attendants,"Southwest is notorious for keeping the seat belt sign on in order to allow their attendants the ability to quickly serve.  However, when it's left on for 3+ hours, that becomes a problem.   People start to ignore it and the attendants have to look the other way.    this may have also lead to the staff forgetting to provide customs forms, which caused a bit of a mess when folks deplanned with no documents."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,SouthWest Airlines all the Way,"Weekend gateway from St. Louis to Atlanta with SouthWest airlines was like a breeze. The timing is so perfect that one can make the best use of holidays. The weather was a bit turbulent and we could see many other flying services getting delayed or cancelled. However, this one was perfect on time. No cancellation charges & one baggage free of charge are other attractive features to go Southwest🛫✈️"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best Airlines our there BY FAR!!!!,"I’ve flown 6 times since January 1st and I can’t say enough great things about this airline.  They are so accommodating, the nicest, funniest flight attendants and pilots I’ve ever come across.  They get you on the plane quick and take off within minutes of scheduled take off times.  If a problem has occurred THEY LET YOU KNOW ASAP instead of letting you sit in your seat wondering.  It’s a lot easier to take when the pilots/airlines keep you informed!  Such a pleasure to fly Southwest Airlines!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Travel march 2020,Routine Southwest flight. Always appreciate  free SW baggae checking.  Staff always friendly and helpful. SW is our first choice for domestic travel.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Typical Southwest flight,Your typical Southwest flight. Best bang for the buck for short trips. They are cost effective and almost always on time. The flight back from Orlando on Sunday evenings with a plane load of kids tired from a week at Disney World can be patience testing.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,wouldn't fly any other airline,"southwest has never disappointed me. their staff is wonderful, the flights are affordable and if you fly on a holiday you get a free alcoholic beverage if you choose. I flew on Halloween and the staff was all dressed up"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Early Bird Check In - does not work!,I have flown 4 times with Southwest Airlines since December 2019.  Each time - BOTH my husband and I have paid $100 each trip for the Early Bird Check In.  All 4 times - it appeared that only 1 person of the traveling party paid for the Early Bird Check In.  They got on the plane and proceeded to save seats.  Which is not allowed.  I told the flight attendant and was told you can sit there.  How about the flight attendant telling them not to save the seats and remove the bags of stuff you have sitting on them???My Solution - REQUIRE all people traveling together (family) to purchase the Early Bird Check In.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Pleasantly  Surprised,"This is the first time i've flown with Southwest and i'm happy to say this will definetley not be my last. I was a little skeptical at first, I had never flown with an airline that didnt give you assigned seating. We checked in about 24 hours before the flight and got a pretty decent Group # assigned. We arrived at the gate and were a little confused on how that worked. Once they started boarding people started lining up according to their group assignment. It does take some communicating with the other passengers to figure out if you are before or after them. They don't really have entertainement like some of the other airliners but Other than that we had a very nice flight. Just bring your own entertainment and you'll be just fine.We even arrived about half an hour earlier than expected which is a plus."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Everything went as planned and although flight were packed it was a good experience,"Everything went as planned and although flight were packed it was a good experience. everything went smooth and on time, no issues."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Florida February 2020,Very smooth flight.  We left a few minutes early and arrived about 20 minutes early and that was nice!  Never had a problem with Southwest.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,SW trip,Had no problems with check in or going through security.  Boarding and deboard there were no issues.  Would fly with them again
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always fun,Always try to fly southwest - I am blind and I never have a problem - never try to take my cane - and when I had a dog it was never a problem ( the only airline I was in with the dog I clean that about )- always fun and easy - love the staff in and off the ground
Date of travel: March 2020,50,No Problems,Flight took off on time and landed on time. Attendants were cheerful and helpful.  Everything was as it should be.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,I LOVE Southwest Airlines!,"I have flown many airlines, both domestically and internationally, and I would rank Southwest at the top of my list for everything. First, their policy on allowing NO FEE changes in your travel arrangements. Second, there is NO CHARGE for checked baggage, up to two pieces per passenger. (Within reasonable weight limits, of course) and allows two carryon pieces, one smallish, like a briefcase or purse/backpack. The staff is always courteous and helpful, accommodating to people with special needs, The planes always appear clean and tidy. They are great about communicating, either with delays or issues that come up. For example, they communicated with passengers on upcoming trips about their extra measures they are taking to prevent the spread of virus. Top notch company in every way. Kudos, Southwest!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Fun and relaxing, everyone was in a good mood!","This flight was great! The plane was not full, so they asked us to spread out. My husband and I headed to the back of the cabin where he sat in the aisle and I at the window. There were other couples similarly situated around us with no one in the middle seat. When they came around with snacks (fritos, cookies, pretzels) they encouraged us to take two or more since the flight was over 4 hours long. Everyone seemed to be in a good mood and the weather was good until we got to San Juan."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Great airlines, friendly stewards and stewardesses.  Always my favorite!","Southwest Airlines is my favorite airline for many reasons.  They always have nice, professional staff members and once I lost a very dear sentimental bracelet and they made every effort to get it back to me which I so appreciated.  It was right after I was diagnosed with cancer and my sister in law made be a bracelet every time I had to go through chemo she added a charm on it.  Needless to say it was very special to me."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Short but nice,I always like to fly into MIdway where there is less hassle. Southwest does a great job out of there
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love Southwest,"Whenever possible the only airlines I fly is southwest.  They are courteous, friendly, Economical.  Their  on time statistics are excellent.  They are not perfect..no one is.  My only complaint is the amount of people who board early in a wheelchair. They are often accompanied by their family members. I have spoken to them about this but their hands are tied."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest Airlines,"As usual, SWA provided a great flight at a fair price.  If you don’t pay the extra $25 for an early place on the boarding queue, make sure to check in exactly 24 hours before the flight is scheduled to depart."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great airline,Flew up to Boise Idaho to see family the airline was wonderful they treated all the passengers really nice would recommend it to anybody
Date of travel: February 2020,40,To the Super Bowl!,"Last minute tickets to the Super Bowl meant last minute flights to and from Ft lauderdale and Southwest was available but at a somewhat steep cost. But hey, it’s the Chiefs first Super Bowl in 50 Years! Flight crews both ways were great and made full flights enjoyable."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Visiting Daughter,"I flew out Friday morning an d the flight arrived in Denver early, the flight was great, and coming home on Monday night the flight was excellent.  The employees are very nice and helpful.  I would recommend them."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Barchelorette Party,Great flight and friendly service. Plus you can't beat free bags! They are my go to airline all the time
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent staff.  On time.,"I love Southwest.  Some people complain about their boarding procedures.  Once you are aware of what they are...choose a different carrier if you do not like their procedure.  As long as I have a seat, I am a happy woman.  Whenever I fly domestic, I choose Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,great,"This is such a nice airline with roomy seats, friendly staff, ease with booking...and reasonable.  Lots of flights to choose from."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,The most fair priced airline,"I won’t fly on other airlines if possible. Although the other airlines look fairly priced at first, by the time you pick all the extras ie. seat position, baggage fee etc. you end up with quite an expense. I will add that on this last flight from Florida, I saw a flight attendant sitting in an aisle seat the whole time people were boarding. This was a situation where he was obviously saving this position for someone in a later group. I should have pointed that out to the C group passengers that were last to get on the plane"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Keeping A Promise,"This trip was to see family and friends. We flew Southwest because of the fare difference between flying out of Chicago Midway vs Chicago O'Hare. Plus their is no charge for change fees vs what the other major carriers will charge you to rebook your flight. Another thing you need to know if you travel a lot, you should be looking at least six (6) months out. And if you find the flight you booked has a lower fare you can rebook it yourself, and get a flight credit on your next flight. Please Note, that the credit is good for one year from the time you rebook. Also, my promise was to spend time at Clearwater Beach with family and a friend,which has the white Sandy Beach rated as the top Ten Beaches which I kept. Also it was nice not having to deal with the cold, shoveling snow, and Hello Reality Check when I came home."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Softball tournament,Both flights were on time and all the personnel involved were friendly and efficient. Couldn't ask for better travel.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Southwest is the way to go,"As always, Southwest continues to be my airline of choice...You get 2 free checked bags and can reschedule at no cost."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Love the way this airline does business,Whenever I can I fly Southwest - we flew to Phoenix and back and then the following week to Manchester New Hampshire and back and all flights were excellent - love the not getting upcharged for bags - easy check in - lining up in an orderly fashion to get a seat - wish they flew to O'Hare or I would use them more often
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight to San Jose Costa Rica,"Southwest is an excellent airline if you don't have to fly 1st class. Everyone flies coach on Southwest. I don't need extra legroom, a bigger seat nor a crappy airline meal.  I love that you get 2 stored bags included in the price of your ticket."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Southwest from Cancun,"I don't know if its the airlines fault or the airports fault, but gate assignments at Cancun are often not made until last minute, so expect to be running to your gate.Southwest's system of ""open seating"" is really just a way to get you to pay fee to be in A group.We were ok only because our youngest is 4, so we can board after A group. Still in back of plane, but at least seated together. Flight itself was as expected, seats are tight, but not as bad as some other airlines. Connected and went through Customs in Baltimore, much easier than last trip when we entered US in Newark. Layover seemed unusually long (since another flight from BWI to Albany left an hour before ours)."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,A customer centered airline,"On time, friendly and welcoming personnel made my trip stress-free.   Sry focused on customer service."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Honest straightforward service,"As usual for Southwest, the flight was uneventful.  While Southwest has generous ticket change policies, their early check-in fee is forfeited on changes, so I didn't pay it for this outbound leg.  We ended up at the end of the ""B"" group but still got good seats together. I got early check-in for the return leg."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Fly Funny,Southwest always provides a fun and funny flight. The flight crew commentary is silly but serious. Flying with them is so easy and enjoyable. Wish they would join the other websites so booking would be easier.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent Southwest Flight,This was my 2nd flight with Southwest in a week and I had a great seat section even with a B & C check in letter.  The flight attendant were polite and served us drink and snacks with a smile.  They also checked the our seatbelts were fastened and bags stored under our seats.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Affordable,"My trip was only 1:20 min flight. Affordable  at $65. per flight. Both flights had great staff, and the aircrafts were clean"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Great flight, hospitable staff, great value","Full flight, great experience. One observation though - and this truly comes from the heart - the overhead speaker doesn't project clearly as it is; but then the female attendant was very difficult to understand with her accent. I'm sure she was personable - just very hard to follow her directions and understand what she was saying.  Also, there is absolutely NO LEG ROOM,not to mention tummy room!  My husband is 6'4 and the tray table would only come down one-half way before intruding on his stomach. He could not put it down more than half way - so he couldn't use it at all. It couldn't hold a drink, tablet - nothing!  The wi-fi was out on this flight and unavailable."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Good Tip - Overall.,"All Good - Return flight was rescheduled - rather than a connecting flight was a direct into CLE, no problems."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best Airline Ever!,"We were on time departing and arrived early. The ground crew and the flight attendants were friendly, efficient and fun for such an early flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great service,"Departure was delayed 90 minutes due to late arrival (waiting for de-icing in NYC). Easy boarding. Recommend buying ""Early Bird"" checkin."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Good flight,"This was my first time flying with Southwest, but I don’t think it will be my last.  I loved the 2 free bags, and boarding seemed to flow easier and faster with their system.  Another thing I liked was they have Dr. Pepper available, not just coke and sprite.  I did use the early bird check in."
n/a,50,Great airline ,I fly Southwest regularly.   They are on time friendly and have comfortable seats.  My husband is 6ft 5in. He always has plenty of leg room.   We usually check at least one bag at no extra charge and have carry ons.  The beverage service is good and because I fly with them regularly I get free drinks in the mail to be used on future flights. I have flown other airlines and always come back to Southwest best value and great service.  Never a change or cancel fee and you have until 10 minutes before your flight to make changes. Great air line.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very non-eventful as I like it,Very good flight. Very courteous. We were comfortable the whole trip. The flight was a little bumpy due to the turbulence flying through the rain clouds.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Love SWA,SWA is always great and on time.  I just wish they had more flights to Dallas mid morning that were non-stop.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,GREAT!,Flew on Friday and returned on Sunday.  Both flights landed early and both flights were non-eventful.  Highly recommend Southwest Airlines!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Treated with Kindness,"As per the usual... From check-in to arrival, I was treated with kindness, like one of the family, making sure I felt valued in every interaction.  I go out of my way to fly SWA just for this reason - I know my travel day will be stress free and filled with joy."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,It was amazing,It was great  Smooth flight very friendly crew.loved it.  It was a 53 minute flight.  wonderful people.  will fly Southwest again
Date of travel: January 2020,50,January vacation,The flight was not full.  Plenty of leg room!  Excellent price for this trip.  Makes it even a better savings because of not having to pay to check in luggage.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Airport Nassau, Bahamas","Southwest flight staff did a GREAT job.  It was the Nassau airport that has terrible management skills!!!  Our poor pilot couldn't have been more frustrated.  He had to keep apologizing for our sitting on Nassau tarmac for 1-1/2 hrs.  There was only one lane in and out for planes because of construction. That is ridiculous planning on airport management's part.  This is a top tourist island.  Construction when necessary should be done at night when fewer planes are coming and going.  Of course, we had the same scenario when we flew out of Nassau a week later."
n/a,50,Great flight.,"Wife and i flew from Pensacola to Houston Hobby just for a few days of exploring the area.The trip out from PNS to HOU went perfect.Right on time leaving and even arrived a little early.Southwest planes are clean, comfortable, good snacks, and great flight attendants.Always friendly.No class.  Everyone is the same.Free wi-fii.No charge if you must cancel.Usually, the best deal.Enjoy Southwest."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,I love direct flights,"On 2/23/2020 I took the early flight from Indy to Las Vegas.   Great flight, with good service in flight.   By the time I picked up our bags and got the rental car, we got to the Condos we were staying at before our room was ready, but they let us Check in and told us they would text me when the room was ready.   Then we went to a Sunday Brunch with unlimited mimosas.   Our return flight was also a direct flight from Vegas to Indy.  It’s hard to beat the direct flights to/from Vegas /Indy with Southwest."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"on time,  & reliable.","It was the type of flight everyone hopes for, not too crowded and left on time and arrived on time. This airline allows for boarding based on when you check in online. As a result the boarding process is the best we've encountered with any airline. It's efficient, hassle free and quick. This could also describe how most things occur with Southwest."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Trip to Milwaukee,"I had a short flight to Baltimore, the off to Milwaukee. Both of the flights were very good. I am tall, but had enough leg room. I did have a checked bag. No problems with thay. It went to Milwaukee just like it should."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Excellent Service,Very good flight - excellent service.  Attendants were friendly and the terminal workers were very helpful.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Good flight,"I always fly Southwest and find the airline very reliable.  Flight to BWI was on time and maybe even a few minutes ahead of schedule!  I like not having to pay extra for checked luggage.  If I need to cancel a flight, I receive a credit to use at a later date, no cancellation fees!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good choice for our 3 day weekend trip,"Trip to kids hockey game. Outbound flight had above 40 empty seats which provided a quieter than usual atmosphere, good cabin service. On time arrival. Return flight was full as is usual for Sunday PM flights, still good service and on time arrival."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Not impressed,"Flight cancelled short notice, allegedly due weather Dallas. Rebooked 3.5 hours later, which, since I was already at the airport was a net 5 hour waste of time. Early Bird checkin cannot be carried over from a cancelled flight. I was told it would auto-refund, but this proved not to be true as I had to call and wait 15 minutes to initiate the refund. The boarding process is virtually stupid with free-seating and boarding designations based on an unintelligible algorithm. I will opt for any other airline in future."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good service,"I almost always fly Southwest the last few years. I pay for the upgraded boarding and always have a good flight. They have not been late on a flight in years, and are usually a few minutes early. Service is good, and the seats are reasonably comfortable."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Good Flight Airline,An easy airline to book passage. No problems if your itinerary changes. No extra fees for small bags. Friendly employees. Have no problem with open seating . Do not want to pay any extra for early boarding or seating but also know that their employees will help in any way they can. Only wish they would have more destinations.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Uneventul flight and got in a little early.,Southwest is a great airline to fly.  We do pay extra to get the early boarding but feel that it is worth it.  And we love that we don't pay for bags to be checked.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight to Phoenix,Terrific as always. Great price and on time. What more can you ask for. Great rewards program also. Already booked next flight with them to Detroit.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,An Airline with heart.,"Entering and exiting with ease,Travel personnel outstanding.Drink and snack service excellent.Gate checking was a breeze"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,It’s a great priced airline.,"I was a die hard Delta customer, I never flew other airlines. Delta never missed me! Southwest has communication all the time."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Southwest Flight to Phoenix,"Because of a FLAGRANT DISREGARD for the public, our car rental agency (Ace) “phonies ou” on us, making us spend more than DOUBLE the rate we booked months earlier-at another rental (Budget)! After Budget told us that we would have to have their car back by 9:30 (and not 5 minutes late) or we’d be charged for ANOTHER WHOLE DAY-we were at the Denver Airport 6 1/2 hours early! Our only option to not sitting there ALL DAY, was to catch an earlier flight back to our other home in Phoenix (as we’d done MANY TIMES BEFORE on other airlines! The flight that originally cost us about $80 each, one way, became a $500+ cost to take one of NUMEROUS FLIGHTS all day from DEN to PHX!!? They forced us to sit in their airport ALL DAY, because of this, and then wouldn’t take our luggage so we didn’t have to carry it all over the airport-for like THREE MORE HOURS!!! We were told that there was ample seating any of about 4 flights going earlier, but couldn’t take them earlier!! I’ve done this on nearly every other airline in over 40 years, but not with SW!? Will think twice before I use this one again!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,As usual I love Southwest,Love Love southwest. They are the best always attentive to your needs and quick with the drinks and snacks.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Wish SW had better system for boarding,"Southwest has many great points:  You can check in two free bags and are allowed two carry-ons; they don't charge change or cancellation fees.  They have a decent schedule to Orlando offering 2 or 3 direct flights to Orlando.  (I always try to fly non-stop.).  You can also join their Rapid Rewards Shopping (earn points by ordering through their website) and Rewards for Opinions (completing online surveys).  Both of these allow you to accumulate points you can use to purchase tickets.  And, of course, you can earn frequent flier miles.What I've never liked is the way you board.  24 hours before your flight, you go to their website and they assign you a boarding number (not a seat reservation).  At the airport they board in 3 separate groups.  A group first, B second and C last.  Passengers line up according to their boarding pass number.  That's where the fun begins.  If the plane is packed, the line-up can be annoying.  Some people try to cheat by entering the line ahead of their number.  SW doesn't always catch these cheaters.   You can pay a $15-20 fee for an early-bird check in but that still doesn't get you a reserved seat, just a better position in the queue.  If you could reserve your seat at the time you make your reservation, I would rate SW a 5-star airline."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Gotta love Southwest employees,"Always a pleasure flying Southwest, the entire process is straightforward, friendly & helpful staff."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always a good flight,"We have a Southwest credit card and use our miles as often as we can.  The seats are comfortable and not too close together.  Beverage service is the same as most airlines, but the attendants are very nice."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,direct flight & on time,"was nice flight,... no issues,.... no hassles ......glad they had water, soft drinks available - get combination of water and cran -apple juice to remain hydrated"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Oakland to Ft Lauderdale,I love flying Southwest Airlines when it’s a direct flight.  But this particular trip because they don’t fly direct to Ft. Lauderdale had me stop twice with one plane change before getting to FLL. This was actually the shortest trip of the day to arrive on Monday at a decent hour.   They always arrive early or in time at each stop but it was at least 8 hours of travel to get there.  My alternative would of been to fly out of SFO Which is further away for me to fly another airline to get a non-stop.  I’ll think about doing that next time to shave 2 to 3 hours of travel on the next destination that isn’t nonstop.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Lubbock To Vegas,"I love the fact that there are affordable fairs throughout the day, but mostly the flight that departs and arrives at the same time. Southwest Airlines = LUV"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A little bumpy,"A good flight from Tulsa, OK to Cancun MX with a connection in Houston, TX. On time departures and arrivals with a 1&1/2 layover in Houston. The last hour was a little bumpy due to weather but otherwise perfect flight. As usual Southwest lived up to their usual high standards. Flight attendants we fun and attentive. We will fly Southwest at every opportunity."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Everything went as expected.,Everything was good. The only thing that needed to be better was the clarity and volume of the pilots communication.
n/a,50,Southwest #1,"Southwest is ALWAYS the best! 2 free bags, great crew, on time, clean.  Preferred airline when available. My husband and I both require assistance and we felt like VIPs.  Wish they had more routes. Their tickets may be a little more but worth it."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Clean, comfortable and on time","Southwest Air provides a clean, comfortable and on time service, once again. Boarding is smooth. Wait time for baggage pickup could be shorter."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest Direct Flight,"I took a direct flight from Louisville to Las Vegas and back on Southwest. The flight was wonderful. The attendants were attentive, courteous and helpful. I would highly recommend direct flights!  So much easier than changing flights and enduring layovers!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Not a fan of their boarding & seating procedure.,"I am not a fan of paying for preboarding and then letting anyone that fakes handicapp status by showing  up in a wheelchair (supplied by the airport) board first.   There is just not over a dozen handicapped people on every flight with not apparent handicapp. Also if you arrive late during their boarding procedures,  you're out of luck on seating even if you paid extra."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Easy flight,"I checked in exactly 24 hours in advance and got a low ""B"" boarding number. There were two of us, and we got two great seats together. (The flight was not full, which helped with the seating choices.) We took off on time and landed early. Super start to our vacation."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent flight,"We flew roundtrip from Cleveland to Orlando.  Our flight to Orlando connected through Atlanta.  We had a delay in Cleveland because of weather in Atlanta, but made our connection without any issues.  We were kept up-to-date with flight status.  Comfortable seats and great crew.  We will be flying Southwest for our next trip.  We like the fact that bags fly free."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best Flight I've Ever Been On,"We left on schedule, arrived 30 minutes earlier than expected, and the flight attendants were fantastic.  Nice, smooth ride.This was the first flight that I've been on in a very long time where there was applause during, and at the end of the flight.I would recommend this airline without hesitation."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Always a good experience,"The flight was on time leaving Nashville and reached Baltimore before time. The service is always great.The snack option is only pretzels, which I try to avoid. The peanut option is no longer available."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always love Southwest. The service is always good,Never have to worry about my flight. The service is always good. Only thing I would change is to add more flights over the US
Date of travel: February 2020,40,On time sure helps when you're a little crowded,"On time, checked luggage free (and not lost), a little crowded.  Unlike some, I like the boarding process.  Nuts instead of pretzels would have gotten a 5.   Make sure you download their app before the flight.  The free movies available on the app make the time fly if you can't sleep."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First time flying SW. The best airline I've ever flown hands-down and I will never fly another.,"The service was excellent- they were extremely customer service oriented during the flight and made me feel as though they care about me as an individual during the flight. I'm usually a nervous flyer, however, after telling the flight attendant, she located a seat closer to the front for me (she said it was less bumpy). Although I had booked a flight with two stops (DFW and ABQ) the flights were smooth and the takeoff (my least favorite part of a flight, normally) were extremely easy."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,THE BEST!,"The crew is always considerate and helpful.  First two bags are free and if you have to cancel or change your flight, your fare is either refunded or applied to the change and there is no extra charge for changes.  Also, if you need special assistance, they are very efficient.  I travel alone and I wouldn't fly any other way!"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,4 flights in 10 days,No sign of any of the Corona craziness! Plane felt cleaner than normal. Still way too tight for tall people! If someone was sick there is no personal space.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Long Flight Sacramento / Denver/ LGA 6 hours flying time......OMG!,"Typical long flight West to East - nothing to exciting, plane was 70% full middles seats open for most people -- overall service was good -- everyone on headsets, or watching i-Phones like Robots -- all in a good flight , I was a robot too watched television the entire time......"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love SW,"Consistent... No baggage fee, free cancellation, best fairs around. Why would anyone pay triple and more to fly AA, Delta etc."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Vacation while recovering from surgery,The service was great. I’d just been recovering from hip surgery and was able to get a wheelchair ride through the airport. They were their to escort me when we arrived and were kind and caring.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Southwest Airlines are the BOMB,"Best airline ever. I’ve flown several and Southwest and Delta are the only two that I would recommend. I flew American once and one time was too many. I’ll stick with Southwest. From booking to travel, the are #1."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,"Quiet, Roomy, Comfortable","We flew Southwest to go see our son Marine. The flights were quiet, roomy, and comfortable. The attendants were helpful to get us all to sit together."
n/a,40,SOUTHWEST AIRLINES ,Flight was non-stop from St. Louis to Cancun. It was a pleasurable flight. The total flight from taxi to terminal 4 hours. It gave enough time for a couple drinks and a short nap. Arrived refreshed and relaxed.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Boarded and departed/arrived on time.,"I prefer to fly with Southwest Airlines because of their low fares and allowing two checked bags at no extra cost.  Also, always clean and the flight attendants are always very nice."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest is always awesome!,"I absolutely love Southwest Airlines. I live in Reno, NV so it makes it easy to use. We are going to Baltimore, MD in May and again I am using Southwest. This will be the first time I will have used them to fly that far. We will see how it goes and I will return here to let all of you know. My Mom & I plan to use Southwest when we fly to Hawaii hopefully sometime this year as well. Hope this helps you all! Safe travels!! :)"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,I have lots of Confidence in Southwest,"The flight was delayed for a few hours.  Southwest communicated throughout the multiple times changes.  During the course of the delays, Southwest gave each passenger a $100 Voucher with a 12 month  expiration date.  Southwest is always my 1st choice of Airline and i have no complaints.  There was a delay beyond our control but the voucher sure made it less frustrating and the end of the day."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,No delays,Great airline for the money. no delays. check in on time. I will recommend this airline. the plane is clean with plenty leg room
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Southwest as always is great,"The plane was late for our trip home, delayed. The airline kept us up to date on the status and issued us a $100 voucher without the passengers asking. The crew managed to knock off 30 minutes of the fight time. The cabin staff was typical Southwest Airlines they were great. We only fly Southwest for a reason."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Try to avoid LAX,"My wife and I flew to Cabo in mid September to celebrate one of her girlfriends 50th birthday.We connected in San Diego on the way down, but somehow we had to connect thru LAX on the way home.  I thought I booked San Diego both ways.  I think SW may have needed to change it.  LAX was a nightmare - crowded, under construction and a mile walk to connect to SW after going thru customs.By the way people, HAVE YOUR FORMS FILLED OUT BEFORE GETTING IN LINE instead of when you're at the custom officer's booth.  The number of inconsiderate travelers is unbelievable.Sorry, I digressed - we had a great experience flying SW to Cabo.  The lines at both SMF and Cabo were short to get checked in and the travel was on time.  We plan on flying SW to Cancun in November."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Another Great Flight,We took a direct flight from Pit to Ft. Lauderdale on Feb. 25 and arrived early.  Returned to Pit. on Mar. 6 on another direct flight and arrived 20 min. early.  H
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Relax, it's Southwest","I only fly Southwest for leisure travel. Departing San Diego is so easy, I like to think my vacation starts at the airport. Southwest is laid back like San Diego.  Vs when you arrive at SFO you are in the jungle, big large and a lot of walking.It is always a value proposition of price and comfit on Southwest. Great pricing no seat assignments, relaxed crew, and staff. This  time the seats were well worn, it's ok just about a 90 minute flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,not good,they broke our bag and nobody contacted us. Flight was normal as usual. We travel that route 3 times a year and usually by Delta.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,clean - polite staff,Extremely easy checking of bags and getting tickets at airport.  Very friendly staff especially the gentleman at the self print tickets and bag drop!  TSA went very fast and smoothly at both airports.  Love no fees for luggage!!  Keeps me coming back to Southwest!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great round trip direct flight,Great direct flight. Needed wheelchair and the arranged at both airports. Check ins were fast and efficient. Extremely satisfied.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Holiday in Houston & Dallas, Texas with a Quick trip to Louisiana!","As usual, I booked my flight on Southwest Airlines, one of the most reliable, affordable airlines. With the downgrading of American Airlines, United and others, Southwest (if available,) is the only way to fly. The flight attendants, the schedules and fares fit quick nicely into any budget. Want a cheaper fare-book early. I have always flown Southwest if available and will continue to do so!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,2 free bags!!!!!,"We flew into Hobby Airport, it was such a pleasant flight. Everything went so smooth. Flight attendants were very helpful since we have 2 small children."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Good,"Southwest is great, but I hate the seating situation.  First come first served basis is not good at all.  always have to be scrambling for a seat."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Returning home after Holidays days!,SWA is great in assisting the elderly.  Pre-boarding is heaven sent.  We do take a little longer to settle in and it is so nice not to be rushed and the assistance is greatly appreciated.SWA makes it very easy to travel with an emotional support animal.  (Make sure you have the proper documentation.)Wheel chair assistance is a life saver!THANK YOU SWA!Best service and price!
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Great deal,A great deal for the money. I always manged to get a seat close to the exit day since I travel alone and grab the first available seat.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Fast and Efficient,"My wife and I flew to Houston Hobby airport the first week of February 2020. We were going to visit friends in Louisiana whom we had not seen in several years.Southwest has this down to an art! 24 hours prior to our flight, we did the online check in. That is a great concept!We used the curbside checkin. After passing through security and to our gate, we had about a 20 minute wait until boarding began.We were in Group B and quickly found our place in line.Nobody was shoving or trying to cut in front of anyone (unlike some of the ""other"" discount airlines). The flight itself was uneventful. We downloaded the TV app and were watching movies and live TV the entire trip. That made the time go by faster.When we arrived in Houston, we walked straight to the baggage area and our bag was already on the luggage carousel (talk about quick)!Overall, I love Southwest! I highly recommend using them whenever you can"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,my first flight,it was a great flight.  scary. we took off in a storm. the flight attendants were awesome. kept us informed. and were very very nice.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flying a basic flight,"What can I say? If you want to fly ""on time"", and with little to zero interruptions (while you're trying to catch a quick nap), the thoughtful and incredible stewards or stewardess's will definitely go out of their way to check back with you to see if your ready for a drink or a snack,when and if they see your eyes open! Always my 1st choice when available!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always A Pleasurable Flight,From checking in to landing both ways our flights were fantastic. We always have a great experience with Southwest.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Airline needs to be stricter with people bringing 2 LARGE carryons apiece,"There was probably at least 20 teenagers ahead of me in line to board plane-They all had huge carryon and in addition a bigger bag with their squash equipment and were allowed to board with all this=Due to this the last 25 or so passengers could not bring their small carry on, but had to check it=Mine would have even fit under the seat,but the employee was so frustrated by then that he wouldn't let me-I have put this same bag under the seat for years- and did so on the flight back-These kids were in the front of the plane and some of their luggage was in the back of the plane-I have seen this on all my flights lately, but this was the worst-The employee who checked our bags at the plane was very rude, but all the others were very nice and friendly.  All airlines, but especially southwest needs to be MUCH stricter on number and size of carryons.  The ridiculous thing is that carryons can be checked for free with Southwest.  The rude employee was a man at the gate when boarding on 2/20/2020 flight number 729."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Typical flight,Free bags and the service was acceptable. The baggage agent let us sneak through a bag that was just over weight. The waiting area was typical airport. Service was standard SW.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,A great trip!,"A great flight there and back; found a smoking area, had a drink, good day! Sure wish they went to Sarasota, but we rented a car and it all worked out."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Destination Paradise,We have been flying on Southwest from Islip to West Palm Beach for over 15 years. We have never had a bad experience.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Always the best service and care,"Flights are reasonable, crew so friendly, most of the time you can change flights at no charge. Two bags free now who does that. With this virus thing going around they texted me to tell me that they are taking this very seriously and go into details. That is awesome, don't you think?"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Ripped Off!!!!!!!!!!!!,Made reservations for my son to visit.  With the virus situation we attempted to cancel the flights but were told that we will not get our money back on a travel credit good for 1 year.  After the year we lose the money.  What idiot and hartless fool made this policy
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Uneventful flight - just the way I like it!,Sunday afternoon flight. Boarded quickly and left on time. I checked in exactly 24 hours before and got a B3 place in line. Found a up-front window seat and was able to stow my bag right above me. Smooth flight and we landed on-time. Will definitely fly with SW again!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Im not a fan of the loading process with them because they are no longer a low cost carrier so why put yourself through,See above. Im not a fan of Southwest because what made them affordable no longer applies. With enough notice I can fly Delta for the same money and get many more perks.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Southwest has become my go-to airline,"Okay, Southwest doesn’t reserve seats, but their seating system is solid and doesn’t play favorites.  I have long legs and my derrière is, well, wider than Delta’s 14” seats.  Southwest gives me at least 3” in the leg room and enough to contain my hind end in their  seats.Southwest’s flight crews are consistently pleasant and competent in the safety department- that is why they are there... not to fetch food and drinks, although they do that with much grace and humor.  Kudos to ANY flight attendant.Nearly always on time, and arrival times are never tweaked to make them look better.Go with Southwest Airlines..."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The Southwest Experience,Our experience with Southwest was very cool laid back flight. Cheap compared to other airlines flying to New Orleans. We didn’t have to pay any extra fees which was pretty cool overall.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest Airlines in every airport,"Southwest is the best by far. I just wish they flew in most airports, like Columbia, SC. I always try to fly Southwest whenever possible. We have the Chase Southwest credit card and we collect points every month. Pays for itself in no time."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Leisure trip to PHX,Southwest makes it easy and affordable to travel.  Our flights were direct with no delays. The crew were friendly. In-flight entertainment was free.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest puts the Customer First,"I am constantly impressed with Southwest Airlines customer service.  Their planes are usually on time & clean. The biggest difference between Southwest Airlines and other airlines is their wonderful personnel.  Their personnel from the gate to the pilots make you feel that you matter. They also, all seem to smile more than the other airline personnel.  They know how to do things right."
n/a,50,Awesome as always!!,My family flew from Houston to Atlanta for a cheer competition. Booking our flight was easy. Check-in 24 hours prior to our flight was easy. We had great seats towards the front of the plane. The flight attendants were very friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend Southwest airlines.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,4-hour flight and no food service,"Considering that this flight originated at 4:45 PM, and was scheduled for just under fours of flight time, I was surprised that the only food item served was a small bag of cheesy crackers ... there were no food options ... to purchase or otherwise."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great quick flight,Arrived in Little Rock early which is always nice! The airline might not be the fanciest but the flights are efficient & usually take off on time & land on time.  I fly them frequently due to cost & flights.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Experience & Value,"We flew out of San Jose, CA to Kona, HI in December on Southwest.  The flight left on time, arrived ahead of schedule, had plenty of room, snacks and entertainment options, and as always with Southwest, excellent customer service.  And the price couldn't be beat! Highly recommend flying Southwest anywhere, but specifically on these new Hawaii routes."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,To the land of the sun and back,"Southwest is always a great way to fly.  2 free bags and timely flights, even when they have to de-ice the plane the pilots push the ""gas pedal"" down and get us to Phoenix only 5 minutes late!!!  Of course, they are also on time bringing us back to 20 degrees and snow!!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Ms,The flight crew is the best.  They were very helpful and I loved how they were checked on all the  passengers
Date of travel: January 2020,50,save money fly comfortably,Love flying southwest! I can pick my own seat; I don’t have to pay for my first 2 checked bags!! and who can forget free snacks and drinks!! If you fly enough (one way) you receive drink vouchers and for someone who likes to go to take advantage of a good deal I like to use my vouchers to get the party started before landing!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Only Southwest,"Besides saving $100's on bagage fees, Southwest won't leave you trapped on the tamarack for hours like AA.  We only fly 4 to 5 times a year, and weare almost always  been on time or early."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Customer friendly,"Bags go for free no additional charge, seats are find where you like once you board. Prior to boarding you line up in very organized lines basis ABC you can pay additional fee of 20 dollars to board in early A group. Each group has 1-30 places. Seems very organized I like the earlier boarding so always pay the 20 dollars when I book. Flight attendants are very customer friendly and all employees very helpful."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Loving the beach,When going on a trip Southwest is the only way to fly. Free bag in free carry on. Employees are always smiling and friendly. Can't wait to sit on the beautiful sandy beach in Bonita springs Florida.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Can’t Ask for More,"A fair price for round trip, direct flight, clean plane and on time service. Crew was friendly and polite.  Pretty good value!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,My Flawless Flight on SWA,"My SWA was absolutely flawless, an on-time departure and an on-time arrival. No drama, no chaos even with all of the Coronavirus hoopla, everything went smoothly. SWA is always hassle-free & I fly this airline whenever possible."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Awesome service,This was my first time ever flying! Great experience with southwest! Will definitely use again! I definitely recommend!!!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Big Island Vacation,"Loved that Southwest is now flying to Hawaii—especially happy that they service Hilo.The price was great, flight was good."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,2 great flights,Went to Florida and came back after 2 weeks on vacation. Southwest is the best. I know you don’t get an assigned seat but the airline is great. All flights left on time and all arrived EARLY at destination. Staff very friendly and caring. No long wait for luggage after flight landed. Seats are comfortable. Will always fly southwest if possible. I suggest that if you plan to fly more than 1-2 times a year that you go to the TSA and get a precheck number. That way you can avoid the long lines at the airports.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flew for vacation,Southwest is always easy to board. I love their style of boarding where there is no assigned seat. You just board per your boarding letter and select any seat available. The attendants are always nice. They also have good snacks on board.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight from Denver to Cincinnati was very comfortable,"Flying on Southwests 737-800 to Cincinnati on 2/20/20 had so much more room than any flight I have been on with the big airlines like American, United, etc. Attendants treat you so very nice, also."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,a mess at the airport,total disaster with boarding.  Southwest is a great low cost airline but the cattle herding mentality is horrible.  I will not fly this airline again.  They had to shuttle us to the gate so no boarding process except if you were on the first bus. Which I missed by 2 people.  Don't really care that much but everybody saves seats now.  The last flight we had one person save a whole row. I'm A42 and my wife was A41.  Don't know why we pay for 2 early birds check ins when every seat in the first 10 rows are saved. Like the free checked bags and change fees but I would like to pick my seat and not be herded into the plane.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Poor Customer Service,"I booked flights to Orlando for the HIMSS20 convention with Southwest for the first time and paid for the Early Bird check-in.  HIMSS20 cancelled the convention due to the Conronavirus.  SouthWest would not refund my early bird check-in fees.  I did not cancel the convention, it is a world wide health issue and there is zero compassion from this organization.   This will be the last time Southwest gets any money from me. Will not recommend this airline to anyone ever."
n/a,50,Best Airline Flying,Flew in from KC to Pensacola for a vacation. This is the best airline flying. The staff is very friendly and attentive. We were in and out of Pensacola airport in no time on our way to the beach. Would definitely recommend to fellow travelers.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nice Flight,"Check in was quick and easy. Flight was comfortable. Online App was great. Service was good and arrived on time. Only draw back, bags were delayed both ways."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Still cramped but all in all, worth it","I last reviewed Southwest in 2017 and I don't have a lot to change. I flew Southwest for years while I was working and this was third leisure trip on Southwest since retiring.  Plus, we've taken two other airlines since for leisure trips and the costs weren't worth what you get.  Same things as last time: TSA Pre-check, so security at the airports are so much less hassle. Paying for automatic check-in and priority seating on Southwest really really can't be beat.  The other airlines we flew had all sorts of add-ons that really increased the cost without that much of a benefit.  For instance, $60 to check each bag on another airline, which we had to do because one wasn't a carry-on.  And when you're traveling for a week, I can't shove everything I need into a carry on bag; I know my wife can't. And finally the ease of use of the Southwest app on our phones was great.  Boarding passes, and communication on flight status and so on.The less than great aspects remain what I had said before: its still flying on a bus in seats designed for pygmies. But all airplanes are mostly the same anymore, unless you can pay an additional amount for first class.  Seems I can find a better way to spend that kind a money for a two hour flight.  And again, Southwest cabin crews are the friendliest I've encountered. They are helpful, and seem to understand that, if you had your preference, you'd rather have a whole row to yourself, so they seem to care a bit more than other airline crews.So, I recommend Southwest, I prefer Southwest, and I'm sorry it doesn't go everyplace I'd like to go."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Worth 3 1/2 Hour Drive  to FLY ❤️ SOUTHWEST,"I had not flown Southwest Airlines in a while. I was pleasantly surprised that the excellent flight experience and customer service has not changed!  Here’s what I mean:** User Friendly** 1 or 2 bags checked FREE** No charge to exchange tickets** Safe, easy flying."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,only south by Southwest,This airline has their customers in mind. No baggage fee for two checked bags. We flew from Las Vegas to Dallas and then four days later on Southwest as well. Both links were suburb. We were coming off flights from Bangkok and had lots of luggage. Boarding is easy and well defined. No pushing and shoving for seats.Clean environment in the airplane itself and the personnel are very communicative and helpful. Fly Southwest whenever we can have a choice.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Another great flight,"I always fly Southwest whenever possible.  In all my years of flying I have not found a more perfect airline and one that is concerned about the passengers.  The boarding is fast, simple and organized.  The flight staff is friendly and professional and goes out of their way to make their passengers comfortable.  The flights are always on time unless mother nature decides differently....Flights are smooth and comfortable.  I respect the fact that they board the military and families with small children first then the passengers that need assistance.  The staff is always willing to help any passenger and always help with a smile on their face.  If the staff has knowledge of a birthday, an anniversary or any special occasion of the passengers it is recognized while on the flight  which I find very admirable. You are always greeted with a smile both while boarding and upon reaching your destination.  Although they don't offer lunches or food any longer (neither do other airlines except on very long flights) they do provide small packs of snacks and beverages. They are the only airline that does not charge for baggage (2 bags and a carry on) or to change your flight which is a plus. The website is very easy to navigate and the telephone agents are always friendly and willing to help.  I have never felt safer than on a Southwest flight and will only fly Southwest whenever possible.  I just wished that they flew everywhere."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best Domestic Airline - no contest!,"From the purchase of your ticket to the time you deplane are your destination, you are treated like a valued client.  Their website is easy to use to book any flight, changed or cancel a flight and at no time are you penalized for making a change or cancelling a flight. WOW, what a difference from the clowns that run American, Delta, and so many other airlines.  Southwest competitors rope you into a “low” ticket price and give you NOTHING for it.  With Southwest I am not charged for my bags, any seat, or cancellation.  The airline staff are friendly and professional. When you add it up Southwest IS the LOW COST QUALITY AIRLINE, period."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Direct Flight,Southwest Airline is my first choice whenever possible. Getting a direct flight is always a plus. I like the fact they don’t charge for the first checked bag. I even like the “cattle call” boarding procedure even if it seems like I always get toward the end of the line!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Get early boarding!,"This was the first time we took Southwest on longer than an hour long flight. We were thankful we brought snacks and sandwiches because at 5 hours, you can only eat so many airline snacks. It was a bumpy flight but the crew was excellent. They were courteous and informed. If you want to get a decent seat and overhead space for your luggage, you have to get early boarding to have a chance. We lucked out having 3 seats to ourselves but there are lots of families flying with kids. We use over the ear sound canceling headphones so that helps. You can't go wrong with the economical travel on this airline, but if you need want more attention, you pay for it by traveling on another airline."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best Airline in USA,"I love Southwest they are by far the best airline in our Beautiful United States. From booking online which is so easy, no time outs or annoying hassles. To the checkin friendly counter staff, always helpful happy and a big 😊 Easy to check your bag if that’s what you are doing. The departure gate area is well organized. Scan you boarding pass in 1 second and get onboard. The service onboard is always 1st class. We’ve never had a bad flight🤞 Nice and clean planes. No fuss. takeoff is on time I’ve never been late. Their app is awesome to watch a movie whilst flying.The people around you are even happy and friendly.I wish I could upload a video I took on our flight to Denver from Austin. As we were getting ready to land this stewardess sang us all a song “ You are my sunshine” she had a beautiful voice it was really nice. Everyone was cheering afterwards and thanking her. It made everyone’s day.  I also just got one of their credit cards. So will rack up more miles. ❤️ ✈️  This photo is me! Did this for a laugh as the corona virus 🦠 is starting to spread 😜🤪🦠"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Hawaii in February,"Chicago (Midway) to Burbank Ca. , to Oakland to Honolulu Back to Oakland to Chicago Midway.  The flight crews were very nice and attentive to all passengers.  Coming home, (Oakland to Chicago), there was very low cloud coverage.  An  instrument landing was needed and performed very well.  I did not see the ground until we were about to touchdown. ""Great pilot(s)"".  Love Southwest  hope they will soon go to Knoxville."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,The Airline Best for Economically Minded Travelers,"Perhaps my last review for SWA because it has outperformed all US Domestic economy airlines consistently for many years. Flight was easy to book,easy to change at no extra cost if I so desired , 2 Free bags for checking plus  generous carry on policy, most competitive pricing of all Domestic airline, good rewards ,clean and comfy planes and more. See why I won’t review anymore. They are the best!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest flight home from Cancun,"Face it, there are those that Love Southwest Airlines and those that don't.  We  Love the airline.  Our flight was like most we take on Southwest, uneventful and as pleasurable as flying can be these days.  One of the things that always stands out to us about Southwest is the friendly (sometimes jovial) attitudes of the airline's employees.  Their frequent flyer program is the best.  We travel enough to qualify for the free companion status in the program and I believe it is the best value in the business."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Another good flight,"On time late in the day - good service - good work! Thanks!BUt, landed way out there so it was a long way and it seemed to take forever for our bags to arrive.Why were the women in 26 D allowed to keep her very large carry on in the aisle - it didn't fit under the seat in front of her. They are there for our safety?"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,ANother full flight - no one was coughing,"Got an empty seat beside me - that's the best seat in the ""house"" Good crew and one of the attendants thought he was funny - not so much but that's OK.On time flight late in the day - that's good service."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Seems that Southwest is the best US airline today,"Full flight, lots of families who get boarded prior to those of us who paid extra for early seating.Why were those women allowed to have their bags, coats and back packs in the aisle the entire flight? Safety?"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Good flight,"All went well, full flight - we paid extra and got ""B"" seating - with access after all of the families and kids that didn't pay the extra $100, that seems unfair relative to our extra cost."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Comfortable experience,"We like the Early Bird check in. You pay a couple of dollars more, but you don't have to worry about getting online to check in. You get a good boarding spot. We like to sit in the emergency rows for the extra leg room."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Always polite, fly 2-3 times a week over 12 states.",Southwest gets me to my Destination the majority of the time!  Dallas departures so-so. The Stewardess always greets with a smile and acknowledges me boarding and leaving the plane.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Value,Very efficient attendants both at check-in and on the plane. Made me feel safe and comfortable. The plane was clean.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Economy Way to Fly!!!,"We have flown Southwest Airlines several times.  The most recent trip was to Las Vegas and last one to Reno, NV.  Southwest is very comfortable and allows two bags to be checked free.  Seats are not assigned but is a first come basis.  Both of our trips were nonstop flights.  Easy trips.  The flight was canceled but rescheduled on the Reno flight unbeknownst to our party of four.  Seems the 3rd party we booked our reservations with didn’t notify us of the change. However, Southwest gave all four of us meal vouchers for the delay and in the end we were given $200 vouchers each, which we used later on the Las Vegas trip.  Was perfect.  I always come out better price wise, considering bag fees are not charged.  Will continue to fly Southwest when I can."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Flight great, problems in Oakland airport!","I love Southwest! Have used Southwest for years!  So glad they now have service to the Hawaiian Islands.  Great flight from Kona to Oakland. However, we arrived at 11:45 PM, had a 5 hr layover, and had to leave the secured area, claim our bags and spend time in hell (baggage claim area) only to check our bags and go through security again at 3:45 AM!  Horrible. I am not one to ever complain, but if the Hawaiian flights arrive at this hr, there needs to be another process/area in place as to not have to claim bags, sleep in baggage claim, and check in again.  If this is the rule, we definitely will not fly on Southwest to and from Hawaii again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Quicker than usual!,"Great service and less people than usual because snowbirds went to Florida in January. Empty middle seat was a treat!  Ordered tomato juice light on the ice and it was perfect. Brought my own sandwich!  We landed early and the flight’s take-off and landing went smoothly. Southwest is a great airline!   Would not consider changing to the “other” company that flies out of Islip, that has a low starting price, but “nickels and dimes” you for every little thing."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great customer service,"Best customer service.  Willie was an amazing flight attendant.  Stories, singing, jokes, and great customer service.  Will definitely fly southwest again."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great service,Flight attendants were friendly and attentive.  Service provided was excellent.  Pilots kept passengers informed.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,whenever I can,"Whenever I fly no matter where it is, if I have the opportunity to take Southwest Airlines, I always try to make a reservation with them. They are courteous, kind, baggage is free, and usually always fairly priced."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very good Flight,Flight boarding was on time and efficiently done.  Flight crew was friendly and provided great service.  Captain would give us updates but the sound system was not good so we didn't understand him when he spoke to us.   Cabin service was very good.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First time in over 10 years I’ve flown with stress on an airplane,"Southwest Airlines was absolutely amazing and crew, from the ticket counter to the baggage handlers and pilots were great!....the gate supervisors from Portland ME and also at our 2 hr layover in Baltimore were very respectful and were very clear with there directions. I personally loved the way they took there time to ensure every passenger was in the correct line that associated with there ticket number and group. I wanted to share this with everyone because in today’s world of airlines WE the passengers feel like most of the airlines don’t care, and  we are just cattle that they are herding  from one place to another and our individual needs and wants that we pay a good price for isn’t on the top of there list. Thank you!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Vegas to Work, is still VEGAS!",Southwest hardly ever disappoints. Make sure you get the early bird check-in... it’s worth every dollar!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,On vacation,We really like this airline.  In Minneapolis it flies out of the Humphrey terminal which is a much nicer experience as far as i am concerned.  The airline is great on taking care of us while in the air.  Passenger loading is different when loading by asigned groups but it works and loading is fast.  Seating is ok as it is on any airiine today.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Horrible policies,"My husband and I spent $350 on a round trip flight. We ended up needing to cancel half of the round trip. We used $48 in travel funds from a previously canceled flight and $150 from our credit card to pay for the flight. The expiration date for the $48 is June 13, 2020. Rather than creating a new travel fund for the $150, all $198 now expire in June. They won’t split the funds into two different vouchers, so if we don’t use the money by June we lose all of it. Additionally, we can’t spend the money before June for a flight that leaves in August. We have to book a flight that leaves before June 13th to count. This is absolutely ridiculous. The woman that I spoke to tried to say “if you used another airline they wouldn’t have given you anything, and there would have been a fee to cancel the flights” This is not true. I used American Airlines for a flight last summer and I canceled my flight and they issued me a full refund for a non-refundable ticket. I will NOT be using Southwest again. Horrible customer service and policies."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Orlando to Buffalo flight was terrific,"I tried a few airlines in the last few years trying to save money and still get something that resembled service. Most of those failed !! I went back to Southwest Airlines and came away pleasantly surprised. We took a late flight out of sunny Orlando knowing that Buffalo  was cold and snowy. The crew was pleasant and as always thorough. The flight left on time and it was a wonderful clear night. Drinks were served promptly and efficiently. We happened to notice a particularly bright star in the sky and curiosity got the better of  us. So we asked Jeremy if he might check with the pilot . Jeremy came back with his cell phone and pin pointed Venus for us. Jeremy stayed a moment and we just chatted. He found out about my wife's illness and about 30 minutes later returned to our seats and presented my wife with a Southwest napkin in the shape of a flower. My wife was so touched by this gesture that she has put it in a special place among her collectibles. We may never meet Jeremy again, but would like Southwest Airlines to know that if we are flying and Southwest serves our destination. It will be our airline of choice. They have never lost our luggage, they are helpful with my wife's health concerns and they make the flight pleasant. I really don't know what more you could ask for. Thank you for listening."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Direct flight/Great service,"A direct flight both ways on our Key West vacation made for an enjoyable post flight experience.  Helpful reservation and check-in personal, baggage arrived with each leg of our trip and flight attendants that care about their job.  A wonderful experience.  The best airline for domestic travel that I have found."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,I dont leave bad reviews but Southwest deserves it.,"I've never been so pissed of by a company in my life. Trying to use credits from a previously cancelled flight with them is a total joke. It took us hours on the phone for them to even get the money attached to our account. Then We tried to use our credits to get a flight on march 3rd because they said they would expire march 3rd and then when we were trying to book them they said we had to use them BEFORE the 3rd! 24 hours and we would be out hundreds and they wouldn't work with us AT ALL! That pretty much what I've realized. They just wont work with you. They dont care if you are getting screwed. Unless you are a priority flyer this company doesnt give a crap about you and will treat you as such. I dont know when companies stopped being customer service based, but I've never worked with more incompassionate people."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Very Nice Flight,Very nice flight.  Left on time and landed about 20 minutes early.  The captain kept us apprised of our progress coming into Manchester.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Quick trip to Nashville,The flight from New Orleans to Nashville is very short (55 minutes to 1 hour 5 minutes) of flying time. The Nashville airport looks a lot like the old New Orleans airport as far as decor and food choices go. We flew business select and my only complaint is letting parents with children under 12 boArding before the Business Select as we ended up in row 8 and our group was A3. We were traveling with a 7 year old and parties with children closer to 10-12 years old should  board after the A group in my opinion. I understand handicapped and newborns or under 3 years old needing extra time... other than that it was an easy quick weekend getaway!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Super Southwest,On time. Great flight attendants. Easy on and off!  Loved the Southwest app. Texting while on the way made it great.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,February trip,"So many good things about Southwest. Pick your seat, two bags free plus’s carry on, pricing lower then everyone other then Spirit. Also WiFi!However there sit anywhere does have some down side. Many, many pre boards and half the people getting it look in pretty good shape. Flight attendants could care less about people saving seats for others and it’s so obvious but they won’t get involved. Although it’s fun to watch people and all the little ways they save the seats, some pretty comical."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Best Airline,"This is by far my favorite airline for many reasons.  Wonderfully friendly personnel, affordable prices, luggage flies free, no fee for necessary flight changes, good on-time record, outside check in, ability to use accumulated points, etc.  We go SW often from Reno and have never had a bad experience.  Safety first."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Salt Lake City,Have been a Southwest Airline customer for years. It is a great low cost airline. All of the employees are always friendly and helpful.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,RSM meeting,The day of departure the weather in ATL was stormy with heavy rain.  Pilot did a great job the flight was fairly smooth and on time!
n/a,30,I guess I don't see what all the fuss is about,"I don't fly Southwest much, but have had a couple opportunities to lately.  I don't see what all the fuss is about.  Do not like the boarding set up, I like to board late, who wants to sit on a plane longer than they have to.  I have a free bag through the frequent flier program on my airline.  The flight is pretty much the same as others, hence the average rating."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Great airline for getting it done, no matter what.","My original flight was cancelled due to weather in Denver, but the gate agent got me on a different flight only 45 min. later.  There was an issue of being double billed for my original flight and the new one that the gate agent put me on, but one call to customer service got everything straightened out.  While many people complain about service, Southwest always gets it right if you ask."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Yeah!! Loved the flight from Hawaii!,"Finally Southwest has shown up on Hawaii Islands and loved them flying in and out of Hilo! Our flight was on time, comfortable and easy.  Flights are resonably priced. We were cleaning out a storage and had multiple containers of items, the extra charges were not huge and the customer service at check in was outstanding from Oakland. 2 free checked bags is an extra bonus."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Is this seat saved?,"I luv SWA. Its my go-to airline for domestic travel - I appreciate their ""Bags Fly Free"" policy - as I often travel with lots of toiletries and shoes. I am a tall person - so I covet the row of seats (Exit Row) mid-cabin that feature a bit of extra legroom. Its worth paying the ""Early Bird"" fee for me - so that I have a good chance of traveling in one of those seats. On this flight, another traveler (of smaller stature) blocked an entire side of the row for their party that was yet to board. While I'll say ""YES"" to am I prepared to assist in the event of an emergency - I think SWA should say ""NO"" to travelers who block others from sitting in these seats. First come, first served, one seat per passenger should be the SWA policy for the Exit Rows."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Our 2 flights on Southwest. Airlines,"We were flying from Florida to Puerto Rico in route to a cruise.  Unfortunately we missed our flight and had to secure a later flight. The reservations persons were so helpful. The flight attendants we encountered were wonderful!  The  SouthWest  employees always appear to be happy, and willing to help.  It’s my favorite airline for numerous reasons. The airfares are very competitive, and the fact they don’t charge an extra exorbitant amount for luggage is a great bonus!  The company is doing a fine job addressing customer service, and apparently their employees  too. If not it would be reflected   in their attitudes. I’ve witnessed very unhappy employees on other airlines."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,LAST MINIUTE BUSINESS MEETING,"I enjoy flying Southwest. I never have any issues and they personnel is always very nice. I love that my bags fly for free, super amazing."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flying to Miami via Ft.Lauderdale,best way to get to Miami but beware of crazy traffic when you get into Miami. Worst traffic I've ever been in. New York or Chicago of the south...
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Smooth flight,"Seating was the only thing that could improve. This was an older looking plane and seats look,felt tired and worn."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Awesome airline,"I was a die hard United customer for 20 years until their prices became out of control. I have received better service in the 2 years with Southwest than my previous airline. The few hiccups I have had were handled quickly and inexpensively. The employees truly do seem happier and very pleasant. Actually had a delayed/rerouted flight and the airline gave a voucher for the inconvenience, United had NEVER offered that, I am a lifer now."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Easy trip non-stop,First time flying Southwest and was pleasantly surprised.  We did the Early Bird and it was a breeze.  Worth the extra $  You can't beat a direct flight!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flying home for a visit,"The flight was fine. It would be nice to know if the people wearing masks are sick, or just taking precautions. Perhaps the airline should pre-screen these folks given what is going on in the world. People have a right to wera masks and other passengers have the right to perhaps not take that flight if people are indeed ill.."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Flying Southwest - You are now free to move about the country,"My wife and I have flown Southwest Airlines several times and we enjoy the 'pick your seat' while boarding.  Have never had an issue with the airlines, except no drink service during stormy weather, as expected.  No initial baggage fee for initial bag, plus free carry on and one personal item, that fits on the floor beneath the seat.  The flight attendants have all been professional, but funny, and the overall experience is a laid back trip. We have looked at other economy airlines, but we still choose to fly Southwest when we can."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always a great flight,"Southwest is always a reliable and affordable airline. They are comfortable, courteous and almost always ahead of schedule. We do 95% of our travel on Southwest and love the service they provide!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Early morning!,"Even though it was early morning and the plane was FULL, we had an enjoyable flight. We weren't together, but were close and we didn't mind, as it was a non-stop flight. The take-off and landing were smooth and the flight was without turbulence. The flight attendants were helpful and friendly."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Uncle Bruce's 90th Birthday,"Wonderful as always flying with SWA round trip.  Return trip was especially delightful because I flew with my celebrating Uncle Bruce and my Aunt Charlotte to their destination  Omaha before carrying on to San Jose, CA. Extended our visit and celebration!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"Afternoon flight from San Francisco, CA to Los Angeles, CA",The boarding process went smoothly. There was no assigned seating. The aircraft had 6 across seating with comfortable enough seats for the 1 hour flight. There was adequate legroom. There was no entertainment provided. The flight arrived on time. The good news is that the flight was inexpensive. The bad news is that it was a no frills flight. I would not want to be with them for anything much longer than one hour.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Best overall flight deal,"With the 2 free checked bags and low fares, I still think this is the best airline deal out there considering the flight selection.    Some of the other budget airlines look cheaper until you add up all the extra fees and options, and their limited flight options. There are a couple things I don’t like about Southwest: that ridiculous line up boarding (they must have used the Stick Family to space their posts); and I’d like to see them expand their routes to additional cities.  But other than that, they are the airline for me. The flights to Houston were pleasant, on-time, and comfortable."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Travel time to Mouse House,Having a great time in central Florida due to its ease of travel from home to a destination enjoyed by many. World class service is something to expect in Orlando due to the many attractions including easy access to Atlantic and Gulf. The fact that Southwest offers direct flights has made this a go to over other locales. Its frankly a bus. 2 and a half hours and you are there. But now there is competition with better in flight entertainment and leg room and its is JET BLUE. Similar pricing means Southwest has to up its service. Its that simple. They can't rest on their laurels.
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Poor service and delay due to gate being occupied on landing: No plan B,"Well I've never been delayed because an airline couldn't plan and organize a gate entry until now. Another plane was still at gate and even though there were obviously empty gates, we got to sit on plane for extra 30 minutes because they didn't have a back up plan. The flight attendants were the most unfriendly crew I have ever seen on a Southwest flight, obviously annoyed they had to work today. Usually my experience has been great and they go out of their way to make it fun, even entertaining but this flight from Tampa to New Orleans was a dud. Prefer others."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The Essential SWA,"Southwest is my go-to airline these days.  There’s no airline that’s close to perfect but southwest is so dependable.  All flights are about the same except for length and there are no surprises - except maybe an extra bag of peanuts or pretzels once in a while.  .  They do the people, product, and price balancing act better than the competition and provide the best consistent value for my airline dollar."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Just a hint less than their usual EXCELLENT service,"As a frequent and loyal SWA flyer, I am usually appreciative of the entire process, especially the friendliness of the flight attendants.  This was mostly a staging flight at the end of the night.  It was a 2100 departure with a 2300 arrival on 2/24/2020 with 17 passengers.  I was load zone A-16 and due to weight and balance we could not sit aft of aisle 12, no problem.  I spoke with one flight attendant who interpreted me as challenging her but I was simply making conversation and quickly took a seat.  I tried to emphasize through more conversation that I was just conversing but maybe caught her at a down moment.  Another flight attendant was outstanding and very friendly.  I initially gave a very good rather than excellent rating but upgraded it as I have had so much success with SWA that I decided it wasn't fair to hit a mark lower because of one instance.  I continue to be a loyal guest."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight- on time for take off and landing,"We flew nonstop and it was a great flight.  We did purchase the early bird seating to be able to get the A boarding.  The snacks are just ok - no almonds or nuts, just pretzels and cheez its."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Plane seats are getting smaller,"i only fly once every couple of years. This time, I was on a newer 737-800.  Compared to the older 737s the seats were very narrow and I felt squished next to a normal sized adult.  And, i couldn't get the seat back to recline - they may have removed this option in this plane. The Service was as usual with nuts/cookies being served. There was only one beverage service .  The plane was full both ways and they asked for people to check bags as there wouldn't be enough overhead space. Flight went off without a hitch."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flawless,"Everything was flawless. Check in at kiosk, baggage check, seating, etc. Free checked bags. On time or early. We bought ($20 each per flight) the early bird check in, which gave us mid-level A boarding, so we got some real  nice seats.I do wish All airlines would enforce the carry on baggage rules (Max. size and qty)"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Quickly Becoming a Fan,"I typically to go thru Expedia to get the best flight prices, dates, and times.  I forgot about Southwest because they don't show up on that site.  At least I don't remember them being an option.  I like the simplicity of dealing with Southwest.  They don't charge for the first checked bag and you line up and get your place on the plane.  No more of this jockying for position when they call your group number, like other airlines.Their seats recline, unlike Spirit's seats."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Luggage weight problem,"I came home after a months traveling abroad. My luggage came through 4 countries several times without any problem of over weight. San Fransico was my port of entry and my last flight was on Southwest from San Fransisco to Phoenix, Arizona. Suddenly my luggage was over weight and I had to pay $75 for an overweight suitcase.  How is this possible? 4 countries, several flights, never a problem in a month and then suddeny a problem with Southwest. This is not acceptable. I did contact Southwest Airlines (SR2313410768610) and got a lame excuse about free checked bags as long as it is not overweight and that it is easier to lift 2 bags of 30 pounds as 1 opposed to 60pounds. Mine wasn't even near 60 pounds. The fact that it was never overweight throughout our trip and then suddenly on the last leg it is, seems fishy to me and as I did not have a saying in this trip as it was part of a package I wil defnitely think twice before flyng with Southwest again."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,unsafe to fly,Flight attendants ignored a passenger being bullied and threatened on board a plane. They made fun of her situation and ignored her call for help.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,On to California,"The flight left Vegas at 7 am ... and on time.  It was a full flight and in typical Southwest style we boarded by section and numerically.  This is actually OK, since you don't feel like you are bring herded into a gate chute like cattle."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Disappointing Flight,"Was very disappointed that the airlines was not taking precautions with the recent outbreak of Coronvirus, and the Flu, there were no precautions taken!  On both flights there were multiple children and adults coughing non-stop.  There should have been masks available and given to theses people!  We were in an enclosed area for 3 hours with air recirculating.    I know money is business, but safety of your passengers should come first.  Airlines and all businesses that provide services for a large group of people should follow the CDC guideline!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Great flight, big savings","My wife and I ALWAYS fly Southwest Airlines when we can (domestic flights) and have been VERY satisfied with the price and service. They are convenient, friendly, helpful, and courteous."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"My Trip To Denver, CO",I really enjoy flying with Southwest Airlines. I have to go here twice a year for our meeting. Great service and great airline personnel. Can't wait for my next flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Southwest is in the middle of the pack,"Their prices aren't super competitive like they used to be. In comparing them to the legacy carriers, I'm paying about the same as Delta, United, American.I will say that they are much better than the crappy discounters like Spirit, Frontier or Alegiant but that's a pretty low bar."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always our first choice,"A great airlines!!!! Exceptional customer service, kind flight attendants, and willingness to put the customer first whenever possible."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,United Airlines,"My kids live in San Diego, make the trip about 2 to 3 times a yr, NEVER a problem! Flew to Disney World in Fla, worst experience in my life. Took from 6 am  to 10:30 at night.  Sat in fla at airport for hours.  Because of weather and over booking. I flew to Miami direct going. But went from Miami  to Huston to Denver, then Tucson. Never again, sat in airports all most the whole time. The worst is I am disabled and They lost my elect wheel chair and luggage. It was delivered to my home the next day. went 27 hrs unable to go anywhere till I got my wheelchair back. Put me in their wheel chairs and I was left in waiting areas and unable to get help for food and bath rooms. Their chairs have to be pushed by airport employees.  I have not flew any where since. I went to take the train for next trip, train was running late and I ended up in a panic attack, I did not go on train, got my money back and went back home. I have not used public transportation since! This was in --June 9, 1917  for my  73 birthday. I have not used public transportation since....."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love Southwest!,The employees at Southwest always seem to be happy to be working. One of the stewards on our flight was amazing. He kept us entertained the entire trip. I always  choose Southwest if their price is competitive on that flight.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Occasional Flyer,"I try not to fly because of the anxiety of the whole airport experience. However, the Southwest flight itself to San Jose was good. I chose Southwest because it is the only airline that does not charge a baggage fee. Also, the layover times were the shortest; it seems you can't fly direct  to anywhere, anymore."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth Flight...as Always,We like flying Southwest. Everything runs smooth and they usually leave from smaller airports that make traveling easier. We enjoy taking our the fact that we don't pay for our bags and there are no hidden fees. Employees are always helpful and friendly. It's our first choice in flying.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A flight to San Francisco,"Booked several weeks ahead of time to access best flights, (direct if possible) and best fares.  Even by paying for an early bird check in the flights were cheaper than any other airlines, simply due to the fact that I did not have to pay for our bags.  Flight was on time. Flight crew was very friendly.  Although the flights were fairly full everything went very smoothly.  Couldn't be better."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Comfortable flight, friendly cabin crew","BWI is a friendly  and comfortable airport.  We took Amtrak from Washington to BWI rail station, where you catch a free shuttle bus to the airport.  It worked well except for our train being 30 minutes late.   This is a long cross country flight so you want to be sure to check in exactly 24 hours before the flight to get the best boarding priority.  I was B34, good enough to get an aisle seat at the back of the plane.  Unfortunately one toilet was out of action, otherwise the flight was good, we even arrived 30 minutes early.   The cabin crew did two services and were efficient."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Comfortable and efficient flight,"I recommend the Southwest App, you should check in as early as possible, 24 hours before the flight.  That will secure you a better boarding priority.  If you are B30 or better you should be able to get an aisle or window seat.  Dropping the baggage was was quick and efficient.   Staff are friendly and efficient, our flight to Washington National was a bit bumpy but on time.  Unfortunately my overhead light didn't work. I reported it to an attendant, later he gave me a beer for free.  Sometimes refreshment is better than information.   Southwest doesn't sell food on their flights so you need to bring your own."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Good flight, excellent service","Southwest gets credit for offering affordable one-way or multi-city trips.  Free checked baggage is welcome, dropping the baggage was was quick and efficient.  Southwest has free entertainment if you bring your own screen and have downloaded the app.  Staff are friendly and efficient, our flight to Houston was comfortable and on time.  Southwest doesn't sell food on their flights so you need to bring your own."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Helpful  to  travelers  and  pleasant  experience to them.,We  always fly Southwest  as they provide  non-stop  flights  to our  favorite  destinations.  Both my husband and i  require  wheel chair assistance  and  never have  to  pay extra  or  wait for help.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nonstop - San Diego to Albuquerqu - Perfect!,"Love this non-stop flight! SW is easy to fly - no nonsense, pleasant flight attendants, and nice aircrafts. Seats are a little tight but it was an 1-1/2 hour flight. We will definitely use this flight in the future."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Experience,"I love the flexibility, and free checked bags for south west. I really enjoy that I can bring my skis and another checked bag at no extra cost. It is so convenient to get to Colorado from Boston for skiing!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Routine, comfortable, smooth flight, wifi issues","Flew Southwest 3654 from Boston to Denver for a Ski weekend and everything was great. Check-in staff were clearly pros with handling skis/boots/etc.(especially when 2 bags fly free!!) and were really friendly and informative about when and where large items would be dropped off at baggage claim. The flight was on time, comfortable, plenty of legroom, with the only issue being really spotty (albeit free) wifi on the return trip. Love Southwest, though."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Comfortable and got to our destinations safely,We did early bird check in which really helped with having the 9 month old in our group. The employees did their jobs efficiently and politely at BWI. If you follow directions the boarding process goes smoothly. There is not many places in the direction we went to our gate to get a bite to eat but we had a quick snack and boarded the plane.  We weren’t sure how the baby would do with the flight but she was an angel.  A little fussy in the beginning but she was fighting sleep so once she gave in and went to sleep she didn’t wake up until we were  in Orlando.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Fine,"Weather delay, not their fault. Landed  in Ft. Lauderdale, but no gate available. Sat and sat. No beverage service, but did on the way to Nassau. Since flight time should have been the same, so we are uncertain why it was offered only one way. Would have been great, since we sat on the tarmac for quite awhile. Poor planning for no gate....."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best service and airlines for domestic flights,"I have travelled a lot recently -the cost of airlines and declining services is very discouraging so I was pleasantly surprised by clean and uncomplicated service by Southwest Airlines. The price is decent, connections easy, checkin was easy and quick. You get to pick your seats and leg room is better than most other airlines.Some flights have lunch for purchase, would be nice if it was available in most of them. If the connection is a short stop, there is no time to buy food, and which is what happened to us. The snacks were ok and couldn’t get lunch but otherwise ok.There were no charging points in the flight but the airport seats had them.The flight always left on time and even if a bit delayed did reach on time. It was a close call in our connection but we made it in time for the next flight.All in all decent airlines and flights"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Mixed bag review,"Say what you want to about the 'cattle call' airline, but I probably appreciate flying Southwest Airlines more than any domestic carrier.  Our outbound and inbound flights were excellent, with the exception of one minor hiccup.  Apparently the baggage weight in the compartment of the plane had to be adjusted on our outgoing flight and this delayed our flight by 40-minutes.  This was unfortunate, but for safety and fuel purposes necessary...all the say it was a bit disturbing as these things should be more in the preparedness of flight.Other than that our flights were perfect.  I don't mind seating that is by A,B,C so long as you are in at least A or B so you need to be prepared.  This airline always gets me to and from a location more on-time and with less hassle than any other airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Trouble Free Flight,"We fly Southwest because you know what to expect, their warm service and their excellent communication when things don’t go to plan. This most recent flight was no exception. We were on time, smooth flight and friendly service - everything you want from an air journey."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,1st hassle free flight to Aruba,"After nightmare flights on other airlines, Southwest got me there on time and with absolutely no hassle. A breath of fresh air."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,I Love Southwest Airline!,"I had another wonderful experience on Southwest Airline. I fly 2 to 3 times a year and I still get a little nervous, the flight attendant from Dallas to Houston was so funny and entertaining that I was able to relax and enjoy my flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,I Use the app,I use Southwest Airlines app to get to Texas and to get back to Tampa the app was very helpful and I purchasing my tickets on the app and also checking in and getting my boarding pass and getting my free bag checked in Updates on my cell phone was very cool enjoy the stress free trip yes I would recommend Southwest Airlines
Date of travel: February 2020,10,SW does NOT honor active duty,"Returning from a trip to Las Vegas from Denver (about 15 of us) to celebrate my sons 21st birthday and return home from Kuwait, the Southwest Gate attendant DENIED my son boarding at the front of the “B” boarding group (the rest of us were the back of B where we were supposed to be.) All of us were dumbfounded as well were the strangers around us. Will not EVER fly SW again. Crappy end to a fun 3 day trip to Las Vegas. If anyone from SW reads this the flight #was 2244. Passenger that was denied was Airman Shelton of the US Air Force. PLEASE train your gate attendants better than that! She was rude and loud and caught everyone’s attention around her. After I got to the gate - I explained to her he just returned from fighting for her freedom to express herself that way."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Canceled flight in last half hour,"While sitting in the waiting area ready to board our connecting flight it was announced the flight was cancelled. Being instructed to approach the desk along with several other passengers we managed to get on the next flight and make our connection. This was a little unnerving but it worked. On our connecting flight we were told to preboard as to be close to front of plane to make connecting flight. As we boarded we were told we were not authorized to preboard in a rude manner. We were just following instructions.  But we made our flight, guess that is what counts."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Have been to Philly Denser and Houston in last month.,Had direct flights to and back to St Louis from these varied locations. Flights were on time or close to on time each instance. Highly prefer the 800 series vs 700 series but had paid for early bird on my flights so didn’t matter. Flight crews were helpful and made the flights more comfortable for everyone I saw on each flight. Say what you want SWA gets the job done if you have to travel.
n/a,40,Gotta Get Away,"Flew Southwest Airlines to Phoenix, AZ.  For traveling from A to B, the flight was very well worth the money and actually quite pleasant.  Free entertainment was provided and wifi service was at a minimum cost.  Drinks and snacks were provided so though there was no meal service, you won't go hungry.  Also, being a direct flight, just to avoid the time and energy it takes to land at another airport, layover and then catch another flight was also well worth the cost of the flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Pleasant Airline,My husband & I flew Southwest Airlines from Atlanta to Vegas for a short getaway and it was great. Both flights coming & going were terrific. Smooth flights and flight attendants were very nice. We will definitely be flying Southwest again.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Premium low-cost,"After below average experience with European low-cost airlines like Ryanair, Easyjet, Vueling, etc.. i was more than surprised with what i got flying by Southwest.Instead of measuring each mm of your hand baggage - 2 piece of baggages included in basic fare, no food on board, but very good variety of free snacks on board, comfortable seats and of course singing flight attendants. What else can you ask for the money?"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest Comes Through With Excellent Service Again,"Our flight from Manchester NH to Tampa Florida was a positive experience. The flight left on time and arrived early. Cabin attendants were pleasant, responsive and professional. A very good service for a cheap air fare."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Flight Attendant Conversations,"We flew from Atlanta to Milwaukee on February 22, which left about 1:50pm.  We have always been pleased with our Southwest flights in the past, but did not enjoy the three flight attendants loud, personal conversations at the back of the plane.  We were seated very near the back of the plane so it was hard not to hear everything they were talking about, including complaining about another employee.  They need to know people can't help but hear them when they are talking so loud.  Did not enjoy this flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Friendly elbow bumper,"Because of cost, we fly Southwest often. It’s common to have a full flight that every seat is filled, however during our most recent trip even the isle was a bit tight. The stewardess seemed to rub elbows with most everyone in the isle; with her hips. She was very nice but couldn’t seem to get those refreshments out without offering an elbow rub down as she went back and forth."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Pleasantly Surprised,I have not flown SW in over 10 years or more.  I was surprised that the planes were nicer than the ones I flew on years ago.  I had a difficult time checking in and had to have a Phone Agent check me in.  It appears the (l) in the reservation was actually an uppercase I (i).  I thought it was a lowercase L.  There were slight delays but planes arrived on or close to their expected times of arrival.   I usually fly United or Delta but chose Southwest because I didn't know if I would have to cancel because of inclement weather.  Southwest offers a more liberal cancellation policy than most airlines.  I will consider SW for some flights in the future.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Misleading Label,"This is a warning for anyone who is tempted to opt for the service class titled  ""Business Select.""  The use of the word ""business"" implies a separate part of the aircraft with more seat room.    The boarding pass label was ""Business Select"" with 4-A, which looked like a seat assignment.  The service costs more than full-fare economy.  To be sure, at no point does SWA state any of this except the added cost, but the label ""Business Select"" does imply it.  The lesson I learned:  When you fly SWA, read ALL of the small print.,"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Get What You Pay For,"We flew from Charleston to Midway for a three day get away, our destination was actually East Lansing, MI. We chose this route because it was the best price for a direct flight and got us within a four hour drive of Michigan State. We did not upgrade to early check-in; we checked in online one minute after the open period started and ended up in the back of the plane, but together. There was plenty of space for luggage. Refreshments were minimal but fine for a 2-hour flight. Overall average experience. The staff, from counter attendants to flight attendants, were welcoming and helpful. I simply don’t like the check in and boarding/seating process, but the price was right. I got what what I paid for."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight Attendant was a Hoot,"Another airline cancelled a flight so our flight became packed with desperate travelers trying to get to Denver too.  The service desk handled the “crush” with class and the plane was filled to capacity.  Once we pushed away from the gate, we were treated to a humorous [yet on point] delivery of the safety instructions by attendant [she shared that she was Houston based.]Things sure seem to go better with a smile."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Direct flight,"Can’t beat a direct flight to any location. BWI to STL via Southwest was the only one I could find for under $300.  The only down side on Southwest in my opinion is that their stewardesses are older and not just old but like almost retirement old. I mention this because the early morning flight or last flight of the day they always seem to be in a bad mood. Again, this has been my experience with Southwest unless your in a trip to Mexico and then the Stewardesses are all smiles.Southwest HS definitely closed the gap with the other major carriers."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nice flight!,"Southwest offers an app for free where you can use iMessage, watch TV, and watch movies while on the flight!  What a nice free add-on bonus!  Not to mention, you get two free 50 lb bags in addition to a carryon!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest flight was pleasant and on time,The flight crew was very friendly.  The flight was on time.  My checked bag was free.  That works for me.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Broken Flight from San Juan to Tampa,"It was bad enough that Southwest did not have a non-stop flight from SJU to TPA this February at a decent time, but our stop-over in Fort Lauderdale turned into a 45 minutes added delay due to non-working airconditioning on the scheduled plane. After lining up for boarding at the scheduled departure time and waiting for instructions, we were all told the gate had been changed due to A/C problem and had to move."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Southwest is very good,"Southwest is one of the best airlines “up there”, once you’re up there. I find it very stressful to jockey for a seat and to have the unknown weighing on you as you see the cattle call of passengers waiting to board. If they would just eliminate the cattle call, it would be so much nicer."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Avoid if active,Avoid if you are military.  Told me I needed to be in uniform. 24 years in.  How can they not acknowledge service.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"""Over weight baggage""","When I originally flew into Chicago not even a month ago for work purposes my 2 checked bags were well under their ""limit"" now on my way back home they are saying that each bag is 12 pnds over when why on Earth would I purchase anything to take back from Chicago to Dallas, and when I asked the rude attendent for proof she failed to show me or give me documentation stating they were each 12 pnds over.She just stared at me and said that I owed 150.00 for excess weight! This airline is a joke the only reason their tickets are cheap is because they find a way to scam the public ...I will Never ever fly Southwest again"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Last minute flight cancellation wasted my entire day.,"I was booked on Southwest's flight 1758 from Los Angeles, CA to San Francisco, CA with a scheduled departure of 6:05 a.m. Up until about 5:30 a.m. the gate staff kept announcing that the flight was on time. Suddenly, they announced that the flight had been cancelled.  I was re-booked for a flight which was scheduled to take off 3 hours later. That flight (#1828) was delayed by another 2 hours. I wound up arriving in San Francisco at about 2:00 p.m. instead of 8:00 a.m. They do not have assigned seating. The aircraft had 6 across seating and the seat was comfortable enough for the 1 hour flight. There was adequate legroom for my 6'2"" frame. They do provide WiFi during the flight. There was free soft drink/snack service. Of course, flight 1828 was over 2 hours late."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Safety??,"Good news - id you sit in 28 A and B you don;t have to obey the safety rules and are allowed to have your coats,, bags nad back packs on the floor under you feet.On time, totally full, lots of kids nad families headed to FL."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Full - lots of kids,"On time, well managed; but why do all those people (more than 30) who did not pay the extra for early check in get to board between the ""A"" and the ""B"" groups?We paid an extra $100 and they did not and they got on before we did?? Seems strange to us."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,WHY?,Went well - but why was the young women in seat 26C allowed to have a bag under the seat that blocked the aisle? Maybe because she and the flight attendant almost share a birthday?Late evening flight on time - well done.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,No Surprises,"Southwest is great because you don’t get halfway through your booking to find that you have to pay extra for your seat.  You don’t have to pay extra for your luggage!  The customer service people at the airport are always friendly and kind! Our flight back to Denver wasn’t full, I ended up having the row to myself!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Destination Denver,"We had an early morning flight on Presidents' Day weekend with many families traveling to the Ski Resorts for the break. The flight attendants were more than patient and kind with a full 6:30 AM departure. In Denver, the only challenge was a broken luggage return machine that delayed everyone retrieving their luggage. Other than the luggage challenge everything was perfect."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great experience in Southwest,"Seats are reasonably sized, boarding is efficient and staff is friendly and real. We had a singing flight attendant. Only complaint is that snack isn’t vegan but I bring my own."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Super flight...dirty bathroom,Took a mid afternoon on a Monday.  Great time to fly.  Flight was wonderful.  Pilot had good sense of humor but very serious about his job.  We were seated near back of plane.   Excellent take off and landing with min  turbulence.  Return flight also excellent****BUT we boarded directly after another disembarkmemt.   ****They never even emptied the trash in the bathrooms.  I was the first one to use after seatbelt sign went off and trash overflowing.  With all the flu and COV19 scares  you would think they would take precautions and wipe bathroom down at least.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Fun trip with friends,"Recently had an opportunity to fly on Southwest Airlines from San Antonio to Vegas to meet some friends.  The flight was uneventful, which I suppose is a good thing if you are flying somewhere.  The crew was great as always, never really had any issues with any SWA crews and I typically have many opportunities to travel within the US.  Will definitely use SWA again, in fact heading out on another quick trip to Orlando this afternoon."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Southwest Hotels: Terrible Experience, not operated actually by Southwest","First off things you should know before booking with Southwest for Hotels: 1. Its not actually run by southwest, they outsource it to different parties. Good luck if you have any issues with your accommodations.2. Do not trust the pictures or reviews on their website. Inaccurately represent the actual accommodations.3. Price and points might sound great, but being sleep deprived due to bad accommodations are NOT WORTH IT Southwest provide a great point deal to stay and what is advertised to be a 3 star hotel: The Capitol Hotel Downtown Nashville. The website deceivingly shows this as an actual hotel, not a motel. It has open hallways with windows facing the street that is extremely loud and unsafe. The walls are paper thin to the point I can hear the conversation in the room next to me. It has a police officers sitting lobby for security which is an immediate red flag.On top of this, I requested a king room for a romantic valentines getaway and they gave us doubles. I’m baffled that southwest would tie their name and promote this hotel with promotional points to encourage booking here.Our romantic weekend is ruined thanks to the complete misrepresentation of the hotel described. I had to book an alternative hotel and have to pay double what I could’ve had I known this would be such a terrible stay. This will be the last time I ever book through southwest."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth flight,"This was a great flight to and from San Diego, CA from Raleigh-Durham. On time and a smooth ride all the way. The flight attendants are super friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Bad cabin pressure almost ruptured my and my companions eardrum.,"I flew from Florida to Tennessee and then Tennessee to Baltimore- landing in Tennessee was bad but I was able to open my eustachian tubes after 45 minutes or so but after we landed in Baltimore my left eustachian tube had completely collapsed. For 4 days I was dizzy and nauseous, my ear began to fill with fluid. I had to visit my ENT to have the fluid removed and my physician was able to reopen my eustachian tube - quite painfully I might add. My traveling companion and I continue to have hearing and balance problems. We knew something was very wrong (aside from the excruciating pain in our heads) when we landed in Baltimore and my companion held up our half full water bottle and it was completely crushed from the pressure. Get on the ball Southwest you're going to hurt someone!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Airline of choice,Southwest has a great on-time record which we find to be extremely important if you are making connections to another airline.  No worries about catching your international flight.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,As easy as pie.,"This was a straight shot from John Glenn International to Regional Southwest.  The ground crew and flight crew were typical Southwest - professional, friendly, and in good humor.  If we have the option, we always choose Southwest."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"Rough flight, lots of turbulence ","Flying into Sacramento, the flight was pretty rough. Turbulence was awful, it was foggy. The crew were friendly. The flight was empty so had a row to myself. Service was as expected for a budget airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Airline,"Always satisfied with our southwest flights.   They leave on time and always seem to get us to our destinations on time or early.  The boarding process is unique, but I do feel that it is a faster process."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Love Flying Southwest,"We have always had a good experience flying Southwest Airlines.  They are usually on time and the employees, from the ticket counters to the flight attendants are always very friendly and try to be helpful in any way they can."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,One of the better ways to fly,"I've flown SW many times and never really had any problems. The way you board is fairly unique but seems to work just fine. Traveling with my wife, we were boarded as B60 and C1  and of course ended up with middle seats one in front of the other. Since it was 6:00AM, we didn't care because we were going to sleep. On a return flight, we were boarded as B25&26 and just so happened to get window and middle in row 3. THey serve a little beverage (better than most) and crackers/pretzels. Leg room isn't the best (I'm 6'1"") but there's knee room. Clean,friendly and efficient."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Business trip to Orlando,"Great service as usual. Easy check-in process, friendly staff both on and off the plane. Flight was on time and smooth."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flight,"I love Southwest!  When I have to fly, I try to fly Southwest.  The flight attendents are friendly and accomodating.  The pilots are great too."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delay - Parking Break,"We get out on the tarmac and the pilot gets on the intercom and say's ""we have to go back to the gate, a light came on, we need to get it checked out.  After an hour, it's repaired and we're off.  An hour and 1/2 late but everyone was great and the pilot kept us updated regularly."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good Flight,On time.  No frills but if you asked for something you would get it.  Getting through customs was pretty easy.  I would fly Southwest again.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Consistent and On-Time,"Connected through DEN..no problem and on we went!  Easy Peasey..organized well oiled  machine!  Crew always delightful, fun and courteous."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Airline,Check in was quick 3 pieces of luggage fly free 2 per person our flight was on time the flight attendants were great and we didn't miss our connecting flight
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Thank you SWA!,"Just need to mention the great customer service we received from a SWA rep last October in Salt Lake City. My wife and I had planned a much needed vacation to the South Pacific months in advance, with a once a week departure out of Los Angeles on Air New Zealand. We used Southwest to get us from Salt Lake City to LAX-namely because they had the best fares and there were no baggage fees. We’ve flown SWA many times before domestically, although they aren’t exclusively the airline we have chosen. That may change after our excellent experience with SWA.The day we left to the airport in SLC was chaotic and we rushed to get out the door. In the panic, my wife had left her insulin pump at home! We did not discover this until moments before the plane departed the gate (we were already seated).We had no choice but to get off the plane and figure something out.  The departing flight from LAX was leaving in six hours. Honestly, I thought the vacation was going to be canceled as our travel insurance was not going to cover the costs of re-routing us through New Zealand to the Cook Islands. SWA immediately stepped into action and the customer representative began making plans (and contingency plans) on how to get both of us to LAX in a timely fashion. I wish I had written her name down. She was extremely sympathetic when we explained the situation and within 30 minutes I was on my way. My wife (who had to wait to have her insulin pump delivered to the airport) was on her way within an hour and  a half. We both met up in Los Angeles with time to spare.I can’t say enough good things about the way the customer rep handled the situation. What could have been a devastating episode that could have ruined our plans for a dream vacation ended up being an afterthought because everything went so smoothly! To the SWA customer service rep at SLC International: Thank you so much!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Gate 1 and 2 Montego Bay ruin my vacay zen,There are no permanent Southwest number stands for aiding numerical boarding line up. This leaves passengers guessing where their number will be coupled with gate agents who seem  not really in tune with the Southwest numerical process. It has become a stampeding confusion for the last three years. The gate agents need to set up the boarding signs (tablets with the 1-30 and 31-60 ASAP and make sure they call for A only then B etc.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,On time,"Southwest was on time on all connections, the cabin was clean and the seats appeared to be more spacious than their competitors. The crew was very friendly and helpful. Their seating process was the best. Great flight in every way."
n/a,50,SWA,"Great price. 99% of the time, cheaper than United and American. Web site easy to navigate. Curbside checking of bags...only way to go. Got nothing negative to say about SWA. Flight attendants always nice AND professional."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Round trip 10-day visit,It was a wonderful flight both ways my husband needed a wheelchair is very good service on and off the plane
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best Customer Service in the AIR,Southwest AIrlines is the gold standard for customer service in airlines.  They truly put the customer first.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,His & Her Golf Outing,"My wife of 42 years and I flew Southwest from Austin to Orlando for a week of golf.  We enjoy Southwest, the support in the loading area and on the plane.  Everyone is courteous, extremely professional and create an “upbeat” atmosphere.  On our flight, the pilot joined in by making a few humorous comments to the passengers.  Our flight departed on time and arrived 15 minutes early.  It goes without saying, we will fly Southwest again."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Transfarency?,"Transfarency is Southwest Airline’s policy of treating their customers with kindness, respect, and going above and beyond for their customers. However when it comes time for their actions to match their words the follow through falls WAY short. I recently booked a flight through Southwest and I don’t fly them often but of course see the commercials and social media posts so I had high expectations and was surprised at the low rates. When I needed to change my flight and throughout the entire process I was never informed that flights would not be refundable. I was then informed that after I changed my flight the difference would be a credit I could use later, which doesn’t help me since I don’t normally fly with them. When I called for help with my dilemma and to try to get assistance from their customer service I was treated with indifference and disrespect and had to call multiple times and different places to finally get the information needed to file for an exception (I thought customer service was the norm) to get a refund of my money. Apparently they will hold your money hostage and give you the run around instead of trying to assist you. They certainly did not do me any favors or show me anything in the way of customer service, and I know that this makes me not only want to never fly Southwest again but warn everyone I know about this experience. Do yourself a favor and stay away"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Direct Flight - arrived early.,We flew to Orlando for a Disney event.  The outbound flight was 30 minutes late for take off yet the pilot made good time during the flight to arrive at Orlando on time.  The return flight arrived 20 minutes early.  The flight crew was friendly.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Very comfortable, pleasant flight","We purchased the very affordable Business Select upgrade and very much enjoyed the perks: front of the line boarding access, free drink each, no hassle seating. It’s wonderful that Southwest  it only allows you a free carry on,  but also your 1st checked bag is free. Kind of makes you wonder about all those airlines that don’t!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good option for travel ,"Southwest is a low-cost airline, this time it was a short trip from Las Vegas to San Diego, the plane was comfortable, it had adequate space between the seats, the crew very friendly, they have drinks on board, and the most  The attraction of this airline is that you can travel with two free bags.  the only negative was that this airline does not allocate seats, and this can generate confusion with passengers, for sure I recommend this airline to travel"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,San Diego to Chicago smooth and uneventful,"A smooth flight loading went well. Everyone was cooperative, the staff served us after about an hour after we took off some turbulence as we went over the mountains. The entertainment system had some issues they had to reset twice."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Not sure why it's called Southwest,This little airline sure has grown.  I guess service is the key.  They always get me there and back.  I still don't know why don't just have reserved seating and fill their planes from the back.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Smooth flights to & from Las Vegas on a February long weekend,"We flew to Las Vegas on a Friday morning and returned on a Monday night. As usual, the Southwest flights were smooth. Each one got in a bit early too.  (My only opportunity note is how the price of the early bird check up has gone up over time.)"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest Air Flight,Very friendly. All went well with flight and luggage. The attendant even helped all of the passengers joke through and be extra patient with a screaming child. Also helped the mother be put at ease.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Seat saving issue(s),"Due to persons saving seats, caused delays for numerous others looking for seats.  When another passenger asked what the policy was, on saving seats, she said there wasn't one.My opinion is they should get one. I see more & more of this each flight. Whether it's due to one person in the group buy an upgrade or being in A class... Southwest is missing out on the fee & enabling this disruption to their seating process.What also gets me are the persons who clearly have 2 good sized carry-ons that get on early and blatantly put both of them in the overheads!Consider: if you need assistance to get on the plane, to be first...you should still be on the plane, when the rest get off. Maybe then people would be more honest about their abilities or lack there of.Just a crazy thought - maybe Southwest should consider seating from the back to the front!"
Date of travel: March 2019,50,First time on southwest,Flight was over a year ogo. First time on southwest. We were quite pleased. We flew a 737 max (before they were grounded). Plane was great. Boarding system was fine.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service - Canceled my flight and they refused provide furture flight credits($300+),"I was a 20+ year customer of Southwest Airlines and for the most part rarely contacted Customer Service. The way I am being treated is very upsetting, and its obvious they don't care about retaining loyal customers, for that reason I feel the need to inform and warn anyone who will listen, in hopes that they choose wisely(Southwest is greedy and insensitive).  I cancelled my flight on Saturday 2/22/20, at 11:00 am., due an emergency (unforeseen circumstances).  The flight was scheduled to leave from Atlanta (to New Orleans) at 2:15 pm.  After signing on and performing the cancellation, I clearly saw the message that stated ""Flight Cancelled  $309.00 rewards were credited.""  I later received an email stating I was a no show.  I immediately contacted customer service, who provided me with another so called customer service number in Dallas, who would be able to assist, problem is the offices were opened M-F 8-5. I immediately contacted them on Monday morning and explained the situation, what a waste of time.  The associate basically said SORRY we get to keep your money.  Maybe there was a confirm button that you did not press and you should have taken a screen print.  Not to mention - I am the highest level of escalation.  I was baffled; this was not a $59 wanna go fair.  I don't have that kind of money to give Southwest Airlines.  They are basically kicking the can down the road to basically say SORRY we get to keep your hard earned money.  I was not asking them to give me anything for FREE, I was merely asking them to credit me for a future flight - which is typically their policy.  This is disheartening that I would be treated in such a matter of fact manner, by an airline who is clearly one of the most profitable.  They cannot expect to treat customer this way and expect to gain or retain customer share in the long run.  They really not care.  Honestly GREED has taken over this airline.   I recently flew them once for a business trip to NYC and there was one plane that was stuck in St. Louis due to weather (3:00 PM) and I was told there would not be another flight until 6:00 AM the following DAY!  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and continued flying with them, unfortunately they did not provide give me the benefit of the doubt.    I'm done flying with Southwest Airlines.  My money will spend well with another airline who will respect me as a customer."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best airline,"Hands down one of my favorite airlines, prices are very reasonable and ride is always smooth, highly recommend sw anytime your flying"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Easy Flight from St. Louis to Turks and Caicos,"Relatively easy flight.  Short delay upon return in Fort Lauderdale.  Airport arrival and departure areas outside of airport in Providenciales can get crowded, terminal area for departing flights is way to small. Immigration and Customs in Providenciales not bad when flying in on a Saturday and departing on a Friday."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Extra Special!!,"My wife and I were returning from a trip to Zion National Park and then Front Sight Gun Training Institute.  It was February 14th.  The entire flight crew was exceptional.  One of the attendants even sang a little song for Valentines Day.  Then we were surprised by being told over the load speaker that the Captain had just got engaged to on of the flight attendants as well.  A loud shout went up from everyone on the flight.  Then they proceeded to have hands raised on how long couples had been married.  I believe the winning couple on our flight had been married over 46 years.  They were given a prize.  The flight crew were efficient, extremely happy and friendly the entire flight, we got off on time and landed early,.  It was just an enjoyable flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Fly Southwest!  Easy!!,Get Early Bird!!!! it is every bit worth the $50!  I would not EVER fly again without...all employees were extremely nice and so helpful!  THE airline to fly!
Date of travel: February 2020,30,What a shock,"My first time to EVER fly on Southwest and I was a little lost at what was happening. I had no idea there were no assigned seats. I then learned that we have to confer amongst ourselves and line up in the numerical order of our tickets. (There had to be liars in front of me) I still didn't know the depth of this number order.  I was very close to the end of the line and the back of the plane. (hey, it's the safest spot). But on my return flight, a nice gentleman I was chatting with in the waiting area explained that your number goes in the order that you check in for the flight. What? Why didn't anyone tell me this? He said he sets an alarm for 24 hours ahead (which is the earliest you can check in) so that he logs in right away to get that early number. OMG! What a zoo this is... No first class so I don't feel less than anyone or have to pass by those folks who are lounging in their vast space of leg room, but I felt like a bull charging for my dream seat, of course which I never got on any flight.  You only have movie on your own devices. Have to download an app. Part of my flight had zero wifi going and the flight attendant said ""it's just like that sometimes"" The attendants tell lots of corny jokes on the intercom. We did a mock engagement party for a couple who got engaged right before entering the plane. It does concern me.... ya know the whole thing about assigned seats and a flight list in case the plane goes down...Oh well, I made is safely to my destination.  The boss selected and paid for this one. I will avoid it in the future myself if I can.  Check in early and be safe out there."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very Nice And Smooth,Southwest is an airline to offer. Lower prices make me feel happy. Besides the Ryanair landing it was nice
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A less expensive and awesome airline,Awesome!  How often does the pilot personally welcomeyou to the flight? This happened to me when we left Denver for New Orleans. The flight attendants were kind and caring. Our drink orders were taken on an iPad and delivered on a tray!  We felt valued as customers!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Last time having a kid under six,Families with children under six get priority boarding after the paid group. I like that they don’t charge for specific seats. The pricing is right and if you have the app then you can get some pretty good content to watch for free. We did round trip and I watched it chapter 2 and joker. The flight attendants were courteous and cheerful. The head attendant was comical which helped with nervous fliers. When I travel within the US we always fly southwest as our preferred airline. We travel from buffalo normally as it is the closest to our home in Canada. We wound up better than the plane in picture. Lol
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest Always,"I always try to fly Southwest Airlines.  Easy check in,and 2 bags free.  No hidden fees.I try to book early but if I see that the airfare has dropped, Southwest will compensate for the difference."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Awesome Travel Experience,My wife and I recently travelled from San Antonio to San Jose. My wife has a number of medical issues and has a Service Dog.  This was the first time we were traveling by plane with her dog and Southwest took away all the stress for our family.  We bought a ticket for our Service Dog which the price was matched to my wife’s ticket.  We were allowed to board early and all the staff were amazing and very respectful.  We also found out that the ticket for our Service Dog would be reimbursed unpin completion of our travel. Thank you Southwest for an awesome experience.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Convenient flights,"Living in central PA getting anywhere by air can be tricky. We live 1/2 hour from Williamsport(IPT), just over an hour from State College and Harrisburg and about 3 hours from Newark, Philadelphia, BWI and Dulles with Washington National slightly farther. We can also get to AVP and ABE in less than 2 hours si we have choices but BWI is often our best choice for any distance like the Caribbean, especially if trying to avoid connections. Southwest is a good choice for reasonable prices especially since they include luggage. The personnel are always friendly and helpful. We took advantage of a park and fly deal with a local hotel since we had a morning flight and would have had to leave quite early from home otherwise. The hotel and parking was the same or less than we would have paid for parking anyway. In San Juan we were fortunately able to use one of the lounges at the airport since we had to leave our ship by 8:30 and our flight wasn’t until 1:20. That’s a nice perc of our Amex platinum card. We will certainly look for Southwest flights whenever we travel in the future."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,SMF to ATL Feb 16,My wife and I fly often with Southwest and 2/16/20 was no exception.  It was a comfortable flight with a short layover in San Diego.  The only problem we experienced was the San Diego airport.  We had to leave security area where we arrived to get to the departing gate meaning we had to go through security a second time.  SWA is great San Diego Airport not so much.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving Vacation,When flying with the family I always fly SWA.  Best price with very little hassles.  Even traveling with four people we are always able to sit together.  I used to fly AA but their prices are out of line comparatively speaking.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest continues to be my goto airline,Doing business with and flying with Southwest continues to be easy and effortless.  I like the boarding process.  It pains me to have to go on another airline and get seat assignments.  Initail Flight was delayed but they made up the time.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"As Always, Southwest Provides Great Service","I love flying Southwest and will choose it over any other airline if it’s an option. On a recent trip to Cancun I was, once again, happy with Southwest. We were going to Mexico for our son’s wedding in Tulum, so my husband and I both had more luggage than usual with our clothes for the wedding week activities. I loved that we could each check two bags free, and still allowed me a carry-on where I’d packed all our clothes for the wedding. That way, if a bag was lost, I’d still have our clothes for the wedding! Flights were on-time, and we actually landed about 25 minutes early. Our flight attendants were all very nice in both legs of the trip. I also like the size of the seats on Southwest. Some airlines have uncomfortably small seats in economy class. I’m a fairly small person and they’re too small for me! The downside of flying Southwest, of course, is no assigned seats. If you get a C group boarding pass you may sit in a middle seat or not get to sit with your travel companion if the flight is full.  But, you can pay $25 extra and be guaranteed A group boarding. All in all, with great fares, nice flight attendants, and comfy seats Southwest is my favorite airline. PS If you fly enough times in a year, you get upgraded to A group boarding automatically..."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The Only Airline To Fly,"Southwest Airlines is my first choice, my only choice in airlines. The entire crew is friendly, I like the open seating, it’s just a good comfortable airline. Never had an issue with baggage never had an issue with arrogant personnel, I get on board and turn everything over to them."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Liars,I was told that my backpack make it on the plane. I was running late and so was over all the people with me that was not in my party. All of the beds made it to New York and mine tonight. I’m specifically told at the counter when I was leaving Dallas that my bags would be on my plane when I arrived in New York it was not I have to wait two hours for the next flight in from Dallas and then take another two hours to get home. I was told because I was late check-in that I would have to pay for to come to my house. This is my fault I should’ve never flown with Southwest they were rude when I got to New York and I’m a New Yorker so he didn’t bother me but the lack of help and assistance that’s what pissed me off. I will stick to my JetBlue and Delta are flying to Hawaii Vegas never have had any issues even by being late.i’m a New Yorker so it didn’t bother me but the lack of help and assistance that’s what pissed me off. I will stick to my JetBlue and Delta are flying to Hawaii Vegas never have had any issues even by being late
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Nice flight,Our flight was pleasant.  If you want to be sure to be able to sit with the person/people you are traveling with be sure to check in online EXACTLY 24 hours before your flight.  This airline boards people in the order they checked in.  You want to be in the A group or the first half of the B group.  I also like the fact that you can check 2 bags per person.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,As good as it gets these days.,"Southwest is usually the lowest fare I can find that includes luggage.  So, I find myself using that airline.  I have to say that flying really isn't any fun anymore (no leg room, minimal snacks), but Southwest is a good as it gets."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth,We love Southwest and fly with them with everything we can! This flight seemed to have more leg room and the plane was newer.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great first impression,"As a very large person, flying is often a hassle and a very large expense since I don’t fit in a single seat. I had recently learned of Southwest’s COS policy that allows you to request an extra seat at no charge upon check-in. The agent was very friendly and accommodating. I had no trouble getting my extra seat and was able to preboard. As I entered the plane, I let the flight attendant know I’d need an extender and I was able to get it right then and settle in before general boarding came on. The staff was very entertaining during the announcements/instructions. The whole experience was great. I will definitely fly them again and again."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Southwest is the best value,I really like that I can take 2 pieces of luggage at no charge. This alone sets Southwest apart from the field. Their flight attendants are noticeably friendlier than most other airlines. And my experience has been that they are normally on time.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Free luggage,i had 2 luggages and it was fully free in Southwest. Only airline which provides free luggage servie to economy passengers without even premium tier benefits.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Awesome,Nice flight...fight attendants were welcoming and attentive. Pilots kept in touch the entire flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very Good Flight,Couldn't ask for a better flight.  Everything was on time and the service was very good.  One thing I noticed though is on these longer flights the stews wait much longer until they start service............
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest Airline,Ladies at. check-in were very helpful since we are senior citizens who need assistance.The stewards and stewardess on the plane were very friendly and courteous.  Our wheel chairs were waiting for us when we arrived in Phoenix.  We try to fly SWA whenever we fly.
n/a,50,We ONLY fly Southwest ,2 free checked bags per person. Great customer service. Open seating.  Easy to change reservations.  98% on time ( for us) and two flights this week were up to 30 minutes early ! My only comment would be is that when families board before the B group it's supposed to be 2 adults per child with children being under age 7. Yesterday we observed at least a dozen getting on early who were very obviously older.  I would like to see them more on top of that.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Southwest is sometimes good,Flying Southwest is always easy and fun.  The only thing was the agent at the counter in Burbank was extremely rude.  Thank goodness this is usually not the issue with Southwest.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Southwest Employees Steal your Stuff,"Hi it is Crystal again and I am just following up to let everyone know that Southwest May be a business that is recognizable but it is definitely not a reputable business at all.  I experience the worst feeling in the world when I got to Las Vegas, without my luggage.  I stupidly put a lock on my bag at DCA and sent it up the turnstile.  Lol now because I could have carried it on and saved myself the angst.  After 4 days in Vegas my luggage still was not found, I was given a claim number and sent on my way.  Now almost 6 months later I still have no resolution.  Actually, I was told that there was nothing to be done.  Jennifer, my claims agent, told me there were inconsistencies in my paperwork.  I was given the runaround, told by multiple people a check was on the way, and now 6 months later still nothing! .  Now it is my personal duty to warn other people do not trust Southwest.  They steal an average of 2 bags per flight.  The flights are so cheap because they allow their staff to gain bonuses whenever they see a target.  They then brush it under the rug because they know the average person can not afford to fight them in court.  Please somebody help me fight them."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Fun Flight,"Nice smooth flight from Pensacola, FL to Nashville, TN and back. The only negative was the fact there were no assigned seats. They seat in categories so it was first come first serve according to what boarding group you were in. I thought that was kind of weird but not a huge deal. Other than that it was a flawless flight. The staff was superb. They were so friendly and made everyone feel comfortable. You could tell they liked their job as they were all happy and made jokes with each other on the intercom during the flight... which kept us entertained. The staff definitely gives a nice personal touch which is very nice for the passengers. It's great seeing people have fun on the job. Oh and they also have fabulous gin and tonics."
n/a,50,Always a pleasure flying with SW,Bags fly free. Good seats. Refreshments and a good sense of humor!! Love southwest. Plus in flight movies and more on your mobile device.  Southwest definitely sets the bar to customer service and what airlines need to do to bring in customers.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great employees,Always great employees. They always have such a great attitude and the seats are not as cramped as on other airlines.
n/a,50,Excellent Airline!!!,"All very well with this airline, this was my  first time flying with them, on time, very good attention of the personnel on board, without problems with the bags, acceptable price, I would fly with them again!!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest Airlines - Best way to fly!,"We love flying on Southwest Airlines!The convenient low fare calendar helps to choose the best prices, days and time of your flight. Excellent value for tickets, includes all fees and two checked bags - with zero change fees if you need to make changes to your itinerary. The employees are courteous, helpful and friendly and always seem happy to be working! 💖🛫😎"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great airline,"This is the friendliest airline!  Flight crew always has jokes for the people!  Service is great!  Coffee, beverages, snacks, etc!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Airfare & car rental COMBO is JUMBO MISTAKE!,"I rented a car thru the Southwest Airlines and it was booked with the Thrifty car rental at Denver airport.  Southwest's descriptions of Thrifty's car descriptions DO NOT MATCH Thrifty's car description/classifications.  Of course, I got the ""upgrade"" sell speech and was forced to purchase due to the weather conditions and the car I paid for was NOT as described on Southwest's descriptions.  As a matter of fact Southwest describes their ""lowest"" SUV as a ""MID""; which does not exist on Thrifty's descriptions!  The ""MID"" Southwest describes is actually a ""COMPACT""!  I reached out to Southwest but they considered their false advertising as ""a most popular category"" to all 12 of the car rental companies.  I am so sorry that they think ""mid"" qualifies in the human language as ""Compact""!  DO NOT RENT THRU SOUTHWEST!  Go DIRECT!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest is Fine,"Nice flight going and coming. One snag is their setup in Denver. Self bag and tag was not ready to manage all the clients that showed up. Probably 50% of kiosk were down or not opened for use. Also, if you have a circular grip attached to your cell phone, the scanner will not read your boarding pass bar code. Otherwise, the staff and crew were helpful and kept us updated on flight status."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight,"Always will try to fly Southwest.   They are friendly, upbeat and very helpful.   The planes I have been on are clean."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always friendly and comfortable,I love flying with these guys. It would be nice to have a little more leg room but at least during your flight you don't feel cramped. The flight attendants are always pleasant and they always get me laughing!
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Open seating and comfort,"The open seating is super annoying, since most times you end up not seating with the people you are teaveling with. I am 5'2 and weight 120 pounds,barely had any room to stretch my leg and it was hot even with seat air vent open. Depending who seats next to you, you will be tightly seated ""packed like sardines"".I am glad flight was  hour and a half."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Always friendly and affordable,"The best you can do when affordability is your goal.  Friendly, helpful service.  Clean aircraft.  But, it's coach.  Cramped.  Courtesy snacks and drinks.  2 free checked bags, a carryon and a personal item."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Off to Mexico!,"Another wonderful flight to Cancun. Went through BWI both in and outbound. No delays, all went smoothly. Arrived safely and a few minutes early. No cost for baggage.Southwest is the Best!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always a pleasure!,"If I can I will only fly southwest! They have always been the most fair in price, accommodating with passenger luggage and in every aspect of their jobs!  I bring my chihuahua so I also have to have a small carry on for him and I. Fly southwest is always fun, welcoming and a pleasure to fly with. They hire great flight attendants and their pilots are also gracious and really know their roles in keeping passengers feeling safe during the flight.  I am always appreciative of the employees smile and courteousness! Thank you Southwest for your continual commitment to excellence! A+++"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Friendly, affordable, with luggage cost included!","How was it possible that every single employee I encountered with Southwest was friendly, upbeat, and helpful? I experienced a smooth flight, to Florida and back. The price with luggage included was no more expensive, when compared to other companies I've used that piece-meal each ala-cart item together. I'll be looking to fly with Southwest again."

Date of travel: February 2020,50,Girl’s Trip,Our original flight was delayed due to weather but SW worked to find us the perfect replacement flight! The weather was still causing some flight problems but the pilot explained everything and kept climbing to get out of turbulence! Great trip with no delays!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Attendants are fabulous,This is not the first time I have flown Southwest. I really like this airline. You can pay more or less based on your budget. The flight attendant made me smile the entire time. She was great and very accommodating. Fingers crossed that same attendant will be on my flight home. I must say she is not the first attendant for Southwest that has made a flight enjoyable.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Fly Southwest anytime I can, using SW Companion Fare.  Belize City","My wife and I earned the Southwest Companion Fare utilizing a couple of the Chase Southwest cards and we get a calendar year to use it.  So our plan is to try and go someplace at least once a month.  Belize is a wonderful country, and Southwest's flights to the Caribbean makes getting there very easy.  We connected through Houston on our way down, and through Fort Lauderdale coming back.  Boarding is easy, flights were near full going down, and we had a row to ourselves on all 4 legs. Boarding personnel were friendly and funny, flight attendants overall were great. Customs in Belize is fairly easy, if going to a resort and plan on buying your alcohol locally, BUY IT AT THE DUTY FREE SHOP at the airport!  Can drink all week for much less!  The flights are easy, and you're headed to paradise so everyone is chill.  Take advantage of Southwest Chase card, save yourself some cash and head to Belize!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love Southwest Airlines!,I love Southwest!!!! 2 Free bags and no charge if you need to make changes to your flight.

Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight and service,I chose this flight going to FL as it was less expensive than flying into Orlando by almost $200. Plus the timing of the departure and return trip fit my plans. The boarding process was timely and efficient as was the deplaning process. We were kept informed of everything that was going on by they gate staff and flight crew at all times. Highly recommend Southwest Airlines!

Date of travel: February 2020,20,cram them passengers,"well if you are flying alone and you are a normal sized grown man you will have issues with this airline not only will you have no leg room, no arm room you might even pay $30 to get to be in the first group to board the plane that still won't stop the airline from allowing the last person (with a dog) from sitting next to you and that dog.... will just be on a leash around your already cramped feet. but hey they have pretzles precrushed for your dining pleasere......"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Going and coming back was a great expirience,Great experience all flight attendance were great hadn’t flown in years. Going and coming back was great.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Inexpensive and timely,"Southwest Airlines has several flights daily into Orlando, including non-stops. We rarely experience delays, the check-ins are efficient, and our luggage (2 free check-in bags per customer) gets back to us in one piece. I like the flight attendants’ humor and friendliness."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Worst flight ever,Got on the plane stay on tarmac for 2 1/2 hours missed my connecting flight was supposed to be home at 2 o’clock. They told me one thing but ended up being something else mind you that they don’t feed you. By the time I got home it was a quarter to 12 midnight. I know they are a few dollars less but I fly a lot won’t make that mistake again. Worst airline flight ever SOUTHWEST AIRLINES 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight was good,SW does a great job of getting the passengers on the plane and in their seat.  This was a short flight so I did not pre-book a seat.  I am also not very tall so a middle seat works out for me ususally.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Southwest is great!,I love the simplicity of Southwest flights.  Everything goes so smoothly most of the time.  Some inconveniences can't be helped due to outside circumstances.  The southwest employees are professional & helpful.  It's always my first choice when choosing an airline.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"NOT CROWDED, PROFESSIONAL STAFF","We have a delightful trip from Ontario, CA to Sacramento, CA.  The flight wasn't crowded and everyone had plenty of room.The gate crew and flight crew were very professional, friendly and helpful."

Date of travel: January 2020,50,Love this Airline,"I had a few flights in January.  From Milwaukee to Las Vegas, Las Vegas to Wichita and Wichita to Milwaukee.  All were on time or ahead of schedule, Flight Attendants were friendly.  Seats could be a bit bigger."
Date of travel: March 2019,30,Adequate,Adequate for my needs.  I went to visit family for a while.  As I recall they were the only airlines between these two cities.  This trip was more than five years ago.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Ultimate care and customer service,"When my husband became ill at the gate, Southwest responded by calling medical personnel as well as rescheduling our flight, without additional cost, two days later.  At that time they provided wheelchair assistance for him and when we arrived in Orlando the wheelchair attendant accompanied us to baggage claim (4 bags) and transported both the bags and my husband to rental counter with me, and on to load everything into our car.  Thank you Southwest for great care and customer service.  You have won us over, especially in these days of minimal service standards for airlines."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,The worst airline the people that like them have clearly never flown anyone else,"The absolute worst airline. Transfairency?  Bullcrap.  There is nothing fair about southwest.  Got to the airport early hoping to catch an earlier flight. There are seats open. Can I get on? Sure... For $300. JetBlue, Delta, American... They don't pull this crap to catch an earlier flight. Heck JetBlue and Delta I can call the day before and confirm for FREE. Southwest? Nah we will just leave those seats empty sorry.  Not to mention the seats are horrible, the amenities are horrible, and status perks??? You get to get on the plane earlier??? That's it? I get to be on your crappy plane, with no leg room, and slow wifi longer than anyone else? That's a real perk.  Then the other thing I hear is the tickets cost less... Anytime JetBlue and southwest have the same route JetBlue crushes them on price and that's usually a direct vs a connection!! Southwest is garbage. That heart on the bottom of the plane is means ""we love taking your money""."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Tight seats but love flying Southwest!,"I love flying Southwest! There's an airport in my town but I'd rather drive the 86 miles to Denver and fly Southwest. I'll save on tickets, usually get a non-stop flight, and get to choose my seat. The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is the really tight seats. There are some airlines with an extra inch in width and I wish Southwest had those seats."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Southwest is consistently good,Our flight back home was cancelled so we contact Southwest to make the necessary changes.  We were rerouted but were only an hour or two later to reach our destination.  We contacted them about getting our precheck funds back and it was done within 24 hours.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The way flying use to be,75 yo. Male who has flown with many carriers...many who are no longer in business. Southwest is a Company that still treats its flying public with great customer care..
Date of travel: February 2020,50,I love Southwest!,"My husband and I fly Southwest whenever we can. It's always our first choice.  Plus, we have their credit card and earn mileage points, so that helps a lot.  I just wish they flew more places.  But, we are always treated respectfully."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A model of consistency,"Southwest may not offer the frills of other airlines, but their ability to provide consistent and reliable service is unmatched. On time, reliable,  and friendly flights is their hallmark."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Maui,"The flight was uneventful and went very smoothly, luggage arrived very quickly. Returned to SJC and had the same experience"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Southwest Airlines cancellation.,"I love Southwest Airlines and fly them anytime they go to a city I’m visiting. They are reliable, friendly and don’t charge for bags or flight changes. Their fares are usually good but I’ve noticed them increasing significantly over the past year compared to where they were before. One of the few negative experiences I’ve had on Southwest occurred last month. We were sitting on the plane in Philadelphia for a flight to Chicago when the pilot informed us all flights to Chicago were on hold due to bad weather in Chicago and we would be sitting at the gate for about 30 until the next weather update. 30 minutes later, the pilot told us there would be more lengthy delays on this flight and said all passengers need to get off the plane. Turns out this flight to Chicago had already been cancelled (as confirmed by two flight attendants and a gate agent) but the pilot chose not to tell us this. Why not be honest and transparent with your customers? Was the pilot afraid of a negative reaction so he wanted to get the passengers off the plane before they learned the flight was cancelled? Because of the flight cancellation, we had to get a hotel room (not paid for by Southwest) in Philadelphia and take a flight the next morning. In my experience, people tend to react better to bad news when told the truth rather than something less than the truth. This was an unusual experience at Southwest as they usually do the right thing for their customers."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Traveled PIT to LAS, then LAS to John Wayne Airport, Orange County, Ca. Return flight from Orange County to PIT via Denv",Great on time flight. Excellent service and friendly stewards. Smooth flight and very enjoyable. Clean plane and courteous personnel.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Almost always a good experience with Southwest,"Took off on time, landed early, nice smooth flight.  In my book that's a plus with so many airlines NOT doing that."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,On time flight,"We fly Southwest frequently and the flights are almost always on time. The cabin attendents are always cordial and sometimes funny ! We never pay for luggage and 2 bags fly free. We always pay for Priority Seating ( $25 each way) to get a better choice of seats. The snacks and beverages are always free with alcohol optional for a reasonable fee. They also have flight times very much in line with our desires.We do not fly ""red eyes "" .  Southwest is our airline of choice.  We also flew to Vegas from Cleveland."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Cramped seats, silly boarding procedure","Actually, this was a round-trip.  SW has this silly procedure where you have to call EXACTLY 24 hours before your flight to get a halfway decent boarding position, unless you want to pay extra to board early.  Apparently, enough people do that, because it is almost impossible to get in the ""A"" group.  Plus after boarding the ""A's"" then they take the families, so when you finally get on, you are way in the back.  Everyone sits window/aisle and a full flight results in a lot of shuffling.  We had a guy every bit of 350-400 lbs who wanted to sit in our row (I am 6'3"" and 270 myself) and had to politely tell him ""No way"".  Why SW doesn't do reserve seating and seat passengers rear to front simply amazes me. The earlier you book, the better your seat; it is not rocket science!  I am going to start paying for an an extra seat and applying for a refund after the flight (as per their policy for oversize passengers) I'm sick of being squeezed in my seat and being uncomfortable for any length of flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always an enjoyable experience,"Southwest is always my first airline of choice due to the value of the overall flight.  When I compare the more world wide airlines and discount airlines, no one can beat Southwest in cost comparison and what you get.  They have the reputation as a cattle herding airline, but it is nothing like that.  If a group does not want to get split up then pay more for early bird boarding to sit together or pay more on another airline for reserved seating.  The comfort and entertainment options meet my needs and I have no problem having a stop or lay over figured into my travel to save some additional money.I do wish booking using points from 2 different Rapid Rewards accounts was easier, but overall Southwest makes travel easy."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Consistent and Friendly,"Just a great airline, love the curb side check-in, pleasant staff and flight crew. Snacks are good too! Only real complaint is the lack of legroom, being 6’1” its a little tight. Wish they had a few rows of more legroom on all flights."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Southwest is always great!,"Whenever it's possible, we fly Southwest.  They make booking easy, and also changing plans less of a hassle.  My son and I flew to Orlando for a bike race and it was painless as usual.  Southwest personnel were friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Consistently good,SW flights are always smooth .. the lineups are consistent .. seating is consistent .. you know what you get .. i try to fly them whenever possible.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Feeling the Love!,"I chose Southwest, because, for one, I had a choice. Another reason was price! I saved about $150 on my tickets. Starting first thing in the morning and returning later in the evening of the same day, the schedule that Southwest offered fit perfectly for my needs. Being originally from the South, I am familiar with Southwest, but was thrilled when they announced service in the Hawaiian Islands! I enrolled in the rewards program. Boarding the plane, I was surprised that seats were first come, first serve. I don't know why I didn't know that ahead of time, but no matter. We departed on time and arrived on time. Reliability is what serves me best! The interior was pleasant and I love the heart logo! I love saving money too! Yay, Southwest, glad you're here!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A trip to Paradise,Southwest is a reliable airline to travel to Aruba. The flights were on time and the service was great. It was a pleasure to fly Southwest.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Trip to Las Vegas,We have been flying with Southwest for the past 15 or so years and can count the times on one hand that we have run into a problem.  I love southwest.  Everyone is so friendly
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Ground crew in Indianapolis and Atlanta are amazing,"After getting bumped from flights all day due to bad weather in Atlanta, the customer service agents in Atlanta were able to find us a flight that got to Fort Meyers, even though it had to make a stop in Indianapolis first.  We cleared waitlist on the first segment to Indianapolis but then their was only one seat from Indianapolis back to Fort Meyers so it looked like either myself or my wife was going to get left behind.  The customer service agents in Indianapolis spotted the problem even before we landed and cleared the way to make sure we both got to Fort Meyers together.  Thank you for not only anticipating the problem but jumping through hoops to make the problem go away!"
n/a,50,Great Experience ,Love flying in or out of Islip. Minimal crowds and convenient and reasonable long term parking. West Palm is also a great airport. The Southwest flying experience is excellent.  I was not happy when they changed the early checkin from $15 to $25 but the aircraft and staff are the best.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Efficient Bus!,"Southwest is a very economical and great value way to fly especially up and down the coast of CA.   I like the method of boarding by number which is very efficient and time saving.  No one is looking for their seat number, etc.  The staff are all very polite and professional!Since it is referred to as a 'BUS' people are polite and do not recline their seats.  Not even sure they do recline.  The flights are so short one does not need to recline to sleep.  I like polite people!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Destroyed suitcase,This is a great Airline if you want your luggage to end up completely ruined. I got a brand new $360 suitcase for my wedding and it is now unusable after 1 trip with southwest! It looks like someone chucked it. It was so severely bent that now the handle will not go up and down. They refused to take ownership as I reported it after the 4 hour window. Lovely customer service.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest is the best!,"Another flawless flight on Southwest! It seems like the employees of this company are happy to work there and it shows on every flight. From the off the cuff pre- flight reviews to the ease at which they all perform their tasks, the generally enjoy their job and work environment!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Recent Foot Surgery Required a Wheelchair!,I required wheelchair assistance round trip through the airport and was pleasantly surprised at the level of service all the way through. We checked in at the ticket counter and from that point on they took care of the rest making the trip stress free. We even took off on time going and returning. Amazing! The easiest trip I've had. I plan to use this route and airline again and again. Thank you for helping me out after foot surgery.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Just Like the Great Staff Stories in Their Magazine,"This experience was right out of the Southwest Magazine.  I noticed when I got up to the gate that my luggage was only tagged to Houston, new person at check in desk, and we were going to Harlingen, Texas.  I went to the desk at the waiting area and asked the Southwest person what I could do.  She took charge and assured me that she would make sure that the tags on our checked luggage were changed to reflect our final destination.I saw that the Southwest person put the new long tags on the side of the desk for the person to come up from baggage to change them. After quite awhile I noticed that the person at the desk was gone and the tags also.  I believe that she either made sure that the matter was taken care of or took care of it herself as she said she would do if need be.  Our luggage was at Harlingen when we arrived.  Thank you.Some of my confusion was that we needed a wheelchair for my husband and that was new to me so I was not as observant at check in as usual."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Extremely efficient.,"The flight from Raleigh to Nashville was in a new 737 800. Very comfortable seats with great leg room, you have to upgrade on American and a Delta to get this much leg room. Flight wasn’t crowded, hit the gate early and quickly exited the plane. Next flight from Nashville to Pensacola was an older 737 700 , not as nice but still comfortable.  And, most important, I checked golf bag for free,"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Lose and bump bags,This is the sixth time I have flown into Denver and they have lost my bag. The lady Elisabeth at the bag counter in Denver stated I was welcome to fly a different airline. I was shocked to say the least and ya I got upset when I was told that. A lady from the back came out and told me I was being rude but they would help me anyways. I was like ya I was basically told to screw off.... So disappointed and still no bag.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Late flight,"It wasn’t a huge deal, but they delayed our flight by over an hour-reason is they gave up our plane for another flight and didn’t notify us until we were already at airport and checked in! Seem like they could have given us notice earlier!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,No Problems,We fly Southwest whenever we can... I've got their credit card...and get the points.  Their prices are right...their service is fine...I like the no seat assignments process...   ...and they try to please every time.  I had trouble a few months back...shuttle dropped me off at the wrong terminal in Minneapolis...and I missed my early flight.  The gate agent saw I was in trouble...moved me to another flight... and I was on my way within an hour.  No cost for the change up.  I'll stay with them.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth flight and friendly staff,"The flight was on time, and a quick stop in Ft Lauderdale to unload and reload passengers. It was a pleasant experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,they make it fun,"they always give you a laugh -- and two bags free!  AND they give you pretzels ... now, I don't care for pretzels but it's the idea that ONLY ONE domestic airline gives you anything to eat in economy!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Early bird boarding.,I booked my trip on sale from southwest and purchased early bird checkin to assure a better seat and eliminate worry that I’d be sitting in the center. This was a good choice as I was a26 on my flight. Flight attendants were great as usual and the flight landed 30 minutes early. No lost baggage. Happy days.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love Southwest,"Southwest is always great.  I like that I can choose my seat, however don't understand why when I check in exactly 24 hours in advance, that I am still in the ""B"" group.  The flight attendants are always nice.  I love that 2 bags are checked for free and that snacks and drinks are still provided.  I am just waiting to get on a flight one day that has some live entertainment like I see on facebook!  :)"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Our favorite nonstop flights,I am handicapped and require wheelchair assistance I am always treated with respect and dignity Flights are on time and staff is pleasant My only negative comment is that there were ice cubes and a few peanuts on the floor from previous flight at my feet
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,Piolet got us there early and very nice people on flight also flight home got us home early with very nice people attending to us.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The cheap seats were OK,"I didn't know what to expect, I haven't flown in about 10 - 12 years. Things have changed somewhat. If you buy the least expensive tickets, you loose the option of where you'll sit. Do I like that, no but I can see the why the airlines have gone to this arrangement and it makes sense. you pretty much get what you pay for, I think that's fair. Even with the ""cheap seats"" you still get 2 carry ons and 2 checked bags, that seems to work for most people, it worked for me. Overall, the flight was good, without any problems, if I fly again, I'll go with Southwest."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love Southwest,"I love southwest  is great service, great price..My flights they being always on time the crew are really nice and when I use the counter at check-in  they been always very helpful"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,the really good and the really bad,"first the good. customer service is high. Thank you Jauer Colli in Cancun, Mexico. Mexico customs did not stamp my immigration receipt to leave (discovered as I was boarding to come home). One of the customer service folks put me in a wheel chair (i'm 67, but can walk fine) and RAN through the international terminal, through the shopping area to the immigration office, quickly resolved the  problem and raced me back through the way we came so I would be able to catch my flight. A+ customer service. Next, the not so good. This was my first time flying Southwest. In all other airlines I can pick my seat. So, we paid the extra $100 for early boarding. Understandably, those in wheel chairs go on first. But, when they allowed folks that either were mobidably obese or just because they felt they were too old (we were older than them) were allowed to board before us. DO NOT PAY EXTRA $100 FOR EARLY BOARDING. Doesn't matter what your boarding number is, just play sick!!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Mechanical issues- again!,"Mechanical Issues on  a flight 9 months ago left us sitting in the airport 8 hours. The flight ended up being cancelled completely, Unbelievable but here we are sitting in the airport 6 hours for flight delay because of mechanical issues again! A woman in line for rebooking said she had the same experience on a southwest flight recently.  I will most definitely avoid booking with Southwest Airlines in the future."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,My new favorite airline!,"I thought the days of customer service on flight were over...not with Southwest.  I honestly only picked the flight because it was a great deal and the flight was non-stop at the right time of day.To my surprise, the crew was extra friendly. Complimentary snacks served, and I purchased an adult drink which was reasonably priced.For solo travel, it was great.  If you are traveling as a couple or more, it may be worth upgrading your boarding position to ensure a greater chance of sitting together.  Since it was just me, the fact that I boarded as a C7 was of no consequence - I still got an aisle seat (my preference).  Legroom was not an issue, and neither was the proximity of my neighboring passenger (I will say that I am ""average"" size).Baggage check (included) was a breeze and so was retrieving my luggage upon arrival.Highly recommend!"
n/a,50,"A little bumpy going, smooth coming home","As usual Southwest is number one in my books for flying. The stewardess and stewards are always exceptional. They are always friendly and accomodating.My friend had never flown so I mentioned as we boarded and the young lady asked if she wanted to meet the pilot in the cockpit? She was so excited and had her pic taken with him. Due to weather we had a bumpy trip down to Orlando but smooth take off and landing. Coming back we had a female pilot and male pilot. The take off and landing along with the entire flight was smooth. Skies were beautiful, we took of in FL at 75 degrees and landed in Baltimore at35 degrees!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Southwest Air will always be my first choice,"Air travel is not easy, nor enjoyable. But Southwest really makes an effort to make it tolerable.  Check-in is easy, lining up numerically is ""orderly"", and checking a free bag means I don't have to wrestle a carry-on bag around the airport or into a bin.I fly back and forth to/from Tulsa and Houston for family visits, and choosing Southwest allows me to use Houston Hobby and the always-easy Tulsa airports. My direct flight is almost always on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Southwest meets our needs.,"My sons have developmental disabilities.  For the most part Southwest has been kind and considerate of their needs.  Just coming home we had a rude flight attendant.  She was rushing us and ordering me about instead of letting me handle the situation which I've been doing my sons whole lives.We planned this trip way in advance so we were able to get the tickets at a lower, more affordable rate.The gate people are wonderful and patient with my sons and me.  It is a good airlines.  We prefer it to the others.Talked a friend into flying Southwest and she was pleasantly surprised."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Each leg was early!,"Both flights left early since we were all on board.  I thought at first that the check-in counter  opened late but eventually realized the fault was mine ... I was early, having misread my  departure time.  It was early and SWA staff were not their usual flip selves.  I think that starts after 6 am."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always good...,Southwest is always good.  If you want to get there in one piece and on time without drama.  The seats are close but not as bad a some airlines... there are minimal snacks or food service.. even for purchase.  As long as you plan for no frills you are getting exactly what you pay for.  I'd rather eat what I want prior to the flight and have a low price with baggage included.  I've never had a problem on Southwest Airlines.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Air bus,Well they give you a snack witch was nice.the system use for boarding works nicely.But we could see dirt on the bottom of over head compartment
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Two free bags, democratic loading, friendly staff","I always like Southwest.  Two free bags, no charge for seats, done in numerical order.  The staff is usually exceptionally friendly as well.  They need more direct flights coast to coast, and the one downside is that they have NO reciprocal relationships with any other airline, so if the plane doesn't make it or the last SW flight is cancelled, you are STUCK.They need to negotiate harder on the flight reciprocity with other airlines.  Other than that, my top choice."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Smooth,"SMF packed flight, but SMOOTH flight. Return also smooth, but not full. Staff was great & friendly. Pilot took off & landing was so smooth."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Hawaiian Routes a Success,"We're keen to keep the number of stops to none or few.  Since we have a Companion Pass for our travel and many reward points, our flight to Honolulu to catch a cruise of the Islands cost in cash $11.20 a piece.  Typical Southwest experience: friendly, helpful attendants, flight left on time and arrived early, and good updates.  Although I'm six five, it was as comfortable as possible for the five plus hour flight.  I was impressed at how many people were taking advantage of Southwest's new flight.  It feels like going to Baltimore from the West Coast."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest Airlines Affordability and Rewardability,"Flew Jan.15th, early morning from PHL to SJU with a transfer in Orlando FL. Cabin stewards and ground crew all cordial and friendly.Return flight on 1/27 had brief layover in Tampa before arriving @ PHL on time. Because if our Southwest Rewards Credit Card, flights were free."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest is our preferred airline! Flight was on time and onboard service was excellent.,"Southwest is our preferred airline! Flight was on time and onboard service was excellent. Albert the wheelchair attendant at PIT was wonderful! The following remarks apply to FLL contractors unless they are Southwest employees.  FLL  curbside check-in and Wheelchair staging need improvement. No help from agent unloading bags from car to scales for tagging to destination. Supposedly agent dispatching wheelchairs did so by boarding time. However she insisted on taking disabled person's boarding pass , but made us wait 25 minutes so aircraft was already boarding and wheelchair attendant responsible for clearing TSA security to gate was unnecessarily burdened by delay. We barely made the flight!. Upon arrival in FLL, wheelchair attendant pushed disabled traveler from the gangway to arrival gate and then abandoned her there without a word. I ended up navigating to baggage claim pushing the wheelchair with both backpacks. There  I hired a porter for help to the waiting car."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Experience,"To be honest I have never been a big fan of SW, except for short direct flights in state, so I was surprised when flying with them to and from Maui.  Flights were on time, even arrived 30 minutes early, the flight attendants were friendly and baggage was quick to arrive at airport. The free entertainment selection was excellent. The 737-800 was roomy and plenty of legroom for this 5'7"" leggy lady. Price was extremely low beating other airlines by hundreds of dollars."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great airline,"Sure appreciate being able to check a bag for free. Price was great, employees were kind and helpful."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,LUV Southwest,As always the efficient Happy and reliable crew at Southwest gets it done right. As someone who fls almost weekly for the past 35 years I have reference points from basically most domestic airlines. The total experience with SW is far superior to any other airline.My sister has been with American over 37 years and although they are better than most they can't compare to SW! The fun and friendly staff makes all the difference. They have their 2nd largest Hub in Balto and it makes it very convenient and cost effective to Fly! My family and I LUV SW!
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Wasn't a fan before... definitely not a fan now.,"My girlfriend booked a trip to New Orleans through Travelzoo, so we had no control over the flights.  This was our return flight to PHL.  It was scheduled to leave MSY at about 7:15 PM with a 50-minute plane change in Nashville and into PHL at 12:05 AM.  When I book my own flights, I avoid plane changes of less than 90 minutes, since 71-year-old men with two hip replacements and two bad knees should not be running through airports (I ain't OJ).  Our plane got into MSY late, so we left about 40 minutes late... see where this is heading?  We landed at gate C6 in Nashville... our PHL plane was at gate C17; of course, it was in a different concourse. As we exited the jetway, they were paging us, and several others on our MSY flight, that the flight was ready to leave.  We had to ""run"" through the terminal to get to the gate where a smiling Southwest employee told us that the plane was waiting.  I should also add that because this is Southwest, purchasing seats in advance was an additional charge. I will avoid Southwest at all costs and if I have no choice but to fly them... it will only be direct flights."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Convenient and Affordable for Business Travel,"Traveling on Southwest Airlines from the Washington DC area to Milwaukee was convenient and affordable. By booking direct with the airline I was able to select the business class option, take advantage of the early check in option, secure an early boarding seat assignment, and I got two coupons for an “adult beverage” for the round trip flight. I highly recommend Southwest Airlines. The rapid rewards point system is great. The points don’t expire and they can be used for ANY FLIGHT! No blackout dates and no restrictions for domestic and international flights."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,canceled flight due to weather poor customer service,"Seriously disappointed in SWA.    Flight from MCI stopping in Denver (to pick up 9 yo grandson) then on to San Diego for a cruise was canceled due to ice storm.  Swa had no other flight options that would stop in Denver and get us to cruise in time.  So we drove to Denver though the ice storm and flew first swa flight out the next morning with our grandson.  Swa did not charge us the difference for our flight out of Denver but did charge us the difference ($600) for our grandson’s flight and our return flight to Denver.  They said those changes were our choice, not because of cancellations.  It is not a choice to send a 9 yo to San Diego over night by himself and it is not a choice to return to Kansas City when your car is in Denver!  Swa had an opportunity to save the day but chose instead to give us reason to never fly swa again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First time flyers on Southwest!,"Love Southwest! We purchased early bird check-in and I'm so glad we did. We were in A group which worked both ways for us. We were able to board the plane in the first group and choose our seats. That was important to us because my husband has a fear of flyer, I didn't want him to end up in a sit he was not comfortable."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Cancelling a childs ticket,My son was bringing my two granddaughters (age 5 and 4) for a visit. I have not seen them in about three years. Two days befre the flight his ex wife said he couldn't bring them.I callled SWA to cancel and to get either a refund or put the tickets in my name. They told me because I booked the (Wanna get away) there was no refund or transfer of the ticket. I explained to them that they are only 5&4 yrs old and that they will not be flying in the next year. All they said was (Sorry).  Well SWA you are sorry. I will never recommend you!!!!!!!!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Southwest Airlines Shines Again!,"Really Outstanding Service and made the arrival time despite having to leave a bit late.The Cabin Crew was Very Attentive and Polite!Pilot ""Nailed the Landing"" like landing on Silk.  If you've ever landed in Las Vegas before, you can appreciate this due to all the ""Crosswinds.""  In other words, ""very Hard to Do.!""A Fun Flight!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,The only airline I fly unless I need to go somewhere they don't serve,I fly Southwest exclusively unless I'm going to a city they do not serve.  I love that I can choose to pay a little more to get a better position in line if I want it.  I enjoy their boarding process and think it makes a lot of sense.Have always enjoyed the service on the flights.  Never had any issue with asking for additional snacks or drinks.I do wish they would offer something other than alcoholic drink coupons since I don't drink.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Rude flight attendant,"Was very unimpressed with the flight attendants on a southwest flight. They were very rude when asking for a drink. They would act all annoyed as if you were wasting their time. Plus, I asked for a water bottle and they refused to give one. And they wouldn’t let me use the restroom on the plane and we still had 30-40 more minutes left. And there was no turbulence! Very rude! I wouldn’t recommend flying this airline. It’s nothing like flying American or Alaska airlines. I hope to never have to fly again unless Southwest makes some big changes."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Southwest Airlines is the BEST!,"We love flying Southwest Airlines!  2 Free checked bags!  Plus a carry on, plus a personal item.  I was able to pack enough for our 9 day trip without doing laundry.  The crew is always lighthearted and funny.  They are very helpful if we have questions.  We pay the extra fee for early bird check in because I usually forget to check us in on time.The seats are definitely as cramped as other airlines and if the person in front of me leans their seat back my tray table will hit my stomach so they should give people a few more inches. But the flight is short so we get through it with a couple complimentary drinks :)  Landing was very smooth."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best service ever,Better than Etihad. Always great in service. Planes is new and clean. Drinks always free and baggage are also free. Well done SWA.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Easy travels to TF Green,I couldn’t find to many airlines that fly from Vegas to TF Green airport so I booked Southwest Airlines almost last minute. The flight was comfortable and had 1 layover in Chicago for about 45 minutes. Getting in and out at TF Green was a breeze. Definitely recommend Southwest for flying into Rhode Island.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth Sailing!,"Southwest always starts out or ends our vacations well.  They are friendly, helpful, and I’ve never had a bad experience with them.  I’ve flown a lot, and I always recommend and fly with Southwest only.  I love that there’s no worry about extra bags, and that makes for easy flying.  👌 SW"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight Experience,Nothing but great service on a full flight.  All service throughout the flight was handled without problems by all attendants.  Best flight in ages !
Date of travel: February 2020,30,A Truly Budget way to travel,"What’s good about this airline- the only nonstop from Buffalo to Las Vegas. If you want to fly for 5 hours without any amenities then this is your ride! No outlets for your electronics, no TV and the only food is a bag of pretzels. I know that I will have to make a stop on other airlines BUT I won’t feel like I’m flying in cargo."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Only way to fly!,Southwest is such a great airline! No charge for checked bags and nice flight attendants. Nonstop to Cancun from Denver was a breeze. And they have free movies you can stream on your device!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Vacation 13,Plane was full as we expected it would be. Courteous service was provided by the flight attendants. Easy access to WIFI if you had previously registered with Southwest.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,SWA Flight 5042 (IND to LAS),"I flew on flight 5042, from Indianapolis to Las Vegas, on February 1, 2020. I have no complaints about the flight. The boarding and deplaning process was fine. The pilots navigated the flight smoothly and even got us in 40 minutes ahead of schedule. The flight attendances were very pleasant and attentive to our needs. Keep up the good work."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Baltimore to Orlando - pleasant caring flight staff!,"Whenever we fly Southwest we have experienced pleasant, caring flight attendants. We always feel well cared for and this flight confirmed it again!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Albany to Lauderdale,"This was my second trip on Southwest, both have been round trips ALB to Fort Lauderdale non-stop. The boarding process works very well as everyone seems to quickly and easily find and take their seat. The flight crew was friendly, helpful and did all they could to make the flight enjoyable. And, the flights were on time despite slight delays for deicing on the way and a late arriving plane on return."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,again a great flight,you cannot beat southwest airlines for great flights  for caring staff  for on time performence  its the only airline i use
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Loved Southwest,Southwest flight from las vegas to detroit was great it was on time and efficient the employees on the plane were friendly and helpful i will be using southwest in the future and would recommend to others
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Overbooked flight and stranded in Atlanta,"First time flying southwest, and last time (not sure why I didn’t book Delta).  Arrived at the airport an hour early and was stuck in the slowest TSA line ever.  Arrived at the gate 9 minutes before departure and was told are seats (family of 4) were already given away.   Evidently they give tickets away at ten minutes, even if you are checked in and checked your bags.I guess the lesson is you get what you pay for."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flight!,"I like the ability to sit anywhere. This is an open seat plane. I had plenty of leg room and you get TWO free bags! If you plan in advance, you can get a really good fare."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Direct flight to Disney,With a direct flight from Pgh to Orlando this is a popular airline. We did the early bird check in to insure that the three of us sat together. This airline has open seating. You need to be in Group A to board first.  Seating is a little close if you’re a bigger adult. Snack service.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Love Southwest Rewards,Easy to use Rewards. Love this program. Flight was great. On time. Snacks and drinks. Very happy. Friendly staff.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Bday getaway,I love Southwest Airlines. They never disappoint. The staff is always so nice and so much fun. It’s rare when my flight is delayed and they always get me where I need to go on time. I recommend them to anyone.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Rob,"Another great Southwest flight. Flight attendants were kind and helpful. Always great service, with few surprises.  Thanks again Southwest!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Key West trip,Always fly Southwest of possible. Great experience.  Customer Service is great. If flight cost goes down can get credit for difference.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Very satisfying feeling to see my grands enjoy their first flight!,"First flight for grandkids ages six and ten. We traveled as a combined family of ten, so hearing the conversation clearly was not easy. Clues came from the facial expressions as one of the ten year olds was explaining the science of flying to one of the six year olds. Priceless. So happy the flight to and back was seamless, including take off and landing. Early twenty-four check-in worked great!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Disney trip with cheer leading team and families.,Everything was excellent once again on the flight.  Nothing beats free bags and no change fees.  I don't know how Southwest can make money when they keep there fares so low!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,One of the best flights,"The airport in San Jose is great.  Easy to get through. The boarding was easy. Flight wasn't full, but close.  I got to watch a movie through SW free movies (even though it was not as easy as it should have been).  The flight arrived early. This was one of those flights that was just great.  A very rare thing on flying anymore."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Confusing Process,"Check in the bags at LGA airport was a terrible experience. It was very disorganized, the Southwest staff was not friendly or helpful at all, they were just rushing us but the process was confusing, they just give you the ticket for your check in bags but they don’t even take the bags at the desk, you have to take it yourself to a different area to drop it off (I’ve never seen this anywhere else), the space at the desk was really small so people were on our way and stepping in front of us while we were trying to talk to the staff there. Just a very stressful and terrible experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Going to Florida,"Awesome airline, Flight attendants are very energetic positive & smiling willing to help,cracking jokes making the flight go by fast, Free Wi-Fi in with live TV and movies. flight was on time. Boarding process was quick and easy. Disembarking was also quick and easy. Highly recommend Southwest Airlines."
n/a,50,Funniest Flight Attendant Ever. ,"I laughed my guts out at the witty banter of Boris. Give this guy a raise as he was personable, helpful and hilarious.  I have never had such an enjoyable boarding experience. He got everyone in quickly and safely and with smiles. Did I mention that he needs a raise? P.s. Send him nice passengers too 😂"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Unfriendly for business,"The best thing about taking a Southwest flight from Islip McArthur airport is that it’s not JFK or LGA. But you have to make a big trade off, and for me, the thing I dislike the most about Southwest is the policy of non assigned seats. I work during the day and am just not able to login to the app exactly 24 hours before my flight to checkin and try to score the front of the line. On this trip I tried, and still ended up in position B31. That means 90 people boarded before me plus all of the families with young children and others with disabilities. By the time I got on, I found a seat in the back row near the bathroom. Then a very large guy took the seat next to me. It was impossible to sit up straight, never mind open my laptop to do any work. It didn’t matter though, they announced that the WiFi was not operational before we took off.  I think I’ll put up with the car ride back to LGA next time so I can fly in a more civilized manner and make my time more productive and relaxed. Disappointed."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight,"Awesome flight, good in early, very organized and clean. Staff was awesome, seats were comfortable and not too bad on leg room."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,ok experience,i don't like flying southwest because of the unassigned seating and I needed assistance getting to the plane and then back to baggage claim and had to wait for the assistance at both ends
Date of travel: March 2019,50,"On time, great service","Great airline. Love this airline. Quick , dependable and they have great customer service. Baggage handling is great too"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The best airline flying today,"On time, friendly, comfortable seating and easy check in. Reasonable rates as well, especially for direct flights."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Taken care of,I needed a wheelchair for this trip and Southwest has a good system to ensure that you make your flight on time. Less organized on the trip back into Midway but still got it done. I was able to sit in a front row due to Southwest’s policy of early boarding.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Fast run to Atlanta,"Caught the late night run to Atlanta for a Saturday function. Left just after 9pm on a Friday night. Since apparently, nobody wants to fly to Atlanta on a late friday night flight, we had a half empty plane. I managed to stay awake through the always entertaining pre-flight briefing, then kicked back and snoozed my way to Atlanta, arriving around midnight.Chalk up another overwhelmingly pleasant travel experience, courtesy of the Southwest  Airlines crew."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Always am happy with Southwest!,"Great flight, except for the last leg, but this was not the airlines fault, it was the airport. From KC, went to San Diego and had to change planes. I have flown into SD before, but never had to change planes. Had 20 minutes between wheels touching down, and boarding for my last flight. In SD though, to switch terminals and in doing so, you have to go through TSA again.  For 3 previous flights my bag was fine, and of course, they needed to open it, this time through. Like I said, not Southwest's fault, San Diego airports doing."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Chicago to San Juan,My husband and I flew from Chicago to San Juan on Southwest Airlines to board a cruise ship to South America.  The flight was a typical Southwest Flight.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Always a positive, A+ experience with Southwest and their crews...","I cannot praise Southwest Airlines enough. Everything from check-in, to in flight crew, to customer service is top notch. I have never had a bad experience with Southwest, and this trip was no different. Check in was a breeze. Gate attendants are friendly. Flight crew were personable, and entertaining. I praise Southwest to anyone I talk too. I have converted a few of my friends to Southwest, and they are 100% satisfied with the change. I know this review sounds like I am a paid endorsement for Southwest, but I assure you, I am just one of their millions of satisfied passengers. I just wish they had more destinations (especially non-stop) out of Louisville."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great Experience,"What I like about Southwest Airlines, is if you arrive late, you can pay a small fee to get bumped up to the shorter line.  Like I was in line C and was able to get in line A, hence I got a seat closer to the front of the plane.The crew is always very pleasant."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,No Charge for Bags,Very Good On Time Flight ... Stop in Dallas Texas to change planes but a very nice flight and it arrived on time!
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Second bad trip on Southwest,"We had a flight at 11:05 am on a Sunday, at 3:36am i received a text that our flight was cancelled.  The weather was fine so I'm not sure why it was cancelled.  I tried to call SW, after being on hold at 5:00am for an hour, I finally was able to rebook on line.  The site was not working.  I arrived in Las Vegas 8 hours later than I was supposed to.  SW poked a hole in my new luggage and because it wasn't destroyed they didn't do anything about it.  The girl wouldn't even come out from behind the desk to look at it.  She said is it destroyed, I said no and she said nope can't do anything and went back to talking to her friend.  On one of our flights there were only 23 people on the flight and the flight attendants were too busy chatting throughout the entire flight to bring us anything to drink.  Southwest's customer service has really gone downhill.  It's a cheap airline for a reason."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,On time,"Despite heavy snow, the flight left on time.As usual between Spokane and Phoenix, it was full so get there early."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Truly, always a LUV-able experienc","Excellent flight, left on time, made it through turbulent weather with adequate warnings, attendants great."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Pitt to Orlando,Flight went as plan with no problems or delays. Did have some concern as the plane was an older model and I understand that Southwest was accused of buying foreign planes without proper inspections from FAA.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good Flight To Albuquerque & Then Return,Been a while since I flown on SW.  Going out of Love Field is just wonderful!  Quick on TSA and then wide choice of food!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Fantastic & Fun Service,"Went to Colorado for a ski trip and everything was great. No hassles with the oversized ski bags either direction, and always friendly service. They are my preferred airline!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,San Juan Southwest flight,"So glad that Southwest now has more flight options to the Caribbean!  Although it did require a connection, my Southwest flights were great!  The staff is so happy and makes its customers feel valued.  This airline does it right!"
Date of travel: March 2019,40,Entertaining Employees!!,I took advantage of the introductory fare at $29.00 and wasn't disappointed at all with them for I heard that they make you laugh...
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Bad experience on Southwest while traveling with special needs passenager,"Southwest has pre-boarding for special needs passengers however, the gate agent won't allow us pre-boarding even though we were advised by the reservation desk to request it. I was told by the gate agent since I was traveling with my disabled son, I could help him and no accommodations from Southwest. Once boarded with general boarding, the flight attendant fussed at me multiple times while I was helping my disabled son. A very bad service attitude. I would not recommend Southwest if you are traveling with special needs passenger."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Super Bowl,"I always fly Southwest when ever I travel, not only are they cheaper than other airlines, I’ve never had any issues or problems. I highly recommend this airline!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always on time,The flights are always on time.  Staff is so friendly always greeting you when you enter/exit the plane.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flights were great,"We fly Southwest regularly.  The planes are clean, the staff great, and the connections are convenient."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Still the best of the bargain carriers,"This was a late night flight but was non-stop.  The service was good, as always.  No frills, and you have to get in line and rush to find seats together with your party, but it was a decent price so the trade-off is worth it for us."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love Southwest and Staff!!!,"Good staff, nice baggage fees, clean planes.  I will also go Southwest is available we're we fly to.  I can't much more than I love flying with Southwest Thanks Southwest!!!!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Awesome flight,"The flight was on time and everyone was polite and very helpful.  Very helpful at check-in,  making it a simple and quick."
Date of travel: April 2019,40,"GREAT COFFEE, AND COMMUNITY","Smooth and easy, the usual great cuppa Community and BelVitas for a morning flight. No hassles, boarding system works just fine. Seats...kinda compact, but economy is what it is."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,The best quality care and patron service,"Southwest Airlines really cares about their passengers and helps out in so many ways starting with helping you find the very best flights for your schedule, two free bags, no fee for cancellation 15 minutes prior to boarding because the absolutely understand life happens. They really, really care and it definitely shows not just over the phone, but on the flight. I definitely recommend Southwest to anyone who loves to travel or needs to for business. You will be taken great care of. Thank you so very much Southwest Airlines for an amazing flying experience."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,No issues,never have an issue with this airlines.  Always pleasant - no delays staff was friendly and cost of trip was reasonable
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Phoenix Flight,"Southwest has many good thngs like free bags to check, but don't care for their policy where you pay to get on the plane sooner.  Let people check in and that should determine when they board."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,On time. Great flight attendants,We took our 4 year old grandson on this trip to Florida to see relatives & friends.When we boarded the pilot invited our grandson to come into the cockpit. A flight attendant took a picture of him sitting at the controls in the cockpit. Then she texted the picture to us so we couldsee & share. We left on time. Changed planes going - easy walk to next gate. We took non stop home. Also left on time & arrived early.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Round trip,Every leg was on time and perfect. The staff was fun and the new NOLA airport is wonderful.  KCMO old airport is horrible but is in process of being replaced.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,New flights to Maui,"Southwest began service to Maui mid-January 2020. Booked in Aug or Sept 2019 (can't recall) on the first morning they offered seats and booked an insanely great deal for round trip tix. We flew from San Jose, CA to Kahului on the 21st of Jan. which was during the first week or so of service. Clean plane. Great scheduling ~ arrived in Maui about 4:30pm. Snack was a clear plastic container w/ Wheat Thins, a white cheddar cheesy spread, Welch's fruit snacks (vile) and pretzels ( I think that was all).  It was OK. Flight time is only about 4 1/2 hours so it was an appropriate snack/diversion. About an hour prior to landing, they passed out Milano cookies and coffee which was kind of a nice surprise. One flight attendant was unnecessarily bossy but everyone else was OK. Would fly to Hawai'i this way again based on the price. On time both ways (actually arrived early in Maui). Bags were delivered promptly. No concerns. Wish Southwest was more attentive to paper waste. There was too much for the flight attendants to store and I saw at least one sack of trash get stored in an overhead bin which was weird but I recognize that there's only so much space available."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Our flight went off without a hitch.,"All of SW employees were friendly and helpful. No charge for luggage. The only thing that happened, was they changed our gate."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight and service,Great non stop flight and great service by the cabin crew very friendly and helpful throughout the service
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Family Holiday Getaway,"Was a good getaway for the family. We have 2 children, age 18 months, and 4 years.  The 4 year old was happy to play video games on my phone. (We don't have any video games at home so she understands to be on the plane to play!)  The little one sat my my wifes lap and fell asleep after watching the takeoff from the window seat.  We appreciate the early boarding that Southwest does, because like many parents we often miss the online check-in taking care of the little ones."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,I have always have had good experiences with Southwest Airlines,I've traveled many occasions with Southwest and every single time it has been a satisfying experience.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,OK flight,"I would definitely advise paying the extra if you want early boarding. My elderly parent was ill and it was definitely worth the extra cost. If not in a rush I would not pay for it. During this flight no drinks or snacks due to weather,"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Christmas travels,"Very friendly service and since bags fly free, I incurred no additional expenses since I used points to travel(aside from the 11.50 security fee). Hobby airport did a good job of getting the luggage in an acceptable time, and the attendants at the luggage area were dressed up for the holidays. I even got a photo with an Elf!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,California Trip,As normal I had a very nice trip to California to see Friends & Family. I was very surprised by the amount of leg room I had on All of the Southwest flights that i had. Between the leg room and the choice of times I would choose Southwest over any other airline. The Best.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,hilton head flight,"Southwest is the only airline that flies non stop from Pittsburgh to Savannah Airport , and Hilton Head Island, our final destination for this trip, is a short 35 minute drive from Savannah airport - left on time and arrived early, which is generally the case with Sourhwest"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good flight for your budget traveling midweek!,"Got a low fare that was less than I would have spent driving to Orlando from Atlanta, so I saved money and physical wear and tear."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great customer care,"For this Quick flight that arrive on time but due to an issue with another plane being stuck in our bay in domestic arrivals our aircraft was diverted to the international arrivals , the staff walked us through the area to find our luggage which did take an hour to get though no fault of the company however they gave us all a $200 voucher valid for a year , very kind in my view."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Love it always,"The before, during and after flight service with Southwest is top notch.  We always fly with Southwest first and foremost."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great airline!,"Good prices, efficient, pleasant staff from check-in to arrivals. The number of bags allowed with no fee is also nice."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Dartmouth,Staff are so polite and helpful.  It’s the only airline we fly. Price is competitive with other airlines and the free luggage can’t be beat.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Would definitely fly again,"Flights were on time. Bags were free.  Staff was friendly. Southwest kept me updated via text messages on my flight, boarding, and such.  Due to my height,I sat in the exit row and had PLENTY of room.  Wasn't nickle and dimed like Spirit.  Pricing was upfront.  WI-FI was easy to use. Southwest provided recent movies and live TV. Pretty good selection of entertainment for the flight. The price for the flight was fantastic as well. Snacks were basic but I knew better to bring my own food for the flight. Overall, I was very pleased! Thank you :)"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Waiting for a response.,"I usually fly southwest airlines.  I really like giving them my business. Their price is usually fair, always appear happy to serve and they always mail me drink tickets.  However,  I'm going to reserve my judgment as I'm waiting for them (for over a month) to get back to me on a claim for my stroller that was broken upon my return to NY on January 8th. I'll update this post to reflect my new thoughts, if any."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Friendly, funny staff","Staff couldn’t have been more helpful.  Flights on time. Plane clean. Easy baggage handling and quick pick up.  Nothing fancy,  but great for the price."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always on time and friendly,"If you've ever flown SWA you know what to expect, funny employees, 2 bags of peanuts, or cookies and a small cup of beverage. I have learned to take trail mix and an empty water bottle to fill just before boarding. I have been flying SWA for 30+ years and have never been late to my destination. They have perfected the art of unloading, refueling, tiding up and boarding and I appreciate that. It would be nice if they could start handing out sanitary wipes so you could wipe down the tray and armrests before settling in."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great airline,The only airline that rivals Southwest is JetBlue.  Southwest has direct flights low cost free checked bags and flexibility for making changes. And are usually on time. I recently flew American Airlines and two out of four of their flights were over an hour and a half late with lame excuses.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Good, no-frills traveling","The Ritz it's not, but you get decent, friendly service. Mostly, the planes are packed. Well, it is what it is. But sometimes they're not. Enjoy! At least this airline gives you a soft drink and pretzels unlike the ""other"" no frills airlines (which I'll never use again). One big reason I use Southwest is that it allows me to avoid O'Hare, the nightmare of nightmares."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Weekly flier,"I fly weekly fromBoise to Ontario on Southwest.  Easy flight, everyone nice.  A direct flight would be great."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Love Southwest,We have flown Southwest numerous times. The Flight attendants are so very friendly and helpful.  We will continue to fly with Southwest. SomThankful there is not a charge for luggage
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Non stop flights,"What a pity that this wonderful non stop has been discontinued. Hopefully, as Boeing returns to the air this will be restarted."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best Airlines in the skies today,"SWA continues to be the best airline when you think of all the things that go into an airline. #1, If I cancel my flight, the money I paid simply goes into an account to use within the year with no penalty, #2 If I make a change, unlike all other airlines that charge a fee to make a change, SWA doesn't charge a penny, #3, My first two bags (and no one ever checks in more than 2) go free.......every other airlines charge for at least 1 if not 2 bags, but not SWA, 4) They have wi-fi (minor charge) but also I can watch TV for free and they get about 15 - 18 channels, so boy does that help bide my time, 5) They are the most on-time airline when it's in their power not related to weather......when a plane comes in, they get the plane back out quicker than any other airline I fly, 6) their flight attendant culture is like no other airline....they are mostly fun, friendly and will go out of their way to help you enjoy your flight..........so yes, I'll fly SWA whenever I can, wherever I go......makes no sense to fly anyone else if I can help it."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Flights are easy to book, luggage is free","Booking a flight on Southwest is easy.  Each traveler can check 2 pieces of luggage for free.  You can also take a carry-on bag and a personal bag at no charge.  Flights are generally on time, and frequently arrive early."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Traveling out West to Utah,Southwest is a fun airline to fly.  Flight Attendants are generally very friendly are are right there to help in any way.  The seating works for me but some people have a problem with it flying with a large family.  Sometimes hard to get seats together.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,camping with 200 lbs of equipment,"I must tell you at 60 my husband and I tent camped and filled four suitcases to almost the max weight of 50ilbs each, It was a site to see us carrying them! Only SWA would let that happen FREE!!!  We are now done tent camping, but we did it!!!! SWA is a great airline to travel love their non-stop from Chicago to San Juan!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great and Friendly Service,This was another great trip on Southwest.  The Southwest people are always friendly and helpful.  Being able to check bags free and not having to drag them through the airport was a major factor for choosing Southwest.  It is great to have an airline that values the customer as a person and not just an ATM.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Pilots needs to listen to medical doctors on medical issues before booting someone off the airplane.,"So, my son had a cough and ended up throwing at a trash can near the boarding gate.One lady who was part of the early boarding noticed and started raising a concern about possible coronavirus infection. Pilot stops boarding.The gate staff called me to discuss and had me talk to a doctor about the background on my son’s condition.The doctor explained the pilot that this is nothing to worry about, but the pilot didn’t allow us to board.How stupid can pilots be?"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Not that Economical Anymore...and Service Sad!,Always have disliked  how SWest herds you behind those numbers and then you have Festival seating...but the worst ins flying in a layover at Midland -Chicago which almost always is a delay and a cluster crap!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Southwest Airlines,"Every time I fly with Southwest, I appreciate them more and more!  It starts with the front check in.  The attendants are always friendly and approachable, even when they must have heard the same questions a zillion times that day.  The gate check in varies; occasionally, there is someone with a sense of humor running the mic and settling the nervous passengers.  The flight crew are professional and helpful and personable.  This last flight was no different.  Each step along the way was incredibly smooth, even the TSA check!  Southwest is, by far, my favorite airline!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always the best,"I was put off by the "" no assigned seating"" policy at first, but I have not flown on any other airline in 7 or 8 years. I will fly to the closest airport that has SWA, then drive to my destination. Their on-time record, and the lack of change fees if/when I get stuck in a meeting or need to cancel makes them the only choice for me. And if i really want a certain seat for a cross country flight, I splurge for the upgrade at the airport. They make flying so easy."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,SW airlines,"Normally don't take Southwest Airlines as I tend to feel like I'm being 'cattle herded"" but our Aunt and Uncle recently came to visit us from LA and just raved about them and how much better they've become in the way of service and pricing.  So decided to fly Southwest on this flight to Denver and YES, I'm now a believer!  No more Frontier, Spririt or JetBlue as these literally charge for every little thing."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Piss poor costumer service,"Checked in for flight in 24 hours so we would get a boarding g position. . Found out they cancelled flight 18 hours before we were set to get on plane. Didn’t have any flights around the time I booked. Major inconvenience. When I booked a different flight to get back home, costumer service rep was not very helpful. I had known how unhelpful they were when trying to arrange a different flight  I would of went with a different airline when I originally booked flight.  Costumer rep could of cared less how much of an I convenience it was. I was very unimpressed with their costumer service when their company was the one to inconvenience me. Airline couldn’t give a reason why it was cancelled. No bad weather.  I will think twice before booking with southwest again!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Arrived Early!,"Great flight, friendly service, free WiFi and luggage,  and we arrived early! Always recommend Southwest!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Never again!,"The whole boarding system stinks!  I hate the fack that it's first come first serve seating and you can't reserve or choose your own seat ahead of time.  And the ay they line you up according to whatever section is one your boarding pass (again chosen by them not you) is just plain bad business.  Both coming and going I had the luck of sitting in the very back of the plane even though I was at the airports 2 hours early each time.  The seats are not comfy, no tv's in the back of each seat so you are forced to use your phone, but no place to charge it so your battery runs down before the flight is over.  Was it worth saving the baggae fees?  Hell no...I'll be a Delta customer for life."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Direct Flight Houston - San Jose - Houston,The service is always good.You know what to expect. Book early and check-in early. The flight staff are always friendly.My preference would be to have a booked seat.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Not a Typical Flight on Southwest,"I’m not sure what the pilot was told about the weather conditions, but we and the flight crew remained seated for the entire flight.  There were a few bumps, but nothing was bad.  We were given two coupons for free drinks only for that flight.  We could not use them because there was no service.The movie I tried to watch had a spotty connection on this full flight. As we departed none of the flight crew even spoke to us to say good bye."
n/a,50,Best crew ever!,"This crew was absolutely amazing and funny, and kept a very awkward situation from turning into a lot of wasted time on the ground! Why people don't just sit in a middle seat instead of aisle and wind."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Outstanding Wheelchair Assistance  Service from Southwest Worker,"The Southwest worker saw us struggling getting off the shuttle from the rental car place, and he immediately came to help.  As always, Southwest employees go above and beyond.  He pushed the wheelchair to get us easily through security and brought us directly to the gate.  My only regret is I didn't get his name to send in a thanks to Southwest"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight r/t MDW to SJD,Great flights.  On time. Super hardworking flight crew - and entertaining!  We decided to fly Southwest and connect through Midway rather than another airline connecting through Houston - I think.  Flight left MDW a little late due to weather - but we arrived in Cabo close to on time.  I really like that southwest doesn’t nickel and dime you to death.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Southwest Hotels - Poor Quality Rooms - Poor Experience,"This review is not against the airline which I love, but since there is no place to address the Southwest Hotels, I am posting here in an attempt to educate and warn others of using Southwest Hotels to book their accommodations.  We recently returned from a 10-day Honeymoon in Hawaii.  We booked three different accommodations through Southwest Hotels.  In all three instances, we were severely disappointed with the room selection upon check-in. Kind of like when flying Southwest and you get that C45 boarding assignment, you know you are screwed,  you can expect that same outcome when you book thru Southwest Hotels. Guarantee you will get that dreaded middle seat, back of the plane, non reclining seat(or room) option! We booked the hotels highest rated Oceanfront room (its our honeymoon!) only to get checked in and find out we were given the view of the pool, slide and 35ft concrete wall of the room next door (wait Oceanfront??) Unfortunately, with Southwest hotels, you pay upfront and it is non-refundable.  We tried to change rooms and when we were unable to, just left the hotel and went elsewhere. I strongly encourage you to avoid our pain and book through the hotel directly or another site, as Southwest Hotels does not carry any weight with the hotels themselves and in turn leave, us, their clients, vulnerable to the worst possible room selections and experiences at our destinations with no option for recourse. I hope this saves you from our pain!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"I like Southwest, but the whole grouping things stresses me out","I like to fly Southwest because they don't charge for baggage, etc... but geez, I HATE the boarding system. The first time I flew (probably 5 years ago)... it wouldn't let me sign in ahead of time and I got in the last group... which meant I couldn't sit next to my boyfriend and we had horrible seats in the back of the plane and no one would move. (I'm a bad flyer, so I really needed him!) --- this time was better... but still, my friend and I had to SEARCH for seats together because everyone was sitting one seat apart even when they said the flight would be completely full.  It gives me anxiety just thinking about having to find seats and what happens if I can't sign in ahead of time!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Above and beyond,From the time I walked to the curbside check in to the time I arrived back I experienced friendly and professional courtesy. The gentleman at the curb ensured I had an extra seat for my trip and was comfortable being a large mammal. He personally walked me to the counter to ensure I was taken care of and had everything I needed for the trip. I've heard nightmares about how southwest treats larger individuals and this couldn't be further from the truth.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Group flight nightmare,"The customer service told me one thing and the fine print said another, long story short I got screwed and had to pay for extra tickets out of pocket"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Basic Point A to Point B travel.,"I flew the route from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas then onward to Boise. The first leg was about five hours long. I had a great seat, no one next to me, but still, five hours! With that said, the flight crew were awesome, the flight smooth, and the bathrooms clean. That's about all you can ask from Southwest. They got me from FLL to LAS and then BOI."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Southwest goes farther!,"This airline goes the extra mile in helping passengers who need assistance. They allow preboarding and give an extra hand when flying with my 92 year old father, be it helping him balance as he enters/exits, keeping an eye out on him if he gets up during the flight, or grabbing bags from me so I can assist him better and making sure a wheelchair has arrived. Those agents who bring the wheelchair are amazing!  They  will make stops along the way for bathroom or to pick up food. When returning, they help retrieve luggage and bring the wheelchair out to shuttle buses/Uber/cabs and more. Our landing was the smoothest I’ve ever experienced and all of the employees from check in to end of flight were cheerful and respectful."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Fake Wheel Chair Pax,"So once again SWA Allows fake wheelchair PAX board before anyone else and take 5 people along to get row 1 without paying for Early Bird.  Way to go SWA. I  can say I tried SWA, but will now go back to whoever will assign a seat. This boarding system is OUT OF CONTROL, just like the Support Animal fiasco."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great airline,I can't recommend Southwest Airlines highly enough. From the moment I walked up to the doors of the Albquerque Sunport to arriving at Philadelphia every Southwest personal I talked to was friendly and helpful. The flight  was on time and the plane was clean and comfortable.If you have never taken Southwest do yourself a favor and book a flight.
n/a,50,Rental  Property Visit ,"This is the first year we flew from Sacramento to Phoenix after many years of driving. Our ultimate destination was Sierra Vista for business.My wife made reservations online and found it easy to book the sale fare advertised. When she had questions she was able to reach a reservation agent quickly. He was excellent in answering all our questions and making sure we had assistance to the boarding gates.The inflight staff was exceptional. They were personable and not mechanical in their service. The flight was boarded in an orderly manner and went smoothly. The trip was pleasant and we didn't come ewacross any rude or annoying passengers. Southwest has come a long way with improving and maintaining their customer service. Keep it up and we will continue to fly.My husband and I flew to Alaska on another airline rated Higher in service.  We  were in first Class seating and this service was a more pleasant experience OVERALL.I am not sure if this is just a great crew , great day or the right employees working together."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight,"We flew direct to Florida for a vacation. It was the easiest time. Having the app on m phone was great because 24 hours prior to the flight, I got a reminder to check in. I love the process of picking your own seat. The best part is that you can check 2 bags if you want to for free!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"“No such thing as 1st come, 1st served on Southwest.”","A little background:  My sweetheart, had a serious fall and injury in October, 2019, requiring surgery as well as weeks of no pressure on her foot, casts, boot, and slow progress.  We needed to get away fro Milwaukee to Phoenix for not only warmer weather, but, also a change of pace.  We booked a flight to Phoenix in November, for a January 27th flight, purchasing Southwest’s EARLY BIRD, thinking my sweet would be able to handle the terminal and TSA.  As it happened we needed her wheelchair to get to the gate.  At check-in, we were told that because we were early we wouldn’t have any problem getting a bulkhead seat which mtsweet needed (the extra legroom).  We we the only ones at the gate, a good three hours before the flight, and when the gate agent arrived (about half an hour before board time), she acknowledged our being there and our need, so we felt secure.  All things changed when a young Southwest employee (male), showed up and at boarding let it be known that all those who could walk with Pre-boarding on their thicket could board, but only those who could walk, no one who needed assistance (wheelchairs included).  My sweetie was beside herself - why have pre-boarding for those who could walk, and not for wheelchair dependent.  Incensed, my sweet argued briefly with that young man who said there was no first come first served at Southwest, despite their early bird program, as well as pre-board program.  This gate person was belligerent, and not at all caring.  The upshot being that my Sweet struggled to get out of the wheelchair and declared she was “walking,” despite her boot and unsteadiness, leaving me behind to do whatever I could with her chair and that gate person.  It seems that this gate person, and maybe Southwest have no regard for those who need assistance onto the plane, as well as access to seats with room (at the front of the plane - walkers with Pre-board would likely take those prime seats, those depriving those who need them to the cramped seating more aft on the plane.  We have always observed those in wheelchairs being the first to be boarded, but we were deprived of our one time need.  I hope this was a one time occurrence because this young man did not like older people with Pre-boarding needs approved by his own employer.  Southwest has always been a favorite of ours, but this is causing us to re-think our position.  My Sweetie managed to hobble her way to a bulkhead aisle, and our flight was uneventful afterwards, with the wheelchair being delivered to the jetway with I’m minutes after our arrival in Phoenix."
n/a,50,Here We Go Again,"Southwest Airlines has never disappointed us. They are almost always exactly on time. I say almost because occasionally they are a few minutes early flying in to a destination and have been a couple of minutes late coming in, but it's not an exact science. The flight attendants are respectful and helpful. You do have to confirm your flight 24 hours in advance to get your boarding pass, which can be an issue while in the mountains with slow internet but we were able to make it work. The flight was great and making the connection to the next was great."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"""Flight was ok""","Everything on the flight was fine, except my husband and I didn't get to set together.  We didn't pay extra for the early bird tickets, so, I guess that is just the way it is.  I was lucky to get a seat by a nice couple, so it turned out ok."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,First and last time...,"Went for Christmas break to DR with 2 kids in a stiller. Most airlines would do family boarding first, or at least after first class boarding. Not SW. we were last. Imagine being last with kids and baggage on full flight over Christmas holiday?!?! Never again."
n/a,30,Early morning flight was great,We left LAS at 6:30 am. Great time to navigate the airport. Flight went great with an available seat open between us. The sunrise was beautiful on the way to SLC. One thing I learned (first time using SWA) was having 2 passengers in the same reservation opted us out of digital check in. I'm not sure what I could have done different. We were checked in but could not print a boarding pass until at airport at the kiosk. That's an example of their system not being very flexible for the user.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,No Assigned seats does not work,"Our flight was excellent, the crew fantastic, helpful, and cordial. My only bone to pick is the policy of no assigned seating. It does not work!!!! My husband and I paid for business select or ""early bird"" seating. We did board ahead of the majority, but our number was in the high 30's. What this means is that thirty some people boarded ahead of us. Perhaps they booked many, many months ahead, I don't know. What I know is that my husband, being a large man, always needs extra leg room space. The thirty people ahead of us took all the leg room seats, obviously. The extra payment ended up being useless because what we wanted was leg room and he did not get it. He was very uncomfortable the whole flight and inconsolable for having paid extra (although it was a symbolic 50 dollars) and not be able to get a wing seat or the very first row seat.  We would not have minded paying extra similarly to other airlines, but be guaranteed some leg room. I would have given this airline a 5 star if it were not for Southwest seating policy. Let me just add that this opinion was shared with other passengers whom we encountered on the same flight and they all showed their  dissatisfaction with the ""no assigned seat policy"""
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"On time, excellent service!","Flying with Southwest is always a pleasant experience. Our flights were on-time and  the attendants are always very attentive and helpful. You can't beat the value with 2 included checked bags. If you haven't flown Southwest before, you need to know that you can't choose your seat ahead of time. You should check in exactly 24 hours before your flight to get a decent boarding position if you are traveling with someone and want to sit together. Families with children can board early in the boarding order so they can sit together, but couples, friends, etc. need to check in early to get a decent position in the boarding order. It's a minor hassle, but we didn't have any problem getting seats together."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Southwest has a problem with early bird,"Southwest has a problem with the way early bird privileges/rights are handled.  YOu no longer get what you pay for because Southwest does not enforce their policy.  The last 5 or 6 flights have all had the same issue - a couple travels together where one individual purchases an early bird ticket and the other does not.  The one purchasing an early bird ticket ""saves"" and aisle or window seat for the ""non early bird"" travelling companion.  When an early bird customer with a higher priority number boards, they are forced to move farther and farther back to get an aisle or window all due to the number of people that are ""saving"" seats (I recently was forced to the 3rd to the last row for an aisle).  The flight attendants do absolutely nothing when this happens.  It's pretty clear that seat selection is based on each individual's boarding number, not the boarding number of their travelling companion.  I'm not sure who is more to blame in this situation, the customer that is unjustifiably ""saving"" a seat, or the airline for not enforcing their policy and delivering on what they are charging an additional $25 for.  As a side note, It's pretty interesting how obnoxious people can be when you tell them they aren't allowed to ""save"" seats.  They'd rather scam the system and screw other customers (who didn't scam the system), then pay the additional $25 for an additional early bird.  It's gotten so obnoxious, that I am travelling United (yuck) when I have a choice and the fare is about the same.  Great example of people doing the right thing getting the short stick with no ramifications to the knuckleheads breaking the rules just to save $25."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,A SW plane half full,"Leaving Aruba is never fun. It's a great island. We fly SW because it is non-stop from BWI, our closest airport in the DC area.We had early bird boarding, which I highly recommend. Total of 85 passengers, and my wife and I each had adjoining aisle seats. No one else in either row. Very nice. Standard SW snacks and drinks. Plane left early and arrived early. Baggage claim was almost instant.Only problem (and it turns out to be a benefit) is that you clear US customs in Aruba. It's therefore two whole lines of shoe and belts off, etc. Being Global Entry saved us 30-45 minutes. You're crazy to fly without it."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,First time Southwest Fliers,"We found a great deal on flights (leaving at zero dark thirty)!  Paid extra for Early Bird Check In.  Got great seats and it was a less than full flight, so we were comfortable."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flights!  Friendly attendants!,I love flying southwest.  Flights were all on time and they offer free live tv and free movies in flight.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great service.,Had to change my itinerary plus had a cancellation of a flight. Everything seems easy with Southwest. No hassle is their way in everything. Staff always courteous and overly helpful. Feel like I’m one of their elite passengers. I had a lengthy itinerary for this trip under three different confirmations but Southwest made them flow and helped along the way when I needed to change.   I fly several different airlines but would choose South west over any alternatives when possible.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Flight OK But MAJOR issue prior to flight,"Flight was your standard no frills flight with fair service by stewardesses.  However, when booking the flight, we mistakenly one week prior to when we were actually when we were going to Cancun.  When trying to explain our mistake, Southwest said ""sorry"", you will now have to pay a higher rate.  Second issue, paid $100 extra to get early seating and couple who flew with us did not pay extra and boarded before us! Big rip off!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Friendly airline with great employees,We left on time and arrived early. The flight attendants were very friendly. My husband had to pre-board for a medical issue and we had absolutely no issues whatsoever.  Everyone was helpful.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Great staff, great entertainment","Flights were on time and arrived slightly ahead of schedule. staff, both ground and air was pleasant.Only possible complaint is the time it takes for bags to arrive in baggage claims."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,holy hell the bathrooms,"Last week we flew Southwest from INdy to Las Vegas.  Wi fi didn't work, so make sure you take a couple downloads with you.  The worst thing were the bathrooms.Everyone knows that airplane bathrooms are tight, but these were ridiculous.   You step in and you literally have to rotate to line up with the toilet..  Trying to not sit on the seat and be able to go was definitely difficult.  I can't imagine anyone over 6'2"" could even get in....."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Better,"Better staff, better seats, earlier arrivals, quick luggage retrieval and a sense of humor. When making a rough landing the pilot immediately came on the intercom and said,”We made it!”"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"No muss, no fuss. Simple and orderly, even in bad weather!","Full flight, but still left on time and arrived early. Crew was helpful and everyone was seated in a timely manner. For an early morning flight, it was as good as it could have been. Can't go wrong when taking one of the first flights of the day."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Typical SW flight,Flight left on time and arrived a little early both going and coming back. Checked bags were at carousels in a reasonable amount of time. Still don't care for the unassigned seating but that's the way it always has been.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Must Do the Southwest Airlines Reservations Again.,"I must say that when I booked Southwest Airlines from the Booking number +1(803)373 8382 I easily book  my ticket hassle free. I got the discount also. Also in the airlines it used to normal flight. Proper services , better leg room. food and etc."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love the Service,"Southwest flight attendants are the best, still get snacks and two bags free.  One Suitcase and a set of golf clubs.   The only way to travel."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Never an Issue on SWA,I always fly Southwest when I can to my destinations when available.  As long as you know their ticketing and seat assignment process it is always smooth flying.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Quick and inexpensive!!,"I took a one-way flight from a driving destination in Los Angeles back to home in Kansas City.  The non-stop Southwest flight was $95, and I paid the extra $25 for automatic check-in (got queue A48).  The flight was on time, with no baggage fees.  Excellent value and excellent service!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,No crashes,"Traveling on Southwest has two main perks:The ability to change a flight without a charge;Two free checked bags per passenger.Other than that, it is just a modern plane with too small seating, lousy snacks, and indifferent service from underpaid workers. Some people like the way they seat passengers and others don't. We used to like it better until they decided to let people pay to jump the line.All that said, we try to fly Southwest whenever possible. However, next time we don't want to use the Tampa airport so we will have to choose another airline in order to fly into the Clearwater airport. The Tampa airport does have two smoking sections inside security which is a huge plus for smokers and taxpayers who have to pay for more TSA when the only place to smoke is outside of security."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Been Great to Flight on.,I’ve been splitting my time working in Sacramento and San Diego the passed 3 years. I’ve been flying back and forth on Southwest Airlines. It’s been a good experience. Lots of flights available each day. I highly recommend Southwest Airlines.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always a smooth experience flying SWA,Smooth trip down and back. SWA has it dialed and has fun while dialing it! Love the Suduko puzzles in the in flight mag.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight to Austin,"Southwest never disappoints. When flying for personal reasons, they’re always my go-to. Unfortunately, when flying for business they aren’t always able to accommodate my often - last minute - itinerary. Otherwise, no complaints except I wish they’d change their drink coupon program. I spend a lot of my own money (not company reimbursed) and don’t reap the rewards or full benefits."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,New appreciation,I am compelled to write this review not because of Any particularly great exception è but rather because I recently had to fly with a different airline (American). Every experience we had reminded me of how much better Southwest was in all of those areas.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Service,"I travelled to and from Dallas Love field and Buffalo International in the past month. It was the first time I flew with Southwest, and I chose them for the free baggage. I am very impressed. Southwest allowed me to change my flight out for free after bad weather was predicted at my layover. After my flight back, my luggage did not appear on the baggage carousel. The representatives were able to find out my baggage never got on the plane with me. I was given the option of retrieving my lost baggage from the airport and recieving a $200 transferable flight voucher or having my bags delievered to my house. I chose the later. My flight landed at noon and my luggage was delievered at 8 pm the same day. Mistakes happen, and I am pleased Southwest fixed their mistake in a timely manner. I will fly Southwest again."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Late late late ,"Hot as hell on board, all packed in like sardines. Flight delayed at lease 40 mins. Not impressed. Not sure how hard it is to get these short haul flights in and out on time. Other airlines manage it"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Alright, but.....","I have flown a lot.  I have flown Southwest a lot, since the '70's.  I have never flown and not had a tray table - until yesterday.  I was in Row 1 with the bulkhead in front of me.  That has never been a problem on other airlines, they simply provide a tray that comes up out of the armrest.  For some reason, Southwest has chosen to not do this.  Due to the lack of a tray table, I chose to forego the snack and drink offerings because I didn't want to juggle them (especially the cup of ice) for 45 minutes or so until the flight attendant came around to collect trash.  I also use the tray table to support the book that I'm reading.  How much money did Southwest save by not installing 6 armrest tray tables?  Is it worth it?"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,First and Last! ,SJU-MCO Southwest feb 5 2020Flight 1250 my seat 17B Latino 5’8- 5’9 was in the back of the plane almost all the time; was upset since we got in the flight and treatment of disrespect.  First time asked for water he denied it even when we told him it was for a medicine and second time ask for a Coca Cola for my wife and a beer for me was very rude he asked to pay first and delayed the service. When I pushed the button so he could get the garbage he told me he wouldn’t take it so I proceed and took it my self; very upset voice he tells me we had to wait until the end of the flight for someone to pick it up! (It was only a can and a Nabisco ritz paper) then he told me report me but didn’t have me his name; then came and threaten me with another flight attendant (this is the guy and something else that didn’t get to hear well). We were a large group with kids 81 in total and after asking 90% felt miss threatened.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Hung up on four times by a Southwest Customer Support,Tried to get assistance on using unspent credits from a flight I didn’t use to go towards a purchase of a new flight. Customer service hung up on me four times without giving me assistance. The Southwest Ap is poorly designed when trying to use unspent credits. It was a very poor experience.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Shamed for Preboarding,"I hadn't even made it onto the airplane when Janice, the ""attendant"" at the gate, started ripping into me about pre-boarding. ""I can't just let you pre-board. You have to have a medical reason or need assistance,"" she said in a very hostile, indignant tone. I didn't know what she was talking about. Nobody had ever grilled me before about my medical reason for my pre-boarding. I showed her my cane and said I had a hard time walking. She didn't miss a beat, snapping at me that she couldn't see my cane over the counter and that the cane was considered ""assistance."" She also said I'd wasted my money in buying early bird/business class. All in this brittle, hostile voice. Like the textbook mean English teacher at everyone's school. Then, minutes later after we'd sat down in the waiting area, she actually picked up her microphone and went over the PA system to ""remind"" us all that we couldn't just pre-board, and had to have a medical/assistance reason. Just to clear up any confusion. She publicly humiliated us. I am sorry that woman is so angry, but she shouldn't be the face of Southwest. We filed a complaint. It took a lot of back and forth before anyone contacted us. They gave us minor compensation. But unfortunately, things like that really put a cloud over one's vacation and leave a bad memory for a long time. Southwest, try to hire positive people. You're slipping."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good experience,"Flight was good, no surprises. The boarding time was much more on time compared with other airlines I've flown with recently. Not a huge fan of not having assigned seats, but it is what it is."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Will Fly Southwest Again,"Great Flight...had a singing airline attendant.  She did a great job.  Also, one of the other attendants was very helpful in finding my husband and I seats together. He helped us with our carry-ons and was extremely courteous  Wish I could remember his name.  Flight was on time both ways - happy about that!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Direct flights,"Living near Baltimore, Southwest Airlines at BWI offers direct flights to the popular resort areas in the Caribbean and eastern Mexico resorts. Using their fares calendar to book makes things easy and helps us find the best prices. Checking in and baggage check seems to go very quickly. We get early bird check in because on other airlines we would find ourselves sitting apart. Never had a bad experience and would recommend Southwest to anyone."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Low Stress & Free Jokes,"SouthWest makes it so easy to fly.  The rates are very competitive and I love not having extra fees for our luggage (2 bags per customer). The staff is helpful and the flight attendants are the most creative and funniest people you could meet. The free wifi, movies and TV are a plus. I wish more airlines followed their example. Their seating can be a little confusing for the beginner, but most fellow passengers are willing to assist."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Flights on Southwest were unimpressive.,"Southwest will get you where you are going but I can't say much of anything else good about them. I hate their boarding process by ""pole position"". Everyone who gets on the plane first and takes up all the aisle and window seats first leaving on the center seats open. The flight attendants even joked if you have a C group board position that stands for ""center seats"". The plane was also very dirty. The try tables were filthy. Beverage service and smack were minimal and very slow."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Smooth On Time Flight,"Smooth flight, we landed on time.  Cabin crew were great as always with Southwest.  We booked a direct flight, 5 hours to San Francisco.  The middle seat remained empty giving us plenty of room.  I was able to sleep for half of the flight.  We could not get the inflight entertainment to work on our smartphones."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Pure Awesomeness,Best experience I've had with an airline yet. They definitely go above and beyond to make customers happy! I'll go to Southwest first before looking into booking with anyone else.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Annual vacation,Love flying SW whenever we can. Finally starting back nonstop flights from MKE to Cancun. They will always have high recommendations from me. Great people to work with. Will use them whenever I can.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,One Stop Flight,"Although we had a layover in Baltimore, this gave us an opportunity to have some fresh made sushi opposite Gate 7.  Also, the trip from Baltimore to Providence was running 50 minutes behind, but arrived almost on time.  Great Southwest experience and now we don't have to go to Boston to travel to the Caribbean."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always great service with no hassles and free luggage,always great service plus no luggage fees and can cancel or change flights and keep the resulting credit!
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"Snowstorm caused havoc, Southwest kept changing my flight","I know it was a snow storm and things get canceled but , Southwest 5 times kept moving me around , finally I canceled the flight and re booked myself on a better flight , still on southwest. Of course a stop so really a 3 hour flight turns into a 7 hour day through Denver. Southwest has no directs from Minneapolis anymore"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Vacation,Have officially started using Southwest Airlines. Their customer service friendliness and professionalism wowed me in comparison to the airline I had previously used for 15yrs.  I do definitely recommend their service.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Reliable, punctual, friendly and good value","Southwest consistently delivers a quality product. This flight left exactly on time and arrived early. The terminal is spacious, with comfortable seating including adequate numbers of power outlets. The gate agents and flight attendants were friendly and helpful as usual. Boarding was efficient and there was more than sufficient overhead storage."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,If only they could get the bags to you faster,"Nice flight attendants and on-time to early arrivals almost make up for some interminable waits for baggage. Snacks were ok, but they could offer the morning cookies in the afternoon. Good seats.  Plenty roomy.  I fly Southwest every time I can,  because I like not having change fees."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,BEST AIRLINE CREW,Best Service Round Trip Tampa To Providence...Always Satisfied With the Crew And Flight! Direct Is The Way To Go...Amazing Airline
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Another messed up flight by SWA.,"My last 8 flights have all been SERIOUSLY delayed with 2 full plane changes. They used to be my favorite airline but now I will avoid them at all cost. All the good things Jim Collins and other thought leader authors wrote about them have expired. SWA is just a another time teller, not a time piece any more. They are a mess !!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Rude passengers,"First let me say that I love Southwest, almost always friendly, courteous and accommodating. I have only had one unfriendly crew member and I fly SWA 75 to 100 times a year. Now, other passengers are a different story altogether...many times I have been witness to the most rude, uncouth and downright nasty passengers. How many times during the boarding process do other passengers bang into you with their suitcases, backpacks or other items? Just today I had a passenger on the other side of the isle sling his backpack and hit me square in the head...no apology, instead he said I should have been looking out. WTF?Then, two rows behind is a guy in pajama pants and a T-shirt that looks and smells like he has been sleeping in them for days. What is with the behavior? I like to be comfortable but not offensive to others in the process. Am I wrong?"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Compassionate,"Upon landing, my wife turned on her phone to find a relative had died while we were in the air.As soon as we got to the terminal, we asked if SW could get us back. The agent found two seats back the same day. In Season!Great service from a great airline."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flights were on time.,"Check-in/Bag drop started late from MBJ as the security was not present. I am still not sure what that person's purpose is at that point however all other agents were present and the counters manned. Aan announcement was made to advise us of the delays with check-in.There was no straight flight from MBJ to MCO this year so it connected in FLL (Last year I was able to get a non-stop MBJ-MCO.  I got non-stop on the return)  It was just enough time to clear Immigration and collect my bags and clear security and get to the boarding gate.  FLL-MCO was quick.  Flights were on time and even landed a bit early which was appreciated.Flight crew was warm and friendly. Incidentally, some were the same on both flights even though it was a different aircraft."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Going to cousin’s funeral,"I traveled on Southwest, because the price was better than other airlines.  I had to leave on Wednesday and return on Tuesday to get the best price, but I visited my son, as well.  The flight was good.  The stewards and stewardesses have a sense of humor.  A steward on the first flight even sang a song.  I had plenty of leg room, didn’t have to pay to check my bag, and brought snacks from home.  Small snacks were given on board, as well, with drinks like coffee or soda.  The flight was smooth most of the way except over the Rocky Mountains, which is expected.  I will be flying Southwest again for the price and the savings."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always great service,"Always a great airline!  Every staff member we encountered was super friendly.  The plane was clean and the flight staff was great!  Our pilot communicated several times with the passengers, which I love for them to remember us and interact.  We always try to fly Southwest."
n/a,50,Like None Other,"After being on nearly 100 airlines in my lifetime, I must say Southwest is my favorite. Everything from its flexibility, service, commitment to client, and staff treatment has been top notch. I know this airline has its hiccups once in awhile. But if you really want a stress free travel experience with good prices and flexibility, Southwest is your airline."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Wavering loyalties,"I've been a loyal Southwest customer for about 20 years now. They were usually the first airline I would check on before comparing other airline rates. But this last trip from Buffalo to Houston and back to Buffalo left a bad taste in my mouth. I could understand one flight being off but with a layover both ways, we took 4 different planes round trip. Every flight had issues! The WiFi had a charge per day and there were no discounts or benefit to being a rewards member. The price wasn't too steep but the service was awful. Connecting was terrible and spotty or not even feasible at times. Most of the movies would not load and the quality was terrible. The flight staff was excellent for both our 2nd flights per day of travel. The first flights both days of travel had very rude, unkind and unhelpful flight staff. They took a really long time to bring out drinks even after recognizing our kids were complaining of thirst.Even before getting through security at the 2 airports, the staff was quite stern and not very helpful when we asked simple instruction questions."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Nice flight!,"I enjoy flying southwest. This trip we had done really fun flight attendants. We sat at the back of the plane and the one flight attendant had such a funny personality and just used humor to make it fun for us. Plus, got a few extra drinks on the house. It was so fun!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Early Bird Ripoff!,Never get Early Bird Check-in!  It’s a scam. Bought this for $25 to “get a better boarding position and automatic check-in” 36 hours before the flight but only got B28. Really?!?  Which means 88 other people also  got this and I did not really get a “better boarding position” for my $25. Even spoke with Felicia the supervisor who tried to defend this deceitful practice and said she couldn’t refund or do anything about it. I travel every week for work and from now on Delta will be my choice airline.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Recommend!,"Getting boarding passes and checking luggage with Southwest at the airport was easy with self checkout. If you don’t remember to check in online exactly 24 hours in advance, you’ll be at the back of the plane.We still managed to get decent seats where we sat 2 and 2 together.Flight attendants were rushed with snack and drink service.Landing in Buffalo is so easy. This is a great airport to fly in and out of. Not too big. Easy to find your way around. WAY less expensive than Toronto."
n/a,50,The Best US Domestic Airline Game Over,"Easy check-In in Mexico, and you still get 2 checkin bags, which is great when you are on an active holiday (we had our own snorkel gear packed). We opted for the priority seating, so we had the pick of seats, although the flight was only 2/3 full, so most people amhad a window or aisle anyway. Comfortable seats, a stopover in Denver where we got really good dinner food (big salads) to take on our second flight, and home right on time. Luggage came out promptly."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Love Southwest,BWI is a hub for Southwest so loads of nonstops! Love that! The Second Seat Policy makes them my first choice. I’m a large person and always buy a second seat in coach to get the most room. Southwest lets you preboard with a companion and will ALWAYS refund the cost of the second seat! Love that! Bags fly free! Love that!Love Southwest!!!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Flight,As always The flight flight was very good. The flight attendants were quite humorous while still maintaining a level of professionalism while addressing the onboard instructions. All needs were met and all in all a very good flight. Would fly Southwest again without a doubt.
Date of travel: March 2019,50,always had excellent service and flight,Unfortunately  they do not fly out of Knoxville  have to drive to Nashville closest    always had good service with them and miss being able to use them   I use allegiant and frontier  out of knoxville but they only go south in the wintrer not north
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Another great flight on SWA,"We travel Southwest frequently.  Flights are almost always on time. In this case our flight arrived early. Because SWA is one of the biggest carriers at these airports, wait times at the gate or runway are almost non-existent.  The flight attendants are usually very friendly"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Death in the Family,"We had to make a last minute unplanned trip due to an imminent death in the family. Reviewed all the airline prices and decided on Southwest because of the free (two per person) baggage check in. As has been our experience in the past, Southwest was “on time” for both routes. The fight attendants were very attentive and accommodating. One was even funny and entertaining. (Think he enjoys his job.)Only recommendation would be for Southwest to have more seating space for those who are handicap and require more seating area. Otherwise, uneventful trip. Recommend Southwest highly."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Smooth flight, on-time Arrival","Left 15 minutes late due to a problem getting a handicap aboard, but pilot made up the time and arrived as scheduled (usually arrive 15 minutes early).  Outgoing flight attendants and plenty of snacks for the taking.  Easy on and off."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Southwest is always a good choice,"We flew Southwest down and back to Tampa.  Direct flight on the way down and one stop on the way home.  Both times the planes landed before the designated time.   Flights were great and smooth.  My husband who isn't fond of flying didn't even notice taking off on the flight down.   The flight attendants are wonderful, humorous, and human. I always fly SWA when I can."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent Curbside check-in and wheelchair assistance at PIT; wonderful in flight stewards.On time departure/arrival,"Excellent Curbside check-in and wheelchair assistance at PIT by Byan; wonderful in flight stewards. On-time departure/ early arrival, however aircraft did have to wait for a SW gate to open before we could deplane in FLL.  At FLL the wheelchair attendant abandoned my wife at the arrival gate: He just walked away so  I had to navigate to baggage claim with our carry-ons. Bags arrived on a different carousel than posted."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Religious trip to Havana,Very timely.  Attentive to our needs and questions regarding Cuban visa.  Staff at check in was efficient and courteous.  Flight attendants were very friendly.  Amazingly quick fights.  In flight services were good.  Fights were on time.  Lay over in Ft. Lauderdale was excellent.  Will recommend again.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Round trip flight with Southwest Airlines,My wife and I always fly Southwest Airlines.  Our round trip flight from Seattle to Las Vegas was perfect.  Flight there and the flight back was on time and went just fine without a hitch.  I would highly recommend using Southwest Airlines for all your flying travel needs.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always appreciate the staff,There are always exciting things that happen in Southwest flights! For this one the flight attendant had his Ukulele and so did one of the passengers. They played ‘You are my Sunshine’ and a lot of the passengers sang. Then just the flight attendant played ‘Rainbow Connection’. It was a great way to start an early morning flight!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent Flight with Great Attendants,"Great flight, we got in early on a smooth and comfortable flight.  The attendants were very friendly, courteous and helpful and efficiently managed the boarding process.  Seats were comfortable and we did not feel cramped.  Pay the extra for priority or early boarding it is worth it.  If you don't you get a boarding number based on when you check in, either online or at the airport.  Regulars know to check in 23 hours and 59 minutes before the flight to get a descent seat.  I learned long ago to just pay the extra and you automatically are in the first boarding group."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Overall,"Nice smooth flight and efficiently managed by flight attendants.  I do recommend paying the fee for early boarding, as there are no assigned seats. I have flown Southwest for years and after a couple of experiences where I was late in the boarding process, I had to check my carry-on because there was no room in the overhead.  The seats were comfortable and if you download the Southwest App to your phone or tablet, you can watch free entertainment on the flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,I absolutely DO NOT recommend Southwest airlines,"The Southwest staff were very unfriendly to my family and me. This is the last time my friends and family are taking southwest. I absolutely DO NOT recommend them. Hopefully, everyone else will have better experiences with them once they manage to train their staff members to not have attitude when talking to their customers."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Don't Forget Anything on the Plane,"I have always been pleased with Southwest.  They seem to have lost their ""funny"" on the flights which is one of the reasons I preferred them but they seem to be all business now.  I'd like to see that come back.  The fight was great and the pilots are amazing.  Landings were almost glass-smooth both ways.  Granted the weather was pretty nice but still, I remember some landings with the old Northwest Air.  ""How many times can we touch down?"" moments.  I do have one single significant regret from the trip but it wont impact my overall review of the flight.  My daughter forgot her homework binder in the front pouch of the plane.  She had been working on it through the flight and put it in the pouch to take a break.  Needless to say, it was forgotten.  YOU MUST REMEMBER IN 24hrs.  Outside that window, if it is found, goes back to corporate.  We didn't know that and returned to the airport the second day to try to get it.  This is where things go south.  While speaking to the Southwest employee regarding the loss, the employee disengaged from the conversation to speak to another.  Not regarding business but...""Hey girl, what's up...etc, etc.""  Then comes back, where we continued mid-sentence on the issue.  It then happened yet again with another person!  Really, twice in one converstion?  Unbelieveable.  Once we were informed of the policy and the conversation ended we began to leave. Looking back I see the girl talking with another associate and does the fists under the crying eyes motion.  Completely unacceptable as my daughter was distraught that all of her school work and review work was gone just before finals.  You must send an inquiry to recover lost items.  Guess what, it's ~$30 to do the inquiry and there is no guarantee it will be found.  Tough sale for a binder but good on-plane inventory lesson learned."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Flight,"Great round trip experience. Both flight left slightly early. And got us early arrivals. Great, friendly flight crew! Comfortable seating and no luggage charges! Three pieces! Luggage service was good on both ends. Truly the LUV airline!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Great Flights, early arrival, bags arrived when we did!","The attendants were professional and friendly. I like flying this airline because the price you pay is what everybody else pays. There is no nickel and diming, free bags and decent seats. No charge for coffee etc."
n/a,50,SW Airlines has excellent service and on time record.,"We fly SW several times a year from Chicago to Cancun/Cozumel. We live half time in Chicago + Cozumel. Southwest is always our 1st choice. Direct both ways, no layovers, 2 bags free and MDW is more convenient than ORD."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Affordable, no frills, on time",You get what you pay for but that's fine with me.  Great service.  On time.  That's all I can ask for and I'm satisfied.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flying experience,"The airline was onbtime. The employees, both on the ground and in the air, were helpful and accommodating."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flexibility is key!,I was able to change this flight four times for no cost! I really love the flexibility of Southwest. I will continue to book all travel on this airlines
n/a,50,SWA-Always the best choice,Flew from Phoenix back home to Chicago on January 7th. I never fly in the winter time but I had to attend an event. As much as I can I use Southwest airlines because I don't have to worry about paying for bags especially flying back home and in the winter when you need more clothes. Both my flights there and return flight were 30 minutes early! This happens to me often on SWA and they are always on time at least if not early.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,rude and unprofessional flight attendants,"I needed to use the bathroom and asked one of the flight attendants/ Ebony if I could wait in front of the plane for the bathroom to become available, she said no in a rude tone of voice. I returned to my seat and waited. As soon as the bathroom sign indicated availability I got up and started walking towards the bathroom, she started yelling at me to go back and sit in my seat, I walked towards her trying to let her know that the bathroom was now available. She got in my face, grabbing my arm and pushing her chest against mine. yelling not letting me talk. I told her to step back and let go of my arm. She refused and continued to yell. At this point another attendant came and threatened me to get me arrested when we landed. I finally went back to my seat, shaking and terribly upset. I am a 65 year old woman 5 ft, 115 pounds. This attendant was about 5.8 weighing probably about 200 pounds. I believe if she was confronting someone even a little volatile younger/bigger than me this would lead to a physical confrontation jeopardizing the safety of all the passengers. Southwest airline should do a much better job training their flight attendants how to deal with their customers. Very disappointed."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"When I fly, I prefer Southwest Airlines","I choose Southwest Airlines every chance I get because: the staff is more customer service oriented, they are treated better by leadership and it shows in their customer care, flight staff are allowed to have a sense of humor and actually interact with customers, passengers are more relaxed, and flight maintenance is definitely a priority....safety first!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest is the Best!,"Southwest always has been ontime for us, they serve snacks and drinks that you have to pay for on other airlines, and I think you are getting a great price compared to the big airlines."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flying with Southwest,The flight was good. Only thing that surprised us was there were no seat numbers. You check in based on your Zones? or something I cannot recollect. Once in flight just sit wherever you feel free. Not sure if it is good or bad. We always got last rows..
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"January 12, 2020","There were no delays, we landed a little early also. The flight attendants were good. Your bag always flys for free. Get the early boarding pass, worth the $15.00 extra. You board early that means you can be some of the first to unload. The only thing is the seating accommodation are little small. Seems like the luck of the draw when you get stuck next to a really large person sitting next to you. Stan H."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Took amazing care of me!,"I had a medical emergency on the flight, and the flight attendant was very quick to respond,  helpful, and kind. Southwest wound up having to ground our flight early (thankfully at our original destination) and they were efficient and took excellent care of me until medics could take me off of the plane. I am very grateful to them."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Traveling from Minneapolis to New Orleans,"Despite unpredictable winter weather in the Twin Cities both  traveling to and from, Southwest was on time and made the usual great customer service experience available.  Flights were on time and uneventful.  I count on Southwest to deliver a great overall customer service experience and they rarely, if ever do not provide a pleasant trip."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flying to abq,"Swa does not charge for every bag, and all the hidden charges the other  airlines charge.plus the system to get on the plane is very easy.you call 24 hours before you leave and get boarding pass with a,b,c inthe card the early you call the the better it is to board early.I fly swa always."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Simple, friendly, convenient","We opted to fly from LAS because of the lower airfare cost. The staff was friendly, love that there are no extra charges.  Too bad SW does not fly out of Fresno, CA."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Wonderful in every way,"Southwest usually has a good flight crew (with a few occasional exceptions) but this was the best one in a long, long time.  Even though it was a 6 AM flight, they were pleasant, fun and accommodating.  Boarding was efficient as usual, the flight was on time. Baggage handling was slow but that is always the case in Orlando no matter what airline we fly."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Lost items in bag and camera for work,"I traveled from LAX to Las Vegas and in LAX gave my bag to the Southwest skycap to check my bag. I arrive home to someone else items in my bag. I have been without my camera and equipment for 3 days now which I make a living doing photography work. I am also missing my clothes that was in the bag. I have called, emailed and Twitted to get Southwest to correct the problem and I have not been offered ANYTHING to replace my camera or missing items. I have been doing all the calling and emailing and the customer service and sense of urgency to correct the problem is HORRIBLE.Waiting for reimbursement for items."
Date of travel: February 2019,40,Always fly SWA,"We always fly Southwest Airlines when possible.  Easy to book, easy to use app, bags fly free, almost always on time or early, very affordable. Never lost my luggage.  Friendly staff."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Another great flight,"Another great trip with good airline service.  No delays, comfortable airline seats. WiFi, polite staff."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Honolulu to San Juan-Great Nonstop,"Flying from Honolulu to San Jose was a pleasant experience.  The attendants were super, the timing couldn't have been better, and we even arrived 15 minutes early.  I fly Southwest often and choose them when I can."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,What happenned to assigned seating?,"The service workers , including check in, stewards,baggage all very good.  Overall flight was uneventful,which I imagine is very good these days. I only question whatever happenned to assigned seats??? My wife and I were seperated on both flights."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Southwest Now Doing Predatory Pricing,"I used to consider Southwest Airlines to be friendly to its customers. Recently, however, I've discovered that Southwest has moved to ""hyperdynamic pricing"". This is where they raise rates almost instantly on a flight in which you've shown interest (via a search on their site or an effort to modify an existing reservation). If you take a few minutes to think about a flight before purchasing, they'll increase the price on you...sometimes considerably. IMHO, this is a form of predatory pricing, designed to coerce the consumer to make a purchase immediately, and to extract an increase (and a high percentage one at that) if you don't. Southwest can no longer be considered friendly to consumers. This is predatory behavior at its worst."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Southwest is the Airline!,Staff is always helpful and friendly.  I like the line-up verses a assigned seat. I have only had one delayed/cancelled flight and they made it right with a voucher towards next trip!
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good flight,Flight was fine. Not full. Staff as usual very friendly and helpful. Keep the 2 free bags forever. Wish they had more snacks
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Fll to PHX,"Great service, kept us laughing.  Flight was 15 minutes late for departure. Stewardess and steward gave us constant attention giving the feeling of personalized attention."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always fly Southwest,It's always important to check in 24 hours in advance to get your place in line.  This is a no frills airline that is comfortable and efficient.  You are allowed to change or cancel a flight without penalty.  It is the best airline to use.  The entertainment on board is very good and better than other airlines.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Canceled reservation,At the last minute I canceled my reservation with them three hours before flight. I received a love credit which I took a screenshot. 6 hours later I received a email from them saying that my reservation was never canceled and they took the 350.00 of the total flight. Called customer service which was not helpful at all. Was a totally loyal customer for 10 years...They are definitely changed.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good flight,"Flight was on time, plane was not full, so I was able to have a row  to myself. They now charge for bags, but that is understandable. Friendly stewardesses.  Plane was on time and ride was comfortable."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Top Notch Customer Service for New Marine Mom,I Would like to shout out to Henry who helped me when I called customer service today.   He was able to fix our dilemma involving my new Marine's flight back after his first 10 day leave. He graciously explained the ins and outs of what Southwest offers active military personnel.    My son and I are very appreciative for the time he spent answering questions and clarifying misunderstandings. Cheers to Henry! : )
Date of travel: January 2020,50,great airline,great airline  staff is terrific  you must print boarding pass 24 hours before flight  if you need help they are there for you  easy baggage checkin  easy security if you have PRECHECK  they left on time and we arrived early on both trips if fact the return flight got in 30 minutes early you get a snack and beverage and the staff is really caring
Date of travel: November 2019,50,awesome,My experience with Southwest Airlines was great. They were on time and the flight was smooth. The stewardess was very friendly as well. I will be flying with this airline again
Date of travel: January 2020,40,PLEASE GIVE HUSBAND and WIFE back to back Numbers when they book their flights together!!!,"I bought and BOOKED a ticket for myself and a ticket for my wife on SAME RESERVATION.When I checked in 24-hours ahead of flight, I was given the number A-17 and she was given number B 41.That is around 80 people between us when boarding.WHY    WHY    WHY?????????????????Why not give a husband and wife back to back numbers so they can board plane together??????????????????????????????????SOUTHWEST          PLEASE change your method of issuing numbers!!!!!!!!!!!!"
n/a,50,Hassle Free,We flew Southwest Airlines from IND to FLL and back again in January 2020. We did not have any problems with anyone with Southwest. Everyone was friendly and efficient.  We will definitely fly with them again.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,First trip on Southwest and not impressed at all,"My first ever Southwest flight and it started with a bad experience.i was allowed 2 check-in bags and I had a suit pack (to carry my blazer)with me , which was considered extra baggage and my carry on was forced to check in.Am not sure if I lack common sense on space issues on flights or it's Southwest.. am not impressed...there are lot of empty carry on spot on the flight.."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best airline rewards program...period!,"I travel over 200k miles per year and try my best fo fly SW whenever I can. Sure you don't have the first class cabin perks - but the rapid reward program is by far the best in the industry for free flights and companion pass service. If you fly only a few times a year, SW is a pretty good bargain and on-time performance is super. But if you're a road warrior, and you like to use points for personal travel, you simply can't beat SW.Now that they've added international travel to their portfolio, as well as flights in and out of Hawaii, they really are a great option."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Employees,"The flight attendants did a wonderful job.  Funny, Professional, Caring.  It was so nice to see a team that took pride in their jobs!  Please use them as role models."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Still Our favorite,"On time the on the outbound flight with a great crew and smooth boarding.  Half our delayed on the return flight due to toilet troubles.  The crew was great and the flight was smooth, especially the landing.  the crew made up for the delay with great service."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight and excellent service,I loved the flight and the service. I have always flown on Southwest and have always loved every flight. Southwest is always my first choice.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great perks with credit card.,"I have a Southwest credit card. You get 4 free upgrades per year. I don’t pay for early bird. Pay a little extra and be given seats A1-15. I’m not going to pay for early bird then get a B boarding #. This being because if you’re a family you don’t need to pay to board early. Families often get on before people who’ve paid to get on early. Get the card and board early, free, four times a year. I do wish paying for business included luggage up to 70 pounds. The drink selection is good. Overall, good value airline."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Great flight and service,"Always love flying Southwests lots of direct flights, free checked bags and great service from the flight attendants.  Only thing that bothers me is we are expected to figure out how to put our own tags on the bags, since I do this 1-2 times a year feel little apprehensive that I will do it right and not lose my bag.  Southwest employee just stood there and watched me struggle with putting it on...no offer to help..cost them a star on rating"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Smooth flights,We typically fly Southwest Airlines when we travel to Florida and the flights are smooth and stress-free.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,It was Southwest nothing different,"Nothing different even though you're going on a 5-hour flight over the ocean to an exciting destination. I was a bit surprised that Southwest did nothing to play on the fact your flying to Hawaii. Good people working hard for sure, but the food was a bag of carbohydrates, a couple of drink services and a final water pass. WiFi was sketchy both ways going and coming back. If you're not tech-savvy you watching a movie could be difficult. If you don't bring your own device you're left to your own devices as there is nothing to do but sit and read or sleep. The legroom was nice though. It's a 737-800 nicely done, 6 wide. BTW don't sit in the front row as the arm rests are your trays. Very uncomfortable.I've never liked their boarding system, but it is what it is. So if you like Southwest it's just that Southwest. If you don't, then again it's Southwest, nothing special."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Always a good flight,"Southwest is the most cost effective flight for me. Everyone at Southwest from the check-in person to the airplane hostess are always smiling and very helpful. Boarding passes are online 24 hours in advance which you will receive you boarding group and number. It is  Open seating which means once on the plane you can choice your seat.Most Seats are comfortable. I had recent surgery and certain seats can not fit in due to wide hips which are in the front row which has the most leg room. Bummer since I have long legs. Suggestions bring your own food to eat a drink and snack pretzels are basic snack,"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Nonstop from Atlanta to Las Vegas- December 2019,Positives: flight was great; plane in good condition; attendants were wonderful; Pilots were welcoming and pleasant upon boarding and off boarding. Snacks were decent for a 3 hour flight. Negatives: Early flight at 6am EST. In my opinion I would not do this again if flying to a different time zone. In Atlanta it is so busy and traffic to get there is usually a pain. So in order to make it on time I left my home at 3am arrived at the airport in plenty of time. Flying to Vegas put us there 7ish am which made for a very long day and I didn't enjoy my first day as I was very tired. Next time I would book mid day.I checked in my luggage (one bag) and it was lost once I got to Vegas. The claim office checked the status and found my luggage was on the way to Chicago but would be back in Vegas later in the day. The Claim office rep said they would deliver to my hotel. I went all day without any of my things.Thankfully my luggage was delivered later that evening.Also because seating on Southwest is a first come first service basis and by order of letter/ numbers you need to check in early on line to get first call so you have seat choices. If traveling with a more than one person everyone needs to check in online early so you can be seated together.Note if leaving Hartsfield Jackson in Atlanta that early in the morning there are not alot of shops or eating choices since nothing is open. The only choice we saw was a Chick Fil A which the line was very long.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great budget American airline with great baggage allowance,"I travelled first time to USA and took 4-5 domestic flights on southwest. All were on time, easy boarding process, free snack and coffee and 2 free check in baggage. Yes 2 free check in baggage of 23 kgs. Was recommended to me by friend in USA and now would like to recommend others."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Hate seating process,I would prefer to select a seat when I make a reservation.   To be forced to check in a day before - when busy doing other things -  is a pain.  I avoid southwest for this reason
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Always a nice flight,"Southwest is consistent. Flight left late and made it to Denver early. They have a decent selection in snacks, not just pretzels. Their entertainment services are a bit of a pain to get into, and I didn't have the app on my child's device so we couldn't use it. Love early bird check in, although don't like it went up in price. Staff is always friendly and I like that they are usually light hearted. Also appreciate they have non stop flights from Hartford to Denver because most other airlines don't."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Best Airline Byfar,I took a break from flying southwest due to a few delays and I got on flight 4498 to oaklnd and let me tell you... the service was superb and I couldn’t have asked for a more accommodating experience. Our flight attendants were amazing but we have to give a special shout out to Joaquin because he was so informative and patient with us and all our crazy requests. Will definitely always fly SWA 🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻
Date of travel: January 2020,50,We flew nonstop from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale and back,"nonstop flights from pittsburgh to fort lauderdale and back.Eveything on time free bags and whats nit to like? Also ,Pittsburgh airport is one of yhe best airports in the country. We live in between pittsburgh  and cleveland so we have a choice.Like everything in cleveland, the airport is a complete mess. so it is a nobrainer as to which one to use"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Early Birs Check in is NON -REFUNDABLE!,"Had to cancel a flight from BWI to PWM. Booked for two people and added early bird check in ($120 for both). NO REFUND ON EARLY BIRD CHECK IN SO BEWARE!Truly sucks and gives a whole new meaning to their slogan of "" no change fees""...."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,a true vomitorium,"Returning to Islip, New York, from Punta Cana, the first leg was headed for Fort Lauderdale. Just as the flight attendant announced the plane's pushback from the gate, a female Dominican passenger jumped up and dashed for the forward restroom, locked herself in, and remained for the next 62 minutes. The plane stopped short, and the woman refused to communicate through the door. Medical emergency? Having a baby? Enjoying one last spliff? No, just the old barf-ola. In prodigious quantity. Somehow managed to get it all over the ceiling, which mystified everyone. This was vomiting on an olympic scale. Eventually, a sister managed to coax the emesis-depleted woman from the restroom, whereupon she and her 4-person entourage were escorted from the aircraft to the sound of cheers and applause from the remaining passengers. Finally pushed back 1 1/2 hours late. Kudos to the flight crew, who kept things reasonably calm, with the help of abundant air freshener."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Best flight,"I've never flown Southwest airlines before but I love them!  Everyone was nice and polite, we arrived home early on the return flight.  The pilot said there was turbulence but didn't feel a thing!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good Flights,"Flew on a Sunday and returned on a Sunday. I always do early boarding because I like to know that I will have room for my carry on bag. I lucked out going and returning on all four flights. I got to sit in the exit row and no one sat next to me because none of the flights was full. I call this Southwest first class, legroom and no one next to you.all flights arrived on time or early. Bad thing for Southwest is Newark is our home airport and Southwest stopped flying from there so we both had Southwest credit cards and cancelled them because of this. I booked the flights with points that I had before canceling the card and got gift card with the leftover points."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always fly SWA,"Very seldom, if at all, have I been disappointed with SWA.  The important thing is it gets me where I need to go.  I have no need to have first class, I have no need to have special attention.  Those that do get taken care of and I can accept that.  I have had that in the past and I appreciate the help they gave me.  So, thank you SWA, you take care of the middle class in a respectable manner and I feel like you are there to make my flight as comfortable as possible.  You Rock!!!!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Nice flight attendents and on-time arrival helps a trip start off right!,"The boarding groups helps control the rush for boarding as seats are not assigned.  The flight attendants were helpful but nothing can overcome the horrendously small bathroom and close seating issues!  Still, for the price and not having to pay for bags, it is a good deal!  Our flight was delayed coming home by a couple of hours but still got us home safely."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,What a GREAT Airline,Southwest Airlines is my go to airline for Florida. My airport of choice is Milwaukee. Southwest Airlines offers nonstop flights to all over Florida. The employees are friendly and helpful. The airport is easy to navigate.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always made sure we were comfortable and had enough to drink.,"Flight attendants extremely friendly, and accommodating.  Sat in the exit row and made sure we were comfortable in sitting there.  The flight was not full so when someone sat beside me, they were told they could have their own row and be more comfortable."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always a treat to fly SWA!,"My wife and I had the opportunity to fly the SWA flight from San Jose, Costa Rica to Fort Lauderdale, FL on Wednesday, January 22, 2020. The plane was clean, the attendants friendly and the flight was over 30 minutes early.   We’ve exclusively flown SWA into and out of Costa Rica on our four trips to that country.  What a treat to fly our favorite airline to our favorite foreign destination. We LUV Southwest Airlines."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Musical chairs with no customer service,We paid extra to have early boarding number...at least 20 elderly/wheel chair passengers with their partners loaded first.  When we landed in PHX they were told they needed to wait until everyone deplaned because assistance was not available...low and behold they all got up and walked out without assistance.  My wife and I had a connecting flight with SW #1277.  Our boarding pass for 1277 stated the flight would be at Gate C7.  Not having much time as our seats on the first flight put us in the back half of the plane we rushed to Gate C7 from Gate C22(?).  It was 2 wings away.  No body else was at Gate C7 when we arrived out of breath.  We then heard our names on the intercom directing us to report to Gate C1.  We were the last to board and had the very last row in the back.  I commented to the Gate Person that it sure would’ve been nice to have been told that our boarding gate had changed.  This is something the airlines used to announce over the intercom before the flight landed.  If you are not going to announce connecting flight gat changes then DO NOT print connecting flight gates on boarding passes.  My wife told me the C1 Gate Employee had followed me down the Gate tunnel as if to stop me from boarding.  She had sarcastically told me that announcing gate changes was impossible due to the fact there were over 125 passengers.  That is just naive...as if there would be 125 connecting flights.  It never took more than 5 minutes when they used to do this...I flew often in my time in the military and this small courtesy was very appreciated.  Customer service is non existent in the airline industry and you are treated like cattle or non-persons.  If you dare complain you take the chance of being denied boarding.  I will not fly SW ever again.  Because we were flying from Reno-MSP-Reno due a family members medical emergency our flights to MSP & Return cost us $1600 dollars.  Just rediculous.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight and this is the time I like to travel,"Not a lot of people like to leave at the crack of dawn to catch a plane, but I find it relaxes me and prepares me for the day ahead, The trip was uneventful and restful even when I had to change in Phoenix where a lot of 49er and Viking fans boarded for the divisional game that was in San Francisco. A lot of good natured ribbing from both sides made the flight even more enjoyable."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Good,"Good, in spite of weather! The incoming flight was delayed, therefore, our departure was delayed.  The flight was smooth and uneventful.  Upon arrival, because we were delayed, we had to wait for a gate to deplane.  Southwest did the best they could under these conditions."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy Flight from Hartford to Baltimore,"Flew on southwest for a brief flight from Harford, CT to Balitimore, MD. Overall great experience! I had plenty of leg space and love that they give you 2 free checked bags."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Customer Service,"I spoke with Rechelle in customer service today and want to compliment her on excellent customer service over the phone. She was very kind, helpful and it was greatly appreciated!"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,What is going on at SWA?,"I have flown on SWA a lot in the past and they always sent me a text to let me know to check in for my flight. I had come to rely on that. For some reason, I did not get any text. I thought I had the wrong dates for my trip and it caused me a lot of grief. Have they changed their policy?"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great airline with some perks,They dont charge you for carring 2 bags on the flight. They have a weird boarding system that you click on the flight 24 hours ahead of time and you get your boarding number. You can pay extra to get in the beginning A boarding line but I don't think tis worth it.   They used to be cheap but now they are getting more expensive. They dont have a lot of non stop flights. The staff at the airports seem to be helpful and flight attendents are accomidating. They only give you a drink and a small snack and sometime seconds if you ask for it.There is no food that you can buy on the plane. There is no inflght entertainment except if you download southwest app you get free movies and tv shows.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,ILL FLY  SOUTHWEST AIRLINES WHEN GIVEN CHOICE,What can you say with southwest you know what your getting when you fly with them.stewardess are attentive and polite yes that is their job but you can tell when some on bigger carriers  that they just are there to get a check  not all but most   flight left on time  actually arrived a little early   good tail wind   Did have to wait awhile for luggage but normal for Denver airport
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Non-Stop to Jamaica,Flight was on time. Boarding was orderly. You can check two bags free and two carry on bags. Only wish they had WiFi TV screens on the back of each seat.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Thought United was bad,Arrived at airport hour and half before flight.  Plane was parked at the gate. Boarded plane then sat about 15 plus minutes when pilot announced a couple of bolts were missing from flaps. 15 minutes later announced maintenance on the way. Then no bolts anywhere near by would fly some in from Dallas. After an hour or so deplained   Went to waiting area where we waited for a plane to arrive. It arrived and was supposed to go to Boston but we they rescheduled to Orlando. Finally boarded again.   Considering is was on the ground when we arrived one has to ask why it took hours to preflight.   Same crew brought it in shoddy maintenance to say the least   No offer of compensation   FAA should review their maintenance standards.  Will file a complaint with airline and FAA when we get home.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On time hassle free!,"This is always a easy one for us, the airline has numerous non stops daily and always exceeds our expectations"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Very Nice--people were very accomodating!,"I had had shoulder surgery, and my arm was in a sling,so I needed help.The peopleat Southwest were very accomodating."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,nonstop to Orlando,"My husband & I recently returned from a vacation to Orlando. After checking out some other airlines, Southwest offered us the best price and time of departure and arrival. We needed to change the departure time of our flight at the beginning of our trip and were able to do so online with ease and no extra fees. We purchased the EarlyBird check-in for both flights and felt the extra money was well worth it. We ended up with A boarding on both flights and therefore, had no worries about being able to stay together."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,My trip to Atlanta,"Flight was good, not over crowded. Attendants were on top of everything, we did experience some rough turbulence but over all it was a nice flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Denver Southwest Agent. ,Counter agent did not take her responsibilities seriously. Airport and gate were packed as it was January 2nd. Gate and flight full. Flight delayed and gate agent too busy chatting with her friends for more than hour to update passengers. Everyone was angry and complaining. To make matters worse I was board number one and she preboarded her friends on a FULLflight. When I confronted her she became very angry and the situation escalated to the point of her complaining out loud for others to hear to include the rest of my family behind me. She was rude. Inappropriate and unprofessional. This is highly unusual for Southwest. (Been flying them for 30 years. )Called to report incident immediately to customer service and never received a response. I was told they could not locate name she had given me!!!!Very disappointed this was not taken seriously by Southwest.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Change of Flight,"I was very disappointed with Southwest. They offered an early morning flight, which I needed because I was meeting with someone else and renting a car with them, but they then just sent an email saying the flight is no longer available and I can choose a different flight. The next flight got in 5 hours later. They were not apologetic, didn't offer anything to compensate since now I am going to have to spend more money because my original plans and meeting another person are ruined, nor were they very helpful. I am not sure why they even posted this flight without the guarantee that there was going to be a plane for it (since the grounding of the plane got extended). I wish they would have been a little more sincere since they are the reason my 1. Entire day of my vacation is shot 2. Have to spend more money to get to my destination since I will have to rent my own car instead of meeting with my original person due to late flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Possibly the worst seating experience ever,"Delayed for an hour and a half due to weather, but much of it on the plane waiting for de-icing, it only got worse sitting in the very last row - which is really meant for 2 seats but has 3, and having the overweight, seat stealer and leg spreader crammed in the middle. Add to that the constant farting, being bashed in the head by bathroom users and flight attendants (since I had to turn away and lean out from the horrid row partner) and zero legroom. This idiotic seating system loads the front first, splits friends and family then jams in the seats. Add to it people ""saving"" seats and it just gets worse. Some of it is my fault for not understanding the bad system and buying a better seat but there is only one airline using this system for a good reason."
n/a,40,Southwest Airlines Makes Flying Enjoyable,"I recently flew on Southwest Airlines, with a connecting flight each way. I love their seating method, and everyone lined up with no issues and boarded the plane. The flight attendants were pleasant and professional. Southwest has some flight attendant announcers who are hilarious, and that makes the flight experience even better. The flights were great, and even with winter weather, we stayed on time. I was really impressed because the day before we were due to leave, Southwest sent us information that our flights might be disrupted by the winter weather, and they gave us the option to reschedule ourselves online at no cost. That is an amazing service!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good flight selections,Many time selections to choose from - slight layover in Chicago. Better shorter route through St Louis but departed later than we wanted.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Worst airport experience ever !!!!!!!,I had the absolute worst experience ever with South West airlines- Houston. I waited at baggage claim for over 30 minutes for my bag which never came while over the speaker the announcer called for the owner of a crown royal bag. As you may know Crown Royal is a liquor that comes in a purple and gold bag but this couldn’t be my bag even though it was purple and gold it clearly said Betsy Johnson all over it. I guess that was a funny joke for the employees to yell on the loud speaker that owner of a crown royal bag needed to come to the service desk. After realizing my bag was not coming I was directed to a room in the back where I inquired about the location of the bag. The airport staff then said oh you’re the owner of the Crown Royal bag and began to giggle. They informed that my bag fell and was ran over and some of my stuff have been destroyed with not even the smallest hint of remorse. My bag was literally destroyed to the point all the clothes and shoes In it were ripped to shreds/ destroyed. When I became angry the south west employee Danny asked me “ what are you so mad about it’s not like we are not going to cut you a check”. I explained to the worker that I am in a city I have never been to with absolutely nothing to wear and all my belongings destroyed. The employee began to tell me how southwest is a million dollar company & they have no problem cutting a check as if this was suppose to make me feel better. The employee then told me it happens all the time due to southwest handling so much luggage on a daily basis and they just cut a check. The employees asked me to go through my bag and damages and asked me to price the cost of each item. The south west employee sat on the computer googled my items one by one while making comments like “ woah you really paid $200 for that ?” and arguing with me over the amount I paid for each item saying things like “ well they have it for cheaper at this store”. The worker also went as far to turn to his employee and say “I don’t even argue with these people” After the employee calculated what he felt I deserved for my belongings he wrote a check for $620 and told me I should just go to the mall & buy new items. The employee told me I can go to chase bank and cash the check the same day which was a lie. I went to chase bank and they told me they could not cash check because south west had to verify it and no one answered the phone. I was not able to cash check until I returned home from my vacation. The customer was absolutely terrible and this was a major I’m convenience and embarrassing experience. I do not recommend Southwest Airlines to any one.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Flight at a Great Price,"Organized, comfortable and friendly.  Our party didn't have any issues.  We paid for advanced check in, it was great.  However, another person had issues with people in A boarding group saving seats for people in B/C boarding groups and wanted the flight attendant to tell the passenger doing the seat saving that he couldn't do that.  I found it odd that the flight attendant said it was ""company policy"" that they do not get involved in seat disputes and that the passengers would have to work it out themselves.  Fortunately, it didn't escalate."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always My Favorite Airline!,"This is MY airline! I won’t fly another, if I can help it. While this may be considered a no frills airline, they have the Texas frills that I LUV! Texas friendly, efficient, reasonably priced fares, and rarely have any of my flights been delayed. The latest flights to and from Ft. Lauderdale were perfect in every sense. Even ran into a pretty famous musician at baggage claim on his way to do some cruise shows. Their rewards program is decent as well. And, when you’re lucky enough to get a comedic flight crew, you may just wet your pants from laughter before you get to your destination."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,I LUV Southwest Airlines!,"I am a VERY loyal customer on Southwest Airlines, being A List Preferred for the past six years.  I never have any problems with Southwest whatsoever, all the employees are great, they love their job, they offer outstanding customer service and don't take themselves too seriously.Free bags are also one of the main reasons I fly so much with them, as I always have at least one, possibly two piece of luggage due to the nature of my job.I cannot think of another carrier that consistently delivers A+ service to all of their customers."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great first flight for  my son!,All Southwest employees we encountered were super friendly.  Communication was great before and during the flight.  Boarding went very smoothly.  It was my 10 yr olds first time flying and the pilot took him in the cock pit to ease his nerves.  He LOVED it!  The pilot was super nice and gave my son lots of ideas for us to do while in Atlanta.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always a pleasant experience ,The crew and the pilot what are engaging in conversation with the entire flight .  It is always a pleasure to fly Southwest and they are more friendly than other airlines
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Southwest is consistently on time, transparent,respectful to customers, and a great value.","Southwest is consistently on time, transparent,respectful to customers, and a great value.  SW $0 baggage fees are superior to all other airlines.  SW flight attendants are superior to all other airlines.  SW minimum boarding time is better than any other airline I've ever flown.  SW offers service & choice... OTHER airlines scrimp on costs & are punitive to customers.  SW shows respect for its customers.  I usually fly whichever airline offers the cheapest price, but SW is the airline I always trust.  I hope they'll soon get all their planes back.  SW has competent pilots & staff, & doesn't deserve to be punished for gov't or Boeing failures."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Nice fly,I liked this trip for me it was very good ... in the past i traveled by this airline and it has been a trip with many turbulence I am glad that this time it was not so .
Date of travel: January 2020,40,everything on time or early,3 hour layover one way in Fort Lauderdale. Gave us time to eat. Less on the way back but since you have to go through customs its nice to have plenty of time. Bags did take a long time to get in Fort Lauderdale- they went  through my checked one so maybe that was the delay.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,"go domestic, not international","we are fans of southwest airlines because they have many flights from st.louis. But their reputation as an economy has long sense disappeared and their insistence to not assign seating has become more and more irritating. But we decided to fly them to Turks and Caicos, on their business upgrade, not the regular status, thinking that they have upgraded service and amenities for the extra cost. Wrong. Same old lineup to get on the plane, except we were in the ""A"" line and we got 2 drink tickets, that's right, 2 each, for the privilege of paying extra. We did get to pick from the gourmet basket of wrapped crackers, but that's it, and we couldn't use our comp tickets because the flight attendant said it was too rough to serve. The return flight was more of the same, so the moral of this adventure is to fly domestic only and don't make the mistake that we did. One redeemomg factor is that we didn' t try yo fly to Hawaii. What a nightmare that would have been."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Another good experience aboard SW,"Have never had a bad experience aboard SW.  Friendly professional staff, clean plane, clean restrooms, decent snack.  For the first time we treated ourselves to the pre-boarding fee and got A boarding passes and that was nice.  Smooth, uneventful flights both ways."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"If you go with others, book with them - part 2","Due to a coffee incident, our 5-person group arrived at the plane a little late, but still in time. Fortunately, we booked together and fortunately, Southwest found the right offer for one person to deplane so we could return together. 2 of our 5 were kids. I got stuck in a row between to big folk, but at least I was on the flight. Service was great, and we arrived early."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"If you go with others, book with them - part 1","Easy check in, good flight service, and arrival on time. Travelled with children, so got to board early and got a good seat. Arrival on time. Good value."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Gets you from point A to point B,"They got me there and back alive. 5 hour average flight with minimal snacks. Not a fan of the everyone checking in online exactly 24 hours ahead of time to get a decent boarding order position. The head stewardess was hilarious on the trip back, did a better job of getting people interested enough to listen to the safety brief than most."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Round Trip Non-Stop SAT>>MCO,"Everything went fine - Group B seating but was fortunate to get a window set with no middle seat passenger.  Quick, easy & good service.  All went well."
n/a,10,B.S. on flt.1701,"Takeoff to landing this was one of the smoothest flights I've ever been on, inexplicably, the Captain refused to turn off the seatbelt sign for the entire flight claiming foul weather was only a moment away. I think he was giving the crew a break at our expense because the weather excuse was BS. Not good. I expect more from s/w."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,rude flight attendant,"I was on flight 1866, and there was such an awful flight attendant. Honestly I have no idea what her name was because after she yelled at me.. I didn’t want to see her again at all. But she was asian and sitting in the back (i was really panicking.. those are the only things I remember). I’m only 16 years old, and I’ve never been closer to peeing myself. The “seatbelt light” was lit almost the entire ride, so I was trying to wait until we landed. Yes, I would completely understand if she had simply told me they needed to stop the plane because I was up! But she was an absolute jerk about it. I’m not getting up because I wanna stretch my legs, hun, I know that the seatbelt light is on. I was on the verge of tears after how rude she was.. I was already embarrassed and I know I should’ve used the restroom sooner, but it was just so mean to yell at me like that... again, I completely understand that they had to stop the plane but I wasn’t about to piss my pants at 16 years old, let alone the fact that someone would have to clean it, and it was just so awful experiencing her attitude. I don’t think I’ll be flying southwest again if I can help it. Not if they hire flight attendants who have no idea how to say “We have to stop the plane because you’re up” but instead treat kids like crap because they have to pee... thank god the pilot (or whoever came over the intercom? ) wasn’t as rude as she was, and simply stated that everyone had to be seated before the plane could move. Hopefully she learns from their example."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Delayed Flight,I was booked to fly on Southwest from Hartford to Florida on December 11th 2019.I was notified by Southwest via text that my flight was delayed for more than two hours. I asked at the checkin counter if I could cancel and fly the next day on the flight leaving at the same time. They willingly granted my request so I was able to return home with my ride. On December 12th I took flight 992 the flight left on time and arrived on time
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Reward Program,"Recently flew from Detroit to Salt Lake City on Southwest using my reward points. Checking my two bags of luggage, which fly free went smoothly. I want to say checking luggage using the kiosk on past flights on Southwest out of Detroit was horrible. I typically take the first flight out, and in the past they opened the luggage check-in late. It's suppose to open 2 hours before a flight, and when their late it backs up fast. This flight I arrived 2 hours before and they opened right on time, and checking the bags was very fast. The flight left on time, and it was a very nice flight. The attendants on SWA are always great! Luggage arrived at SLC with no problems... love it when a flight is flawless."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,SouthWest ... Sometimes Good Sometimes Bad ... This Flight Awful,"Generally, I like flying with SW as the free bags policy is a winner but this particular flight just sucked. Why? How about landing in Oakland and being told there wasn'ta gate available. Not uncommon but the wait was interminable. The plane was alsomoved off the active taxi-way to an apron for a further wait. I was sitting on the port-side of the aircraft and saw 3 other SW planes glide past us straight into a free gate so this tells that it was was, probably, a SW traffic problem not an Oakland airport problem. At one point, the steward told people to sit down as we were on anactive runway - not true as it was a taxi-way and we'd been moved off to one side bythen. You might think the pilot would keep us informed but, no, 2 paltry announcements in over an hour we were kept waiting. Come on, SouthWest: youreally should tell the customers the truth."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Not enough wonderful words for this airline!,"I cannot say enough good words about Southwest.  They allow 2 bags to be checked for FREE!  Also, they are so easy to change flight plans when necessary...no penalty fees.  I love this airline and always choose them when planning my trips if they offer flights to wherever I am going."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,The Usual Superb Job,"I fly Southwest for both business and pleasure. Their attitude and approach matches mine. You get to check two bags with no charges, plus you can carry on one larger and one smaller item. This alone is a big bonus over other airlines. There are generally no fees for changing your flight. This is a great feature. Check in online 24 hours before flight time. And their attitude during the flight is the best. The Cincinnati route seems to be a newer one. It was worth driving a little and flying out of Baltimore.After40+ years of flying, I am very loyal to this airline-with good reason."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always on time,"Southwest did a great job with service, all the way from allowing my 87 year old to board early all the way to a safe landing. Seats are comfortable even for big people like myself.Thanks again!!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Really??,Booked for 4 pm direct flight rescheduled without notice for 7:30pm with connection. Worst customer service ever. Hello?  Do you not understand that I paid more for a direct at my preferred time? Where is my refund? Not flying SW again.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest always easy and fun!,We love southwest because they include the checked bags and always have fun flight people.  Great service and have never had any issues.  :-)
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Love SW Air,"Nice, pleasant flight attendants, clean aircraft, on time departure and arrival. Doesn’t get better than that."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,great trip,"Southwest Airlines is great.  I don't mind not having a seat reservation.  I beleive the idea of having groups (A, B, or C)  board is fine.  I always check in 24 hrs before my flight and usually get a seat near the front of the plane.  The flights are usually very punctual and arrive at the appropriate times.  If you purchase the tickets in advance (Several months ahead) they are very cheap (Wanna get away).  I always check flights on Southwest Airlines first before checking with other airlines."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Only nonstop flight from San Diego to New Orleans,"Easy flight to N.O. For a quick getaway. Not a fan of SWA because of the seating/boarding, but it was fine for a relatively quick flight."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Great flight,The flight was great we flew in at about 8:45 pm pacific time and as we were flying in to McCarran the pilot tilted the plane to make it able for everybody to see the Rockies.  Plane was clean and attendants were nice.  Great flight.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Nice,"The flight was nice and quiet, put my headphones and neck pillow on and watched some shows on Netflix!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,They get you there fast and easy.,"I like flying Southwest. It is best to pay for pre-check in. Then you don't have to worry about your seat.  It is fair.  The flights are always on time.  They have never cancelled on me which is the number one reason I use them and they are pleasant. no one loves to fly but when you do you have to pay for what you get.  Southwest is not the cheapest but they seem, to me, to be the best right now."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Always pleasant attendants,"Usually on time.  I take this flight at least twice a year.  Only bad weather has prevented it, but was immediately given a replacement flight time as well as a voucher for an additional free flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Solid travels,"Once again, Southwest doesn’t disappoint. While not first class, it delivers on what’s promised- timeliness, friendliness, safety, and value. I absolutely love the 2 free bag policy, as a winter skier that travels with boots and skis, the policy is a major differentiator."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Damn Good Flight!!!!,"We hadn't flown with SW for some time but after last weeks flight you can count us as SW regulars again. Another airline had always had better pricing and suited our needs even though you sacrificed a little comfort and paid for extras.   Wow, what a difference it was to fly again with Southwest.  Everything about the flight was ""first class"".  Can't wait to fly again with them."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Canceled flight on hold for 117 minutes,"I understand flights are canceled. My flight was canceled. I received a text informing me the flight was canceled and a code to rebook. There were zero seats available between Columbus OH and St Louis MO. I then called Southwest customer service and was given a recording the wait time was 80 minutes. I called again about 15 minutes later and the wait time was 77 minutes. I called again 8 hours later and the wait time was 69 minutes. I was given the option of having Southwest call me back. I gave my cell phone number and waited for a call. About 70 minutes later, I received a call back. When I answered by cell phone, Southwest hung up. My cell phone rang again. And once again, Southwest hung up. I called customer service again and the wait time was 57 minutes. I stayed on my phone listening to Southwest ads for free checked bags, unaccompanied minors, traveling with pets, etc. 157 minutes later someone answered the phone. I was told since Southwest canceled my flight, the purchase price would be refunded to my credit card. Then I receive an email, that the refund is a credit for a future Southwest flight. While they advertise low fares, if you want a window or aisle seat, you likely need to pay extra for Early Bird Check In so add this fee to the price of your ticket.I booked this flight because it was direct. Based on poor customer service, I will use if Southwest is my only option."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Southwest is easy, but I hate the non assigned seating.","Southwest is easy. I went into Houston Hobby, out to California and through Vegas. It was a fine flight and the Flight Attendants were good. The Pilot could have had a better attitude, though flights were fine."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Delay Becoming Routine,"On my last two trips between Baltimore and Denver, one leg of each trip was delayed by an hour or more because the airline held the flight so that another flight could be canceled and the passengers added to our flight.  On this trip, supposedly weather cause a flight to be diverted to Denver and 15 passengers added to the 42 empty seats on our flight.  Hence, I did not arrive in Baltimore until after midnight. I speculate this practice may be a method for the airline to manage the loss of the 737 Max. I do like not having to pay for luggage when I travel to ski."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Regarding luggage,"While going to Houston from Kansas, my luggage was opened by security for checking but they broke the lock and now i cannot use it again. And while coming back to Kansas from Houston, my small luggage was totally shattered! Not at all happy with my only two newly bought luggage destroyed in one journey."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Favourite Airline,"I've flown southwest at least 10 times and they are my favourite and i've flown alot of airlines! The prices are great because you always get 2 free checked in bags, a carry on and personal item. Plus the picking your own seat process is convenient. Staff is always friendly as well."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Not friendly for people with disabilities,My daughter has a disability and requires some special assistance while flying. Southwest made us feel like low life’s for requesting a disability boarding pass. Very ashamed that a company this day and age would do this.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Snowbird visit to Naples FL,"Flight was on time boarding, take off timely as was our arrival time, in fact we arrived 15 minutes early."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Exactly As Advertised,"Both segments of this trip were exactly as expected. The check-in process was smooth and efficient, boarding was easy as I had I paid for a priority group, and the flights left and arrived on time. On board service was fine but nothing special. Whoever did the announcements at the start of the second flight second was hilarious! While remaining professional."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Saves money and you can pick any open seat,"We flew Southwest Airlines for the first time out of San Jose Del Cabo and were very happy.  It is cheaper than Alaska Airlines who we usually took to/from San Jose Del Cabo.  Southwest doesn't show up when you search using the regular search engines (Orbitz, Travelocity, Expedia, etc) so you have to search using their website directly.  They don't pre-assign seats so you have to go by the grouping on your boarding pass.  You can get a higher grouping by signing in for your flight as close to 24 hours previous to the flight as possible.  We were able to get group-A boarding by doing this.  When boarding, you can pick any open seat.  So it is best to board earlier to get the best selection.  We will definitely fly SouthWest Airlines in the future."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Flying home from work conference,"I will never fly southwest again. I had a mimosa before my flight home to Houston from St. Louis. I was approached and asked if I had drank prior to my flight, because aFINNISH non American commented to the flight attendant I had,  (yes I had  a Mimosa pre-flight.), I was then asked to leave the air carrier and told I could not fly through southwest for 24 hours: within the hour I purchased a direct flight through Delta and was on my way home. I will never fly southwest again."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Growling Pains Causing Delays?,"First, I always check-in as soon as possible, literally the second 24 hours prior happens. For both the outbound and the return flight, I was seconds after the allowed time and was still only able to get B56 for the outbound and B50 for the return. I don't understand that!Our flight was at 8:35 AM and we arrived in plenty of time for it. However, they changed our gate, sending us to the very end of the terminal. That would have been fine but they had two flights set to board at the same gate but only one plane.It turned out our flight was delayed due to a public address system issue and it wasn't available. They finally had a plane at a third gate but it was well after 9:00 AM before we started boarding and later still before we actually pushed back and departed.To their credit, they did make up some of the time in the air but the return flight back to Nashville from Phoenix was also delayed by 20 minutes. I hope this is not an indication that Southwest is growing too large to provide the service they once were so good at."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Unorganized,Southwest is a very unorganized airline. No one was clear with directions with security check. I was charged for an overweight bag meanwhile the bag had the exact same items I came with prior to. And the people who work for them are extremely rude. One lady gave me an attitude because I simply asked a question. Never again will I fly southwest. You are better off with Jet Blue.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Another good flight on an absolutely filthy plane,"Boarding: very crowded boarding area in Reagan, but orderly process.  Plane: 737-800  in desperate need of cleaning and interior maintenance. For example two rows behind the emergency exit row, there’s a seat that is incredibly stained and torn. Also, the floor was dirty, food crumbs and candy. And my tray table was the dirtiest I’ve encountered on a flight in years.  Tip: Bring handiwipes to clean tray tables and armrests.  Service: Good service from friendly flight attendants  Lavatory: filthy and no hand towels"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,On time flight on an absolutely filthy plane,"No microphone at departure gate, soiled and dirty plane, but arrived early Boarding: Boarding was not as orderly as usual. The gate agent didn’t have a working microphone. And he was not a loud person. So there was some confusion during boarding but it was still decent.  Aircraft: newer 737-800. Plane was dirty inside- dirt on walls and ceiling, filth and trash on the floor.  Service: Good flight attendants Schedule: Departed a few minutes late but arrived early. Kudos to the captain."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Southwest Airlines is the Worst,"Flying on government travel from San Jose, CA (Friday morning) to HOU, TX, and back (Sunday morning) through Southwest Airlines was hands-down the worst travel experience of my life.Throughout that experience, I had my flight cancelled and was then sold a one-way, non-government rate ticket on late-check status, when I explicitly asked for round-trip government rate, showed ID, and had no time constraints.  Baggage assistance as a consequence of late-check status was miserable throughout, both over the phone and in-person - condescending, superior, and totally unempowered.  Made every attempt at civility and polite interaction, greeted with coy, smug, and trite condescension - a 180-degree pivot away from customer service.Trust and believe, if you fly SWA, and you happen to find yourself on the wrong side of the aisle, they will not have your back.  Absolutely no honesty, no integrity, no loyalty, and not an ounce of grit or ""git'r'dun.""  Value system needs seriously relooking, retraining, and retooling."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Our fav airline,"Another pleasant SWA flight!  Left on time, arrived early.  Dallas based crew was great.  The guy reminded me of Rod Stewart...hair, build, dress.  One weekend (not recently) I flew American, Southwest, and Northwest.  Southwest won in every category.  They were the quickest to board us, they fed us snacks and beverages, and left and arrived on time.  I fly Southwest whenever I can do so!"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,This used to be my favourite Airline,I fly quite a few times a year and used to only fly southwest.  With the removal of so many non stop flights I have switched to Delta.  I prefer southwest but they leave me with no options.  And they are having more late flights than i have ever experienced before
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always a good experience.,"We frequently fly Southwest out to the west coast and in this instance, Belize.  Southwest allows 2 full size bags to be checked at no extra costs.  Boarding is prompt and the flight enjoyable."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Soooooooo popular,"The crew was excellent as always. On time leaving the gate and arriving. Smooth trip. This was the second leg of the trip from Fort Lauderdale to San Juan, Costa Rica. Be warned, there is SOOOOOO much luggage. Seems like everyone else checked two giant bags so much, much slower than usual. Also note: Southwest flunked the on board water quality standards so don't drink the tap water in any form. (Only Alaska and Hawaiian passed)"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Arrowhead stadium to watch Chargers vs. Chiefs play,"The pilots were great along with the crew.   The service was very good and our connections were all on time, which does not always happen."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"Islip, Long Island","Living in Suffolk County, flying from Islip is extremely convenient.  Southwest has clean planes, your (2) bags are free and their on time performance is great. On the downside, I don’t know anyone who likes their seat selection/boarding process - especially when it comes the handicapped. That said, flying to and from a local airport trumps everything - every time."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Refunding,"Due to an ice storm our flight got canceled. They pushed us out on a flight 2 days from the expected time. We couldnt afford to wait that long so we rented a car and drove home. They now are not refunding us on our tickets. (The representative had told us we would get refunded for our tickets if we do not use them.)  We have flight points to use to fly free with till October of 2020. For someone who rarely ever flys, this sucks. Basically, great service overall. As long as your flight doesnt get canceled! Dont rebook your flight. Just ask for a refund immediately and use that to buy another ticket."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Houston to Cancun,"Southwest was awesome as usual. They will not nickle and dime you to death like other airlines. I am excited to see they are adding destinations. Cozumel, here I come!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Lost luggage,"This was my first flight alone,I’m scared of flying. I flew from Indianapolis Indiana to Tampa.I got to Tampa went to get my luggage it wasn’t there. Indianapolis airport never sent my luggage to Tampa After finding this out, I had to borrow clothes fromMy adopted mom to wear.I had nothing.after two days   they finally had my luggage.I received a 100 dollarFlight coupon, so that wasn’t bad.But I think I should have gotten at least something to buy  clothes with,I had the clothes on my back.no bra or underwear Very embarrassing to figure that one out.Anyway Tampa was very nice, helped all they could, I guess. Customer service and the security were very helpful, and nice.And yes Southwest is the best to fly with.and I will fly with them again. And they don’t charge luggage, two suitcases a piece, per person."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy Flight,Super easy short flight. Fun flight crew. Deplane on tarmac. Sit in the back of the plane. They opened the back doors to let us deplane and we were one of the first families through customs.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Terrible,"Southwest is absolute garbage not once has my flight not been delayed with these clowns. If I could give them a 0 rating I would! I would rather ride on frontiers cardboard seats, at least I will reach my destination 😂"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Excellent staff,"Our flight was slightly delayed, due to late arrival of the plane probably due to weather.  However, they kept us informed and when we started boarding it was quick and we were on our way.  The flight stewards humour was awesome as always. Although we left late we arrived almost on schedule.  The extra luggage is always great even if we don't use it. Thanks Southwest for another adventure!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Vegas Non stop,Fast friendly and pleasant for a birthday get away.Eight ladies enjoyed a long weekend trip for one's birthday!!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Costumer service,Best costumer experience compared to any other domestic airlines. They truly value their costumers. They worked with me for a refund when I had a genuine medical reason.
n/a,50,No complaints ,I have no complaints and the return trip home we were almost 15 minutes early. I love that 2 bags fly free and I can almost always get an aisle seat. Unfortunately I fell asleep on both flights that I didnt get my snack but oh well I have no complaints. I wish they flew out of SUX or FSD.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,LOVE flying SWA,"Always a pleasure, on time, smooth flight.  Enjoyable flight crew.  I'd love it if the pilot pointed out a few points of interest that we're flying over.  #1 airline for us - always.  Please, more direct flights DEN-RSW."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,SWA from Denver,"As always, SWA did an outstanding kid with a smooth, trouble free boarding, on time departure and early arrival.  Only problem was the hour to get our bags in Houston."
Date of travel: February 2019,50,Why can't all airlines be like this!!,"Fantastic customer care - just had to change my ticket for flight in couple of  weeks time, noramlly I dread having to make that call with other airlines as you can almost hear them rub their hands together as they prepare to gouge you for change fees etc.Not Southwest!! its true $0 change fee and for my flight $0 fare difference......certainly helps me want to fly with these guys more for my domestic travel, plus original ticket was $100+ cheaper than the competition in the first place!! Good for you Southwest"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Short, smooth and sweet",The Southwest flight was nice.  Didn't run into any turbulence while on the way and didn't have to wait in line on the runway.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good Airline,"We usually fly Southwest Airlines as they usually fly to our destinations and their prices are good.  The service is generally good and we've rarely had any issues as far as the flights themselves.  We don't like the fact that you cannot pick your seats ahead of time and that you pay a price for priority boarding and you still don't get a decent seat.  We've had passengers actually say that we couldn't sit in the seats that we chose when boarding the plane and that they were saving them for somebody which is not allowed, but nothing is said to them.  In other words, one person in their group pays for priority boarding and then they save seats for the rest of their group, when all of our members pay for it and are told we're not allowed to sit in certain seats... just unfair.  Also, there have been several airports that we wanted to fly into but Southwest does not fly there... Sarasota, Punta Gorda, Santa Barbara, Myrtle Beach.  We have filed complaints with Southwest about the seat saving and nothing was ever done.  Also, don't care for the fact that they want you to print out your own boarding passes instead of the counter person printing them for you, but unfortunately we have found this to be true with other airlines as well, but does not make it right.  We are not employed by the airlines, we are the customer.  But all in all, Southwest generally has good customer service and we love the fact that they are one of the few airlines that does not charge you for your luggage which is a real crock of bull !!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Always 1st rate service and value,Like flying Southwest mainly for the free bags but also good service  and good availability of flights.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight....and I hate flying!,"I loathe flying, but sometimes its necessary and I always have a great experience with Southwest!  No turbulence, smooth landing, kind staff and even got to point out to my little girl that at least one of the pilots was a female. :)"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest is great!,"Both legs of this trip were on time,both going and coming home, despite being during the holidays! Gate attendants were friendly and helpful, and the flight attendants were efficient and welcoming. We fly exclusively SW domestically and wish they opened some Canadian or European options."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,My Flight,"I have no complains about this flight. The flight attendants were very nice. We had a open seat in our row, it made the flight extra nice!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Enjoyable Experience,"Great attitude shown by all personnel from the ticket counter to flight attendants. There are no assigned seats on Southwest Airlines.  You need to call 24 hours in advance to acquire a letter and number designation.  As you are called to board, you line up according to letter and number.  Then proceed to board and take any available remaining seat.They did not use a beverage cart.  Our attendant took our order and shortly appeared with our drink on a tray.  This eliminated congestion in the aisle."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best. Airline. EVER. Thank you for such AWESOME service! :),"Southwest has been my airline of choice for years! The selection of flights, the low, affordable prices, the selection of your own seats, the flight crew, the destinations, I mean, there's nothing to dislike about Southwest. If I can help it, I'll never fly with another airline, unless I have to fly internationally. Southwest gets my vote every time! Thank you Southwest Airlines for making sure my family and I are treated well and that we always arrive safely at our destinations! :)"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,We usually travel southwest.,"As we taxied to the runway, the captain came on and said there was an issue and we needed to return to the gate. As we approached, we noticed the lights of the emergency vehicles (fire trucks & ambulances etc).  It was concerning, as we were given no other information. I assumed, it was due to a medical concern, as the flight attendants had spoke the a gentleman toward the front of the plane prior.A man in a blue jacket with an emblem came on, he and the staff approached the passenger. The passenger got off, without assistance. Then later, a woman in that row got off with a couple of bags.The captain then came on to explain the emergency, and they would need to filed updated flight paperwork. This added to the delay, almost an hour.The captain did come on the speaker to thank us for our patience and understanding."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Thankful for such a good company!,"My grandfather passed away yesterday and I immediately booked my flight from DEN to BNA directly through Southwest. It was a very expensive round trip booking but in order to be with my family during this time money is the least of our concern. I had a friend mention that some airlines have a bereavement or emergency discounts. Today, the day of my flight, I called SWA customer service and spoke with the most respectful and empathetic customer service agent, Brent. After a brief conversation he was able to refund one of my flights and the total amount of my airfare was nearly cut by 40%. This simple action by my favorite airlines has earned further loyalty from my family and myself. Thank you SWA and Brent for the financial assistance during a difficult time. It hurts to lose a loved one but I humbled by this company's kindness and respect. <3 SWA"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Friendly service,We had a direct flight to BWI.  It was smooth and fast.  We arrived on time and had very good service by all the flight attendants.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Love Southwest for the flexibility and terrific customer service!,Traveled with my daughter and husband to LA for a wedding and site seeing.  Our trip kicked off with attentive and kind flight attendants as we began our vacation on the plane!  Southwest is always our first choice - no extra costs for seat assignments or your first two bags or a change of plans and great customer service!   We just LOVE Southwest!!!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,No Frills but Good Customer Service,Recently flew SWA from ATL-MCI-STL as storms moved across the Midwest.  SWA offered a one-time flight change because of the weather disruption.  We decided to stay on originally booked flights.  Although I am not a fan of the boarding process all the agents went above to keep people up-to-date on delays.  I still applaude SWA for the 2-free bags and the ability to cancel for future flight credit.  One of our bags did not arrive at our destination.  The baggage claim agent was very helpful and accommodating and ensured us the bag would be delivered to our home at their expense.  The bag did arrive the following day.  Because of the customer service and reservation flexibility I will continue to fly SWA.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Great customer Service,Recently flew Southwest.  Staff was great and very accomadating.  Flight was on time and boarding was very organized.  Will definitely fly again with them.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Still #1 in my book,I gave my rating as a 4 and not a 5 because every Southwest flight is full plus some.  The service is dependable and consistently good although I’d prefer the peanuts over the pretzels.   SW is my go to airline based on where I live.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always high quality customer service at Southwest!,"Southwest always delivers customer service with a sense of warmth, friendliness and individual pride.  They are always professional and prompt.  Whenever flights are available, they are my go-to airline!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,The best group travel ever,we were a large group and both of our flights were cancelled. Southwest stepped up and got us all home. They brought in a plane and we went directly home.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Not family supportive,"I’ve flown Southwest countless times and will continue to do so when it’s just myself and wife. Actually have a Southwest card to accrue miles for domestic travel but am thinking maybe now it’s not worth the fees. While the majority of flights have been very positive, recently flying back with my 14 year old step daughter was problematic. For some reason I had a B seat, and my daughter and wife a late C seat. When trying to board the plane in Tampa I had my daughter line up with me. I tried to explain to the guy scanning tickets that she’s a minor who has a phobia flying. I wanted to ensure she could sit with either her mother or I. He wasn’t supportive and frankly was just plain rude. Told me that was my problem and if I didn’t want her to get on the plane alone I could board with the C passengers. I had no problem doing that but as expected her C number was so high when we got on we had to sit separately. I recognize this might sound trivial but she was an emotional wreck by the time we landed in Baltimore. So while I appreciate Southwest’s prices and generally good service, I won’t be using them when I have my kids or grandkids on trips. My son had a similar experience when I sent them to Florida where neither he or his wife could sit with their 6 and 8 year old. They’re just not family oriented or consciences of the impact to children."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Great, except for slight delays which were not the airlines fault",great except for slight delays caused by an emergency on the prior flight.  Not the fault of the airlines.

Date of travel: January 2020,50,LOVE Southwest!,"Southwest is just the best.  Our flights were on time and always efficient boarding and service during the flight.  LOVE the free 2 checked bags, we were travelling for a lacrosse tournament and had lots of stuff.  Also, if you need to cancel you get a credit vs having to pay change/cancel fees.  Did not have to do that this time and all went as planned.  Excellent!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Saving Christmas,"My wife and kids went to my in-laws in Colorado for Christmas. My plan was to join on Christmas Eve since I am a clergy person and have to work that day. I was pretty worried something would go wrong and I’d miss the Christmas Eve festivities. However, not only was the flight on time, we were early and they gave us a free drink for the holiday. Cheers! We love Southwest and pretty well fly exclusively with them if and when we can. Absolutely the best customer service in the airlines!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Usually on time,Flew from Las Vegas and the flight was on time. The landing perfect and the service ok. The plane was pretty clean.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent Flight,"Our flight frm Manchester, NH to San Dirego, CA with a stop in Baltimore went without a hitch.  There was some moderate turbulence and the flight crew was courteous to those who would not remain seated while the seat belt lights were on.  On both filghts the flight crew were excellent.  We arrived at both stops on time or slightly before.  Our luggage also made the fiight."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Return from Baltimore after Christmas Visit,"We always use Southwest Airlines when we fly to and from Baltimore. Flight#251 left BWI @5:00pm and arrived @ RSW @ 7:30pm, non-stop. Smooth flight, on time.We use Southwest Airlines whenever we can, depends on what cities they fly into."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Holiday travel!,"Over all decent flight. The ground crew in Las Vegas airport, very disappointed!! Our flight was late and the guy making announcements thought his “not funny “ jokes would help a restless crowd during holiday travel....it didn’t work!!! He should have just done his job and updated us on the timing of our late flight....not pretend he was headlining at a local comedy club!!!! Once on board, crew was nice and professional!!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Early morning flight,"Traveling as a family of three is always a challenge, trying to sit together.  However, this day was exceptional as we got to sit in the same row. Southwest allows people to pay extra in order to board early, but we didn't do this. We checked in online exactly 24 hours ahead, and still ended up in the B group. The gate agent allowed us to board at the end of the A group due to our young child standing there with us."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Not Perfect, but Definately the Best by Far of the Others!!","Short uneventful, uncrowded, trip that left on time and arrived early. More comfortable seat and more legroom than other carriers at a better fare. Had my usual Coke Zero and pretzels before dozing off a little.  Don't fell like a second class citizen, and don't regret having to board with Southwest, like I do with other carriers."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Best customer experience ever on an airline,"Before flying down I spent the $50 for the two of us to get the advanced seating option.  When I got my boarding passes we were still almost the last to board - on both legs.  On leg two we could not even sit at the same end of the airplane.  The next day I emailed a complaint to SW.  They acknowledged my complaint in a return email the next day.  When it was tie to fly back I figured why bother?  The night before the return flight I received an email from SW telling me that they were refunding the $50 and apologized for the mix up.  That did impress me.   However, that is not what impressed me the most. The night before my wife went to bed early, feeling queasy.  In the AM she said she felt better but not 100% yet.  While waiting 4 hours to board we went to mid terminal to have a drink and a bite.  She ordered a martini.  As she was finishing it I suggested that she cut herself off as she was not herself.  She ordered another anyway.  A while after that arrived I left for 10 minutes to change clothes.  When I returned her drink, and glass, we're gone.  And so was she - mentally.  Never seen anything like that before.  I had to physically help her to gate 8.  There she sat trying to sleep.  Then we were notified we had to go to Gate 6.  I think she was worse at this time and it was a struggle to get her to the gate area.  When it was time to get in line I had to help her while we dragged 2 carry ons.  FINALLY made it in to the plane where the flight crew approached me about my wife and that we shouldn't make the flight to Baltimore.  I said we would thinking that she would be sober in 4.5 hours.  10 minutes before flight time they asked us off the plane.  Here is where it gets good. Outside the planes entrance was a flight attendant with a wheel chair, plus another staff to take our carry ons.  They walked all the way to the luggage area with us and retrieved our bags (now its 5 total) and then took us to see the SW medic.  He told me how to feed and water my wife for best results in handling too much alcohol.  Then the two flight attendants - both women - walked us thru customs and then to the waiting van that I called.  These women also had mad arrangements for us to catch the same flight the next day - all at no charge.  I don't think that we will ever fly another airline than SouthWest (unless they don't go where we need to go).  That was a class act.  FYI - I got Sheryle back to the apartment (I called the owner for OK) and she was in bed by 6:00pm.  She didn't get up until 19:00am the next morning - 16 straight hours asleep - and felt good enough to walk but still had the upset stomach and headache - and then added a runny nose.  That's not alcohol but I sure think it aggravated it! Wow.  Thank you SouthWest."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good Direct Flights between Oakland and Albuquerque,"I fly SouthWest alot from ABQ to Oakland for work.  Overall, this is a good flight.  Usually on time, direct flight.   Oakland is pretty good airport for Business.  Southwest has a ton of gates in Oakland.   TSA is ok, better than many other airports.Many people don't like SOuthwest's open seating, BUT I LOVE IT,   I haven't been stuck with a Middle Seat on Southwest for years.  But get middle seats alot of the time on American or Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Holiday travel,"Delays from LIT, delays from Orlando.  Bad weather that night returning so was lucky we didn’t miss our connection @DAL.  My biggest complaint is waiting an hour for bags upon on return at 11:30pm.  Free bags=waiting an hour to get them?"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Cabo Flight,"The trip to Cabo was uneventful. Cabo's airport has been upgraded to add another gate are, which was nice; however, it was total chaos when the flight was announced to start boarding. It was not SW's normal stand in line by your boarding number. People who had paid for the early boarding were shoving their way into the crowd to get to their spot and then didn't realize all they were doing was getting onto a shuttle. Then, we had to stand outside on the tarmac and try to line up properly in order to board, all the while breathing in jet fuel. That part was horrible. The flight itself was uneventful; however, it nightmare was after getting through customs at LAX and trying to find the correct terminal and breathing in more exhaust from cars and buses (I'll definitely try to avoid flying through LAX in the future)."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Always cancelling flights,"Southwest will cancel your flight hours before your scheduled departure. They will not provide realistic options for a replacement flight. I had to purchase a last minute $500 ticket with Delta airlines in order to get to my destination on time for my family. Southwest will not answer the phone when the cancellations occur. I was on hold for 40 minutes and no one ever picked up. This is very poor customer service. The weather in states that are no where near your departure city or arrival city can affect your scheduled vacation or family events. In addition, the late flights are always delayed. This happens frequently at the larger airports like Dallas, TX. Never book a flight scheduled to leave after 6:00pm. When you finally reach your destination it will be 1:00am the next day. The customer services at Southwest has really gotten bad. It's definitely not what it used to be. Book with another airline, you will end up spending that extra money on expensive airport food when your flight is delayed for five (5) hours."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always a great flight,"Southwest is always great.  The flight attendants are extremely down-to-earth, pleasant, and have a welcomed sense of humor.  The captain and 2nd officer interact positively with the customers.  You just get a great feeling on board."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Military Boarding,Someone needs to set a military Boarding policy for Southwest. SMF only allows military Boarding if you are in uniform.   All other hubs allows military Boarding between  groups A & B.  I will avoid using South West in the future for business or pleasure.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Courteous airline stewards,0","They warned us that Midway Chicago had fog, just to let us know the possibilities ahead of time. Then on my way back to Cleveland, they sent me a text to let me know my flight was cancelled and I was able to book a new flight through a different city at check in. I love being informed and the free luggage!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Most helpful of any airline to disabled passenger.,Southwest is always helpful to my husband who is disabled. They always let him sit ion the bulkhead seat which we appreciate greatly as he has trouble walking at all.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Headed to Las Vegas then on to Bryce,"Great flight! Got to see Vegas and Utah. Lovely mountains, beautiful water and fresh air. Would go again, but this time alone."
n/a,50,Love Southwest Air,"Consistent service, their terminal in Columbus (cmh) is easy to navigate, nice selection of shops while you wait, restrooms are always clean.I have been fortunate to have had on time departure every time I fly Southwest, service is great, love no upcharge for checking bags.  Their cell phone app is easy to use as well."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,One of my favorite airlines,Southwest has great customer service and I love that you can switch flights easily at no cost. They have a solid app with good in-flight entertainment options and a strong snack game.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On Time,Flight took off and landed on time. Smooth take off and landing. Use early boarding option to avoid being stuck in one of the middle seats! I much prefer assigned seating as used on other airlines.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Two free bags a must for a three week return trip.,I love that I get two free bags and seat flexibility.  My sister and I got to sit together both legs of the flight.  I think Southwest planes have larger seats than most.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,winter vacation,"This airline is  a budget airline we did not pay for any extras. They do not reserve seats first come first serve type boarding. We paid close attention to check in time and where able to get a lower boarding number. Flight was on time, some of the flight attendants had a since of humor most did not."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent service!!,My husband and I traveled to PR for New year through Southwest Airlines and the experience was very pleasant.  They allow us to carry two bags per person.  excellent service.Thanks Southwest!!
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Not accommodating,"My flight was delayed because of weather, causing me to miss my connection. Fair enough, sometimes the weather is just bad. However, when I arrived and stated that I had missed my connection due to inclement weather. They booked me a new flight alright, which took off THE NEXT DAY. I asked if there was any way they could book me on another airlines flight, and the answer came back as ""No"", that's it no explanation. When I pressed for one they simply said ""We don't have an agreement with another airline"". We'll I'm sorry but screw your agreement, I paid you for a service and I expect that service to be completed, and if you have to buy a new ticket for me out of your own pocket because you were unable to deliver on your end of the bargain that's YOUR problem. They didn't put me up in a hotel, all they did was give me a hotel ""discount"" which is stupid, it costs as much as the flight to buy the hotel and get transportation to and from it. So they gave me nothing but a measly meal voucher and a night in an airport, not even an overnight kit and all my baggage was checked. Great. Will not be flying with them ever again."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,On time but not always the best value,"We travelled first to Minneapolis, then later to Cleveland and back to Abq. The luggage was heavy with holiday gifts but arrived safely. Had an extraordinary long wait for it in MN however. All was good with Xmas day return flight busy which hasn't been so in the past.The only disconcerting fact is that SWA is no longer the least expensive airline, we took it because of the connections and the fact that we had a lot of luggage. It is often less of a hassle to fly another airline and many times at a cheaper rate, have an assigned seat waiting(not having to jump thru hoops getting an early number or pay for it),and equal service."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Sons boot camp graduation,"Got to  Philly, people at baggage counter were awesome, not so much  at gate they  were rude seems as if we interrupted them  from their scrolling on the internet and put them out of way for  asking about Military boarding, oh my so RUDE and said he wasnt in uniform anyway so no! Shame on southwest He was told not to wear his uniform per his commanders just have milatary id.. treat our servicemen with some respect.. better yet we get to Denver and southwest let him on.. get your acts together southwest in Philadelphia rude"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fabulous Fight,I have anxiety when I fly because of being closed in.  The space did not seem cramped and we chose the seats  in the back of the plane.  The flight arrived on time and left on time.  The staff on board was amazing and so friendly.  I will definitely fly Southwest again.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Do they care?,"When you book Southwest Airlines everyone should know you get what you get! They have their herding boarding process and if you don’t like it then don’t fly with them. However, what you should not get is screwed out of bag fees because they don’t calibrate their scales in LAS. Don’t get screwed on bag fees with a false overweight claim. Scales in LAS off by at least 8 lbs. We know this because of the weight traveling into LAS and then departing when I had removed all the clothes that I wore from my bag and placed in an additional bag to travel back. That was at least 10 lbs I removed. Just don’t let them screw you out of money. Travel at your own risk!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,So helpful,"We missed our 6 am flight which kind of put me in a panic! But once I go Through the long service line, the agent fixed it immediately with no questions and no issue- got us on the next flight. No charge, no guilt, nothing. I have Always loved this airline and recommend it to everyone!"
Date of travel: June 2019,40,"An Airline with exemplary Service and Staff. Still in 19th Century, no boarding Passes","South West is an economy Airline and they go about cost cutting by ridiculous means. There are no boarding passes, hence no seat numbers. If you are travelling with family and the plane is full, you will be seated in front and wife will be in the rear.However, the flight crew is very courteous, helpful and professional. The Airlines perhaps continue fly because of the pleasant crew.The service is Worth money. Definitely recommended for budget travellers."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,A Petty Stickler of a ticket agent,"We flew to PHX for appointments at the Mayo Clinic.  Upon departure my wife was in a wheelchair and we had to get our boarding passes at the ticket counter due to a change in our schedule.  The Southwest employee asked my wife a couple questions, like, can you walk the jetway and do you need a special seat.......what's a special seat on a 727 with one class of service?  My crippled wife apparently gave a wrong answer about being able to walk down the jetway instead of using a wheelchair.  Because of that, instead of getting a pre-board pass we ended up in row 17 which necessitated my poor wife who was in great discomfort and pain, walking an unnecessarily long way.  I pleaded with the ticket agent and explained my wife's medical condition, but no, she had given a wrong answer.....because she is a trooper and doesn't like anyone to think she is a slacker, even though she was in pain at the time.  So it goes, some Southwest employees have empathy and common sense, and others have no clue or compassion for other peoples difficulties.  Otherwise, the flight was uneventful and on time."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Nice Cattle Car,"My wife and I prefer flights that have two seats per row instead of the 3 per row that every Southwest flight has.  I was reminded yet again why I do not like sitting next to a stranger.  You wouldn't think a guy would sit next to you and spend most of the hour flight picking his nose, but we drew the short straw this time and that's what happened.  I calmed myself by repeating that at least he wasn't coughing, sneezing on me or hogging the arm rest, so I sucked it up and sat next to the kid who grew up to pick his nose in public like the 8 year old he once was.  That's why I don't like Southwest"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best airline around,"I love southwest airlines,  they give 2 free bags, plus a carry on free. Other airlines may be cheaper but by the time you add seats & bags it a lot more than southwest.  If I can fly with them I always will."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Leaving on a Jet Plane to TX,I have taken the flight a couple times from Pittsburgh to San Antonio and the first time my flight got jumbled up due to Chicago Midway being on a ground stop but they got my on another plane to Atlanta and I arrived in San Antonio a little after my original arrival time. The second time not only did I arrive in San Antonio on time but we were almost an hour early! There are no direct flights on SW from Pit to San Antonio but I have never had a problem with my layover or connections.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Plane half full and 1/2 hr. early,Flight was delightful and landed at Bradley 1/2 hour early.  I just wish they would allowThose of us who have no luggage on board to deplane first.l
Date of travel: June 2019,50,A smooth on time flight,"My flight from Tampa to Columbus was on time with no hassels or delays. Whenever I fly, I always use Southwest if possible.Their service to customers is top notch, and if you have to make a change in your plans, Southwest makes changing very easy. I would recommend Southwest to anyone planning a trip."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Our trip to Hotlanta,"We flew from Omaha, NE to Chicago, Midway & from there to Atlanta, GA for a weddingin the mountains Our flights were all on time and the cabin crew was very professional and courteous. Our flight from  Midway left on-time and arrived in Atlanta as planned, on-time. I must say that my wife & I both used ""Reward points"" for this Round trip from Omaha to Atlanta and back home. Southwest has been our ""preferred"" airline for over nine years. Rarely do we experience any delays. We both strongly recommend the Southwest Rewards program."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,"Southwest flight 0746 Honolulu to Oakland, 535pm departure","The bad-Terrible flight, seats were hard as a rock, even before we took off, the plane smelled like a toilet, uncaring flight attendants (especially the male ones, they looked like they didn't want to be there, and maybe they hate their job), unattended 8 and 10-year-olds behind me kept kicking the seats (aisle and middle), fighting with each other with fists, and using the seat tray as a shoving toy/weapon all while the flight attendants watched and ignored.  The bathrooms were disgusting, fluid on the ground, overflowing receptacles 2 hours into the flight and dirty toilet area.  When we deplaned, the flight attendant didn't even say thank you and a pleasant goodbye, just staring like he wanted to go home.The good-fast boarding and deplaning.  Baggage came out quickly."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,"Oakland to Honolulu, like catching the bus","On 1/2/20, flight 2381, 420pm departure.  The boarding pass indicated a boarding time of 350pm, so we ate and used the restroom.  We purchased early boarding.  When we got to the gate at 345pm, there was no line because everyone else had boarded the plane!  Southwest needs to better inform passengers of early boarding.  The flight itself didn't pull away from the gate until after 430pm, there was not enough air, so most of the passengers sat there in the warm stuffy air.  My advice is to get early boarding and stand by the gate at least 45 minutes before boarding.  This is the only time out of over a hundred flights on Southwest that they have ever boarded early.  It must be due to the route."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Everything went great and on time.,We changed planes in Atlanta and everything was on time. Had enough time to get a bit to eat and still catch the next plane to Columbia.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Disappointing,"I fly Southwest all the time, mostly because I live near their hub at Hobby airport and because of their nonstop service to couple of destinations that I travel to.  This flight was a return flight and it was very disappointing to say the least.  The flight was delayed  for over an hour and half, originally because the arriving flight was late but then because we sat on the tarmac for a long time and each time the pilot would announce our position in the takeoff line.  The only thing was that it seemed our position wasn't changing.  But the real problem occurred at the destination.  The flight landed at 10:15 PM but we were not able to get our luggage until 11:30 PM.  The problem was a total unorganized handling of the luggage belt.  At first after 45 minute wait, it was announced that the luggage will be on belt 1, only to change that to belt 3 a few minutes later.  After waiting on belt 3 and retrieving 1 piece of our luggage, we noticed another piece was on belt 1 again.  Once that was retrieved the announcement came out that the rest would be on belt 4.  This went on for a while until we retrieved everything.  Very disappointing to see a lack of concern for the passengers.  The actual flight and the attendants were nice, but the process of the departure and arrival and luggage handling left a lot to be desired."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always a great flight!,We've always had good experiences with flying Southwest!  No frills.  Pleasant attendants.  Pilots do a great job flying the plane!  :)  Snacks & drinks are satisfactory.  They leave on time and arrive on time.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,four hour delay,"We experienced a four hour delay in Atlanta. They kept us updated,provided a $100.00 voucher and $14.00 for food. Very kind and caring staff."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Holiday travel,"Love that Southwest doesn't nickel and dime you! Friendly attendants, comfortable flight. No complaints!"
Date of travel: July 2019,50,airline travel,The flight attendants where all very nice on this flight. We arrived on time going but coming back. we were delayed at the Orlando Airport for an hour and half. They gave us no reason why for the delay.   Enjoyed the cookies and pretzels with the FREE soda.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Crabby staff and small seats,"We were flying back from Dallas to San Diego on the 27th of December.  Usually, the staff of Southwest is very friendly, but from the check-in guy to the people outside of the gate, everyone was in a ""Chrismas is over and I do not want to be here working"" mood.  We upgraded our seat, paid $40 each extra to do so, and it is a good thing I am on a diet and lost weight because it was extremely cramped."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Easy and excellent service,"We needed to change our flight time, was so happy to find out we could change our flight with no additional fees.  It was so easy to change the flight within the app!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Convenient Non-stop Service,"This was a nonstop flight from Fort Lauderdale to Austin, TX.  My flight was late due to weather up north.  Southwest kept me informed by text and at the gate. Check-in at FLL was quick and easy, because SW has enough kiosks to handle a heavy passenger load.  I was flying on Christmas Eve, and the airport was crowded, but things went smoothly, thanks to the efficiency of SW staff.  It also helped to have TSA Pre-Check.  I enjoyed being able to upgrade my seat assignment at the gate for a reasonable fee.  The flight itself was one of the best I've had on SW.  This was due in large part to the Captain, Mark.  He came out of the cockpit and greeted each passenger with a smile and a handshake.  I've never had that experience before.  His ease was infectious.  I knew I was in good hands for the flight.  Having a personable and very competent crew is the hallmark of a SW flight.  This is why I always fly SW."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Lightly bumpy,Flight was just OK. It was really a bit bumpy all the way. We have been to PHX many times and this was the bumpiest. We normally get a little turbulence over the mountains but this was bumpy all the way.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Southwest isn’t the value airline anymore,"What can I say about southwest that would be considered a positive? The airplane was in pretty good condition. Now, it was a cattle car where their open seating leads to chaos on every flight. Then, as if being packed into the cattle car haphazardly wasn’t enough the WiFi kept going out on a 5 hour flight . This lead me to being stuck with a middle seat on a long flight with little to do and I couldn’t even look out the window because the lady closed the window shade. Another winner was that half the plane apparently needed “extra time” to board and so by the time I got on the race was on. I wish Southwest would credit me for the return flight because 300 for that flight was surely not worth the experience I had. It was literally worse than spirit airlines."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight,"Went to the Carolinas and Gatlinbutg. Flights were on time, attendants were very friendly, Check in went great!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Holiday Travel,Left on Christmas Day.  Everyone was kind and upbeat. The flight was on time with no problems.  This airline is the best value out there.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Good, very good.","Southwest is the only airline I fly.  Always on time, always friendly, and I love it. Trustworthy and reliable."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Always my first option in flying,"Southwest is always my first choice in flying.  They have a proven track record with me as I have been flying Southwest 30 years.  I was able to book my travel a few months in advance which is nice because the price was affordable and I was able to select the nonstop flights that worked for the times I needed.  The reason for the four stars is simply because I had to change a flight because of a cancellation on the part of the airlines.  On the return flight back to St. Louis, we experienced a 35 minute delay, which is unusual for Southwest, granted, but I had an 11 year old daughter traveling with me who was anxious to get home.  I will continue to fly this airline as often as I can."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great airline,"We fly to Cancun many times a year and for many years. Southwest has been the best airline that we have in counted. The flight attendants went way beyond the normal, helping people putting luggage overhead, funny , helpful and professional. And I have to applaud the free luggage aspect."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,A long but safe trip,"The journey was long because it wasn't direct, I had to fly via Las Vegas. However, it was confortable and safe. We had a nice drink and a lovely snack. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Southwest again."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great airline!,"My family and I flew Southwest over Christmas break from New York to Vail, Colorado (Denver International Airport).  Our flights both ways were amazing.  Southwest reminds me of how things used to be before airlines started to nickel and dime you for everything. Each of us were allowed, with NO additional charge, 1 carry on,  1 personal item, and 2 checked bags.  Skis and ski bags count together as only one checked item. We had a ski bag that included 2 sets of skis and boots and they counted that as one bag. (Still totally free). The flight attendants were friendly, gave out 3 free snacks, free non-alcohol drinks, and after handing out all the drinks and snacks, asked if anyone wanted anything else.  The trays were full size and the seats were fully padded despite us being in the economy class. Our flights were on time both ways. The open seating was a little stressful but we (a family of 4) were able to sit together.  I would definitely recommend this airline!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On time and Customer Oriented Airline,Agent at counter was friendly to customers on boarding the flight. The flight attendants were friendly and snacks were enjoyed. Seat was comfortable.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,On Time Flight,Southwest did a great job of making everything work out ahead of time on a flight from OKC to Denver and then on to Louisville.  Flight to Louisville was 30 minutes ahead and cabin service was great!  Love the no bag fees!
Date of travel: December 2019,40,First-Timer,"We decided to give Southwest a chance, since we usually travel on Jet Blue. The flight was great! The only thing I have a problem with is that, seats are not assigned. We traveled with our children (16, 13, 11 yrs). We weren't allowed to board until our group (C) was called. The girls were not sitting with each other or near us. The fact that we were allowed 2 free checked bags made it a bit more bearable. I'll definitely  fly Southwest again. You just can't beat the price...:)"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"On time, easy to travel with","It's so nice when I can use Southwest to fly to my destination. They are generally less expensive than the other airlines, especially when one considers no charge for checked baggage! All the personnel are friendly and helpful. The only negative is that on our return flight, we were in Business Class. But the folks with 9 SERVICE DOGS on this flight were allowed to board first. So much for the advantage of Business Class."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,all flights and transfers were late,Flight was fine just every leg of the trip was late. Staff was very friendly. Captain did keep us informed.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Typical Southwest Airlines flight. Uneventful, but pleasant.","Southwest is my choice of airlines if a flight is available. I like the open seating, bags fly free and Southwest Airlines employees always seem to be friendly and upbeat. They often make the required flight announcements entertaining and worth listening to, yet they are still very professional in the process."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Experience,This was by far one of my best experiences. Having the bags included made it so nice to not have to worry about a carry-on bag.  This was one of the most stress free flights ever. I didn't even mind the first come first served style seating.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Southwest decline ?,"Both the flight out of BWI and Las Vegas were delayed due to maintenance, gate delays and/or paperwork issues.  During this 5 hour flight, the wi-fi went out several times with unacceptable excuses from the flight attendants.  I fear the customer service and overall corporate environment are starting to deteriorate which causes me concern.  I sent a very detailed complaint to Southwest and received a response that was generic in nature. It appears Southwest no longer wants to admit they have issues! I am concerned and hope Southwest gets a handle on their internal issues."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Direct to Houston,"Took SW from L-ville to Houston-Hobby. We took SW because they have a direct flight between those two airports, no stops or changing planes. We usually skip the fee to move up in the boarding line, and did so this time. It worked out fine. We were in the B-group and had no problem sitting together. My only complaint is the knee room between rows. It just seems like all airlines should give a few more inches. I am only 6' tall and yet my knees are right up against the magazine pouch, and one must pray the in front of you does not run his seat back. The flight was actually in early on both ends and no gate wait for being early. Smooth landing too. A good trip."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"After 10 years no fly, pleasantly surprised","I am handicapped and can not walk. So I have not flown for the last 10 years. In Sept 2019, I went on a trip to Lake Tahoe to see friends and go to a work convention. What a pleasant surprise both coming and going. Southwest personal treated me as a VIP, helped with wheelchair service. Security check in, and on board comfort of access seating in the first row close to the toilet.If I fly again in 2020, they are my first choice of carrier."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight to cool(weatherwise)Florida,"Always love to fly Southwest. They are efficient, friendly and I feel safe. They as aways ask if you need more drinks or snacks. The attendants have a great sense of humor and inject that into their safety speech."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Wind shear delay,"On 3rd leg of 4 leg trip and could not land in Denver due to wind shear, had to re-route to Colorado Springs. Sat on runway for 2.5 hours. Finally were cleared to fly on to Denver. We had to rearrange our plans for the day as people were expecting us much earlier to join them for lunch. It all worked out though, with some last minute changes and Southwest was very apologetic and gave everyone $100 vouchers for a future flight. Safety is first priority!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Handicapped treatment - Excellen!,I've always preferred preassigned seating. My company booked Southwest. Because of my age and the use of a cane. I sat in the first row aisle in both directions - no problems! I would strongly recommend Southwest if you qualify for preboarding.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Smooth flight in weather and great value for my money.,Our plane was not allowed to land for 20 minutes late but we circled for clearance.  Pilot and crew were curious and flight was smooth.  WiFi worked and we had free movies.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Bare bones, but it works for me!","The one thing I always enjoy about Southwest Airlines is that it's an economy airline, but they treat me with care and respect.  The flight attendants have personality and their personality is infused into their routine speaking moments. The check in process is easy, 24 hours in advance online.  You get 1 free checked bag.  I have only been on flights 2 hours or less.  No meals, just pretzels and beverages were available.  Which is fine, just eat before you get on the plane, or bring snacks with you."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,helpful employees,"The flight was good and the SW enployees were always helpful with whaterer i needed. I have flown out of the Manchester, NH airport many times and the TSA agents were always rude and a pain in the butt. Why do they seem to have a monopoly on bad service. We never get treated by TSA anywhere as poorly as at this airport."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,outstanding,"You just can't go wrong for the money and the free bags! Customer service is always great and they try to keep you laughing.. you won't be disappointed unless you want to fly first class, this is an equal seating plane"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,The BEST!,"Rarely late, you always know what to expect. The airline ""attendants"" and funny and friendly! The planes are always clean - I really don't know how they do that!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"As always, a great on time flight with excellent service","As always, SWA is a great airline from great aircraft, great service, and great people.  We fly them and Delta for the same reasons.  Super flight attendants and service."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Poorly Handled Situation,"i normally love Southwest and always try to fly them, but the situation out of Havana on 12-23-19 was badly handled.  Bad weather inFt Lauderdale, delayed flights leaving there-headed to Havana so we were greatly delayed leaving Havana.  We still would've made our connection to Austin, but the SW crew filled out departure paperwork incorrectly and we were delayed on the runway another 45 minutes.  SW kept insisting that it was weather and wouldn't own up to the mistake.Because of the holidays we had trouble getting home and they didn't want to give any vouchers.  Finally they've me a miserly one.  I'm very disappointed in what was my favorite airline"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great flight,Paid early boarding for $25 and got on after pre-boarding and sat in the 4th row aisle! It was well worth to pay for early boarding!  Great flight and left on time and arrived early in Vegas!!!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Affordable price.  Excellent service.,"The flights to and from New Orleans were full, so it was very uncomfortable seating.  But, we arrived safe, sound and on time!  Good value!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great flying experience for good value,I haven’t traveled with Southwest in a while. We decided to book our holiday vacation with Southwest and we turned out having a good flight deal and a wonderful flight experience. All flights were on time and we got great assistance from Southwest staff before boarding and during our flight.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,On time! All good except for luggage collection,"Our flight left on time and arrived on time! It was very bumpy going across the middle of the country, probably due to storms. You must download the app to get any entertainment( movies, tv, music) and you have to bring your own food on board. All was good until we had to wait ONE hour for our luggage to be available. Really unacceptable!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,SOUTHWEST IS AWESOME,"Flew out of Raleigh to Denver 2 days before Christmas and it was very smooth. One thing I suggest for travelers with Southwest if you are traveling during a holiday when folks travel with children is paying for “Early Bird Check-in” which ranges from $15.00-25.00. This will allow you to board in the A group before they let folks on with children and the other boarding groups. Better selection of seats since your not assigned one. Also with regular tickets you have to check-in 24 hours before your flight. With “Early Bird” they check your in. The best thing is to get TSA precheck to avoid long lines at airports. It’s $85.00 good for 5 years. Southwest is awesome to fly with and the crews I’ve dealt with are the best. We actually drive from Roanoke, Va area to Raleigh, NC (3 hours) and save several hundred dollars on flights on Southwest versus our choices at Roanoke. I will never us any other airline!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,20,Still awaiting response since September,"Perfume complaint still not acknowledged from September 2019 flight. StewardessApparently “drenched” in perfume, quite noxious and irritating. Have been informed that cabin personnel are instructed not to have any such noxious substances on their bods."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Trip from Denver, CO to San Juan, Puerto Rico","We were glad we had selected Southwest Airlines for this trip as we were to embark on a cruise ship from San Juan and had luggage that flew free.  The connections in Fort Lauderdale on the way to and in Baltimore on the way back were easy.  The airplane from Fort Lauderdale flew relatively low and we couldn't help admiring the most incredible view of the sea, islands and clouds.  All flights took off on time ."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,great airline,I like flying Southwest Airlines. The staff is professional and the planes are clean. The prices are good and your bags fly for free.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,I LOVE SWA BUSINESS MODEL,"This is my No 1 to go airline when travelling within USA. I love flying SWA because of their flexibility and ease of booking and changing tickets. You have the options to cancel/change you flight days before your flight with NO FEES and if you decide to cancel on time, your full ticket price can be applied to future travel within one year of the purchase date. ISN'T THAT AWESOME? Easy boarding and You don't pay for seat to be assigned. Nice and friendly crew members all the the I fly with SWA"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Value still there,"Flew RT from Chicago to Vegas. Price is still competitive (although not as much a steal as it used to be). Also, flight options currently limited to due 737 MAX grounding. Good flight, good service. I enjoy the complimentary drink coupons resulting from my Rapids Rewards membership, even though I'm not that much of a frequent flyer. I don't mind the lack of seat assignments -- especially when I fly alone. The best part? $0 luggage fees. Don't ever change, SWA."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Nothing to Drink/Snack,"Not only the flight was delayed, we believed they did not have drinks or snacks on the plane. We sat in the plane for over 45 minutes at the gate with nothing to drink. When the flight took off, we did not get anything and when the staff walked down the isles they would not look at you. Instead they look down on the ground."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good and affordable prices,"Excellent service and affordable price. They let us take and extra luggage free of cost. Definitively, we will use their service again."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,A pure Delight,"AS always South West  Airlines continues to be a fun airlines to travel, 2 free luggage is a stand out in the industry. My flight was pleasant & very relaxing"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Love the boarding pass check in.,"You can check in 24 hours in advance of your flight.  This gets you a place in line. A = first to board and you pick your seat.  B= second to board.  They do allow upgrade if you want to be first.  They also allow military in uniform, wheel chairs and families with kids under 6 years of age to board earlier.  Nice customer service with 2 free carry ons. (Purse counts as one)  Or you can take luggage to baggage area.  Great prices!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Early Bird Check In Waste of Money,If early boarding is important to you purchase ONLY 1 Early Bird Check in and save  seat/seats for others in your party.  Southwest does not have a policy on a saving seats unless it doesn't disrupt boarding.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,THIRD TIME IN ROW THAT WE MISSED OUR CONNECTION IN FT LAUDERDALE!,"You always have a layover in Ft Lauderdale FL when traveling SWA from Nassau to St Louis, typically it's about an hour from when you land to when you take off to St Louis on another plane. The issue is that there's no consistency. This last time we waited in Nassau FOREVER for 5 pcs of luggage to be found & loaded. The flight attendant told us repeatedly that's what we were waiting on. I asked if my plane would wait for me in Ft Lauderdale and he said they knew we were on this plane & it was going to be tight for our connection. Plane was still there in FLL but doors were shut, our NEW tickets for a flight that leaves in 4hrs was already waiting for us. NOT FEELING THE LOVE! Don't want to hang out in FLL Airport for 4 hours ever again!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good Flight,"Boarding process takes a little getting used to, but not that big of a deal. Great price, good flight, on time, great staff. Will use them again."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Good job as usual,"Not a big fan of SW, because of their boarding process, and lack of food.That said, it is usually a pleasure with the flight attendants having a good time (usually), and being on time.  This flight, both were the case.  The flight was on time, and the cabin crew funny and efficient.Not the cheapest or most comfortable, but on time, and friendly."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Gate agent treated my 10 year old horribly!,"Since BWI is my ""home"" airport, I fly Southwest regularly, mostly out of necessity. On Monday, December 30th, my wife and 10-year old daughter and I were heading home from a wonderful vacation in Tampa, Florida and looking forward to sitting together on a short direct flight.  As an ""A-List"" member, I had an ""A"" boarding pass.  My daughter had a ""B"" pass, and my wife had a ""C"" pass.  We approached the gate agent and asked to upgrade my daughter's pass and my wife's pass so we could all board earlier.  The gate agent told us that we only needed to upgrade my wife's pass, because when traveling with a 10-year old child, she could board with one of her parents.  We paid a $40 upgrade fee to get my wife an ""A"" pass and then the boarding process began.My wife and daughter walked up to get on the plane, and the operations agent told my wife that our daughter couldn't board with her. So my daughter walked back to me, my wife got on the plane and boarding continued.  When my daughter and I went to board, my daughter was held up by the operations agent like he was a rogue bouncer at a Las Vegas nightclub.  He would not let us on the plane, despite her age and my ""A"" pass.  So we waited until B and got on together.  As we approached him, now for the 3rd time, I questioned why the gate agent had told us we could board together and didn't need an upgrade for our daughter and why he treated our daughter this way.  He became agitated and asked ""should I just let everyone on when they want to get on?""  Eventually, to avoid a scene, I told him that I hope if he ever has a child that someone somewhere would treat his child the way he treated mine.  I also told him I'd be sharing my experience with the airlines and on Trip Advisor.The operations agent couldn't have been nastier - and mostly in the direction of my young daughter.  The flight itself was fine and we wound up sitting together due to the kindness of strangers and in spite of this absurd exercise in getting wrong advice from one employee or another.  And to think we paid an extra $40 for this privilege.  Ridiculous."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Another Wonderful Experience with Southwest Airlines,"Southwest consistently has the lowest prices. They have great flight time options, wonderful service and overall communication. This flight was on-time and went smoothly in every way."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,No sense of urgency,"Were dealyed for over 1.5 hrs. With no explanation why, were told it just took longer than expected to get going. And then told we would be delayed some more on the tarmac.we made it eventually but Southwest was in no hurry to get anywhere."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Ghetto Air,"Overbooked flight filled with screaming babies and noisy, uncouth dregs of society.  Delayed over 45 minutes kicking people off the overbooked flight. Cramped seats surrounded by obese people eating disgusting foul smelling things, bumping and spilling everywhere. Excruciatingly loud announcements over the speakers constantly. Literally the worst flight I've ever had!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Southwest Airlines,"Great flight, just too many dogs being allowed on the plane.  When every seat is taken and several dogs, the mixture is just not healthy."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,trip,Friendly service and staff members. Easy access. Allowed my wife with a health problem to board early..Great Airline !
Date of travel: November 2019,50,flight,As always the flight was fine. The staff is always friendly and fun. We try to fly Southwest on any trip we do..
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Trash,They misgendered my son. And they were very rude. Every airline but this one allows my bag. Which is about a foot. They made me pay 60 dollars even though it was just a back pack not even a carry on. Absolutely disgusting trash.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,My Go To Airline,I love Southwest - they are easy to fly with and I love that the price includes what you really need - like luggage!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,My favorite airline,"Every time I fly Southwest, I have a positive, pleasant experience. From the interactions at the counter, to the in-flight service, to the moment I leave the plane I have a positive experience. To be more specific, all the staff I have interacted in my numerous flights have been polite, attentive, friendly, professional, have a good sense of humor, and offer excellent customer service. Moreover, all my flights with Southwest have been on time and uneventful. I’ve never had a flight cancelled for no reason (which has happened numerous times with other airlines), and I’ve never had issues with my luggage being lost, misplaced, or arriving late to the destination. Definitely my top choice when it comes to flying. Thank you Southwest!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Fully packed Flight,I was happy we signed up for priority boarding as the flight over was totally full and they ran out of overhead space.  We did priority boarding a month out and we were still A58/59.   I would have expected that far out to be a lower number but it was the holidays.  The flight was on time and as they were landing to the north we had a nice view of the city prior to landing on the left side of the plane.  The bags did take a while but all in all it was a very good trip.   We caught a Lyft at the airport.  We caught it in the parking garage at terminal B.   It was a 5 min walk and we used the new Lyft method where they give you a code and you take the next available Lyft.   We were going to the Financial District so it took about 45 mins and cost $50.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Christmas week getaway to Disney and Kennedy Space Center!,"Southwest Airlines delivered us to Orlando, and back to Columbus perfectly!  We had great flights, and the staff was awesome!  Flights were on time.  Could not have asked for a more pleasant experience!"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,No respect for our service men and women,I am absolutely taken a back by the way southwest treats our service men and women. I will never fly southwest again! At the very LEAST they should be allowed to enter and exit the plane before civilians.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Not so good going out but real smooth coming back,"It took us forever to get from Pittsburgh to Las Vegas-thru Denver due to weather delays and ground stoppages. We were late getting out of Pitts as the plane wasnt even there yet...it finally got in from BWI I think it was. Then we spent like forever at the airport in Denver awaiting our connecting flight...Some 5+ hrs later we finally departed from Den and got on into Vegas-a good bit late but we got there. Had a non-stop on the way back and everything was on time and very smooth.The Stewardesses and such were very friendly and helpful and just great crews both ways. It wasnt their faults for all the delays going on. Pretty smooth air most of the way, both ways, but we did have some bumps near the Rockies but that is about normal. The price was certainly right for us as well. Will fly SW again, no question."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Total cluster!,"Flew Southwest for a 2nd time and I will never again.  The “open seat” policy is total bullsh*t and not a fair to customers.  Our flight was delayed Over 40 minutes because we were waiting for luggage even tho there were to more flights after ours to Bflo, that they could have gone on.  The owners of the bags were bullying the attendant at the desk and must have paid off the supervisors who were called in for back up.  I saw that the airline is celebrating a milestone anniversary in 2020, can’t believe they made it that long with the terrible operations.  To be clear, the staff was amazing, though communication seemed to be lacking, but helpful and friendly- they deserve a better work environment....they were going to be working more hours than resting, not fair at all!Never again, no matter how cheap....like they say, you get what you pay for."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On the beach by 2:00!,"So glad Southwest has direct flights (at least one day a week) to Liberia, CR.  Our most recent flights to and from all left on time, arrived early and were very comfortable.  We can leave Baltimore in the morning and be walking on the beach in Costa by 2:00.  Awesome."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Comfortable . Crew is friendly,I have flown Southwest several times. Easy to book friendly crew. Easy on and Easy off the plane. Seats were comfortable also.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Direct flight from Sin City,"Great to go home without a connection, especially in winter around the holidays.  Wish seats had a couple more inches of legroom!  Otherwise, good service and a positive experience.  Happy Birthday singing for two passengers."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On time and cheap,Excellent. On time. Too many non qualified pre-boarders. I hate seeing any animal other than a legit seeing eye dog. Had a few but Southwest does not let just any critter on a plane. They should ban all but seeing eye dogs.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,They never disappoint,"Despite having to check in 24 hours in advance to get a decent seat, especially with family, Southwest Airlines is very good at on time takeoffs, arrivals, good service and comfortable planes with WiFi amenities."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,RIC-ATL-BNA,Southwest has done a great job making it easier to fly through the very busy Atlanta airport. They are on the C concourse and do a great job of having your connecting flight come out of the same concourse. The layovers are about two hours long..but there are alot of options for food and some unoccupied gates to unwind at. The fight from Richmond to Atlanta is about an hour and twenty minutes. The flight from Atlanta to Nashville is about 30 minutes. Easy travel for a reasonable rate if you book in advance.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,SWA very consistent and comfortable,"SWA is perfect for our family. The regional flights are often on time and we are not required to pay for unnecessary frills. Flight crew are always friendly and the live TV and movie selection keep everyone entertained.Providence airport is clean, small, and easy. Less expensive parking and less traffic then Logan.Tampa airport has made significant improvements over the past few year. One of my favorite aspects of this airport is the tram to economy and rental car parking. The kids think it is the first ride of their trip.If I was not travelling with young children I would be annoyed with the boarding procedure if asked to sit away from my family. I"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Buffalo to Tampa, Dec. 18, 2019","We always purchase the ""Early Bird"" check-in with Southwest. Although we live, in Canada, closer to the Toronto Airport we much prefer travelling through Buffalo particularly since we clear U.S. customs and immigration at the border versus the hassle at Toronto.Every aspect of travelling through Buffalo is smooth and hassle free.The flight itself left very close to on time and arrived on time.The flight crew was very helpful in supplying bandages for a gouge that I had taken out of my arm clearing security.Based on our experience with Southwest, the sixth flight this year, we highly recommend them. Actually would choose a connecting flight from Buffalo versus a direct flight from Toronto. Buffalo is that much easier to travel through."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Will NEVER schedule a flight into Houson after 6 pm,This is the 2nd time that our flight has arrived in Houston after 6 pm.  Both times there was ONLY  ONE CREW to bring in planes and UNLOAD luggage.  There were 8 planesthat landed (US being the last of 8)  Our plane staying on the runway for ONE HOURwaiting for the crew to be ready for us to come into a spot to unload.Then we waited another 45 minutes for our luggage.They know how many planes they have coming in at NIGHT ; THEREFORE keepCREW there to get them in and unload luggage.   TOTALLY NO REASON for this to happen.  We arrived on time at 9:05 but did NOT get out of airport until almost 11.Then we had a 1 1/2 hour drive home.  We should have been home at 11 pm  NOT 1am     2 of us purchased a BUSINESS SELECT ticket
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Return from NYC to Dallas,"As always with SWA, flight from NY to Dallas was on time and the flight attendants entertaining. SWA continues to deliver exceptional service for a reasonable fair. Non stops to and from Dallas daily. Exceptional choice!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always making your day better,"Traveling at Christmas Time through Denver Airport is a mad-house. Between Full Parking Lots, Terminal renovations and security, it seems we have to add 3 hours to the already 2 hours recommended in order to make our flight. This is made all better, by the staff at Southwest who treat you with patience and respect in the heart of this turmoil. The way they board, large bins and free bags means many flights leave early as all the passengers are boarded."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Decline of Customer Serivce,I use to love Southwest for its flights and amazing customer service. Flight extremely delayed due to broken air conditioning unit that significantly alerted flight time can caused increased travel cost to my trip home. Southwest customer service did very little and pushed me to call corporate. After waiting 30+ min on hold to talk to someone they told me there’s nothing more they could do. Will consider other airlines such as JetBlue in future.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Priority Boarding Is A Joke,"We had a connecting flight so we paid for auto check in which was suppose to give us a decent boarding position.  What a joke!  First they boarded wheel chairs ( absolutely the right thing to do) ... then the circus started. Anyone who needed extra time.... WOW! Half the plane boarded. A woman with a dog ( not in a carrier) trotted on & sat in the front row only to decide she preferred a different seat . ( Holding up the  boarding . People actually RAN to get in the need extra time line. Im not exaggerating, half the plane boarded. Then when regular boarding began , people in c boarded with A because the SW attendant allowed it. What I have learned is not to pay for auto check in but to simply get in the need extra time line. The next time I have a connecting flight I will take advantage of the system and board early also. Perhaps anyone who needs extra time should have to wait to exit the plane  after everyone else. That may solve the problem. Why do they need extra time to board but they are fine to run off the plane? Perhaps they should have to sit in a certain area so they get help getting off after everyone else does."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Baggage Bliss,"Atl airport has ruined a few pieces of luggage in past travels. This time there was no difference except this luggage was hard shell and brand spanking new. Lots of research went in to select tough, durable, affordable luggage that could survive the atlanta airport. We waited at baggage claim knowing our luggage would be returned to us in the same way it was given. Nope! Somehow it got caught in the conveyor and it crushed and cracked it. I usually dont complain but this time was the last straw. I went to southwest and calmly showed them the issue. Daphne the manager was excellent. I left there with a smile on my face and feeling like I had just received a blessing. Thank you so much southwest. I will continue to fly with you."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Terrible don’t suggest it at all,This was a terrible airlines to choose u enter first of all needing to pay a extra quick buck to sit next to your kids if there over 7  you can’t sit next to your family unless your rich with the A class they treat u by how much u pay not by anything else  you have to sit away from your family  I saw so many parents upset about this overall also the leg room was so little and the way they treat you is awful a kids crying in the back because he’s brothers bothering him and he’s threatened if he dosent stop crying he will be kicked off the plane I only suggest this if you wanna travel south s%#$we got to the baggage claim it took 1 hour for the lugages to come for everyone and then we realize our bags are opened and stolen we waited in front of the claim so it was people working for this southwest doing this this is terrible they have ruined people one time they made a old lady fall and not being able to sit next to your family is a terrible idea it reminds you of a bus asking people if u can spend a 7 hour flight with them is just to much and it should be for anyone so I suggest don’t ever even think about Southwest Airlines just terrible 0/10
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Good airline, with amazing helpful staff!","Traveling in holiday season is usually stressful but the staff on PHL airport were patient and helpful. Apart from the obvious plus of allowing 2 checked in bags, southwest also has good seats (not too narrow). I used their internet option this time and found the connectivity good for data related activities."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Amazing customer service,"I had scheduled a non-stop flight from St. Louis to San Francisco over the holidays and was so pleased with Southwest's customer service. My original flight was overbooked, so they offered a voucher if anyone wanted to volunteer to switch flights. I wasn't in a huge rush to get home, so they put my name down and told me they'd let me know if they needed to bump me to a different flight. They were quick and incredibly thoughtful with organizing my new itinerary; I boarded my new flight at the same exact time as my original flight and only got home 4 hours later with a short layover in Vegas. Overall, very impressed with Southwest on this trip."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Love being able to change tickets with no fee,Southwest is the most flexible & fun airline around. Love being able to check 2 bags each for free and to change flights if necessary with no fees.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,always awesome,"Southwest is always the best, never have a problem. Flew into Chicago Midway for an hour layover and then onto Minn/st Paul airport. again no problems.  Took the transit system from airport to just about our hotel in downtown minneapolis. easy   and only $2   We love southwest and ya get to pick your own seat"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Pleased with flight,Pleasant trip overall. No frills. Staff was very pleasant. One downfall was the boarding process as this leads to chaos when boarding
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent flight,"We have booked our flight early at very competitif price. As all inter-island flight, check-in and security check are made in USA...Very good courtessy of The on board services..."
n/a,30,Bring a mask,Now please don't get me wrong I truly like flying with this Airline and the reason why I am doing this review is because my recent flight was not a very pleasant one both flights going to and from we're both full flights and on every plane there was at least 10 to 12 coughing and sneezing and by the time my trip was over I got to my residence and I was sick as a dog my advice is to just have something to cover your face because whatever was roaming about the cabin definitely got me sick
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Never a problem-unlike some of the bigger airlines,I fly for work and request Southwest whenever I can. Southwest has never lost or smashed my luggage - an experience I've had 3 times on higher priced airlines. The sassy Southwest flight crews are a joy compared to other airlines.  I love to pick my own seat - sitting in the back is fine with me.  My employer loves the no charge for checked bags (the reimbursement & paperwork with other airlines is a pain for them too).
Date of travel: December 2019,40,they did make it right in the end,"my orginal flight was delayed to the point that my entire flight was changed.  At that point I lost my ""A"" place in line since I was ""late "" checking in.  I went to the customer service desks and complained and the rep gave me a preboard status so I could get a isle seat on the left, which is the place I have to sit on a long flight.  So it all worked out in the end"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Tired of all the delays,"In the past, I have enjoyed Southwest. Over the last several flights, there always seems to be drama. Delayed flights, broken airplanes, crew problems."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Service at a Great Price,"Southwest is about the only Airline I will fly now. No hidden fees and the service is outstanding. There is nothing more frustrating than getting to the Airport and finding out that there are extra charges, won’t happen with Southwest. That and no extra fees if for some reason you have to change your plans and flights."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,THE EARLY BIRD GETS PREFERRED TREATMENT,"We've never had used or thought to use the ""early bird"" service until our most recent trip involving flights from Las Vegas to Albuquerque, back to Vegas and then to Oakland.  We decide to pay the additional $25.00 so that we could check in and reserve our boarding positions 36 hours before flight vs. 24 hours.  It was worth the price in our case because we were leaving early and wanted the extra time advantage to ensure better seating.  We also wanted to print our boarding passes before driving to the airport.  I know, we're ""old school"".  Anyway, if you find yourself in need and similar situation, they this is a good option for you."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Good Service,"Round trip Orlando to Montego Bay.  Southwest continues to be my airline of choice.  ""B"" boarding, both ways, but still managed to get an isle seat on bulkhead on the way down, so lots of extra leg room. On return, still managed seat on the isle. Love the one free checked bag police, so no need to scramble for overhead bin space.  Could have a cheeper flight, but then would have to pay for isle seat, extra leg room, checked bag...in the end, excellent value for the dollar."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Southwest,"I have been flying with Southwest since 1990.   I can safely say this is no longer the best airline for short flights , price or customer service .    It is , hands down, the worst carry out there .   It is a ""low cost carrier"" that charges the same rate, often more than other airlines and then provides subpar service and ridiculous routes .  The ground and flight staff are snarky , uninformed and could care less about providing customer service .   My most recent experience, flying from PDX to RNO is the final straw for me.   My flight was cancelled sometime on 12/31 .  I was not informed until I reached the airport early 1/1 .   I was then only given two options both of which required an hour more of airtime and a 4.5 hour layover in Phoenix.   I went from an A 21 boarding pass to C22 for both legs of the flight.   The ground agent claimed the flight was cancelled the night before due to weather in Las Vegas .   I wasn't notified because legally they can contact me via text after a certain hour ( sounds far fetched ).  Had I been notified when they cancelled the flight the night before I could have cancelled by reservation had I and flown with Alaska Air ( superior airline by far) .  Instead I got to spend 8 hours traveling from PDX to RNO ( a 1.5 hour direct flight) .I spoke to another agent at the gate about the cancellation and she claimed it was mechanical reason ( SW favorite go to excuse for delays) .    So which is it?  My guess... Southwest's objective is always to reroute customers to meet their needs and bottomline and then pass the expense and inconvenience on to their customers rather than doing their best to honor flights and ease the inconvenience of their paying customers.  Just to top off my experience.. one agent qualified her excuses  to me with the statement that ""after all SW is low cost carrier"" as if that is a good reason to totally inconvenience passengers.   News flash to SW.. You are no longer less expensive than other short route carriers and you have lost my loyalty.    SW is coasting on a reputation from when they had inexpensive flights, more direct flights and an energetic, competent staff.   They no longer shine in any category and people will eventually catch on.Here is to 2020 free from any SW flights and headaches ."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always the nicest,The crew was exceptional. Passed out snacks several times and always made sure we were comfortable. 2 Thumbs up to all at Southwest!
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Cancelled Flights,"This was the second cancellation of a Southwest flight in as many weeks. No explanation of why the cancellation, but makes it very difficult to plan a trip when the first aspect of it gets cancelled. Not a happy passenger."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,A bit late,"The plane was clean and the service fine, but we arrived about a half hour late which caused additional delay as we missed our original Tri-Rail train connection and had to wait at the Tri-Rail station an additional hour."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Early Check in,"The plane was a bit delayed, but clean and the flight staff and service was fine.  We bought Early Bird Check-In for both of us, but noticed some pairs of passengers only paid for one Early Bird Check-In then abused it to save seats for their partner."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Drunk passenger,"Person next to me already drunk, then ordered straight vodka and getting louder and louder taking passenger on other side of planes baby and playing with her getting her all worked up. Thought you weren’t supposed to block aisle on international? Second vodka got spilled in my lap by her, she tells stewardess I paid a lot of money for that and they give her another one! Everyone in rows all around were bothered. I get you can’t stop some things, but don’t keep contributing to it. They had one happy drunk and about 15 others in misery. Something should of been said instead of just avoiding that section by stewards, we were fairly close to front of plane"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,First International Flight on Southwest,"This flight was fine.  The plane was clean, the gate attendants and flight attendants were professional and attentive.  While we checked in within 23-24 hours of the flight, we got high B boarding positions and upgraded our position to low A boarding at the gate for $40 each.  It seems many folks were paying for the early check in option which is less expensive."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,A pleasant holiday flight,Even during the busy holiday crush we boarded on time departed a little late but arrived a little early
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On time departures and arrivals,Departed and arrived on time with minimal distractions.  Even Midway was less congested.  An overall good flight.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,long but comfortable flight,"good flight. comfortable. Not much leg room, but still acceptable. friendly stewardess. entertainment was weak. not much to eat on board and very expensive, but all in all, a decent flight"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Mrs,"Direct flight from San Diego to Baltimore got cancelled. They said it was due to weather but the weather in Maryland was great. Further, other direct flights to Baltimore from San Diego that day was never cancelled. They used “weather” as an excuse so they wouldn’t have to give you vouchers or any credit. They booked me on a flight with two stops and ended up getting to Baltimore at 1:30am, 5 hours later than supposed to so I missed a New Years event. Although I was bummed about missing the New Years event I was more upset that my son and I couldn’t sit together because our tickets were last to board due to them booming us last minute. Since my son is 9, the lady at the counter said she couldn’t accommodate because it wouldn’t be fair to others who’s flight was cancelled to let me board before C, and if I wanted to board early to get a seat next to my son then it’s $50 per person. This was the second horrible customer service experience within a year and I will not be flying with southwest again."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Las Vegas,Great airline and excellent customer service.  We had booked our reservation in June for a trip in December however the Boeing plan was grounded so Southwest Airlies notified us and then booked us on a direct flight both ways.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,excellent flight no problems at all,"fly southwest you won t be disatified, when i fly i always fly southwest no baggage fee for the first 2 bags and plus they give you a snack while you planes. if you needs earbud they have them too."
Date of travel: February 2019,50,taff has ALWATS,"This review shall serve as a general review of SW Airlines, not just any particular flight.  I have flown MANY flights on SW.  I have always enjoyed my experience on this airline.  I cannot say this about OTHER airlines.  Staff has ALWAYS been courteous & professional.  Flights have always left on time with a few even arriving early!  I would highly recommend SW Airlines to friends & family!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good Flight!,"I gave 4 stars just because I  don't like the idea to have unassigned sits. When I know I got two assigned sits on my plane I feel much secure and comfortable. The flight was very good, good service, and very nice people. Great price, short travel time, good service: that is all we need therefore I you traveling to specifically Montego Bay to have a great vacation - this should be your choice!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best Birthday Getaway,"Our flight from and to LAX To New Orleans was pleasant! We had no delays, and our flight attendants were a pleasure."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight experience,I took a flight from Boston to Baltimore. Everything went well. Nothing to complain about. I really liked that Southwest gives 2 free checked luggages.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Nashville,Southwest was great to return from Nashville.  Great price.  Attempt to fly this airline when we travel.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,No More Southwest,"I've been flying Southwest Airlines for years. It's inexpensive, their booking process is fairly simple and flight changes and cancellations are a breeze. I fly 30-40 times a year and Southwest Airlines is always my go to. This past year, however, has been a rough one. I don't remember the last time this year I took an on-time Southwest flight, to the point where it's an ongoing joke that I tell whoever is picking me up not to schedule a time to pick me up until I'm physically on the plane. It's all fun and games when I'm flying home to see family or friends, but I fly monthly for my job. My entire company books flights exclusively on Southwest, and it's no longer funny when our team members are constantly delayed getting where they need to go. I understand that you need to be flexible when traveling, but what's the point of spending money on an airline that is so frequently unreliable? Not to mention counter staff and flight attendants who, because they missed their true callings as comedians, feel they can cover up poor service with humor and bad jokes. It isn't funny. I've always been a Delta hater but they've had my back this year when I knew I was on a tight schedule because I know they can be on time. Moving into 2020 our team (and myself) are looking forward to making an airline switch. I never thought I'd throw Southwest in the same group as Spirit and Allegiant, but I really don't see a difference anymore. Just another budget airline."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Assistance in wheel chair,"I want to compliment the staff.  I added “need wheelchair” to my reservation - for the first time.  I broke my foot.  At the curbside check in, they KNEW I needed one.  Everything went smoothly after being passed from one employee to another right up to my gate.  This made my trip possible."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Almost a Perfect Flight,"We took the non-stop to LV as it is the only way to go.  The flight was on time, the flight crew was great and since my wife has a mobility problem we were able to pre-board so we sat in the first row.The only problem was not caused by SW.  My wife chose the center ""B"" seat with a middle aged man sitting at the window in the ""A"" seat.  Several times during the flight he stretched (groped) her and then we swapped seats and with me in the center seat he was able to keep his hands to himself.  I told her that she should have told the flight attendant but she didn't want to make a scene.  On the return flight we were fortunate to have a nice lady share the row with us, so no problems there."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Worse experience of my life in an airport,Let me start by saying this started off on the wrong foot as soon as we approached the gates. My wife who suffers from social anxiety disorder and does terrible in crowds mustered up the courage to go to the desk at the terminal and tell them she had a condition and normally preboards to avoid the big crowds was asked exactly what her disability was. (Are you kidding me. That’s so illegal) then the lady informed her that’s no reason to preboard and she needs to figure it out. I was blown away by that as i was getting coffee when my wife asked. (She wanted me to be proud of her for getting the courage and asking herself for i normally do) the staff denied it of course and my wife not wanting to make a scene proceeded to tell me not to worry about it. So there we are and I’m tending to my 3 children and my wife paralyzed by fear as we walk up and hand the agent all of our boarding passes. He literally paused and looked at me and asked if i could hear. I said what? He said i just stated that all passengers must be holding their own boarding pass which i reply. I’m sorry i didn’t hear. It’s not a big deal i can give them to my children. Which he must have thought i was being confrontational as he stared at me silently as if he wanted to engage in physical combat. It was an awkward minute that passed as he took his time holding up the line to make his point and he made sure the passengers behind us knew it was our fault the line was held up. While this is going on my poor wife’s situation is worsening. We boarded our plane and will not be recommending southwest to anyone which is a bummer cause I’m normally a southwest snob. I could not believe the way we were treated and no one should ever be treated like that. Especially if they have a disability. My wife was shaking in fear when she sat down and i couldn’t believe any of this went on. Flying is supposed to be a fun memorable experience. If people don’t like customers or customer service maybe they should find a new field of employment.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Hate Southwest Airlines,I will NEVER fly Southwest Airlines again. Worst 🤬 airline. These 🤬 canceled my connecting flight and rescheduled me for the next day with no form of compensation claiming it’s due to weather challenges. The managers are beyond rude and shouted at me repeatedly! I don’t recommend anyone travels with them...
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Long day of Travel Made Better by Great Cabin Crews,"I love flying on Southwest. Aside form the fact that more often than not their fares are less than the competition, one of the things that separates Sothwest from other airlines (in my opinion) are the cabin crews.  They nearly always engage passengers with humor and a more personal feel, rather than the robotic attitudes found on some other major airlines.  A recent trip from Belize City to Detroit, thru Ft Lauderdal entailed about 7 hours in the air and a 12 hour travel day altogether.  The friendly attitude of the flight attendents made what could have been an miserable, long day far more tolerable .I also recommend spending an extra twenty-five bucks and getting early check-in, which allows you to avoid some of the mob scene during the boarding procedure."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Southwest pretends to treat their customers well.... they full of it ;),"Writing from a 3 hour delayed flight... this delay, never apologized for by SW, means I will miss my connection in ATL. SW has made it clear they will not pay for hotel or any accommodations to help me pass the 13 hour gap between when I was meant to fly out and when I will now fly out of Atlanta. “Weather” they say, skirting them of responsibility. They went on to tell me that “weather” meant de-icing a plane in Minnesota 2 flights before my original flight. Apparently de-icing planes in December is considered “weather” when it comes to delays and allows them to avoid responsibility for stranding their customers overnight in connection cities. Apparently ice is not something Southwest accommodates for in winter months. Cool. Just be warned: this airlines loves to pretend they treat their customers well when it actually means herding them cattle onto flights instead of assigning seats like every other civilized airline. They also looooooove to tell you that delays are not their fault. They’ve gotta recoup those baggage costs someway; right? Turns out they can pay for bags by saving all the money they don’t spend on their customers that they leave high + dry. You’d think that paying for a crappy hotel room for their customers would be worth sparing the crappy reviews, but I guess not. Back to Delta I go! I’d rather pay a little more to feel valued and taken care of by my air provider, every time. Save yourself. Bargain airlines mean bargain service. Every time. Your cheesy flight attendants and their dad jokes can’t distract from terrible customer service. Choose better than the laymen’s airline with laymen service  😘"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always Top Performer,"Whatever the destination, whatever the departure airport the folks at SWA know how to do a professional job to get you to your destination.  They aren’t perfect but perfect gets advice here.  Whether it is the pilot helping check bags to expedite departure or the flight attendant holding a baby so Mom can relax a bit they seem to care about customers and go that little extra.  Yes, I know their boarding system sucks but hey two free checked bags!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Pleasant experience,Many flights over several years with a recent flight being my first experience with Southwest and completely satisfied.
Date of travel: February 2019,50,Great experience on all fronts.,"Southwest delivered on customer service, from check-in to the gate, on the flight, and then arriving. Then did it again on the flight home. The employees care, and do what is right rather than follow scripts and have interest in delivering a great travel experience. Happy to fly with them anytime."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,GREAT PRICES - LOVE THE FREE BAGS,"Yes, they have great prices.  LOVE that you get 2 free checked bags & free carry on.  People are friendly.But would someone please explain to me why oh why they go through the circus of a que line & not just giving people seat tickets.  How hard is it to just give tickets that include a seat # ?  I think it is a way for them to get some money out of you selling the priority boarding.  In the time they spend getting people to line up, I would think seat assignments would be easier.  We were lucky & got to sit together each flight, but would not have been happy if we could not.  When people fly with children they need to sit together.  This just makes no sense whatsoever to me.  If Southwest is listening to this ~ please, please, please change this.  We only use your airline when it is a direct flight & a super deal.  Otherwise we will pay a little more to go on another airline where we can choose our seats & have the guarantee to sit together."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Island hopping,"Took Southwest island hopping, great price on the flights, very quick flights. Our flight attendants were very nice and they did a great job with the short time they had us on board. The service was a bit odd they did water and an awful juice. I would not touch the juice it is so sickening sweet nothing but colored sugar water. I would bring my own drinks and snacks as it a sort flight. Other than that it was great flights to and from the big island"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Hawaii the Southwest way,"Had a great time flying from Oakland to Honolulu on southwest. It was a typical southwest flight full, flight attendants were amazing and did a great job with the limited resources they have. The wired snacks are not the norm for southwest and did not make a lot of sense as they are very heavy in the waste side. The fight attendants did a good job trying to mitigate the waste. Southwest does not serve food so everyone brought on tons of trash and it was very apparent there was no though on what to do with all of it. I would recommend you not bring a lot of heavy boxed items, small snacks only.  Other problem was the many many bags that did not fit in the plane, Southwest has to start watching the bags as some people had huge bags that did not fit in the bins or they took the entire bin. Very bad customer experience with the flight attendants being caught in the middle trying to help but not able to keep the passengers from taking entire bins. Other than the small issues Southwest did a good job on this flight getting us into Honolulu early."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight,"The flight attendants were very kind! Going to and from our destination. There was a slight delay on our way back, but the flight attendant gave us a free drink. We never had any issues with our tickets, boarding or the flight in general."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always a good decision,Southwest continues to be reliable and enjoyable. Staff is always courteous and helpful. Planes are always in great shape and always a great value.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Reliable and reasonably priced.,"Excellent connections, reliable and on time. Considered many other airlines and no other came close to Southwest. 4oom overhead for Cary on luggage adequate. I have flow many other airlines to dthis destination but none comparable."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight attendants,The attendant's kept us informed of cause of delays and were very pleasant throughout the flight. Attitude makes a big difference in how the experience of the flight is viewed.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Flight attendants,I have flown quite a lot and this is the first flight where we were reminded to stay in our seats throughout the flight consistently.  The flight was not rough but from what I understood the previous flight was.  Seems like they assumed this flight would be similar. Cabin service was given but people needed to use restroom but we're told to stay seated. Unusual for Southwest
n/a,50,Can you beat this Airline?,"I like to save money like most people planning vacation. When Flying I have used the usual travel sites like Priceline,  Travelocity and Expedia to name a few.  But if you really want to save try calling each service direct such.  For airlines, if you call Southwest Airlines you can save big.  But you need to call ahead by 6 months and if your flexible use the low fare calendar.  You get to bring 2 pieces of check in luggage and a carry on included in the ticket price.   They have many direct flights and the seats are adequate.  With a wife and a couple daughters the luggage deal is truly a money saver!  Highly recommend.."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Southwest Airlines Declining Service Quality,"Whats happening to Southwest?!Both ways had terrible experiences: rude, military-like gate staff barking orders at BWI; delay due to checking bags once we had already boarded at MNH;lost luggage requiring home delivery middle of night.Felt like a nightmare United,Delta, or Spirit trip vs the old charming and efficient Southwest! I'll be shopping around!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight back home,"Considering it was late in the evening on the 23rd of December, I was impressed. The flight was only delayed by a few minutes and everything went as planned. I fly often and like the way Southwest airlines operates especially that there is no added fees."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good flight,It was different but paid the extra to get in the first to board but was a great experience. The flight crew were fantastic.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Oakland Southwest ticket agents are incredible!,"Southwest's Oakland desk agents are fantastic, and provided the best experience I've had with am airline. I brought my cat in a carry on that was too big. The agent checking,me in tried her best to let me by, but it clearly wouldn't fit. So she quickly snuck in the back and gave me a free southwest pet carrier.She could have easily followed strict protocol and ruined my and others holiday, but did her best to make sure we'd make our flight. That level of service has made southwest my number 1 airline."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,"Nothing special, just an average busride, err, flight!","I think we just missed the mass exodus, but arrival, check-in and the flight went pretty smoothly, for flying the weekend between Christmas and New Year.  We were on a Boeing 737-700 (twin-jet) (B737).  There was very little turbulence.  The aircrew was efficient and mostly friendly.  We left four minutes early and arrived 18 minutes early."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Regional airline, not even trying to become better, times and service areas are key","Almost all the planes make a stop, some times you have to change planes, some of the airports help Southwest others treat them badly.Flyers overload the plane with carry-on despite the baggage policy, they also fail to listen to the gate personnel about line-up and baggage."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Birmingham to Pittsburg round trip,"Trip was good, flights were on time, leg rooms seems to be shrinking every time I fly. Not that crazy about the cattle call method of seating on Southwest, adds to the tension already of getting in an airport, TSA, etc. Have to worry if you can get seats together or pay more for early boarding time. All in all, not bad, but still stressful and could be better."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight from hell,Service on drinks was slower than normal. Air conditioning on flight 416 was horrible. Everyone around us complained but to no improvement. Sick kids everywhere on this flight..still fighting something we caught on this flight. I get it. All people get sick..but maybe there should be some rules for people flying with a temperature. Idk smh2019 and flights have not changed in 20 years
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Middle seats available all over the Plane!,"The actual flying was smooth with landing.  The flight attendants were respectful and light hearted.  I didn’t mind flying since you do not have to pay 75 per bag like other airlines.  I will fly again.  The only thing I dislike is the seating.  We were last to load and we had to take random seats (Mostly middle )all over the plane.   Next time , I will have to pay the extra 65 a person to sit by each other.  So technically the airline will get you some where rather it is luggage or seats!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Works for us,Well worth the price. The no bag fee is what all airlines need to do. Use Southwest sometimes rather than use my miles
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Free standby for A list members a +,"This was the 2nd part of a year end mileage run to achieve A List preferred. Did not care where, just there, back & little $! Outbound modest cost, but return was 8 hours later or $200 plus per person extra! Thankfully, both A list, cleared us (no extra cost) & only spent 90 minutes in the airport. Flight full but all crew, from gate agents on, courteous & professional! Even permitted to preboard per ADA. Back home for lunch...."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Southwest Airlines Service,"Used SWA to fly to Ft. Lauderdale Dec 3-8th for a vacation. Service was ok not the usual service for SWA but holiday season busy I get that. The the return flight home from Ft. Lauderdale on Sunday Dec 8,2019 was a nightmare. There were lines and lines of people to check in. The employees of SWA were seen standing around like they had nothing to do. The 2 guys were leaning on the counter as if hanging out. They would close several positions and stand and talk then walk off. Then my time to check in and the girl could have cared less on service. Didn't touch bag and someone else walked by to take off scale. Didn't appreciate the way I was treated by no means. Good luck"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Literally a waste of time,Booked in September as a direct fflightt...  south west then elect to make it a connecting flight via Reno.  Basically takes 4 hours to get from Las Vegas to Oakland.The outbound flight was not much better S it was delayed by 2 hours.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Baggage Service at BWI is an Abomination,Nearly a riot at BWI recently as Southwest's Baggage Office refused to interact with clients waiting an hour for their baggage to appear. The agent summoned airport security to protect her from questions.SWA desperately needs management on site in the late evenings at BWI to help disenfranchised clients.
Date of travel: February 2019,10,Crazy boarding process led to lousy flight experience,"I fly frequently and somehow had never flown Southwest until recently.  My first flight on Southwest will also be my last.  I knew there were no assigned seats on the plane, but it was completely stressful boarding with my wife and young daughter.  Most of the aisle seats and most of the window seats were taken, which left most of the middle seats available.  When I sat in a middle seat, I realized I was sitting between a husband (on the aisle) and a wife (on the window), who seemed irritated that I was sitting between them.  It was ridiculous.  On the flight home, I asked the boarding agent what I could do to make sure my daughter was not sitting with strangers, and she seemed completely unconcerned.  I know a lot of people like this airline and setup, but I'm not one of them.  Scrambling to find seats upon boarding a plane ruined the flying experience for me.  I'll never fly Southwest again."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,The Entire Crew Kept Passengers Informed,"As we were anxious to have this flight over on time, it wasn't to be.  Our pilot first informed us that we were asked to circle and not begin our approach as there was severe weather in Orlando.  This continued for so long that we needed to land in Tampa to refuel.  The pilot again advised the passengers of this plan.  He also updated us every so often just to keep us in the loop.  It was a very long day, as we had started in Reno that morning.  Our pilot and crew had to be as tired as the passengers. We finally landed after 11 PM instead of our scheduled 9 PM.  Frankly, I am glad we actually made it to our destination!!  Thanks to our Southwest crew for handling this professionally!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Smooth flight with plenty of room,We recently returned from Montego Bay and had such a great flight!  It wasn't overbooked so no one had to take middle seats.  The attendants were kind and funny (as Southwest attendants usually are) and our flight got in earlier than expected.  Luggage was handled with care.  Reasonable ticket prices and we paid for the early bird check in to save the stress of wondering which gtoul we'd be in.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Saving Seats,"Southwest has got to deploy a policy about saving seats and boarding process. A group should NOT be allowed to have one person pay for Business Select and that person save one seat or rows of seats!Someone escorting someone that boards ahead of others (claimed handicapped) should NOT be allowed to save seats that others have paid more for.  A touchy situation but a person in a wheelchair, who boarded the flight first, should not b expected to walk past me on the way to baggage claim. On a positive note and confirmation that humanity has a chance n this torn world. Departing SAT last Monday had the pleasure of witnessing wheel chair agent smile and agree to get elderly customer a cup of coffee! What a nice thing to do."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Only one complaint...,"I love Southwest. I fly them all the time. I love the ease, the free bags, snacks and drinks. My only complaint on flights back from Mexico is their boarding process. I've done it from Cabo, Cancun and Puerto Vallarta and its always a mess. Last trip, my girlfriend paid for upgraded seat assignment ~ A5 to be exact and they let about 30 people pre-board ahead of her. Pre-boarding is supposed to be for people who need additional assistant. Most of these 30 people did not as they all walked on to the plane with their bags. I didn't see one wheelchair.. When my girlfriend went to the agent and asked to pay for upgraded seating, the agent responded, ""Do you just want Pre-boarding instead?""..."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Southwest will not take off if every seat is not filled.,"We booked a round trip flight from BWI to LAS and back over the nolidays.  The trip had been booked two months in advance.  The morning of departure from Las Vegas we received a text from Southwest that our flight had been canceled and we were rebooked on another flight with a layover in Chicago.  Our original flight was non stop.  While the flight itself was uneventful and the flight crew great, the layover in Chicago was attrocious.  It was a three hour wait in chicago on B concourse where Chicago Midway has little or no food services worth patronizing.  I purchased a Bagel for my wife and found it to be stale and unedible.  While none of the airlines are as good as they once were.  It is a shame that that all an airline looks at is the profit margin and not the service that are in business to perform."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Efficient, on time flights","The check in was really easy.  First time doing it on this airline, but they had staff at the kiosks who were extremely helpful.  Was a little wary about the no seating assignments, but we had only the 2 of us in a row coming and going. I did check in online and got an A or B each time. Flight staff very friendly.  No problems with luggage.  Did like that you could check bags free. Flight left on time, and arrived a little early.  Good experience."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Crew,"Southwest always does a fabulous job.  Easy boarding, always on time.  Friendly and service oriented crew."
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Best option...?,"This is the best option from Atlanta if you don’t carry baggage just small carry on, also looking for 4 weeks before your trip, is nonstop flight so excellent for weekends in Cancun, cheaper option like Spirits stop in Fortlauderdale...."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Just long enough,It was a nice easy flight. An hour and a half. Not a full flight. Easy on and easy off. Nice staff and good.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Delayed flights AGAIN,"I will NEVER fly with Southwest Airlines again. Our trip was flat out cancelled when all of the 737 debacle happened. Not their fault. They kindly gave us an $800 flight credit to use in the next year. We saved it so that we could go and see family over the holidays. I booked it 6 weeks ago so I could get the times I wanted. Got 2 text messages this morning delaying the flight to Dallas so that we missed our connection to Amarillo. Had to re-book and now we lost a day of time with my family. We had to get a hotel room in Amarillo because we are getting in so late and had to delay our car rental. The customer service lady was extremely rude and really couldn't care less. Oh and to add to it - I refreshed the flight information on the southwest website. The flight time was changed back to a good time where we could have made the connection, but by the time I called they had already sold all of the seats. I guess we should have risked it and just gone to the airport hoping that something would work out. Southwest offered nothing, not even an apology for the missed time and extra money we had to spend."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flawless,"Nice flight, no turbulence, on time. We were lucky to seat in the 1 st row without even getting early bird"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Christmas time vacation,My flight to Baltimore was great ..I do have the Southwest App on my IPad so I watched free moving going and coming back ...I am deaf and all Southwest people are very nice ..helpful and accommodating....Southwest has no charge for luggage ...I fly Southwest when I fly in the US ....
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest Airlines is our favorite,"Consistently uncomplicated and friendly, this is our go to airline when traveling in the states. No weird hoops to jump through. Also, no fuss when I travel with my dog."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Amazing,"So for a 26 minute flight you get two checked bags, a drink and a snack and supposedly you need to fight for a seat. Given there was 50 spare seats on the flight that wasn’t an issue. All for $30. Service was great, flight took off and landed early. Took us longer to get the bags back than the flight lasted!!First time on Southwest, so so impressed. A quarter of the price of Hawaiian and infinitely better than the disgrace that is Ryanair that we have to put up with in the UK.If ever the opportunity arises again I won’t hesitate to fly with them."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Swift and Comfortable flights.,Hands off the the pilots and crew... both of my flights were swift “nonstop” # 1609 n 1616 and the crew were friendly.  Remember on SW there is no bag fees! ❤️
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Phenomenal flight,"I absolutely love this airline! The concept of picking your own seat, allowing 2 items, comfortable seats with acceptable legroom and complimentary snacks is phenomenal! You feel appreciated and valued as the consumer and not pressured when packing or purchasing your ticket. This company is customer centered and it shows. The staff were fantastic from boarding to inflight to deplaning. Lastly, the pilots were phenomenal!! Our landing was awesome and we glided to a stop (whomever landed our plane was had outstanding and gifted skillset). We arrived earlier than scheduled and the deplaning process went pretty well! My only disappointment was that I was not aware that I had to download the app on my iPad instead of just going to the site to watch inflight movies. I have the app on my phone, but didn’t want to drain my battery so I couldn’t watch the two movies I planned to watch during my 4 hour flight. Regardless, this was a great flight and my drink coupons were used graciously! :)"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Bags fly free!!,All flights were on time and not full until the return flight.  They had the best coffee I had tasted served on an airline.  The flight attendants were pleasant and some were funny.  They made the travel fun and carefree.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,holiday delays,Internet went down at Sacramento airort so everyone had to be rebooked.The ticket agents had to hand write tickets and baggage tags.We had to wait in line for four hours or more to get rebooked and missed at leased three flights.We were rerouted thru phoenix to get to San Diego.I've got to say the agents at the counter did a great job of trying to get people rebooked.We finally got to San Diego nine hours late.Everyoneone was tired from standing all day long and hungery from not eating.I think the flight attendants seemed like they didn't want to be there.One of them said over the intercom that they've bee up for twelve hour and were tired.Well we;ve been standing around on our feet for twelve hours and the ticket agents have been up at lease eight hours doing solid work.Any way the service on that flight wasn't so good.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Service Recovery Lessons Required,"Traveling on Christmas Eve with a 10 month old. Leaving the house at 2am to get to logon at 430am go make our 530 flight. Checked bags. Got to gate and received an email at 448 that our 530 flight had been cancelled. Went to ticket agent and was told all flights are booked and next available flight is 5pm. The cancellation was due to weather flight was departing at 530am..cancelled due to fog in Chicago. A flight at 630am left logon and arrived on time to Chicago. They say it was weather so then why wasn’t the flight delayed or why weren’t the other flights flying into Chicago delayed or cancelled from southwest? Southwest reps said it’s their policy to not be able to accommodate people at hotels when a flight is cancelled because of something out of their control. No accommodations were made for me and my 10month old. We were expected to stay in the airport for 12 hours. I asked for a hotel so that at least my 10 month old could rest and I could pick up some food for him. Again it was told to me their policy is that they can’t do anything for these circumstances. Southwest, yes you can you just don’t want to. No one helped me to find another solution. No hospitality was provided no one went above and beyond for a very stressful mother. The expectation was for my 10month old to stay in the airport for 12 hours, very hospitable! I found a flight leaving from tf green about an hour and 15 mins away from Boston. The flight was due to depart at 12:30pm. I decided this would be better than waiting in the airport for 12 hours. The ticketing agent put me on that flight and we were on our way. After incurring extra mileage and gas and a very tried and hungry 10 month old we arrived to tf green. We now will have to pay 60 dollars for parking when we were already accommodated for parking in Boston. Our return flight is to Boston and our car is in providence. We will have to take the train or bus to providence and lug our 2 checked bags and our infant with us. After speaking with numerous people at Southwest customer service they provided us with $200 in love vouchers. They did not accommodate our bags to tf green and they will not pay for transportation to tf green. I asked why they weren’t able to do these things and why they weren’t able to get me on a flight to tf green and they said they can’t do that. I responded yes you can you just don’t want to. He (Rod) couldn’t say anything and finally said well our policy..and continued to tell me about policy. The right thing to do is to properly provide service recovery for a customer who has had a great deal of inconveniences. He said they will fall short of my expectations because they will not give me what I expect. As a hospitality professional for over 12 years you never tell a customer that your services and company will not meet the customers expectations. You may fall short but that’s when you go above and beyond to make it right."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy flight from Houston to Los Cabos!!,"Need a flight to Los Cabos? Houston Hobby is an awesome airport for international flights. When coming back to the states, the custom process is easy and lines are never long!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Multiple Times SW has Screwed Me,"Multiple times SouthWest Airlines has screwed me. The first time (a few years ago), I arrived at the airport to check in and they claimed I had no reservations for a flight. It took well over an hour off arguing before they realized they were wrong and I did have a reservation. They booked me on a new flight much later because by time they realized their mistake, it was too late to make my original flight. What did they give me? A measly $100 voucher for missing 6-8 hours of my time with my old military buddies I had been looking forward to for a long time. Stupid.Another time, more recently, they cancelled my flight a day before for ""weather"" and said they could not book me for 3 days. Really? You expect me to miss 3 days of work because you want to cancel a flight due to ""weather"". Mind you, no other airlines cancelled out of the airport. I paid $800 out of pocket for new tickets. Southwest refunded me the ticket cost I spent with them, but, what about the massively expensive tickets I had to buy to get back and go to work? Three days is completely unreasonable, especially when I can book a flight the at the same departure time though another airline.DO NOT FLY SOUTHWEST. I've flown with most of the airlines in the US and a few overseas. I have never had these issues with other airlines."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On Time Every Time,The flight attendants took very good care of us. The flight departed on time and arrived a little early. I always fly Southwest Airlines because I always have great experiences with them.
n/a,20,First interisland flight,I tried southwest for this interisland flight.  The terminal is in the international terminals so it's the furthest gate (beyond the jetway).  All mainland rules apply because we are not in the interisland terminal that only hawaiian operates out of.  This makes tsa rules different from interisland rules (no fruit for example whereas terminal 1 is no problem).Not sure the distance/inconvenience worth the difference in fare.
n/a,30,New Seats vs Old Seats,"We used to fly Southwest frequently, but find the newer type of seats to be too uncomfortable.  We did just complete a trip to Ft. Meyers on Southwest.  On the way there, flew in a 737-800 with the newer, blue seats.  Horribly uncomfortable.  On way back, flew in a 737-700 with the traditional seats in Southwest colors.  Much better, even though seats were noticeably more worn.  It's a shame Southwest made this transition."
n/a,50,Great Airline!!!,"We have flown with Southwest for years. Flights are on time, the staff are friendly and helpful. This last trip, we somehow ended up at the wrong gate( Our fault). They called our names over the intercom. We went as fast as we could, with canes, to get to the gate. We didnt mis our flight and the flight arrived on time. So thankful they go the extra mile to help folks when they make a mistake. Our favorite Airline, we will be using them for every time we fly. Where they go, we will fly with them."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,They’re on your team,"I ubered over an hour to make this flight after missing my bus, arriving just 30 minutes before takeoff. Check-in staff worked with me at top speed to give my bags the best chance at making the flight and directed me where I needed to go. The flight had a 10 min delay, so I was not late anyway, yet desk staff at the gate were again helpful in answering my questions! On-flight staff and experience were smooth as always with Southwest. I’m a consistent flyer for the low fares and great experiences. It’s a shame they are cancelling direct flights between Milwaukee and Boston!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great employees!,It’s always a pleasure to fly with Southwest!  The flight attendants are very courteous and professional.  The pilot kept us updated as to our location and how the weather was going to be when we landed.  Great flight!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Seamless flight,"Phenomenal experience! The checkin process was easy and seamless. The boarding process went pretty fast. The seats and legroom were comfortable! The staff were really friendly and nice. The onboard entertainment and drinks were great! We arrived on time and the takeoff and landing were smooth! Overall, great experience!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always my first choice ,"Southwest is different in all the right ways. The weekend I got engaged my friend mentioned it upon checking in, that message got relayed so they congratulated me on intercom then a hour into the flight they made a announcement congratulating us and gave us back our hard copy tickets with marriage advice from people on the plane.Their flight attendants and staff are friendly compared to many other airlines I’ve been on. They put you at ease before your flight if you are scared of flying.They have amazing customer service and have a great cancelation policy. They also have two free bags. I always check southwest fares/routes before any other airline. I booked my mother in law on a flight and due to storms they got delayed 4 hours ( not southwests fault ) but they gave her a 75 credit to use in future. Southwest goes the effort mile and I promote them whenever I can. Living in the northwest suburbs of Chicago I have to drive to milwaukee or Midwest but I’ll make that trip every time if I can fly southwest. ( I’ve flown 50 flights and have never had a bag lost )"

Date of travel: December 2019,10,Southwest Ruined Our Christmas Vacation,"As a business owner, I only can only take holidays off to travel and it's something that we look forward to for months, pretty much as most people. This year, we decided to visit Ft. Lauderdale, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and Miami for New Years. Well...so much for our plans as Southwest left our luggage behind in Ft. Lauderdale on Christmas Eve. When we arrived in Montego Bay, there seem to be about 15 or more other travelers in the same position as us. We filled out a report and were told the luggage should arrive mid next day. No such luck. In fact, we're 3 days into this without our luggage. Yesterday we were told one of our bags was found and would be delivered in 2-4 hours. Nope. Nothing. Nada. Today we called several times and it seems as if no one can get a hold of the carrier. The status has shown bags out for delivery for over 24 hours with no updates or luggage. To make matters worse, we leave for Punta Cana tomorrow and could miss delivery of our baggage if it somehow arrives. Even worse, I was told it may even be sent home (if it's actually found) which doesn't help us for the other locations.Also, I'm not sure if Southwest understands the gravity of the situation. Not only did we have to cancel our Christmas reservations and walk around in the same clothes for a couple of days, but this type of stuff causes relationship challenges....to say the least. Do you know how long it takes a woman to find a ""perfect"" new years dress? My partner is over it and she is ready to head home. I'm still in a much needed break from a stressful year. There is also another element of stress of wondering if we're going to see over $5k of items ever reappear. We spent thousands of dollars on this trip and it's about a total loss. My appetite for Southwest has been on the decline and after this experience...I think I'm done."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,We Always Fly on The Southwest Heart,"This is the only airline that truly gets customer service in the air. Flight attendants, pilots and the rest of the team members who took care of us genuinely love their jobs. A flight is not just about taking people from point A to point B but more about creating an experience or perhaps creating a gateway to an experience. When flying to that experience a friendly smile or a helpful hand is all one needs to start a trip on the right path and Southwest knows how to do it well. Finally as someone with disabilities I strongly believe that Southwest is the best U.S airline to fly passengers with disabilities with clear and efficient procedures, including their pre-board process, they are the only airline that understand that boarding guests with disabilities can take just a bit longer and they never rush us. Always grateful to have SW on my side. Oh I must not forget to mention that there is free entertainment on board that you can use with your own device. Wifi is available for a fee. If this is your first time flying with them keep in mind that there are no assign seats but instead a position in-line when you check-in, the earlier you check-in the better seats you will get. I wish everyone a safe and enjoyable flight with SW."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Again and again my favorite.,I love all the perks this airline have and the way they are so accommodating at the same time keeping a good price.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,BNA to LGA on holiDAY,"Look, flying airlines during the holidays is always stressful. I've stopped taking the 6:15 AM flight out of town because the airport is more of zoo at that hour than ever. That's before you even get into the terminal. My high praise for ANY staff who has to work the Christmas Holidays and deal with the hair-trigger stress & anxiety of any passengers who forget they're not-the-only-one. Southwest baggage, check-in and gate people are always great, but I'm writing this to give a 5-star shout out to the funny, sassy female flight attendant on this flight, the one doing the majority of announcements while wearing a red sequined Santa hat. I've heard tons of humor on flights domestic & international, but Mam, you are by far the Top-Dog Best Ever. Far far cheekier than Delta's International departure video. I'd pay to hear your stand-up routine should you ever take that route. Thanks again, I love you!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,It was great!!,"Over view Southwest Airlines Co. is a major American airline headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and is the world's largest low-cost carrier!! As of 2018, Southwest carries the most domestic passengers of any United States airline.The airline has scheduled services to 101 destinations in the United States and ten additional countries. Its most recent expansion occurred in March, April, and May 2019 with service to Honolulu, Maui, and Kailua-Kona respectively. Southwest began to expand service to Lihue in mid-November 2019,[ and will expand to Hilo in January 2020My first time flight on this Southwest Airlines! from NYC to Atlanta GA. I love it and it was quite reasonable  than any other company. I was actually amazed that they don't charge the fee for language. These days mostly they will charge $35.00 per luggage.. The flight attendants was so funny with a great sense of humor I think this is quite an innovated airline company.Just be aware that Southwest Airlines has an open seating policy. Seats are not assigned ahead of time, rather passengers are assigned a boarding group, A, B, or C, and a boarding position, 1-60. The boarding group and position determine when you board the plane, and thus how many seats you will be able to choose from/."

Date of travel: September 2019,10,I used to be a loyal SouthWest Customer but no more,"I booked a flight from Newark to Denver in August and needed to cancel this trip for personal reasons.  I always loved the flexibility of flying Southwest and how simple it was to change your plans if needed.  However SouthWest subsequently pulled all operations out of Newark and when I reached out for some sort of solution to either get a refund of my credits or even an extension on the usage I was met with no help at all.  The customer service person told me that they are still operating out of LaGuardia and that they would not do anything to help me.  LaGuardia is an additional hour away (at minimum) and will cost me an extra $160 to get to and home from.  I always picked Southwest over other airlines when I had the option but no more, Southwest has lost a loyal customer and I will also share this story with othe"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Going northwest on Southwest,Southwest offers early boarding for anyone that needs it just ask at the counter. As an elderly traveler with prosthetic knees  I found this quite refreshing.  The flight was smooth and uneventful and the cabin crew was very friendly.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,LAX is a little strange at midnight...,"Overall, good flight, other than the flight was extremely cold.  Also took about an hour to get our bags.  Got told by the Southwest Baggie Claim Rep, they have no idea what carousel the bags would show-up on.  They delivered half the bags for the flight, then it was another 20 plus minutes for the rest of the bags to show-up."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best airline in US,Southwest never disappoints in service especially with 2 free bags and ample legroom.Planes are nice and not too old.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,It was four days before Christmas...,"...and all through the airport, people were nasty and not being good sports.  Then suddenly Southwest staff did appear, and rendered the passengers into great cheer.  The flight was only two hours and the plane it did clatter, but with flight beverages in hand, it failed to matter. We laughed and we ate our snacks filled with cheese, and realized this flying thing was a breeze. At the end of our journey we sprang from the plane, eager to fly Southwest again~"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Inexpensive and quick way to travel,"Our flights were on time, comfortable, and very nice. The stewards were very friendly and professional. We did the round trip from RDU to FLL and return for a cruise out of Miami."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Decent Experience,"We had a very decent flight experience. We choose SW because we usually have a good experience. As you all know flying nowadays can be troublesome to say the least. We didn’t have too much trouble. Of course there are the usual suspects who don’t fly often and are confused by SW’s boarding and those passengers who believe they can take everything they own and carry on. This is the reason for the 4 stars since I wish the airlines would enforce their rules more. This adds to the boarding times. One other thing, One of the legs of our return flights was cancelled and we were not notified by SW until we turned in our rental car. Luckily we had the means to stay at our destination another day and SW did not charge for changing our flights. They could have easily sent us to our change plane location and we would have been stuck there a day without our luggage."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Love, Love, Love this Airline !","Three of us traveled from Nashville to Newark.They allow two checked bags per person at no extra charge.Even though it was a short flight (2 hrs) it was comfortable.There are no seat assignments so when you check in you are automatically assigned a boarding group.  When you board, you choose your seat.  Interestingly enough, some do not know the sequence of numbers and have a hard time lining up in numerical order.  But that's not the airline's fault.Hopefully, Southwest will continue to expand its flight destinations because we LOVE to fly with them."

Going back from Manchester, the staff was rude, not only made me remove the velcro sandals but yelled at me for taking so long and also yelled at me for not being able to lift my carry on.  I have herniated disc damage.  The man behind me had to help me.  Isn't the staff supposed to do that for a disabled person?  No respect for disability and if they do it again i will report them to the ADA.k"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great value and excellent service,"I admit, I am a fan of SWA. I often fly them to various domestic locations.Southwest often has some of the lowest fares, stellar service, numerous flight options, and a top safety record.The flight from Chicago (Midway) to Sacramento was no different. The flight was a little late departing (weather) but the pilots made up the time during the flight and we arrived virtually on time.The flight attendants are well-trained and eager to help the passengers.Of course, meals are simple: cookies and nuts along with soda or coffee. If one can accept those options, Southwest Airlines is an excellent choice."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Non-stop,This Airline has been so user-friendly since it's beginning and now it's added non-stop to Nashville I'm pleased that it's making it even friendlier.

She wore some really festive stockings. Midway our flight , a passenger became ill.(Thought we would have to land at nearest airport). No, that didn't happen. All flight attendants were on deck. Overhead request was made for a doctor. There was one on the plane. They did a superb job at stabilizing the woman who just happened to be seated next to me. Needless to say, no cocktails were being served. I sure wanted one!  KUDOS to the crew. This is just one of the reasons I fly Southwest Airlines!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Anon,"Terrible service in baltimore on christmas eve. The woman who checked our tickets before boarding gave us and the people around us the worst service. She made us go out of line when we checked in early because we had “too many bags” and it doesn’t say that anywhere online (we’re frequent flyers, we know what is and isnt allowed). She made us lose our place in line and told us we couldnt bring the cookies we just bought for christmas on the flight and we couldnt fit it in our bag (because we JUST bought them) and she made me stuff it in my bag, which instead crumbled all of the desserts, just for us to take it out on the flight. Horrible service overall and i will never fly southwest again even though i always had. Unbelievable, rude, just bad overall."

Date of travel: December 2019,30,A General Rating of SW From a Frequent Flyer,"This is a review of SW overall and not a specific flight.  SW has the best rewards program by far.  I can fly one round trip business flight for around $1,000 and earn enough points for another RT flight.  I do earn double points with my status though.  I also earn a companion pass for my wife each year and she can fly as frequently as she wishes absolutely free.  Bags are free and you can always change or cancel your flight with no additional fees.  This is the positive but its the negative that has me flying with American on longer flights.  On my last flight to BWI, there were 14 wheelchairs and many other pre boarders.  There are certainly people that need to pre-board but there as many people that game the system to board early and sit up front.  A simple solution would be for SW to enact a policy where pre boarders must sit in row 10 or higher.  This would put an end to all the games.  Also the number of people with ""emotional support"" dogs is ridicules.   25 year old females with their Yorkies who don't want to pay the $100 to take their pet.  I can purchase a one way ticket for $500+, receive an A-1 boarding pass and be the 25th person on the plane.  I will fly SW just enough to earn a companion pass and some points and fly American on the other flights.  The SW planes are smaller planes so the emergency exit rows don't really have much extra legroom.  A great airline but improvement needed."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great As Always,"Easy boarding, great service. I'm a wheelchair to gate person. Not enough staff to wheel to gate without a wait. Other than that, a good experience."
Date of travel: May 2019,30,"Southwest rocks for prices & availability, eat before or after your flight.",Southwest is affordable not very comfortable but not horrible like others and they have friendly attendance but limited food just snacks and drinks popcorn peanuts chips stuff like that and drinks. If you fly them frequently you get little perks like free drinks etc. They're not my favorite airline but they get the job done.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great airline!,You can’t beat Southwest Airlines with their 2 bags checked free and carryons. Staff is always friendly and are super cool people. Clean planes. Flying on any plane nowadays is super crowded but they make it relatively comfortable.  I highly recommend.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Baltimore not military friendly,"For some reason out of the 4 southwest flights I took from buffalo to Houston, Baltimore did not offer priority seating for military. Not sure why that one was different."

Date of travel: December 2019,40,Direct Flight makes it easier,"No real issues, load time was long due to many wheelchair (10+). So we left a little late made up some of thr time in the air. Middle seat wasn't that bad. Take a wipe to clean the tray. You will be surprised how much you will collect. Tv and movies available on App worked well."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good job under the circumstances,"Due to a short ground stop for an emergency in LAX, the flight was thirty minutes late departing Tucson. Nonetheless, I made my connection to Hartford, however, my luggage did not! The baggage department was very gracious and my luggage arrived via common carrier the next day. MY only issue with this is that one should be able to sign a waiver to have the luggage signed for. I work so am not available during the day."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Trip home,"Our Southwest flight from New Orleans to midway airport was delayed 30 minutes due to the weather, they kept us posted on the delay, once the plane arrive they quickly got us on board and in the air. The fight staff was very friendly and helpful,The plane was full. Being near the holidays overall I would say this was an excellent experience. I would highly recommend Southwest. Fast,friendly and almost always on time."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Never on time!!,Flight was of course belated coming down from Bwi . Boarding was a complete crap show .. so of course was late arriving in Orlando .. so I was hoping it wouldn’t be the case for the way home from Orlando.  Beautiful day out what could be the issue?!! But of course Southwest is delayed again!!  Every time we fly this airline it is always late !! Sucks!!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight to Orlando,Southwest provides consistently good service  We use Southwest more often than any other airline and we are usually quite satisfied
Date of travel: December 2019,40,First time SW flyer,"Wasn't sure of the seating assignments so we paid extra for early bird boarding.  Worked well.  Only glitch in the whole trip is one of our flights was 1 1/2 hours late.  This didn't cause us problems.  The seats were comfortable and they served soda or water for free and gave out some snacks.  All and all, it was a good experience."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Christmas Trip,Had a great experience flying Southwest from Atlanta to Denver on a very busy travel day.  The gate agent in Atlanta was very funny and kept us entertained wile we waited to board.  The flight attendants were dressed jazzier than the normal Southwest attire.  They were very friendly and efficient.  Flight was in early.  Only drawback was the luggage carousel getting changed at the last minute.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,N/a,"Today our 3 pm flight was cancelled for no apparent reason. Luckily we were able to book a 2 pm flight. We arrived at the airport with an hour to spare to find the southwest computers had been down for 13 hours. We had to wait in a line for 3.5 hours  that wrapped three times around the inside of the airport as every single passenger had to be checked in manually. Then were put on standby for a different connecting flight which we were able to obtain seats. Unfortunately that plane was 90 minutes delayed, causing us to miss our connecting flight by 2 minutes. The connecting flight departed 10 minutes early as we watched it take flight. There are no flights home for us tonight after we just missed the last one. Meanwhile we are offered a $100 travel voucher which won’t even cover a hotel tonight. Now we have been waiting over an hour to speak to a supervisor."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Towards above average flight,"Flying during the holiday season usually can be a big pain, but this time, we were lucky going through check-in, at the gate and boarding the plane.  The staff was efficient and somewhat festive.  The aircrew was very nice, as well.  We were flying a Boeing 737-700 (twin-jet) (B737).  The flight was as comfortable, as I would have expected.  We were late departing, however, apparently because the inbound flight was late.  So, we left about 20 minutes late, but we made up a little bit in the air and only arrived 15 minutes later than scheduled.  The traffic at Midway for arrivals, was horrid, however.  We actually walked upstairs and were picked up on the departure level, where traffic was nearly empty."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,"Pathetic, Unprofessional, and Unprepared for the Holiday Rush","Where do I begin? Let's start with the lady at the ticket counter that was yelling for people to ""get to the next open kiosk"" instead of providing a professional delivery.  She also failed to answer questions about TSA pre-check and just seng me down the line.  The flight was delayed 90 minutes. I get that delays occur. The issue with this delay was that we sat in the plane for 40 of those minutes while the attendants called passengers that they ""missed information"" on when we checked in. How does that happen? How can you ""miss"" someone scanning their ticket in? Then there are the bags. Oh the bags! They overloaded the plane (go figure) so 20 to 25 bags were ""randomly"" selected to be re-routed. No one was told if your bag was or was not selected. Ever. There was just a group of us standing around the baggage claim looking in desperation to see if our bags happened to be a little late. Nope. We were eventually confronted by the utterly rude baggage claim center employees who didn't have details or answers regarding when and where our bags would arrive.  In the end, I opted to meet an independent carrier at their place of business to get my bag. Said bag arrived about 4 hours later than Southwest said it would.I have had many pleasant experiences with Southwest. Even have their credit card and can pickup a free trip every once in a while.  But for this trip, they get a giant F. Very disappointed in Southwest. They lost my trust today."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love this airline - two free checked bags -- consider this when pricing flights,"On a recent trip to San Francisco we departed from TF Green (we usually depart from Hartford) because the price was substantially less expensive. We did have to wait before going through TSA until the airport security was up and running.The flight to Chicago Midway was fine as well as the flight from Chicago to San Francisco.Friendly staff, drinks and snacks served, and no flight issues.There were three of us traveling together and we were able to sit together (which has never been a problem for me when traveling with friends).II will take standing in line to board with my designated number, and two free checked bags anytime."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,"great check in staff, excellent in-flight crew, apathetic condescending baggage personnel","I have always flown with SW and have received excellent services but yesterday changed that.I understand in a company of this size, mistakes by employee are unavoidable so I hope this email can help create policy or enforce those already in place to ensure what happened to me does no happen to the next person.On Saturday 12/21/19 I checked in at Atlanta airport at 5:29AM for the 6:15AM flight from ATL to HOU at a kiosk. The machine lagged so the process was not complete before the 45 minutes cut off. I proceeded to the front counter and was politely helped by the staff there to check in. the service on the plane was also just as pleasant. However when I got to Houston is where it all began.I was only able to retrieve one of the two luggage. When I tried to inquire about the other, I was told by the representative there that because the luggage was a ""late check"" it may be on the next direct flight which will land in 4 hours. I thanked the person and waited. when the luggage finally came I was appalled at the sight. this particular luggage was a gift from my wife so I treasured it with love. I bought a fabric luggage cover to protect it from scratches which I know is unavoidable with use. what I saw was my sentimental luggage tattered, stripped naked of its cover, with scratches and dents on the top, and a broken top handle.I did not open the luggage but went straight to the baggage claim office to file a report and check the content there.The first question the representative there asked by was ""are you sure the handle was not broken before"". I explained to her this is a gift from my wife and I had a fabric cover on it. now it is naked, dented, and broken. she then ask me again if I was sure the handle was not broken before. I may understand the policy of asking but why ask twice; and completely ignored the fact the luggage is dented and naked. Upon opening the luggage I found the cover inside of the luggage. She then ask if I want repair or replacement. I again repeated how important this luggage is to me and would be delighted if she can repair it. after inquiring with her colleague, she tell me it must be replaced and ask what brand it is. then in the middle of the crowed room exclaimed ""oh your luggage is a no brand name"".not once did I get an apology for the anguish of not knowing where a sentimental treasured item is, the heartbreak of seeing it tattered, the wasted one day of off-work to spend the holiday with my family, and now the humility of the crime of being poor and treasuring a none brand name item that was a gift from a loving wife after saving up one week of paycheck."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Flights gone wrong,"Worst flight ever, or should I say worst 5 flights ever I should have been home hours ago started at 8:30 am got home 11:30pm WTF!!!🤬  Southwest should refund my money and the Uber ride to and from the airport. DO yourself a favor and fly another airline. This is not the first time.😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬. The pilot kept saying twenty minutes then the mechanics don’t know what they’re doing according to the pilot 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Take off on an icy winter day,Easy take off after an icy morning. Quick and easy sky cab check in. Non-stop flight with excellent service while in the air.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Hate,I am not sure why SW airlines have such a high rating. I travel for my job and hands down worst airline. 90 percent are delayed but they lie and say on time. I will never again fly this airline.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Extremely inconvenient and stressful,"My wife and I are on a trip back from our honeymoon leaving Puerto Vallarta to Orlando Florida. The earliest time we can check in for our flights was at 2:30pm. My wife set an alarm on her phone at 2:30pm  for us to check in on the South West App So we can sit together for our 8 hour flight back to Orlando. The App is flawed, it only allowed one of us to check in and gave an error for my wife saying “airport check in required” when all of her current information including the passport was updated. If you have not flown with South West before, they do not give you assigned seats. If you do not check in at the exact time of your familyMember,  you risk the chance of not sitting with them for the flight. This may not be a big deal for some, however for us, we are both very nervous flying and find comfort in sitting next to each other. Now we have to wait until tomorrow to find out if someone will help us and we will sit together or not which gives me a high level of anxiety. - If this was the only issue I’d experienced with South West I would not have taken the time to write a review, however it’s not. My wife and I also traveled back from Rochester, NY toOrlando, Florida in June 2019 with family and had another awful experience with this airline. When we arrived 3 hours early for our flight leaving Rochester, the attendant informed us that our flight “may be delayed” and recommended that we switch to a different connecting flight. We took her advice to learn that the Rochester flight was never delayed. We arrived in Orlando at midnight on a Thursday to find that South West lost our luggage from the change in connecting flight. The manager in Orlando was not empathetic in the slightest and treated us like this happens all the time for this airline, even after my wife explained that she had her suit in her luggage for a big interview the following day. Their customer service is mediocre, they lack compassion maybe due the nature of the job they do everyday. On our connecting 2 flights to Puerto Vallarta I expressed concern of our luggage making with us (due to the experience I had from Rochester) to one of their staff members at the gate. The woman was abrupt and dismissive with me and responded “we kind of do this a lot”; which did not help to ensure me based on our previous experiences.  Due to the multiple experiences I’ve hadWith South West, I would not recommend them toFriends or family. The small amount of money you may save with flying Southwest is not worth the stress or lack of exceptional customer service."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent flight across America and back,"We took a 3 day trip from Tampa to San Diego and return, on Southwest.  Excellent and easy four hour-plus direct flights with arrivals within 5 minutes of schedule.  No issues.  Comfortable boarding environments, efficient boarding, great flight attendants, clean planes.  Very satisfied."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight Home from Las Vegas,"You can always count on two three things from Southwest;  they are on time, flight attendants very friendly, no food-bring your own!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Trip to NOLA,"Definitely recommend booking early to get the ""just get away"" pricing. Depending on when you travel, this option can sell out quickly, so if your dates are firm, book early to get better pricing. There are no assigned seat with Southwest. Check in as soon as you are able to (24 hours prior to your flight). Boarding order is dependent on when you check-in. The earlier, the better.Departure and arrival both on time. Flight attendants were polite. Love the free checked bag perk. I did not have to wait long on my checked bags once I arrived at my destination, which was great."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight great service,I don't think I have ever had a bad flight on SW. This trip was just as great. Fabulous service and a great flight. AND we arrived early for all legs.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Love Southwest, wish the only direct flight didn’t land after midnight","Love flying Southwest. Took flight 334 from FLL to Hartford. I actually do watch the fares for the trips I’ve purchased and take advantage of price decreases when they happen. My only complaint is that the only direct flight to Hartford lands after midnight. Please Southwest🙏 We need a daytime direct flight, especially in the winter when all of Connecticut is desperate for a South Florida visit"
n/a,50,Southwest flight Phoenix to Nashville ,"Mid morning flight from Phoenix to Nashville. The flight boarded on time... gate agent was friendly encouraged everyone to put a small bag under the seat in front of them to leave room for bigger bags in the bin....free checked bags, so why not check them. flight arrived early.... touch down was smooth."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,The perfect inter-island flight at an inexpensive rate.  ,"New airline in Hawaii and at a $59+tax rate per person/oneway we booked it.  Flight was perfect for inter island. Flight left on time, roomy leg room, and in flight service was enough.  No fees for (2) bags per person.  The only complaint I have is the seats are not too comfortable. Hey, I’m willing to put up with it for the price. Goodbye Hawaiian Airlines - sorry!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Love Southwest ,"I think this airline does an amazing job!  Check in was easy and the staff was very friendly.  Flight attendants and pilots were all professional.....and even funny at times, making the usually boring pre-flight stuff a little more enjoyable.  Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks are complimentary and instead of pushing a drink cart through the aisle, they write down your order and bring it out on a tray- thought that was a much better method.  Seats are pretty comfy and I did like the onboard entertainment you could access from your phone.  There are movies, games, or can even watch TV! I had no issues whatsoever with my flights and will continue to fly Southwest whenever possible.  Just to note: there are no assigned seats with this airline.  You are assigned either A, B, or C group with a number and you sit where you want."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Zero stars,"I gave them one star only because there is not zero star slection.My wife and I had a reserved direct flight with good seating.  At the last minute they emailed a canceled it for no reason. We had to scramble and reschedule to a  change over to a cattle car,and we didn't get to sit together. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GIVE THEM A DIME."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest Quick Flight,"I really appreciate the ease of flying with Southwest. I was happy that this flight crew actually had some fun when going over the safety briefing. That used to happen almost every time, but not it seems to be a rarity. The flight attendants did a good job on a short flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Inexpensive Flight with 1st class service,"We planned a trip to NYC to see the Radio City Rockettes in early November.This trip has been on My wife's ""Bucket List"" for several years.  We started planning in late September. Southwest Airlines has ""Wanna Get Away"" fares, extremely inexpensive.  We were able to book round trip  air fares for 2 from San Antonio to NYC for $ 198.00 apiece. Both trips only had one stop with minimal time spent in Houston, Tx. going and Dallas, Tx. coming home.  With Southwest each of us could check in 2 bags each with no cost, one bag carry on and my wife's purse.  The planes were comfortable, on time and crew provided outstanding service.  Going with Southwest also allowed us to do some extras things while staying in NYC.  If you are concerned about a budget this is the way to fly.  The most inexpensive part of our week long trip wasthe sir plane flight. I would recommend Southwest airlines to you."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great as always.,"Highly recommend SWA. We have flown other airlines, but SWA is always tops with us. 2 free bags, and free soft drinks. We will fly again."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest is THE most flexible airline!,"You won't find Southwest on Expedia or any of those sights. You have to go to their site directly to access them. They are far and away my favorite airline to fly.* You can cancel your flight with NO change fee, and use the funds for a future flight (make sure to keep track of your Confirmation Code because they will not do it for you).* You get 2 FREE bags to check.* If your flight is delayed over 4 hours (pretty RARE, in my experience), they will give you a voucher for another flight (I've received up to $200!)* They have frequent sales that are pretty phenomenal. Most recent jaw-dropper was $29 from northern CA to southern CA! (of course, you have to travel Tues or Wed to get these killer fares, but if you are flexible, you can fly places pretty cheaply!)GO SOUTHWEST!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent airline,"Use this airline whenever I fly.  I love that I don’t have to pay for checked luggage.  Due to illness had to cancel two flights this year and it was easy to cancel and reschedule.  Most airlines charge a fee, but not Southwest.  I will also look at flying with them before any other airline.  Why pay for extras when you don’t have to."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Too long layover in Phoenix,"4 to 6 hour layover was too much. Plane supposed to land in Salt Lake but diverted to Denver. Then from Denver back to salt Lake, unload and travel to Phoenix for our Reno flight. They made no effort to find a replacement plane and thus 6 damn hours in Phoenix airport. That sucks the big one."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Good flying experience,"I like flying southwest.  Curbside check in is fast, 2 checked bags no charge and pick your seat as you board the plane is preferred.   Fast check in with mobile app and digital boarding pass is easy."
n/a,50,Flying To Meeting,"Plane was loaded quickly, efficiently and professional. The gate agents were friendly and courteous. The first flight wasOn time and comfortable. The second flight out of St Louis was on time and friendly. I have great experience with Southwest most of the time."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Trip to New Orleans,"In spite of both flights having a full plane, the trip was very comfortable and enjoyable. Southwest Airlines does a great job."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Fly,Flight was ok but it was full and was late getting to Phoenix  I am a tall person so leg room was not good all in all i like the price.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,The CSA 81000 Jenny from Albuquerque!,Jenny made our christmas even more merrier!!!. She helped us change our flight without having to charge us extra as a one time courtesy because of her and her amazing team’s kind heart. She mentioned she’s been with southwest for 14 years and we thought the reason why she’s been with the company for that long is because she knows how to empathize and make sure that her priority is to keep the passengers happy. We really appreciate your christmas gift to our family. Have a Merry christmas and continue to be a blessing to other people 💕
Date of travel: December 2019,10,NOT a military friendly airline,"This is obviously NOT a military friendly airline and it haves a poor customer service, at least with my experience.  Wouldn't recommend this airline..."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Nice friendly flight,"Flight was on time, boarding easy with Southwest system, each have a free bag, snacks and soda.  Overall a very good experience."
Date of travel: March 2019,20,Rebooked out direct 2 hour flight into a 6 hour flight! Always a problem with this airline,"I have had such bad experiences with Southwest, I haven't flown them in years.  Reluctantly they had the best prices by a little bit for an upcoming trip.  Within 1 week of booking they have already changed both our flights from a direct 2 hour to over 6 hours! No options to rebook with another direct flight.  And of course the other airlines are now booked up or airfare has increased so cant change to another airline.  They have ruined so many vacations - Southwest fans are just in denial, they are one of the worst airlines."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Just so easy,"I really think Southwest has a perfect system.  Boarding is quicker here than on any other we’ve used recently.  Pay a little extra & you can board a bit earlier with a better choice of seats.  Service is friendly & efficient.  Our seats, in a 3-on-each-side configuration were decently comfortable.  Definitely recommend."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Maui to Oahu Long Way to Baggage,"I'm from DFW & decided to take SW from Maui to Oahu...as Hawaiian Air has such a monopoly on interisland flights.  At Maui checkin, the gals suppose to help you b/4 ticket counter were too busy talking to each other....when politely asking them for help, they said go to ticket counter.    I needed a chair to go to gate, and NO ONE would help me...they told me to walk over  to wheelchairs and someone would be there.  REALLY???  The flight was wonderful BUT you land at a remote terminal and must bussed to main terminal for bags....what a pain in the A!!  It was a good 1/2 hr. b/4 we got to baggage.   SO DISAPPOINTED...plus outdoor ramp off plane.   You can see Hawaii doesn't want SW there!!!   It's a long long ordeal to baggage folks!!!  VERY DISAPPOINTING....WON'T FLY FROM MAUI TO OAHU AGAIN."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Love Them,"They were great as usual. The only problem was that on the return I received an error message in trying to get my border pass.  After a minute or so, it finally came up but I had a B59 number and ended up in the back seat. Not bad except it took a long time to get off the plane."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Okay, not outstanding","Not their fault we were 2 hours late to board. Captain very pleasant. Crew not so much, they were put out like us."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Airline,"We usually fly Alaska Airlines to Puerta Villarta but decided to fly Southwest. When we departing from LA First there was a gate change. Then we were delayed over an hour and half because the plane was over fueled. Even the pilot said in his 25 years flying this was a first. The plane was filled to capacity, then eventually the pilot said they’ve decided to change planes, so we had to get off that plane and go thru the boarding process again at a new gate  on a new plane. Our flight back to LA was fine"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Flight was delayed,Normally Southwest is great but the flight was delayed and then after landing it took awhile to exit because a plane was at our gate.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Common courtesy,"We don't fly that often and on occasion fly Southwest between ATL and Houston Hobby.At this particularly crowded time of year I would make this suggestion. Lots of pre board announcements that it is a sold out flight and therefore PLEASE store your personal items ie small bags and back packs under your seat. Then police this policy during boarding. Otherwise this is what happens. People who either cannot afford to upgrade to priority boarding or have to make last minute changes are the last to board. One makes their way down the long aisle with their 2 wheeler which of course will not fit under the seat find little overhead space available - due to backpacks that easily would fit under seat - even as they reach back of plane. After finally storing overhead all the seats near back of plane are taken. Then you have to turn around and struggle back to front of plane where last night I encountered two of the most unfriendly folks I've ever met. When I politely asked it I could sit between them both rolled their eyes. I am average size BTW. On landing I told the window lady - I can image her being the Titanic lady asking if the lifeboats will be boarded by class - that I would step into the aisle to allow her to exit. No thank you, no nothing, nada She even looked like the Titanic lady.. It both amazes and saddens me that there are so many rude inconsiderate people these days. Only reason I don't give 5 is SW people should enforce more firmly ""small bags go under your seat."" Aisle man had his 2 wheeler AND his personal item conveniently stored directly over his head. My wife and I who of course did not get to dream of sitting together had to wait until almost entire plane had exited to return to rear to retrieve our luggage."
n/a,10,Never on time ,Southwest loves being delayed. They have been delayed for at least 50% of my flights (30+ flights in the past year) such that when they are on time I am surprised. Their operations suck for a large airline. Never fly them if you want to get somewhere on time with no hassle. It takes them ages and they do try to help but the bottom line is they don't know how to be on time and wouldn't have to help fix our issues if they didn't create them in the first place
Date of travel: December 2019,40,I survived,"Ok, let’s start with the fact that I’m not a big fan of flying and I absolutely abhor takeoffs. Now, the flight from Omaha to Vegas was pretty decent. I landed in Vegas at 2 pm to discover that my connection to Reno had been canceled due to a plane not being there due to weather elsewhere......but they might be able to get me on the 1130 pm flight. Oh wait, there’s one boarding now that I can get you on if you can get alllllllllllllll the way across the terminal in 10 minutes. Somehow I made it. Now, if you remember your earlier reading, you know that I abhor takeoffs. That was the best part of this flight. Stuck in the back of the plane for 51 minutes of hell! The FA’s never unbuckled from their seats!That all being said, I’ll still be flying Southwest. Reasonable fares, pretty friendly people, 2 free bags, and connections to almost anywhere (start flying to Alaska, will ya?)."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best airline!!,"Southwest is my airline of choice! Friendly staff, clean aircraft and flexible schedules are hallmarks of the airline.The gate staff and flight attendants were professional and very patient.Southwest is the best!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Special Fare,I was watching for a fare sale to go to Tucson to visit friends and this period of time between Thanksgiving and Christmas was only $49 each way. Altho my return flight was really early in the morning the flight only lasts about 1 hour. I like their quick boarding and no seat assignments. This went off really good.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Not A Bad Way to Travel,"I'm not a fan of the A/B/C group boarding, so I suggest spending the extra $15 and getting the Early Bird Boarding.  Guaranteed to be in the A group.  I have been on a flight where a woman who was traveling with 2 young children ended up being at the end of the C group.  When she went to board, there were only middle seats available.  When she asked the flight attendant for help, she was told that she'd have to find the seats and ask passengers to move herself.  What mother wants to leave their young children between 2 adult strangers on a plane?  A little help would've been nice.  Anyway, as stated, not a fan of not having assigned seats but I am a fan of having 2 free checked bags.  Also, remember to download the Southwest app on your phone/tablet BEFORE boarding so you can enjoy their inflight movies/shows/etc.  It will not download once you are in the air (this, according to a flight attendant).  Overall, not a bad way to travel.  Seems people either love this airline or hate it."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Non-eventful flight, the best to have","Everything went smoothly, no surprises. Checked in 24 hrs ahead of flight and was able to get A or B group for all segments of flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Thursday 8 PM Flight,"This pilot was my favorite of all pilots.  The airplane's takeoff and landings were done with expert handling, as well as his navigation through the airport while taxing to and from the runways - not super slow, no bouncing.  The only complaint about the flight was the fact that the woman behind me talked through the entire flight. It was so loud that I could hear her over my headphones.  We all know that lady's life story. Honestly, I've been choosing other airlines for international flights and I think American airlines are a terrible value for the dollar and only use them as a necessity these days.  The other airlines board the back first, then the front, which is a lot faster, too."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Baggage check maze of confusion!,"Our trip this morning (530am) from Ontario to Sacramento started with a very unclear line to print our own baggage claim ticket then kind of shimmy our way back into the line.  There were no instructions, ropes or employees to instruct everyone how the process was supposed to go so many of us were really confused about where to go, stand or proceed with the kiosks that printed our baggage tickets.  Then after finally struggling through the chaos and printing our baggage ticket we approached the counter to hand the bag to the EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVELY RUDE ""customer service"" agent.  There were 2 women, I did not see their names but 1 was black and the other a white lady.  The white lady was the was who treated us horribly!  After we finally were able to complete the process and hand her our bags and we were starting to walk away (and this is after she was horrible to us a few times already) she then shouts out to my mother, ""read the instructions next time!""  Not only was that extremely unprofessional and humiliating as other customers were watching but very rude and we looked around to see if we could find the ""signs"" she spoke so loudly about and it took a lot of effort to find them in the confusion of holiday travelers.   Fast forward to our flight.  We had a charming blonde lady with southern accent as our flight attendant and once she found out I was traveling to go see my dying father and not so much for a vacation she was absolutely the sweetest person ever and gave me extra services I didn't even ask for.  Her warm heart made the whole horrible morning experience just disappear.  So!  Thanks to her I might consider southwest again but that person scanning bags at the counter was absolutely rude and mean and I overheard other customers comment on her behavior as well!  I do hope southwest can maybe train her on what customer service should look like and make those kiosk lines a little more user friendly!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest is very helpful for mobility issues,"Recent Southwest flight with a mobility impaired traveler went very well.  Had a wheel chair waiting at curbside checkin arranged at ticketing.  Had assistance at both ends of each flight.  In particular, assistance was needed for the security check for the wheelchair.  There were no extra charges for the mobility assistance.  Good job Southwest!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Ahead of schedule - Nice Surprise,"Flew South West from Houston Hobby To Tampa on Saturday, 12/7/2019 and the flight was quite full.  We use early bird check in so we are assured of a decent seat selection in the A Group.  Flight was on time for departure + the pilot actually gained some time flying over the Gulf of Mexico.....arrived ahead of our scheduled 10:30 PM arrival time, which on a Sunday night is always welcome.  South West does a good job for a fair price.  We will use them again.  Non-Stop Flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,San Jose to Maui,Pretty good for a 5-6 hour flight.  Have flown on 3 other airlines for this leg and SW did pretty well keeping us snacked up/fluids and mild entertainment.The seats for this flight were also much roomier than the normal SW seats ...plenty of leg room.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,BEST FLIGHT ATTENDANT EVER!!!,"OUR FLIGHT ATTENDANT WAS TIM :) He was the BEST.  You needed it, he provided it.  We were flying out to a Company Xmas Party & needless to say, our Boss was HANGRY.  Tim provided Extra Snacks, entertainment, little knick knacks for us to bring our kids & you could tell, he REALLY CARED about us.  Gotta always give a shout out to the Free Bags ALSO, Thanks SW.  I fly you guys maybe 6-10 times a year to see my family in Chicago & a few other times for business if I'm lucky, but in all the years I've been travelling, I'VE NEVER HAD ANYONE GO ABOVE & BEYOND LIKE TIM.  Thanks Tim, I hope we meet again my friend.  Keep up the good work!!  Much Appreciated!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Early check-in didn't help,Flight was on time. No problems. Service was good. Unsatisfied with the early check in paid $40 each and still ended up in the B boarding group. Feels like I wasted my money.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent Flight Overall,From the DCA Airport to flying in a Southwest plane and landing in TPA. The flight was only around 2 hours long and was painless. Self seating is super easy and you have the option to check your bags for free. Drinks and snacks are also available even on such a short flight!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A little hiccup...,"when I went to get our boarding passes, I realized they'd changed our flight, arriving much later in STL, which we could NOT do.  I called SW, they apologized for the changes and after my explaining our dilemma on time, got us out of Phoenix earlier to arrive in time for other commitments; they got us checked in an boarding passes upon arrival at airport.  Whew!   Low and behold, we get A3 & 4 boarding AND a free cocktail for our troubles.  Yippie!  Thank you SW!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,LGA new terminal,Southwest always a great flight.  Free movies and drink coupons for frequent travelers.  Love the new terminal at LaGuardia.  Nice sitting area with plenty of charging stations.  Always pays to upgrade to get an A boarding pass though!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving,I have used Southwest Airlines for years and never have a problem. I recently received free cocktail tickets for future flights as a THANK you for using their airline.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Mrs. Padron-Croes,"I use SW most of the time when I travel to the states, their service is great, 2 checked bags incl pp, they are always on time, free movies, and never had issues with time delays!!! I am a rapid reward member, so I also earn my points while flying with SW!!! Highly recommend SW"
Date of travel: September 2019,10,"Despicable customer service, baggage/ground crew at DCA","Despite checking my bags at Fort Lauderdale airport 2 hrs before flight, my and about 15 other passengers' bags did not arrive at DCA with our flight.Southwest baggage area at Reagan International (DCA) is cramped and disorganised to begin with:  2 carousels and NO indication as to which flights' bags are being sent to which carousel.  The Southwest ground crew personnel were apathetic; I got more information from fellow travellers.Next, when word did get around, that for those of us left milling about our bags had been sent with the next plane, we crowded into the lost baggage office, spilling out into the cramped area next to the carousels.  No Southwest employee particularly took charge to give us the information; again, it was mostly being passed as word of mouth amongst us waiting passengers.4 Southwest employees were on duty, taking our details.  Since I opted to pick up my bags myself later in the evening, I was offered a voucher and told they would call me when the flight/bags arrived.No call from Southwest.  I called Southwest baggage a bit after that ""next flight"" was due to arrive and was met with mediocre service on the phone.  I hauled myself back to the airport, and the same 4 Southwest employees were there, with no other customer in the office.  2 had eyes locked on a screen, the other 2 doing something else.No one greeted me.  I announced myself, and was dismissively told to wait a minute.  I replied that I had already been waiting for more than ""a minute"" for my bags and had come to collect them.  I got eye rolls from the employee who did look up, but no apology for keeping me waiting then, and certainly no apology on behalf of their employer - Southwest - for keeping me waiting for my checked bags.This is when things deteriorated.  The youngest one of them started looking among the scores of bags sitting there by name tag, not thinking to ask me what size or color my bags were.  I went over to point out my bags -- and in point of fact, did point them out -- when a 2nd employee of the 4 came over and BERATED me for being in the area with the bags.  I half-jokingly asked if this really was Southwest Airlines, as it didn't sound like it!  That 2nd employee's attitude to me got worse, then dismissing me in the 3rd-person as though I were an inanimate object, told her ""colleague"" that she didn't have to answer me/help me as I have to show them respect!I wonder who does the employee training for Southwest ground crew at DCA, as they certainly skipped the lesson on showing the customer - paying customer - respect, and courtesy.  This 2nd Southwest employee then in a childishly theatrical manner went over to the scores of bags and started ""looking"" for my bags, slowly one by one, exactly in the area where they were not (remember, I had pointed them out already).  These words come to mind:  sheer ignorance and malice.I was handed my bags as though I, and my bags, were pieces of garbage to be gotten rid of.  Absolutely, Southwest!  I am glad to be thrown away from your airline after 10+ years of nearly bi-monthly flights.  And as I before would enthusiastically encourage people to fly Southwest -- because of the customer-friendly service -- I now equally enthusiastically tell them NOT to fly Southwest.As I pointed out to the professional and courteous customer service agent who took my lengthy complaint -- and she did apologize profusely for those DCA Southwest baggage employees' behavior, as well as for Southwest's delay with my bags -- there is no way those 4 employees could have acted with such arrogance and impunity were they not feeling protected by an equally egregious Southwest management at DCA."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Flight!!!,"Probably the best flight I've had. We left on time and arrived early without any hassles. Normally my smaller than usual carry-on bag always gets flagged as ""not enough room to put in over head compartment"" despite much larger bags being allowed. This was my 1st time flying SW airlines and it was great! The staff was courteous and professional. The change in flight went smoothly as well. The only hiccup was the didn't announce that we were leaving 20 minutes late, but we still arrived at our final destination on time. I only had a carry-on bag and personal bag/item so I can not attest to the baggage handling. I will definitely be flying SW airlines again!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest...Always a pleasure!,"My work takes me on several trips a year and I always fly Southwest if given the option. Customer service is always outstanding and staff is sincerely excited about their service. I have never had a bad experience on any trip I have taken with Southwest. Due to rough flying conditions we did not get food and bererage services, but that was ok, they were short flights."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,The Spirit of Southwest Airlines is Dead,"To the unfortunate death of Southwest Airlines... My wife, daughter son and I (30 year frequent flyer members of SW) had reservations to fly to Panama City Beach for Thanksgiving. My wife and daughter left on the Monday prior, and my son and I were due to leave the following Tuesday morning from Denver. Heavy snow cancelled our flights on Tuesday. I re-booked for later that day, but this flight was also cancelled. Our flight had a stop in Dallas, and so I called Southwest to see if they could get us to Dallas on Tuesday night, (There were available flights listed). I would pay for a hotel on Tuesday night and we'd fly to Panama City early Wednesday morning. Southwest said no. Travel had to be completed in one day. I asked why and the answer was ""It's our policy"". Never a good justification. They said the agents at the airport might be able to split the flight that way, but they couldn't. They said I'd have to go to the airport and ask. I suggested maybe they could call the agents at the airport rather than have me drive an hour in the snow to perhaps be turned down. They said they couldn't do that. I kept trying and finally got a hold of someone at their corporate offices. After another hour of begging, (honestly, we just wanted to be together as a family at Thanksgiving) the rep said they'd do it. However....since we were booking what they considered a ""new flight"" on such short notice on a holiday, the flight to Dallas from Denver would cost each of us more than $1,000 a piece. Our original flights were all booked with frequent flyer miles, and there was no way we could afford to do this. I'm certain someone will attempt to take down this post within minutes, but y'all need to know that the image Southwest has worked so hard to cultivate, no longer lives. If you won't help a family be together on Thanksgiving without gouging them, (as if SW needs my last $2,000) what do you stand for?"
n/a,20,Beverage service Southwest,"So I'm a southwest flyer, other than overseas flight I will generally pick Southwest over any other airline given there are flights available. So when it comes to Southwest I'm a bit bias because I like flying with them. However, on my most recent flight with them, I definitely didn't have the greatest experience. My husband and I chose Southwest as our airline of choice for our transportion to our destination wedding in Aruba. This flight wasn't very accommodating or friendly at all. The flight attendant refused to help me with my bag. I even told her I was nervous putting it in the overhead bin for it's my wedding dress. She gave me this dry ok so what look and said ok well the bins a empty so just put it here. Now! I am fully capable of putting my bag in the overhead bins myself or having my then fiance do it for me. It was just me using it as an ice breaker and making conversation. During flight service the attendants came around and asked about beverage service which we indulged in. As the attendants were preparing for their decent we were not done with our drinks. My husband I both had maybe a little left in our cups, the flight attendant came around and told us she needed our cups right now. My husband and I were both confused as we were just going to chug the drink down and give her the trash. She made a scene about it and said no I need those cups now. Out of all my years of flying, which I've been doing since I was 8 years old, I'm 30 now. I had never seen a flight attendant act like this over a drink not being finished. She was completely out of line. Needless to say I still fly southwest and have other flight attendants about this incident and 1 attendant gave us free alcohol for putting up with this madness and others have said the flight attendants are under direction to collect all trash before the plane lands. Yes she was wrong but all trash has to be collected before landing. So going forward when you hear the caption saying he is going to descend chug those drinks to advoid any scenes being made"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,sunny mexico,great flight out on time. return one attendant got sick waited an hour plus for won to fly in to Austin TX for flight to Denver
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Lot's of turbulence but still an enjoyable flight,This flight was super turbulent but the flight attendants and pilot were so reassuring that it was still a very comfortable flight.  I am a nervous flyer and turbulence usually scares the bejesus out of me but because of the constant updates from flight attendants and pilots I felt very safe and unafraid.  Checking in and boarding was a bit messy because of gate changes and a slight delay but we still managed to make it back earlier than scheduled.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Very smooth and comfortable,"This was an amazing flight, everything moved along on time as planned. The flight itself was smooth, comfortable and quick.  Kudos to the pilots and flight attendants who made this the most enjoyable flight.  I never fall asleep on flights because of my anxiety but I just couldn't help but fall asleep on this smooth flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Tail of two flights,"The flight was standard as for Southwest goes. It was the ground operations that were missing the boat. The plain was delayed arriving BWI, the on helpful part was not enough ground crew to load the plain and delayed departure another 30 minutes. Then when we arrived in Denver they had nobody to drive the jet bridge to get off the plain. Another time the pilots were verbally displeased for the ground support of the operations."
Date of travel: January 2019,40,Flight on Southwest,The plane was clean the Flight Attendants were nice. They made sure air conditioning was fixed on the way back and it didn't take long. Was very happy with their service. I fly Southwest whenever possible. I like the times I can fly.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Best-customer-experience-no-hassle-perfect-airliner !,"Southwest has been and will always be our preferred domestic airline !Provided you plan ahead and book your tickets early, you will end up getting a fairly decent price. The good part of flying southwest is the transparency - basically no hidden fee for any bags (you have a carry on + personal item + 2 checked bags included in the ticket !!). The seats have decent leg room and the flights almost never get delayed ! What else would you expect from an airline right?"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Less expensive but not very comfortable,Good effort by cabin crew.Much better care should be taken to upgrade and maintain the toilets.The processing of passengers at the airports could be more efficient.
Date of travel: April 2019,10,A travel agents worst nightmare!,"April of 2019 I traveled to Tampa to visit friends and check out a few Clearwater resorts I wanted to book for events. It was business so I traveled solo but also my birthday weekend so my husband surprised me on a red eye. Fast forward to departure day on our way to airport and Southwest cancels 1 hour before boarding time. No explanation or compensation offered. After calling and realizing that some clients were offered travel vouchers and others were not someone finally contacted me offering us $200 each in luv funds. My husband and I both missed 8 hours of pay which is double the value of funds. I am also a banker and missed a very important conference, in addition we had to pay another night of hotel and car rental. In short we still took a huge loss.Fast forward to August 2019, 4 months later were in Hawaii and decide to use my husbands voucher to island hop. Southwest had one ways for around $50 each. We book only to find his was actually only $150 not stated amount of $200Now Fast Forward to December of 2019, I am still a travel agent have a large group of 25 guest flying back into Tampa almost exactly a year later. Resort then cruise so flights are important. I book myself outside of the group with the intent of using Voucher! And guess what?? Our flight going in has been canceled. We are 4 months from departure and other carriers will be higher now and I have collected payments from clients. Not to mention my Luv funds are set to expire so I have to talk to another department to beg for extension? I was told it was because of continued grounding of Boeing. Well if that plane is grounded why are you selling tickets?Southwest is a travel agents nightmare and a pain to travelers. They are not dependable and always my last choice in airlines now. I get free bags on most airlines because I'm a card holder. But clients often see it as a value so I try to adhere. I am always leery booking clients with them for fear of there overbooking and lack of delivery. Southwest needs to stop selling tickets on planes that they don't have clearance to fly yet. The grounding has been going on long enough for them to have a system to serve clients."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A great airline to fly,"Southwest is the only airline that I fly.  My daughter lives in Florida so I travel there a few times a year.  The prices are reasonable, and Southwest, for some reason, has the ability to get there a little sooner than they say.  The people that work for Southwest have always gone out of their way to be nice."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great staff,The flight crew was very respectable and made the flight a simple and very enjoyable experience. Wes stood out to me in particular helping me access a movie on my phone and giving me an extra snack.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Fly with anyone else but Southwest,The last three flights that I've had with Southwest have been delayed for over 2 hours.  This trip we flew to Seattle to visit our granddaughter.  On the flight there we had a layover in St Louis and they were late 45 minutes because they were loading 50 plus Amazon packages.  I didn't realize that Southwest was the new FedEx / UPS in addition to a commercial airline!  on the way back from Seattle we had another connecting flight in St Louis which was delayed and then they diverted us to Jacksonville and we were three hours late coming into Tampa.  this is the third time they have diverted my flight the first 2 times were to Orlando and all three flights I was hours late getting in. They blame the weather but it's mismanagement of their flights.  When I booked this trip they canceled that fight and rebooked me with long layovers and I had to fix my reservation so from the get-go this has been a nightmare.  they are not worth the savings I'd rather pay for my bags and fly Alaska Airlines. at least I know Alaska airlines cares about getting you to your destination on time Southwest is all over the place they have constant delays and it's unacceptable.  I am thoroughly disgusted I have been a Southwest customer my whole life and this is it three strikes you're out I'm done.  take the time and do your research and go with another flight it is not worth the savings it will end up costing you more in the long run with all of their delays.  if I could I would give you a zero rating because this customer is completely unsatisfied and had enough.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,"Good flight, horrible handling!!!","Southwest airlines does an excellent job at flying, but they do a HORRIBLE job at handling luggage. Take this photo for an example, this mug (which, by the way, was heavily packed!), it was completely DESTROYED by baggage handlers! They should take into consideration that, for instance, a suitcase might contain my GRANDMA'S GIFT to my MOTHER!!!!!! Overall, they are SUPER inconsiderate when it comes to baggage handling."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Burbank agent,"I had a horrific experience at Burbank with Southwest gate agents. I travel with my 3.5 pound 13 year old  dog who is very well behaved. He will give a couple tiny barks once in awhile to alert me of unknown situations. The gate agent took a huge dislike to us. After getting approval and he was ‘inspected’ by southwest agents, we calmly waited in boarding area for an hour. As I was getting ready to board, I was abruptly approached by the agent and was told I had to leave my pet behind if I wanted to fly. She was denying me boarding. What a traumatic experience! Southwest isn’t about customer service. I tried to speak and register complaint with customer relations for 8 hours. It was pointless! Worst experience in my life."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Great time, would use again",Flight was smooth.  Flight attendants were outstanding and kept us informed.  Got there earlier than planned and Southwest’s staff provided us with all information to get through customs in a timely manner.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Best Airline I ever travel,"I flew from Fort Lauderdale to Punta Cana for my anniversary. The first thing I want to emphasize is that in Southwest Airline you do not have to pay the first suitcase you dispatch below, I loved that, in addition, the fly attendant was very gentle even invited me and my wife to a drink that of course we do not reject . Everything on the flight was great Check-in, arrival, return. Something that I loved was the price I got even though it was in a short time. I will definitely use Southwest again for my trips."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight,"As always, great flight, easy on-line booking and check-in, great service, entertaining crew, on-time arrival."
n/a,40,Will likely fly with Southwest airlines again,"My nephew had an emergency surgery so I came to help. I booked and traveled within 24 hours. I was surprised of how easy to check in at the curbside. The airlines allow 2 check-in baggages free. The guy also printed the boarding pass. That was easy and stress-free.The boarding was organized. No seat assignment. Since it was a full flight, they encouraged passengers to check-in carry on baggages for free.The boarding was fast.The only thing I did not do was to a bring a sandwich for the flight. They provide water, soda, juice and small bags of snack but the flight was long.Next I will prepare a lunch box."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent Flight,"The CSR's at Southwest in PVR were the utmost in professionalism.  The onboard crew; F/A's and pilots were equally professional.  We did experience three instances of greater than normal turbulence, requiring the F/A's to be seated, postponing inflight services.  Each time, they apologized to the passengers for not being able to provide service.  Very customer service oriented.     Date of travel  15-12-19"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Efficient and friendly,"The SWA boarding experience has become more controlled and efficient over the years.  The CSR's at the gate at LAX are polite and professional on monitoring abusers of the boarding process.  However, we had several passengers who utilized the wheelchair early boarding, they and their entourage monopolized the front seats.   Upon (attempting) to deplane in PVR, those passengers and entourages were first to block the aisles preventing others from deplaning.  They refused to move until the wheelchairs were brought onto the plane.  We observed two of the ""wheelchair"" people walking outside the airport without aids.  SWA should require a Dr.'s note to request a wheelchair or make the early boarders sit in the back of the plane.    I know I have not grown taller, nor have my legs gotten longer, the legroom on SWA appears to be getting smaller."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight Crew handled on-board incident in a professional manner.,The flight was proceeding smoothly until a passenger behind us became ill. The flight crew took immediate action. They supplied the passenger with aid in a calm and professional manner. Another passenger identified himself to the the crew as a trained EMS person and assisted the crew in determining that ailing passenger's blood pressure was showing a dangerous level. Oxygen was administered and soothing words to calm the passenger down. The Pilot was advised and took appropriate action. The flight land in Philadelphia. BRAVO Southwest GREAT JOB!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always great,Southwest never disappoints. On the way up we had a very lively and funny flight attendant. She made the trip enjoyable. SW is always on timek
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Haven't flown in years.. Will now,"Recently flown for the first time in many years.  Nervous?  sure..   The Southwest airlines experience brought the joy of flying back again.  Clean airplane, friendly crew and a smooth flight on both flights.   From Pittsburgh to Orlando and back."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Easy flying,"Firstly, I’m a huge fan of SW.  I love not paying for bags and I can get a good seat (towardsfront) without wasting time or money.  This flight left later than posted, but they communicated that information right away and later reassured us that we wouldn’t miss our connecting flight; which we did make.  I also like the movies SW has available on free inflight services.  They still give out snacks and flight attendants seem way less stressed out than the “over-priced” carriers.  Also, I always have plenty of leg room."
Date of travel: June 2019,40,SWA to Puerto Vallarta Mexico,"With Southwest Airlines flying to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, the best direct flight time of just 3.5 hours from Oakland Airport to Puerto Vallarta and paid around $380 per person.  Hope SWA will offer more flights since the tickets sells fast.  Also SWA flys to Cancun, but hopefully more flights and lower prices to follow.  Will try the Hawaii route also."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,“Business Select” scam,"Five of us flew from Chicago to Charleston, SC. For four fares, we paid $278. For my son, who is larger and wanted more room, I booked business select, and it cost $808. They have only one class, which we didn’t know until we boarded. My son boarded number 1 and we were number 20-23. He ended up sitting right next to my wife. How can they charge $530 for that. It’s downright consumer fraud. I have never flown Southwest before, and never will again."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Flying High,"Flight was on time. The attendants as you board were friendly and courteous. I was in the B section, it seemed like over half the plane boarded when they called the A section. So many people got up for the A section, I wondered if they really monitored what section you sit in when you board. The leg room is not the best and the snacks were a small bag of salted pretzels. We know why they give you salted snacks at a bar, is it the same on an airplane? Do not care at all for the little bag of salted pretzels. Other than that the flight was good. If you catch a good rate and it is not a real long flight then it is good."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Top Flight staff at SWA spreads the LUV,"We travelled with a passenger needing wheelchair assistance for the first time.  Our original non stop flight was cancelled shortly after booking and we were rebooked on a direct flight that added a few hours to our travel time.  When we got to the airport 2 hours ahead of our flight, one of the passengers discovered that she did not have her purse or ID.  Since her home was 1.5 hrs from the airport we had to ask the ticket counter agent for help.  He rebooked our whole party on a later non-stop flight.  We had enough time to drive back and retrieve the purse with the ID needed to get through TSA screening.  The airport staff and flight crew were outstanding which minimized the stress of our travel day.  Kudos to Mike  at SWA PDX!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Terrible Policy,"My fiance and I got an offer to fly private to NYC but still needed our return flight back o Texas. So we ""no-showed"" because we only had an option to cancel both flights and not just the 1st flight. So they then cancelled our return flight as well and kept $1,200. They were then semi-rude on the phone. This policy is a joke and I have done this 2 other times for a past United flight and they did not do this. No wonder Southwest stock is half as much as United stock. Terrible & greedy company."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Always enjoyable,I love Southwest transferency. The flight attends enjoy their job and it shows. I love their flexibility if you need to change your flight. Southwest also keeps their schedule. I fly southwest every month and I love it.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Surprizing for a Discount Carrier,"Great personnel!!!  These people have their act together! Great organization at front desk and at boarding gate.  Other, so called-full service, airlines should take note."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,The seats were actually designed by someone.,"Southwest is generally a pretty good airline.  The staff are professional and have a sense of humor.  We don't mind the boarding process and like the free bag.  If you make it to an exit row or if the flight is really not filled the experience is generally okay.  But the flight on Friday, December 13 to Phoenix was full and only regular seats were available.  Someone actually designed the seats so that your knees are jambed into the seat in front of you and your shoulder is in the isle and your spine is only straight if you are in the middle seat.  Then they crammed them into an airplane,  and Southwest bought the airplane.  I had three hours to contemplate this cruel insanity and am compelled to share it."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Another great trip,Good flight. Not too long a layover in Baltimore. Checked luggage was quickly delivered to the turntable.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"BETTER THAN HAWAIIAN, EVEN WITHOUT THE ALOHA","With Southwest Airlines, you are trading off a ""zone"" and seat assignment in advance, with a ""first come, first served"" experience.  At the same time, you are gaining a better seat opportunity if you check in as early as possible once the ""clock"" starts.  Southwest also provides a nice benefit if you need it (and we did):  ""Early Bird Checkin"" for an additional $25 per person.  This allows you to check in and reserve your boarding position 36 hours in advance.  The service onboard is also their own unique brand of hospitality.  It helps to be different and still hospitable."
Date of travel: January 2019,50,love this airline,this air line is comfortable and best prices. it needs a little up dating but pilots and cabin crew are wonderful. i fly them every chance i get . They don;t go every were though so check it out
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great!,"Southwest is the best value out there. On time, clean, and some of the nicest staff from curb to cabin! They’re awesome!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Tennesse Trip,My fiancé and I flew with Southwest on December 7 2019.  The flight was onetime and without incident.  Southwest always does a good job when I fly with them.   The flight was smooth and relaxing.  The Staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely fly with Southwest again.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Good Airlines...but,"I regularly fly Southwest.  Good airlines.  Friendly employees.  Love the airfares, the no baggage fees, etc.  But I do have two issues I have face multiple times.  First, they rarely leave when they schedule or arrive when they schedule.  It seems to happen more often than not.   On occasion this has caused me to reschedule appointments.  Second, on more than one occasion they have lost my luggage.  While they find it and deliver it, it remains a source of stress when the lose it.  I rarely check a bag because it happens too often."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Satisfied ,"Kind attendants, snacks, and multiple drink services for the short 1.5 hour flight. Very satisfied with the service for the price."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight to Orlando,There was a video about being in boarding group 1. After all the special groups board then group 1 was called. My two flights felt like that. Except for the screaming children my flight was fine. I guess because of the resort’s children and handicapped is to be expected. The attendant said this flight had the largest number of wheel chairs she experience.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,"Southwest to Hawaii, The good, the bad and the ...","First let me start by saying that I love Southwest Airlines.   They usually make things easy and get you where you need.   There are things that everyone who flies with any frequency with Southwest knows.  First you HAVE you call exactly 24 hours before your flight to get seats unless you want to pay for early check in.   You can change your reservations without a change fee.  Southwest usually had the friendliest flight attendants and big big one especially when going over to Hawaii two FREE pieces of checked luggage.When flying Southwest to Hawaii, all rules go out the door.  First calling 24 hours ahead doesn’t really help you.  If you call 24 hours ahead of the flight and its your only flight that day (no connections) you are up the creek without a paddle.  If you are lucky you will get a low “B” number otherwise you’ll get a high “B” number or a “C” number.  Why is that?   Well if someone is connecting from Denver there 24 hours ahead for their first and second flight is 2 or 3 hours ahead of you.  Someone else in the same time zone as you with a connecting flight like San Diego will have one to two hours ahead of you.   The flights are very full.  Many people pay the $20.00 or so and buy early check-in which automatically checks you in 36 hours ahead.  This to might not work as well as you hope but you can probably be assured that you’ll at least get a B-30 or better position.  There is another problem with seating.  Many passengers buy ONE early check-in or even the more expensive upgrade boarding which you can only purchase at the airport and that is if it’s available.  Upgrade boarding is a boarding position between A 1-15.   They were $40.00 for our flight.  They then board the flight earlier and save seats for the rest of their party.   On our flight back from Maui  my flying partner who paid for early bird check-in and got a “B-4” assignment said that when he got on the plane every aisle seat was save with a backpack or luggage until the last 4 or 5 rows.  You can see that this might be a little aggravating.Make sure you have your electronic toys FULLY charged.  You might also want to consider getting a battery extender.  There are no electrical outlets on the plane (this is not the case with the other legacy carriers).  Entertainment is free and they have a decent choice of movies and TV shows.  Consider buying a sandwich or making them at home before you get on the plane. You might get hungry over 5 hours of flying.  Southwest does give better snacks on the flight to Hawaii but they are snacks.  Mine contained a package of Wheat Thins, a small container of spreadable cheddar cheese, Welch’s fruit gummies and a package of 6 Tic Tacs.   They do come around with a Pepperage Farm cookie later on and pretzels.  There are still free soft drinks and cocktails and beer you can purchase.  The plane is a 737-900.  It’s newer and has a nicer interior then most of the other Southwest planes I’ve been on.  It also is a bit bigger and seats a few more people.  The problem is the seat bottom don’t have a lot of cushion and my bottom got very uncomfortable sitting there after a while.  The trip home it was the same plane but much worse for me.  It started be uncomfortable within an hour. Bottom Line:  The price is right and truth be told I have a companion pass so my partner didn’t have to pay for his flight other then $11.20 for security fees.  I also have enough points to fly free myself.  If that wasn’t the case, I would consider spending the extra money and flying a legacy airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Ontime  from BNA to CHS and from CHS to BNA.  Nonstop.  Only took a little over an hour.,Southwest has never let us down except for a long flight delay last year due to weather conditions.  We fly SW whenver possible.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,SouthwestAirlines experience,"Flew 6 times on Southwest in past 3 weeks. Fly approximately 20-25 times a year.  By far the best airline going. No baggage, fees. No fee to change flights. Excellent employees from ticket agent to gate agents to aircraft crew. Southwest hires personality and it shows everytime I fly with them. There are times when flights are delayed due to weather, that holds true for every airline.  It’s the effort they make to get you to your destination on time.  My #1 choice when I fly."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Reliable, cost effective way to travel","As usual, Southwest is a very competetive and easy way to get from place to place.  Now that other airlines have split out all their costs, SW is cheaper to fly with bags and carry on luggage.  On this trip, the flights pushed away from their gates on time or early, and we arrived at both locations ahead of schedule.  The seat size is pretty ordinary, and if you are  a tall or large person, it would be worth it to pay the fee to get into the ""A"" boarding group so you can select a bulkhead, aisle or emergency row seat.  Overall, the staff is very efficient and helpful, and the boarding process makes much more sense than other airlines.  Southwest has become our regular flight choice."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Typically above average, this flight was JUST average","Southwest is typically the best OVERALL airline I choose.  Direct flights with good pricing is what I initially look for followed closely by Customer service.My complaints for this return trip:1) Two broken suitcases at International terminal required an extreme amount of inconvenience to find the correct location to address the issue.  We were a group of 20, and I was not able to break from the group to address the bags.2) Almost 2 hours waiting for customs agents after arrival was not acceptable.  Not sure if this relates to Southwest, BUT it was a bad ending to our return flight home.3) Group travel only allows you to check in ONE at a time.  This process seems like it could be expedited better as it took almost 25 minutes with our entire group to get checked in.4) In Cancun, several foreign fliers were not able to comprehend the boarding process and were let to board with the A and B groups when they had C boarding status.  It made our boarding line a bit irate!I must give the flight attendants great respect as they showed a super good personality and humor throughout the trip!  The little things do make a difference!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Southwest is the best!!!!,"Can’t say enough about Southwest Airlines. I’ve always received excellent service and especially love NO CHARGE for luggage!  Everything from the ease of pre-check-in 24 hours before my flight to assistance, if needed, at baggage check-in, to customer service via the flight attendants, etc is great!  Will always try to fly Southwest if my destination allows for it!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Cancun - Atlanta 14 DEC 2019,"Easy check in and security in Cancun.  The passport readers at the kiosks didn't seem to be working so we used the desk to check in.  In Cancun, terminal 4, they don't post gates until about 60 minutes before departure, so you have to keep an eye on the boards when it gets towards that time.  Atlanta no longer has Mobile Passport available, but it does have Global Traveler.  Easy pick up and transfer of bags from international to domestic.  Kiosk check in for customs worked well, though being able to use Mobile Passport would have been quicker to clear customs."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"They hold my record for being on time, and have no problems.","We needed to get to Colmbus on business, and this was a short term notice for this trip. Southwest had the seats, the price was fair, and off we went. Return trip was great, on time and back in Tampa on schedule."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Good airline,Quick and easy in and out no problems slow in flight service.  Faster service would be nice on short trips.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,comfortable,"comfortable trip overall.  usual southwest customer oriented personnel.  Plane ride both ways very warm, so advise to remove any extra clothing such as coats or jackets and storing. The only reason for the 4 rating was that the auto checkin for A group not as effective as might be desired."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Vegas trip,"Good flight, on time, very attentive flight attendants and smooth landing. Both flights were full, service still good."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Not Pleased This Time with Southwest,"Not what I have come to expect from Southwest Airline.  After arriving at airport and checking in we were told there was a problem with our plane coming in fro Las Vegas and they were swapping it out and it would be making a stop in Salt Lake City, Utah and then onto Indy to pick us up to head to Ft. Lauderdale. This would delay our flight approx. 30 minutes.  OK, no problem right?  Well, more than 3 hours later and now well after midnight, a plane finally arrives in Indy to get us to Ft. Lauderdale. The Southwest desk attendant told us that instead of the plane coming in from Vegas like we were told when we checked in, they sent a plane that had come from Denver (snow storm) that had first gotten to Denver after coming in St. Paul Minnesota after being stranded there because of a snow storm.  WHY ON EARTH WOULD THEY SEND A PLANE FROM ONE SNOW STORM TO ANOTHER SNOW STORM A THOUSAND MILE AWAY AND THEN BACK TO THE MIDWEST BEFORE HEADING TO FLORIDA!!  We finally got to our hotel around 3:00 in the morning ( after having to pay $25.00 for taxi because FREE Hotel shuttle stopped at 1am).  All Southwest did was send an email the next day apologizing.  One would have thought they would have offered compensation or drink tickets or something..... very disappointing!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Another Reliable Southwest trip,"I always fly Southwest when I can.  I trust Southwest for being the most on-time, the nicest flight attendants and the most reliable."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,very pleased.,we were very pleased with both our flight out and our return flight. flight out was normal. on the return flight we had an attendant would had a great sense of humor and made the flight not boring. it was great. we would choose southwest everytime if they go where we go.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,I always fly Southwest,"Great prices, fast check in and NO baggage fees, EVEN for oversize bags!I  only wish the other airlines were not always ripping us off for EVERY FEE ""THEY"" COULD THINK OF."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Economical, on time, friendly","Southwest was all you could ask of an airlines in this day and age. Relatively low price, on time, relatively friendly and I got homeland my stuff flew for free.Their prices are not always the lowest, but when they are, I look forward to flying with them."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Family Trip,"My family and I checked in online later than I’d hoped, so I was a bit bummed about it. When I called my sister, however, she let me know Southwest let’s families with small children board just before the B group. I was thrilled! It worked out exactly that way, so my family got to sit together. The flight attendants on the GEG to DEN leg and the DEN to ATL leg interacted with my kids, so that was great. The only glitch in our trip was rude service from a lady in the baggage office when we couldn’t find an item. It was more than resolved when Southwest’s customer service intervened. Happy overall."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Not my Fav,"I was looking forward to our trip.  This was my first SW Airlines flight. Pro's:  pricing was good, flight schedule options were good, snacks were averageCon's:  I do NOT like the non assigned seating.  I didn't know that even though the seats were not assigned, you do get assigned a boarding order and that can present a lot of problems not only with where you sit but whether or not you can sit with the person you are flying with.    I also thought that compared to other airlines, the seats were too close together to be comfortable for most people."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great as always!,We did fly direct to minimize possible problems and everything was great. We always purchase the early bird so we can sit together and I’m really glad that it’s an option. I’ve really never had a problem flying Southwest. If your flight is delayed for some reason they let your connecting flight know that you’re coming. The other airlines I’ve flown don’t really seem to care if you make your connection or not.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,positive as always,"Purchasing the extra to get better in line position was worth it. The check in process was great. Not a regular traveler, the staff was most helpful!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great experience!,"Excellent flight and service -- landing and take off, terrific. No delays, no turbulence and flight crew was the best!The only issue we had was that the pier of departure had changed without an overhead announcement. We were running to catch our flight!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Bags fly free,"I always fly Southwest if at all possible.  I really appreciate the bags fly free aspect.  I hate the nickel and dime routine by many airlines.  You buy your ticket, check your bags and you are off to a relaxing vacation.  I really like the Southwest Cell phone app, makes getting your boarding pass easy even for old people like me (74).  The crew on the flight was especially friendly, but I have found that Southwest maintains friendly crews  everywhere I fly.  I highly recommend Southwest.  I have had flights with them in 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and on through the years."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Always delayed,"This is the 5th time I have flown from Tucson to Las Vegas and return, each time the flight has been delayed. I am not sure what issue southwest has with flight service to Tucson but I recommend passengers find another airline"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,GREAT VALUE - GREAT AIRLINE,"We have been flying Southwest Airlines for many years.  The value is excellent.  2 checked suitcases 50 lbs. each are free.  People refer to the boarding procedure as the ""cattle call"" but I don't think so.  We often book using Early Bird boarding and have always been able to get the seats we want and board within minutes of the time boarding begins.  Using the Southwest credit card we fly using points most of the time.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  From DC to Florida, California, Nevada, etc. we have flown with Southwest!"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,DELAYS going and coming,Flight leaving SAC was 1/2 hour late leaving so connecting flight was almost missed...had to run as they were holding.  Flight returning also delayed 1/2 hour so same...12 passengers has to run to connect in Burbank to SAC.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Wonderful,I have traced with Southwest airlines a few times over the years and if I'm traveling in the US the are my preferred Carrier. Every fight attendant have had wonderful personalities and seen to really enjoy their job. They have always been accomadating and never make you feel as if your putting them out.I love love to thank them for always making me feel like a valued customer.
Date of travel: June 2019,40,nice flight,It was a nice flight and we left on time. It was a real smooth flight all the way to Detroit Michigan
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Bowling trip,"I love Southwest Airlines! We always fly them when we have bowling tournaments, training etc! The service is always great and never have a flight issue!!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good experience,From check in to flight ending the representatives were very polite and helpful. This was a welcoming feeling after traveling for 20+  hours. The flight was smooth and relaxing.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,No Surprises with Value,"I love this Airline. It is not luxury but sure beats the hell out of UA and American wrt service and expectations. Ground staff and crew are friendly and willing to serve, unlike other carriers."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Pre Holiday present,real fast check in with baggage and going threw customs.  To many crying babies on the 5 hour trip !     the service from the flight attendant was great.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Worst airline,Check in very early but get the seat in the farthest back. Seat very tight. Flight is rough.Came to check in 3 hrs earlier but they open 2hrs earlier. Service desk terrible.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"First international flight with Southwest: On time, easy boarding",Typical Southwest flight - which is good. Flying internationally did not cause any additional issues. Beverage and snack service were as normal. Crew was great - as usual.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,I FLY SWA!,"I love flying this airlines. Flights are often on time or early. The flight attendants are generally fun, friendly and laid back."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,It was okay,"Booked this flight last minute due my grandmother's passing in November. Southwest had the most affordable return flight option on such short notice - only $99. (With Alaska, it was three times as much!) It was nice being able to pick my own seat. Paid $25 to have the early on boarding option. Plenty of over head cargo space for my two carry ons. Didn't eat any snacks due to food allergies. Attendant came by often to offer refreshments like water. Only complaint is that Southwest does NOT have usb chargers like most plane carriers do. Had to dig my portable charger out of my carry on to ensure my phone was charged."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Beware of possible changes,I booked non stop due to our age. One month prior the airline changed the itinerary and we had two additional stops. We were over 11 hours getting home and ruined our plans for the next day.
n/a,50,Best airline,"Smooth checkin and flight. Always friendly service from the check in counter to boarding, in flight service and baggage retrieval. I carry an extra large fishing rod holder that is accepted as on of my two checked bags. Have been doing this the last 5 years and never any damage to the fishing rods. The only airline we fly in the u.s."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Faster is better...but don't forget to slow down to smell the roses!,"This trip to Los Angeles, I decided tossing the car keys so I'd be ""refreshed"" for vacation, then I ordered South West Airlines tickets because they hadn't let me down whenever I did choose to fly. The vacation's only drag, was leaving home at O'Dark Thirty to catch flight 699 out of PDX, then I was seated comfortably at a window seat, also with an empty seat beside me. No delays, no drama, and after a short stop in San Jose, I'm up again, this time looking outside at the Channel Islands. Does this happen on every flight??? Afterwards, I caught a cat-nap then landed at LAX without incident. I feel so good I think I'll head to the beach and smell paradise!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Work Fun,"I love flying Southwest.  I love the fact they have several options for straight thru flights.  Bonus, you get 2 checked bags for free :)."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delayed flight but smooth flight,Our flight was delayed two hours but the service was great as usual. From the time we checked in until deboarding the plane it was great.  We drive past IAH to Hobby airport due to the great service Southwest provides.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Excellent Experience, Quality Service for Thanksgiving 2019",We travel for leisure purposes at least four times a year. When available our airline of choice is Southwest. The fares are the cheapest without extra charges for seats or baggage. Most of the time the plane leaves on time or early. We often arrive early. The baggage claim is fast. The seats are more comfortable than other airlines. The agents at check in and at the gate have always been friendly and helpful. Customer service at baggage claim and on the telephone have always been friendly and helpful when we needed it. Our last trip was for Thanksgiving with family and friends in metro DC. It was an excellent experience.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Leisure Trip,Southwest Airlines is the best. The staff from the time you enter your gate area until you exit your flight is nothing but courteous and kind. Live this airline!!!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,fly to jamaica,from start to finish non-stop flight no problems the staff was pleasent efficent and really nice people
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent trip to TEXAS and New Mexico !!!,"We took our annual Winter trip for the season and we chose South West Airlines again to get us there.  We flew into Houston ( Hobby ) and actually got there early.  That helped us get to our rental car area early and get the car we wanted ahead of all of the other people.  Great trip for two week and ended up in Alb, NM and flew out of their airport ( sunport ) and we got home early again and were able to beat the crowds.  5 star service and crew, we highly recommend this airline."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Travel,Excellent service. The flight was smooth and superb. The staff were super friendly and they made us feel at home. Great experience overall.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Archaic Way to Fly,"First time flying Southwest Airlines and now completely understand why flights are cheap and bags are free. These are the only perks that keep them in business and, frankly not enough to get another dime from me. Can't select your seats...not that big a deal. Pay the extra for early bird seating...problem solved (not). Have groups A,B, and C all board a bus and shuttle out to the plane on the runway so that when the bus doors open, there is a mad dash to the stairs...absolute insanity. Have seen acts of war that were more civilized. For a moment, we actually considered walking the other way. Will NEVER EVER fly Southwest Airlines again even if the flights are free."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,The Best Airline,"Southwest is the best airline to fly. We made from Oklahoma City to Washington in 2 hours. The straight thru flight was awesome. The Crew and Airline Attendants were great! Love their Frequent Flyer Program, Rapid Rewards!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Friendly airline!,"Really friendly people. The people in DEN were the least friendly, but all the staff on the airplane and at CVG Rocked! They streamlined the boarding process by having people board in order, so there was no squeezing into another section. They also have the beverage and snacks process down really well."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Never lets me down,Great crew. Southwest is by far the best airline to fly.  Never an issue. We fly several times a year to Vegas for R &R and always pick Southwest for their service. Will Definitely fly with Southwest in 2020. This airline never lets me down.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Only one thing could make Southwest Better,I routinely fly Southwest and with health issues this was the first time I requested wheel chair assistance to get from the terminal to the gate and I was not disappointed.  The flight attendants are always wonderful and this flight was no exception.  I love the sense of humor they have in addition to their professionalism.  The only thing that could make a trip better is being able to choose seating but now needing assistance I do get to be seated before I would normally be seated.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Better than others!,3 flights to get home but still....except for NO FOOD to speak of.....good flight.Have all kinds of wifi available but NO PORTS to charge your electronics.  BIG oversight.Free bag check!No change fees!Can check in 24 hours early to try to get early boarding so you can sit together with spouse.  Not available on other planes any more!!!!!
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Improvement made,"I flew on the Monday before Thanksgiving.  All the flights were full.  My flight was direct, but other passengers had to make connections.  Our plane had to make an emergency landing due to a cracked windshield. The pilot, crew, and passengers reacted calmly as we made our speedy descent into Houston.  Upon landing we were directed to a close gate for us to continue to our destination and Southwest held the other flights so that those making connections could get where they were going.  They did the best they could for the passengers, a major improvement over similar incidents in the past."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,GREAT!!!!!!!!!,Everything was on time ran smooth no issues even with the bad weather staff were nice  and funny 1 (FA) Had a lot of jokes.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,smooth flying,"The stewards are always very nice and friendly, I travel Southwest most of the time when I go to Fl."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest always makes my flight relaxing. They are there to help at every turn and we usually arrive early.,"Bags fly free if you have 2 under 50 lb. each. Snacks and complimentary beverages made the flight go by quickly. Free WI-FI on our flight allowed me to text during the flight with no additional charge. Seats are comfortable and leg room was adequate. Flight crew was polite and available during the flight. Boarding was orderly even though there is no assigned seating on Southwest. Getting there safely and on time is my priority, which is why I always try to fly Southwest Airlines."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always Great,Always happy to fly with Southwest. My family flys on Southwest whenever possible. Have never been disappointed by this airline.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest,"I have flown Southwest for many, many years and in all the years that I have flown, I have never REALLY had any issues...when I look to fly I do ALWAYS check S/W first before I look at other airlines - I know I will always fly S/W"
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Great Flight,"I always fly SWA and haven't experienced any problems.  I love the fact that my bags fly free, since I usually travel with two pieces."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Wonderful Experience as usual..,"My experience with Southwest as usual is fantastic.  I have yet to have any problems or bad encounter with this airline.  Every time i take them, it is always a memorable experience.  If l had my way, l would fly them all the time, but they can get expensive at times.Overall a fabulous airline.  Friendly staff and SMOOTH air transition, including landing the land.  Go Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always a pleasure,Flights were on time and staff was friendly and helpful!  Baggage claim moved along quite quickly; there were absolutely no issues with this trip.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Celebrating my wife’s retirement!,"We flew Southwest to Las Vegas in early November. The flight was relatively full. We were fortunate enough to have the middle seat unoccupied. The flight attendants were extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I have the Chase Southwest credit card and used points to pay for the flight. My wife and have only flown one other airlines and that was to Alaska. I would encourage everyone to register for a  frequent flyers account. Southwest has free WiFi on certain planes, so make sure the flight you book has WiFi available."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Disability assistance,"We traveled w our disabled adult son and while getting to the gate was difficult 3/4 times, once we were there the SW gate folks were awesome. ( at both ends of the outbound trip we could not get assistance to the gate though a supervisor, Cesar, finally stepped in on the LV end and was VERY helpful. On return to BWI we were again told no one was available. This was not SW fault as it’s a contractor for the airport which provides the service)We entered the info re disability needs when we reserved and were able to sit in the first bulkhead row. This made getting him on & off so much easier. We gate Checked his manual w/c and kept thefootrests in a bag in the overhead bin. The usual too small seats etc still apply but the assistance was great. Thanks!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Family Wedding Trip,"Las Vegas to San Diego left a little late, arrived on time.  Return flight was on time departing and arriving in LV"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Vacation,Full Flight but it was nice; Need more legroom; better variety of snacks; movie availabitiy would be nice.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,My Go-To airline,"Southwest has direct flights to most of the places I wish to travel.  I very rarely get bumped and only then voluntarily.  Most of the flight crew are helpful, friendly and attentive. Of course about 20% are just phoning it in and can't wait to get home.  I try to cut them slack since everyone has a bad day. I can put up with a few less than helpful staff to get the free bags."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always a great flight on Southwest!,Treated my wife to a short 3 day and 2 night trip to Vegas. Only about an hour flight both ways between Vegas and Phoenix. No problems at all!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Very good flight—enjoyed one of the staff he was very humorous—got into Austin 10 minutes early.,I fly Southwest as often as I can their fares are reasonable and no baggage fee-2free suitcases and a carry on. Service is great and very efficient. They have a wonderful cancellation and change policy. I only take other airlines if SW doesn’t go where I am going. Also their points never expire like other airlines. I wish they flew to where I am going this winter —south west coast of Mexico.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Easy Flight.,It was a way too early flight at 0600.  But it was a direct flight to ATL so I got in early.  As early as it was the crew was super nice.  I really like the SWA does it in loading the plane.  Its as fast as possible with people carrying way too much as carry-on items.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,The most uncomfortable flight...,Southwest is an affordable and convenient airline but there seats are so cramped and uncomfortable. I won't fly Southwest unless my husband is with me so I can lean on him. I don't like touching strangers and you can't help it flying on Southwest. I did appreciate the drink coupons I received from a previous flight. Since in-flight entertainment and wi-fi wasn't available on this flight. The drinks came in handy on this last flight. The drinks eased my discomfort.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Get there for less!,"SWA will get you there, safely and for less.  Southwest continues to provide many options at a competitive price."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Friendly and comfortable,"I love Southwest Airlines for a number of reasons, especially two bags free, but this flight was particularly special.  Everyone is always so friendly from check-in to deplaning.  What really put it over the top was one of the flight attendants singing a Southwest Airlines version of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer just prior to landing.  She had a beautiful voice and the lyrics were, of course, very funny.  It's nice to get a fun surprise like that on a trip.  Thank you, Southwest!!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,It's a flight.,"Always fly Southwest, first time I can say our stewardess was in a bad mood.  What's up with only Miller Lite!?!?  Bad decision."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,International Flight ,We only fly Southwest they are the best airlines by far as my husband and I feel. 2 bags fly free. I fly at least every other month and then some.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Ms Brenda Hill,"I could have driven to the party in Phoenix from San Diego. Instead I relaxed on Southwest. So easy, and reasonable. Flights are on time, bags free and never lost, and a competent staff. Each time. And now they fly to Mexico. No wonder Southwest is consistently successful."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight crew dispositions top notch!,"Although I have flown 28+ years with USDA on several other airlines, truthfully I find no better accommodations that those I take advantage of on a personal link with my fave vacation carrier Southwest. I told my stewardess when boarding flight that this r/t I was accompanied by my BCC 17yoa foster son, Johnl.  She gave him a S/W token of appreciation & let him meet our captain in cockpit < the takeoff.  He will never forget his thrill of sharing 1st ✈️ Flight with my fave airline Southwest!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love Southwest,"Love flying Southwest.  Fares are affordable, and Southwest has the most lienient change/cancellation policies in the industry,"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Southwest will steal your money !,"I’m typically not one to do this. But I am very aggravated with Southwest AirlinesMy friends and I were on the plane headed to our cruise in Mexico about a month ago, something went wrong with the plane (which we were understanding because things like this happen that are out of anybody’s control) Southwest customer service was not helpful AT ALL in helping us trying to figure out how to get to our next destination. They kept ignoring us and promising us multiple vouchers while we were at the airport (that we have yet to receive) We took matters into our own hands, and at this point we had to figure out another way to get to Mexico through a different airline. Southwest promised us a refund, & vouchers (probably hoping to keep our mouth shut) but it’s been a month now & we haven’t received a single thing from them. Altogether my friends and I spent $5,000 or more that weekend because of Southwest and they can’t even give us a $75 refund for our flight. Never flying through Southwest Airlines again"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,My go to airline,"Awesome flight both to and from Kansas City. Going out we were delayed because of fog, but as we were headed to Vegas, who cared. Crew were as usual helpful and professional. Thank you SW for never disapointing."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Southwest Is the Best,"For under $100 I flew to Reno and back with two pieces of checked luggage! Had a great flight. My one complaint would be that due to their method of boarding in groups A, B, and C numbers 1-60 in each, i felt like the SW Gate person should check that people are lined up in the correct order. I was B 20 and B43 was in front of me and I did not feel it was my place to tell him to get where he belonged.😜"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Ok,Flight was on time. Service was good. Wish had a better system on seating chart but overall th is experience was ok.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Visit to Arizona,"This was our first time flying with Southwest and we had a hassle free, wonderful experience. With this airline we were not assigned seats but it was first come /first serve based on when you checked in.  Easy bag check-in. Pleasant employees at counter. Very clean and updated seating in plane. Flight attendants were awesome. Witnessed a passenger being verbally abusive to another passenger. The attendant stepped in and handled the situation in a diplomatic but firm manner."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Love southwest,We always try to fly southwest. They still cater to the customers unlike some other airlines. I always recommend my friends to fly southwest.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Smithsonian African American History and Cultural Museum,"The flight was what you expect from SouthWest: bare bones, no frills, gets-you-there-on-time. The Smithsonians never disappoint. The newest, the African-American History Museum is another shining example of ""the peoples'"" museums. Because your tax dollars pay for them entrance is free. Allow 2 days to see everything."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Over all very good flights,"Overall a no hassle, on time, uneventful flight with courteous and friendly employees. Liked that there was no extra charge for checked baggages as I use a medical device that uses distilled water which cannot be taken into the cabin. That said there were some management related issues:- Snacks were full of salt and unhealthy to eat. I opted out.- Seating was crowded; 6 seats per row w/ narrow center aisle on a 737.- Flight crew was somewhat frantic as no carts were allowed for them and it was a somewhat short flight which mean they were constantly running up and down the aisle for service. However this was not their fault and did their very best with the resources available to them.- WiFi connection was somewhat flaky and limited in connections and could not be established with an active VPN which compromises personal security.One of the unfortunate outcomes of the seating arrangements is that a morbidly obese person selected a center seat next to me making for a somewhat uncomfortably flight on the last inbound leg to DAL. However this was not the fault of the crew but of management with their 6 across seating arrangement resulting in narrow width seating along with no assigned seating. That said overall I was very satisfied with my flights as they were better than expected."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Medical emergency mid air with well trained employees,"This was a very friendly comfortable flight.  We had a medical emergency on our flight and the stewardess were extremely professional, kind and knowledgable to everyone on the flight and especially to the ill gentleman.  They asked us very kindly to wait so they could get the ill passenger off first and completed us on the ability for the paramedics to do what they needed to do.  I highly recommend this airline."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,On time!,"Nice smooth flight that left a few minutes late but arrived on time. Service was excellent, Flight Stewards were friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,No Frills_No Thrills!,"Yes you get a small bag of pretzels on most flights plus free non-alcoholic drinks. Great pricing if you book well in advance. Flight attendants go through the motions but provide service. Most do not seem to happy, however, do their jobs. I feel very comfortable with the Pilots ability to get me from point A to point B, safely. I have been on dozens and dozens of Southwest flights with only one flight where many passengers were slightly nervous but the Pilots provided a great safe landing with everyone cheering when it was over. Blizzard conditions, BWI closed so no place to land then diverted to Norfolk, VA to land in 60 mile per hour winds. Southwest has seasoned Pilots. This was the thrill I never want to experience again. The only one with Southwest. Plus two checked bags for free. Southwest is my favorite Airlines to travel on. They are the best deal in the Air. Bring your lunch or dinner an snacks on longer flights. Now they have internet service so get their app. I just watch the Sunday Night Football game live. They offer Live TV, Movies and Music. Not bad for free. Personally, I skip the work to just relax. When It comes to traveling by air I care mostly about safety. They have a great record."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love Southwest,I love to fly southwest because most of the time the fly is on time and the teem members are always helpful loving and caring.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Like the airlines,"We fly Frontier and Southwest between Charleston, SC and Denver CO because they offer non stop service.  Southwest is often very close in price to Frontier and allows 2 free bags, reclining seats without paying any upgrade fee and offer food for sale on board.  ."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Even though there is no seat assignment usually not a problem.,"This was a non-stop, the biggest incentive!!!    Glad they have senior rates...SWA doesn't compete as well on routes comparing w/other airlines...I would fly them more often if they did."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight from Corpus Christi to Las Vegas,"The flight from Corpus Christi was ok.  It is a quick flight to Houston where there is a layover because few airlines fly from Corpus Christi.  The airline attendant was tacky and rude.  I ordered a Bailey's up (using my Southwest drink coupon) and a sparkling water.  When she brought the Bailley's it was on ice, so I sent it back once I got her attention again. She refused to bring the sparkling water, even when requested a second time.  She came by to ask if I still had the Bailey's bottle and when I told her I never got the sparkling water and she just repeated her question.  The pilot made comments as if they were doing us a favor to fly to Corpus Christi as if the flight was free and there was not a higher rate for a short distance.  I have ALWAYS supported flying out of Corpus Christi.  Next time I will drive to Houston or San Antonio to fly out and may not fly Southwest due to their attitude towards Corpus Christi.  We might live on the edge of the earth, but we know how to create choices that are less expensive.  The flight from Houston to Las Vegas was good without negative comments and the return flight was ok."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Reasonable price for nice non-stop flight with 2 checked bags,"Southwest airlines has easy to check baggage locations with curbside check in available at both Austin and El Paso airports.  Direct non-stop flights are available.  The check in process is easy on line, however there is no assigned seats.  Southwest seats are first to board, first to pick seats.  Travelling with young children was a plus as we got to board after the A groups of people (before B groups), and therefore able to get a row of seats that had a window, middle and aisle seat together for the 3 people travelling towards the back of the plane."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Going  to Disney,Had a good  flight  it was smooth the service  was  good  the airline  attendants were  very  nice  and  helpful  going  in  and out of  airports  was very  smooth  and pleasant  it is a learning  experience  when  people  go to bigger  airports  with  shuttles  but overall  it was  very  enjoyable
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight to Raleigh,"Love SW, boarding is so much easier than the others.  Cheerful crew and very helpful.  My Flights have been generally on time.  No complaints."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Found my new drink- non alcoholic,Got the same fun and funny crew for both legs of our flight. He told us about a drink he likes and we had it on both flights.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Delayed due to weather....but great team.,"My flight was delayed going toGL, but it was not the fault of the airline, but when we arrived,  the weather was absolutely wonderful!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,A Star in the sky,Flying from Atlanta to Columbus was beyond words. Southwest continues to give exceptional service from the ticket counter to your plane to your destination. They are remarkable as to the way they make you feel valued as a customer. Kudos!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great airline!!,"Southwest is my usual airline. They are the cheapest, but also the best. They are the most entertaining and friendliest that I have experienced. Larger size passengers fit well and they dont bat an eye if you need an extender."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Friendly, Helpful, Inexpensive","Haven't flown in years and numerous Southwest employees were very helpful. Also appreciated extra legroom that I didn't have to pay extra for. First time with Southwest, now every time with Southwest!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Everything you expect!,"Paid the money to board early, even though I think $40 is ridiculous! When it is 20 minutes before the flight it should be cheaper!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy and inexpensive,I used some of my accrued points to fly absolutely free (plus Taxes). What an easy airline to deal with.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Phoenix to Chicago,We flew back to Chicago and all went well.  The flight wasn't fully booked - so it made for a little more comfortable flight.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,All went smoothly,Our flight went very smoothly.  Boarding began on time and we took off and landed on time.  We had a humorous flight attendant that made the flight more entertaining.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Stress Free Flying,"Southwest is my favorite airline to fly.  Great customer service and you can easily reach them by phone.  Their no penalty for changing tickets and no cost luggage is great. I always purchase the precheck in, which is well worth the money since there are no assigned seats."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Halloween Vacation,Southwest airlines personnel were prompt and polite. We moved through security smoothly. Our flight departed and arrived on schedule. It was a smooth ride with minimal turbulence. The plane was clean and comfortable.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Flight to Atlanta, GA",Flying SW is always a great experience. I always require wheelchair assistance and they are very accommodating.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Convenient flight friendly service,"The flight to and from Boise Id. was on time and although there was a change of planes, the layover time was minimal. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,no suprises,"Best airline by far, best prices, best staff and usually always on time.  The flights are almost always 100% booked."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,SW connects OC and Oakland,Great way to catch a game or event in Oakland if you live in OC.  Quick and easy trip up and back!  Even same day travel is easy.  The only downside is the flight is only 1 hr so no beverage service and no in-flight movies.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Golden Wings,"Sourhwest Airlines is an excellent airline to fly. First off, if you use the app, the process is very simple to navigate. Boarding passes are issued when you respond to the app 24 hours before flight. When entering aircraft, seats are not assigned, it is first board first serve! Staff is friendly and very helpful!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Family trip,Absolutely love southwest. If I ever have an issue they help resolve it immediately. Their passenger of size policy is a life saver and I never feel awkward asking because they make it so easy. The no change fees are wonderful as well when plans change.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great inexpensive airline that gets you where you want to.,"Southwest is the bomb! I've been flying with them for many years and never have been delayed or had lost luggage and etc. Sure it's no frills, or fancy eats, but it gets you where you want to go, and on time and free wifi for movies and etc. The flight attendants are always friendly and accommodating. Truth be told at first I wasn't a big fan of SW, but they have won me over with their promptness and professionalism. However The San Diego International airport sucks. Which is the only downside of flying Southwest for me. For an International airport it leaves much to be desired. Small crowded waiting areas, not too many choices of places to eat or drink. They really need to step up their game. However no matter how lame the SD airport is, I will always fly Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Airline,I visit the US every year and Southwest is my airline of choice when I get here because their prices are very reasonable and you get 2 checked bags free. My recent return flight from Vegas to Denver was on time as usual and inflight service is always friendly. Their website is easy to use and there are no fees to change your flights if necessary. I also love the curb side checkin which we don’t have in Australia as it saves time.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Family visit,"From the ease in booking online to boarding, Southwest Airline is the best. I never have any issues with this airline. The staff is always accommodating and friendly. Some of the stewardesses put a little comedy in it and we all have a good laugh. I love the way they put all the passengers at ease and greet everyone when boarding and departing the plane. I would recommend Southwest Airline  to every destination they serve. ❤️"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Edgie40,Flew from Buffalo to LasVegas and this was one of the best flights time wise and service. Great service by the crew and nice communication on board. Coming into Vegas was a little windy but we had an excellent pilot who was able to make one of the smoothest landing. Leaving Vegas was also a good flight along with an excellent crew and pilot .Not liking to see fees going up during holiday travel and wish the airlines would’ve been more accommodating than gouging the public. One other thing  I noticed the pre boarding of disable better than 20 and when we landed only 5 needed assistance another miracle fight by Southwest.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,well cared for,I was able to get on an earlier flight due to an emergency with no additional charge. It was a rough flight and we were well informed by the cabin crew when turbulence was coming. My only beef with Southwest is they allow one person in a party of two or three to save seats
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Airline,Excellent flight with both on time & a little early (round trip). Service was great on board. Flight personnel were very good.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Just a traveling guy headed to NOLA,"Southwest did a great job again in getting us to our destination without a problem and on time.  Plane was clean, flight attendees did a great job."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always a pleasant experience,"So I've been flying Southwest for a while (Rapid Rewards member since 2013) and the experience is always pleasant.  They have been late several times but it is communicated promptly, which I appreciate.  They're always apologetic about it and they try to make it to your destination close to your original scheduled ETA.  The flight attendants are very courteous except for one, but that could also just be the way she talks, who knows?  Overall, can't complain about their service but I wish there's a direct flight to SLC.  I find the layovers unnecessary since the plane would go south then back north, which does not make sense at all."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Long Wait,"First time ever, my flight was cancelled due to weather in Vegas. Long 4.5 hour wait in airport for next available flight☹️"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving with Family,"Round trip direct flight was comfortable, on time and pleasant staff.  I can’t have wheat or gluten, so I could not have their snacks. Only wish there were other options. Love Southwest luggage and boarding policies, as it makes boarding so easy and economical. I always look for Southwest flights first."
n/a,50,Fast and efficient ,We try to use Southwest Airlines for all our domestic flights as a quick and effective way of getting to our destinations. They have a great direct flight to Orlando that always seems to arrive on time and a fast one stop to the West coast.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Smooth Flight,"Short but very comfortable flight. All accommodations were very well attended. Took a road trip to Washington from Atlanta with a friend to visit her family and also my family who lives close by, but had to take a flight back home to Atlanta. I was very pleased with the price of my flight and the friendly and helpful service I received with  Southwest. I'm a fan!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest Houston to Las Vegas,"Some people don't care for the process by which SWA boards and seats passengers but I like it. It is simple, not complicated, no assigned seating and the rewards program is great. I'm not a big complainer and require very little in regards to luxury or comfort accommodations. I don't fly a lot so it's even better that I can fly out of Hobby as it is a much smaller airport than Bush."
n/a,50,I really like SWA,"I have flown United,  American,  and Southwest.  Nothing against United and American,  but I have had a great experience with Southwest everytime!!! Once, maybe twice United had a better fare. But Southwest is the way to go!!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest is the only way to fly!!,"I love Southwest Airlines. First two bags are free. Plus, you can bring two items on the plane with you.  The flight attendants are friendly and helpful. One of the flight attendants was humorous. She put everyone in a good mood when they came on the plane. She was holding bags of peanuts and asked everyone if they wanted  a FREE dinner, then gave them a pack. If they said no, she jokingly said dinner is free now, if I have to get your dinner to you later you will have to pay. Everyone laughed as she welcomed them on the plane. We were in the front of the plane and laughed every time. The other attendants were also happy and funny. We need more flight attendants like that crew!  People become grumpy waiting to get on any plane. Southwest is our way to fly if we can. If they don't go to a place we want to go to, we sometimes drive there or just don't go. Way to go Southwest...you are the way to fly."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,all good,"Our flight was fine, going to Dallas we had a stop in San Jose, return trip was direct to Seattle. Only got to sit by my wife on the flight from San Jose to Dallas.But everything went as expected."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,The pilot sang to us before takeoff!,"Clean cabin, helpful friendly flight attendants. Captain kept us updated on what was going on (turbulence, why we were changing altitude, etc). Baggage goes free! Yay!  I like their check in policy-first come first serve and you pick your seat. Have flown Southwest numerous times and I know what to expect; has always been an outstanding experience."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Weekend in Las Vegas,"On time, two free bags, pleasant staff/crew. Direct flight was a plus. It was a short flight of about 2 1/2 hours. Snacks and prompt beverage service"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,business as usual,"a great constant with Southwest airlines is once you know the drill things operate the same every time.  We experienced no hassles, no delays and the usual friendly staff at Southwest.  when possible this is our go to airline because of the dependability!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,All airlines should be like Southwest,"The hard part in flying with Southwest is not the airline, but the endless construction at LaGuardia airport in Queens NY. After dropping a car rental at National Car rental, the lengthy ride from National's shuttle and transfer to a NYC shuttle bus  to the airport. Once through TSA, the wait and boarding was a breeze. Flight was uneventful, comfortable and quiet. I love SW for it's policies, suitcase allowance (2) and they don't nickel and dime you like all of their competitors"
Date of travel: May 2019,50,"I use Southwest often, one reason being no charge for your luggage","Having never flown to Sacramento I didn't know what to expect.  The flight was good,just under two hours.It was easy to find my way around the airport.  My ride to the hotel went smoothly.My trip was for my grand daughter's HS Graduation."
Date of travel: January 2019,20,"Terrible Customer Service, and ripped me off $300","I have never had such an awful customer service experience as I had with southwest. I used southwest gift cards to pay for a flight for my mom, and come to find out we had to pay $300 (that was paid for by the giftcards when we booked) at the airport. Customer service was no help simply stating that they couldn't accept them (even after we paid), and that it was ""okay"" because we could just pay the difference at the airport. The cattle call style boarding process is stressful and unnecessary - I especially don't like not knowing where I am going to be sitting. The actual seats were fine, and a little more comfortable than competitors. Southwest offers all the extras for free... which is nice, but ends up being a pricier ticket. Overall, though, I will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Flying to Chicago.,"I fly to Chicago at least one time a year to visit family.and visit some of the great reastruants in the city,and see some old friends that I grew up with,and talk about old times."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good airlines,"We mostly use Southwest due to the points that my wife and I have. Most flights are on time but as with all the other airlines they can have delays and/or cancellations. We travel with a motorized wheelchair for my wife, we’ve had no problems until this last flight. When we arrived at Fort Myers her chair was totally damaged (it’s value is over $2300.) The airlines took responsibility for the damage since it was inspected in Philadelphia by one of their staff. We are thankful that they have replaced it with a new one and have provided my wife with a loaner until her new chair arrives. Overall I like Southwest."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,SWA Houston to Denver,"We frequently fly Southwest for our family travel and always feel the flight is a good value.  One of the big pluses is the two bags fly free, this saves us $50-70 each leg.  Lots of people feel the no assigned seating is bad but most of the time we are able to select good seats that are not at the back of the plane or even single center seats.  We also find that SWA flight attendants are friendlier than most other airlines, on average."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Turkey Travel,"Bag drop was uneventful, going through security pretty smooth, over all airport was good. Boarding flight smooth, drinks & snack fine, waiting on bags always a slight delay. Traveling during high season ok"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Boston for the game,As usual the flight to and from Boston was very good. No delays. Early flights so almost every one was asleep. Can't say any more than service was very good.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest Flight,I always fly Southwest. I only wish I could upgrade to a first class situation. For my leg room. I enjoy the rewards program and how there are no black out periods.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,A great flight with great service!,We had a great experience with Southwest. Their employees were super friendly and helpful. We traveled with our dog and the staff at Southwest was super helpful in making our trip smooth. Plus we got 2 bags for FREE!!!!!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best price,You can receive the best price from BWI on Southwest. First BAGS  FLY FREE.  You can receive your boarding pass 24 hours in advance or pay extra to insure you receive a priority boarding place before most. Always great service a tht e gate and on board for the flight.
n/a,50,The Best Airline,"We love Southwest Airlines because they have great rates, 2 bags fly free, and the have exceptional service. They also have a great Rewards program. On a recent flight to Fort Lauderdale I booked 6 months out and then monitored the prices as we got closer to our departure. When I found our flight cheaper, I called SW and they made the adjustment (with no fee) and I was given a credit to use on a future flight. That is great customer service."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,great flight,"every time we fly southwest, we have never had a problem.  everyone is courteous & helpful.  in fact, every flight that we have been on has left on time or landed on time.  i would call that a good record."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great rates and great experience,"My wife and I flew home to visit family for a few days, we chose Southwest because on the days we were flying they were the cheapest. We will continue to fly them because we were very impressed with their service, friendliness and their price."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Really Good Experience,I needed help with my disabled aunt to check in. Southwest employee jumped in and took care of us. We needed a new crew while stopped over in Oakland and that made us late to our final destination. Everybody got $100 voucher for another flight. I'm using that next week to go to Phoenix.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,December trip,"As usual, Southwest provided the expected perfect service.  No problems from start to finish!  Always my travel choice!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,vacation,great flight going out. little bumpy coming back but that was due to clouds. we like flying southwest.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Reliable service,"On time, pleasant and efficient ground and crew personnel. Southwest is often running late but they make the wait as comfortable as possible under the circumstances. The flight crew ia always friendly and efficient."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,The only airline for us!,"Southwest does not charge for bags which is a real plus for us. They also board in ""groups"" (A, B, C, etc.) so seat selection is more open and flexible than other airlines. They have a 24 hour online check in period. In order to get the best group, you will need to check in EXACTLY 24 hours before your flight. This is a little painful (especially if you forget). Like most airlines these days, their on-board service is horrible. A little bit to drink and something like a micro-bag of pretzels. Their in-fight entertainment is - of course - based on WiFi so it can be a little sketchy. Overall though, this is a great airline to fly!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Direct flight from Louisville to Orlando,"Flight for family of 8 was on time with excellent service.  Southwest never disappoints me.  With young children along, it is always reassuring to know your flight will be on time."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Short Time in the Air,"To enjoy your flight from Houston to New Orleans, be prepared. It is a short flight (less than an hour). Consider bringing your water, soft drink or coffee on-board. The in-flight service is very short. Have FUN in New Orleans!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Always a Pleasure,Outside of all the kids that be on these flights I always have a pleasant experience when flyinf with southwest.
Date of travel: April 2019,40,""" TRANSFARENCY  of South West Endorsed ""","For Asian tourists carrying extra check in baggage, South west airlines is the best option to travel within USA. They allow two check in bags and reschedulement of flight with no penalty. Of course one has to pay the fare difference if there is an increase. This is a great help to tourists to have flexibility for travel itenraries. Besides flight from Sacramento to Phoenix, we had taken flights from Austin to Scramento and Phoenix to Austin. All flights were on time. That was a great help to us as we were first time travellers within states of Texas, California and Arizona."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Good flight, good service","Southwest is my go-to airline when traveling to Chicago. Their non-stop flights are timed perfectly, and are almost always on time. Flight attendants are personable and helpful, which makes the flight much more pleasant."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,Recently flew to ft Lauderdale from Pittsburgh. It was easy to book check in. It’s one of the few direct flights. Good customer service all around.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Service and Relaxation,"Easing booking, comfortablity, service, and friendly smiles is what you get when you fly SW. also you some really fun and enjoyable staff on  your flight. SW is # one in my book. Good Job Gary and crew."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest to Aruba,"What a phenomenal trip!  I've never been crazy about flying without an assigned seat but the trip from FLL to Aruba was fast (only 2 1/2 hours), nonstop, pleasant atmosphere and on-time!!!!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Almost perfect but not quite,"Southwest does a lot of things right. There's more legroom than Jet Blue where you can only be comfortable if you pay for it.The employees are always pleasant and sometimes downright funny. They are almost always on time or close to it.I know a lot of Southwest customers will agree with me that, because of their boarding policies, they have created a situation where many people ""need"" a wheelchair to board. Now, I don't mind the wait for people who legitimately have issues that require a wheelchair even if that issue is temporary. What I DO mind is the ""Miracle of Flight"" wherein half or more of those who used wheelchairs to get on the plane don't need them to get off. But, by reason of having gotten on first, they've gotten all the up front seats and can also be FIRST off.Many airlines have a policy that, if you get on in a wheelchair, you must wait until everyone else is off and take a chair as your exit mode of transportation. I don't mind having number A37 on line. The problem is that it's actually more like A90. Let's not forget that, if the person in the chair is traveling with someone, they can get on at the same time. If you do the math, 40 wheelchairs (I've seen as many as 44,) possibly 40 more people.If Southwest would only tighten up the rules, things would be much more pleasant on the boarding lines and we'd have to find another topic of conversation because this one's been beaten to death."
n/a,40,Southwest ORF to ATL Experience,"Grabbed a reasonably priced (for short notice, $268 + $15 for early bird check-in) online tic purchase to ATL (through BWI) to pick up a veh I purchased online. While ""open seating"" isn't for everyone, I find giving up that ""pro"" for a slightly cheaper ticket I don't mine. Plus, as airline employees go and the many challenges that can lead to not so ""user friendly"" interactions & customer experiences, I find the Southwest Airlines staff to be light-hearted, relaxed and at-ease conducting their jobs. Makes your travel experience less tense, especially with all the other things that can make for a stressful travel experience."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great airline,Have always used Southwest Airlines for previous travels.  Flights are on time.Staff was always friendly.  Planes have more leg room and seat space than other airlines.  Prices most of the time are excellent.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight and service,"Once again we used Southwest for a vacation flight.  This time to Aruba.  The service was great and all the Southwest employees were extremely professional.  Plenty of room in the seats, very clean and comfortable.  Will try to use Southwest for all of our travel needs."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,A few updates would be helpful,"Given the cost-benefir ratio, I will continue to fly SWA due to the number of flights offered and the discounts. However, I would like management to consider two issues.First, you currently have no GF option on snacks. I do bring my own, but have been very disappointed since you nixed the peanuts a couple of years ago. Perhaps a simple potato chip for those of us who cannot eat your pretzels or crackers? More importantly, I think it's time to reconsider the carry on allowance. The extra time taken for flight attendants or other passengers to place larger items in the bins for people who cannot do so themselves is excessive, but it is REALLY bad when disembarking. Honestly, maybe they should be required to check bags if they cannot place them in the overhead compartments themselves, like the rest of us do. I figure SW will sooner or later begin to charge for carry-ons, which would solve the problem. But until you do, please think about the inconvenience this causes to other passengers who need to deplane quickly."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Non-Stop Flight!,"I was going home to Chicago after the Thanksgiving holiday and after having a very delayed flight in coming to Dallas because of weather, it was so nice that this flight was on time. In fact we were able to arrive early! Southwest people are always friendly and helpful. Being able to check bags free and have a carry on as well is wonderful. Southwest is the best!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fabulous,"We flew our children in from all over the country for the holiday. Four out of six of them came in on Southwest Airlines. All we heard of on the news for days were delay after delay and cancelled flights. Our children all arrived on time, one even early than projected. Our flight back to RSW arrived half an hour early. Out of ten flights only one was delayed leaving on the busiest travel day of the year. We were informed immediately via text message and we were kept up to date on the flights status in real time. Thank you to Southwest for the services you provided that allowed our family to be together for the holiday. The staff is always great. The planes are always clean and delays are at a minimum."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,We always fly Southwest Airlines,"Wherever we fly to, we always fly Southwest Airlines.  Baggage is free, the plane is roomy, all the attendants are very helpful.  We have flown other airlines, and are never as pleased or comfortable as we have always been with Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Hunting for warmer weather,Perfect flight as always .. flight attendants were efficient and very funny .. caught the attention of the passengers with their amusing but necessary instructions ..
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Airline,"Great airline, attendants and on time.  Attentive, funny a total pleasure to fly with Southwest.  I buy the early boarding so that I can chose my seat for what I enjoy and prefer when flying.   Plus I love the free drink tickets.  Can't beat that."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,flight oto Atlanta,Very good flight. On schedule. Check in was good.employees very very helpful. Leave time in Atlanta for train. fair amount of walk time and change of leave. Leave time to get to airport in Atlanta  due to traffic.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,First flight delayed by 40 minutes,I was surprised that our flight was delayed to offload fuel.  Was not a problem tome but to those with connecting flights
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Traveling Experience,"We had an early flight and things couldn't have gone smoother!  We arrived at the airport on time, the flight was not cancelled or delayed (yaaaay) and the ride was excellent!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Non stop makes the flight so much faster.,Most Southwest flights out of Spokane involve at least one stop on the way. Now they have two no Vegas non-stops each day leaving and arriving. We usually take the morning flight leaving about 6am and we take the return flight leaving Vegas about 9pm. This usually give us almost a full final day without having to spent another night. We also use the Lift service while there and avoid paying for a rental car or an airport shuttle.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,On time or quicker,We flew to Denver in late October. Southwest is almost always on time a d our trip was no exception. All personnel were friendly and efficient. We love Southwest.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good for taking check in bag free,We chose this Airline only for the reason that they allow one check in bag free where all other airlines in USA charge $30 per bag for travel. It was a five hour flight . No snacks but a cold drink / juice of your choice available with them with some chips and free water. It was full economy class flight. Everything was ontime.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Mamaw Tim,"First leg of flight to Oakland was on an 800. Super roomy and attendants very friendly. From Oakland to LAX, on 727 and full flight, still extremely easy and friendly. Thanks to all.I always fly Southwest for comfortable and roomy seating."
Date of travel: February 2019,10,Not right,"I'd witness on a couple of separate occasions the ticket attendants in RI committing despicable acts of discrimination against Asians.  I'd filed a complain but as expected, I was ignored."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,"Crowded, Unorganized","Value for money is below par, dirty plane, old and smelly. Boarding and un boarding was mass chaos. We try to use AA or Delta, so we can fly First Class and have clean seats."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Delay,"Generally love Southwest, but this flight was delayed for an hour due to a sensor in the bathroom. As the plane was readied for an hour before departure, why didn’t they realize this before?  The boarding was also really late, so unfortunately the delay caused the flight landing right in the midst of LA rush hour traffic. As the LAX airport has begun a new pick up system, the whole event was an awful experience.The flight crew, however were helpful and professional, as always."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,always friendly and accommodating service,Our flights were canceled due to a hurricane in the Gulf but the Southwest people did their best to get us to our destination.  Our luggage was misdirected and we did not receive it till the next day.  We were amply compensated for the inconvenience.  This was the only time we have had trouble with our flights on Southwest and it was due to a storm.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Fly Away,"KC to Balt. via Minn./St. Paul. The flight was very good the pilots and flight attendants were the best. They simply took very good care of everyone if you needed help with wifi or request simply the whole can of juice, with ice. We really love to fly with Southwest. I'm on the fence with no assigned seats but, if you can check-in early within the 24 hrs prior to your flight your pretty much guaranteed a 'B-Group' seat or middle of the plane so it's all good. Carry-on plus 1-checked bag is free. I'd encourage anyone to fly Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Mrs.,As usual you can count on Southwest Airlines. Fast friendly service plus they really cares for you. On time travel is important to customers. They try their very best to make your flight on time.
Date of travel: September 2019,30,South of Ok,"Southwest Airlines seems to be running on a different standard regarding quality.  The cleanliness of the planes, quality of internet and quality of service during flights seem to be going down.I have frequent challenges with the internet service, the movies available to watch via their app’ rarely changes.  I have been looking at the same movie option for 3 months.  They also serve your drinks before their dry pretzel snacks?!  Isn’t that backwards?I hope they get back to better quality soon because I fly with them about 45+ weeks a year."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Short and Sweet on Southwest !,"Southwest Airlines is my favorite for domestic flights. Their planes are dependable and clean. The steward and stewardess staff is friendly and helpful. The pilots seem to be outstanding. My most recent flights were short ones: Sacramento to Los Angeles, and back. There were plenty of flights for my convenience. Check in was a breeze.Seating is first come- first served according to confirmation time. I was comfortable and safe."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On time departure and early arrival,"I took the early morning (6:30 am) direct flight from Columbus to Atlanta.  The flight was perhaps 60% full.  Boarding was smooth.  We pushed back on time and were #1 for takeoff.  Weather made the flight a little bumpy on ascent and decent.  Cabin service was very good.  We arrived about 15 minutes early at the gate.  Cabin temperature was a little chilly.  Otherwise, it was a great flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Fly Southwest wherever you can,"Southwest is the best discount airline for the fact you can check 2 pieces of luggage alone. The flight attendants and all the other staff are always courteous and will even help you if you are too shy to ask for help. The snacks are minimal, so don't expect a meal during the flight, but for the price it's the best."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Ease of Boarding,"The Boarding system is rarely fast. You do have to pay extra for the convenience of early boarding, but is worth it, depending on your situation. For example if traveling with seniors or children. Same with the convenience of 2 free baggage. If your stay is for a longer time, like mine was is super convenient. The flight was comfortable and the crew very friendly. Yes it’s recomendable."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Travelrestrepeat,"Love Southwest, friendly, free luggage for 2. Usually on time. Sometimes, funny staff. Able to change flight if needed. Usually meet friendly people on flight also."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Southwest Airlines flight,Southwest was better than I expected. The open sitting wasn't bad as what other people have said. My experience was good I did the early bird and I feel that helped. The wifi wasn't working but other than that we had a good flight.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Trip to New Orleans!,"Great flight, as always on Southwest, TWO bags fly free! Friendly staff! And New Orleans new airport is gorgeous and clean!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Great flight,My flight was on time and the crew were friendly and helpful and we arrived early in Nashville.My return flight was on time it went smoothly. Southwest is the best way to go!
Date of travel: June 2019,40,Southwest Airlines,"As far as I'm concerned, this is the only airline to book for travel.  Living on the coast we are limited to our incoming flights, but with a short drive to San Antonio or Houston you can save enormously on your flight.  Southwest has consistently been an exceptional airline for my travels with ontime flights and departures, polite flight attendants and service above others."
n/a,50,great airline,I have used southwest air to fly back and forth from Fort Lauderdale Florida to Puerto Vallarta Mexico a few times each year.  Southwest Air makes it easy because they do not charge for changes and give full refunds for a cancellation.  No charge for 2 checked bags and flight attendants that are very accommodating.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Love Southwest!,"I am moving and am taking advantage of the 2 bags fly free! Also, I love that I always get a window seat and can reschedule my flight whenever I need!"
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Vaca,It has a very good experience..flight was on time..there was a long wait time as when we got ready to board another flight came in we had to wait for them to deplane.  Apart from that overall experience was good
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always take Southwest when possible!,I always pick Southwest whenever possible. The package fees other airlines make could pay for your Southwest airfare!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Another PERFECT flight to Vegas,"Another prefect flight, we had to listen to some SOCK MOUTH FROM RHODE ISLAND Talk about her $140k job, and her collage girls yap for a awhile. Then one of the serviceAttendance told them all to SHUT UP.,!.,Other than that. It was great"
n/a,30,Typical communication,"Standard service except this time I sat at the gate 3.5 hours early only to almost miss plane because they never announced gate change at the original gate!  You get what you pay for.  Then they acted like it was a big deal to ask for one of the cinnamon cookies that they called a ""breakfast"" item for early flights.  It was a 9:30 am flight!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight attendant was hilarious!,"One of the flight attendants was our entertainment on the flight.  Had everyone laughing and happy to be on a completely full flight. Very enjoyable!Southwest has the best flight attendants!   Of course, we took advantage of the 2 bags flying free...  on time both ways."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Reasonable airline.,"SWA is a discount airline and you get what you pay for.  That being said they do offer great deals and don't charge for the first two checked bags.  The Stewards are always kind, helpful and will do just about anything for you.  I enjoy SWA and I feel it is worth it to pay a little extra to get a chance to board in the first wave of passengers."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,"Southwest is always great. No charge for luggage, no nickel dimeing .They do however keep raising the price for early bird check in. The most flexible airline in business. I only fly SW between Columbus and Ft. Myers and they are my first choice  for any other trips I take."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,loved having no assigned seats,"Our son recommended.SWA for our trip. Because of our age, he also recommended we request assistance at the airports to avoid the long walks which we cannot do now. He also recommended we pay extra for early boarding and it was worth it as we were able to board without being rushed. We found staff to be friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest is still my first choice,"Southwest is always my go to airline.  I have used others but Southwest is always the best all around value for my money.  No complaints here.  Tip:  If you have not used Southwest before, know that you should go online exactly 24 hours before your flight's departure time to reserve your spot in line in order to to ensure that you have your best choice in seating yourself."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,I Love Southwest Airlines,"I fly at least 3 times a year for vacation. During the last 10 years or so I would say I've flown Southwest probably 90 percent of the time. Always the best price, bags fly free and the staff are always friendly. Now that they go to Hawaii,  I'll will increase my time with them even more. Thanks Southwest for your excellent flights and care."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Flight changed and no notification,"Imagine arriving to the airport 2 hours early for your flight and discovering that you are actually 2 hours late for your flight! Oh and I was not notified and you receive a lecture that you should have checked your flight but I paid extra because I knew that I would be in meetings all day and would not have to check in. So the choice was to wait 6 hours at the airport for a direct flight or take a series of flights and arrive the next day. I decided to fly to Orlando on a direct, rent a car and drive home so I could rest before all day meetings the next am. My compensation $50 that I had to pay for a seat and a refund of my early bird fee.Lesson learned-always check your flights and know that Southwest can change your flight without notifying you"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest Airlines Always Delivers,"This is my go to flight to visit my 89 year old mother and bring her back California for a visit.  The Southwest Airlines counter staff are always so helpful and respectful to my 89 year old mother.  Without their check-in and boarding assistance, I honestly don't know if I could do it on my own.  Thank you very much for your service."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Excuse me, I’d like to sit there",First of all I Boarded the flight nearly last because I didn’t know the game where you set your alarm 24 hours in advance so you can check in for a better boarding group #.  The topper was scanning those last available sears sandwiched between 2 people trying to avoid eye contact or wearing unfriendly scours. The most irritating were the folk who had stuff in the empty seats to ensure I’d keep moving. I have no patience for this foolishness. Just assign me a seat.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent service by and engaged crew,"I’ve flown with southwest for a while now, and I always find their flight service friendly, efficient, and fully engaged in supporting the passengers. Even when there is a bit of turbulence, the do their best to support the customers."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Omaha to Cabo San Lucas,I love the airline attendants on SW.  They are all so much fun.  I don’t like how they let all the families go before anyone else.  We were in the A group but had to wait for families even though they were in groups C.  We barely got to sit together and  we were A33 And A34.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Consistently Caring,"All staff very gracious, communicative, and considerate. Very reliable airline, very customer service oriented. Bag checking process is streamlined with kiosks, and so easy that many people check bags, leaving much overhead bin space available as well."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,The real friendly skies,Right from checkin at the gate to off loading everything is made as easy as possible. Their internet site is easy to use.  The baggage checkers can print tickets and the first two bags are free.  The line up for boarding makes it fast and easy.  I always buy the automatic check in to get a line assignment.  If you are in the A group you have a good seat.  All seats are the same but quite roomy.  Deplaning is as courteous as getting aboard was.  ALL staff is courteous.  I do not think they allow grouches in their midst. Points are easy to use and no blackouts.  Southwest is my pick whenever I fly.  I have used them almost exclusively since about 2012.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,picking up my marines at parris island CHS.,"I love this airline, they're the best, checked two bags for free.. flight crew were all awesome.. i always travel with these airline.."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest Airlines the Best,Love flying Southwest only airline that allows two checked in bags also a carryon bag plus if your a woman you can have a purse as well. The pilots and helpers are the best .
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Early Christmas trip,You pay for what you get.For me  South West Air has always been my go to airline. The boarding process may not be acceptable to all but it works for me.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Trip to DC,Always great flight with Southwest. Staff helpful and friendly from airport staff to plane staff. Attendant very helpful with me purchasing a drink for me and my wife who was sitting in a different row.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Decent airline for the price.,"I’ve had good experiences with Southwest. I don’t enjoy checking in 24 hours before a flight but everything else is decent. Free bags, seats are relatively comfortable and it’s possible to get a really cheap flight once in a while."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always a good flight,My family and I have never had a bad flight on southwest. Check In is always easy and fast.  Always great customer service from the ground crew and the flight crew.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,Always enjoy flying SW. The flight attendants  are always nice and the seats are comfortable. I do wish they would start assigning seats.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I LOVE SWA,"I have flown SWA almost exclusively for several years because I love their service. Of course, sometimes they will be late, but anytime they've been very late, they actually act like they're sorry and automatically compensate. I don't even need to call customer service (unlike other airlines I've had to deal with, especially the one who claims to be the ""friendly skies""). And being check-in 2 pieces of luggage free, as well as being able to change my plane tickets without any change penalties, and being able to bring a companion for every flight essentially free (since I fly them so much) definitely keeps me loyal! Although this particular flight didn't have them, sometimes I've been lucky and gotten cabin crew who perform a comedy routine for the safety thing at the beginning of the flight. And they are FUNNY! Also, they now have a big selection of in-flight movies and other entertainment even on short flights!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,St. Louis to Phoenix,As always the loading went efficiently and the flight was on time.  The seats were comfortable and the service during the fight excellent.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flt and 2 free checked in bags,"I traveled to Sedona AZ via Southwest Airlines on their ""wanna get away"" deals and the cost was very reasonable if you book in advance.  The best part is, the are one of the few left airlines that dont charge you fees for checked in luggage and get this...up to two bags!  Another thing is they serve complimentary beverages non alchoholic of course but they offer cocktails for a reasonable amount. Together with the free beverages they offer, it also comes with complimentary snacks like pretzels.  We took off on the scheduled time and landed on time as well."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Before winter sets in vacation.,"This is my husband's fishing trip before winter sets in. Unfortunately winter started early this year. Pleasantly surprised our flight was on time and no delays. Southwest is my favoorite airline. Nice people, bags fly free and if you need to make a change they don't penalize you to death. Given the option I will always choose Southwest over any other airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I love Southwest Airlines!,"Unlike United, Southwest staff is always friendly, kind and helpful. Great benefits regarding luggage, scheduling, we requested assistance for my mom and it was great! Free WiFi, snacks and drinks. I’m never flying with another airline to the US If Southwest is available."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,A Giving Kind of Season,"I missed my original flight and got to the airport just after my 2 hour window because there was extensive traffic on the way there. Lucky for me, I ran into the two nicest Southwest employees, Tamika (Customer Service) and André (Supervisor), who took care of me and put me on the next flight for no additional fee because of the traffic! For that, I would like to thank them and Southwest for accommodating me. Great customer services!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Mrs.,The flight was on time; the staff was courteous and efficient. The ability to connect to Southwest’s inflight WiFi made the trip more enjoyable.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Interesting!,"We were pre-boarded this time, then all politely told we’d have to leave the plane as Buffalo was experiencing ice and freezing rain, and Southwest does not attempt to land in those conditions. Understandable! Luckily we were delayed only about an hour. Our subsequent flight was uneventful and we landed in chilly rain. Tampa was looking really good about then!"
Date of travel: May 2019,50,great customer service,"Southwest of course allows 2 checked bags per person, we were on a 45 min connecting flight and they still offered us drinks and a snack. Everything went very smoothly and was happy with the customer service. Spirit airlines lost one of our bags in Orlando earlier this year and we basically lost one day in Orlando."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Short easy flight,"Very streamlined process. Friendly staff and the free checked luggage is what really saves it for me. The open-seating policy can be a little annoying because of the passive-aggressive games people play, ie taking the aisle seat first or piling their carry-ons into empty seats they're not saving for other people, but that's humans just needing to learn to get along."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,good,I feel confortable on Southwest and know what to expect.  I sometimes get free drinks and when I pay itis reansonable.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Reagan to Nashville,"Love Southwewst at Reagan-so easy to get into/out of...Great serviceI am a native Washingtonian, too!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,round trip to kansas city,"We always fly southwest to Kansa City because they are the only ones with some non stop flights . Both directions were fine ,without problems. Be sure and wait for there $59 1 way sale ,otherwise it is about $250 rt."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Ok flight,The flight started out great but with in 30 mins into our flight we hit bad weather  and our pilot really tried to keep us posted. But in the end we had a rough flight
Date of travel: December 2019,50,All but the gate,"Southwest is a great airline due to their customer service.  I just want to know why every time we fly into Charleston and they proudly announce an early arrival we sit on the Tarmac for 20 minutes waiting for a gate to deplane.  Really, the airline and airport can't figure out the plane is landing!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Affordable, reliable","Excellent staff, on time on both flights, great value for the money.  Open seating so try to get in the A group."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Perfect Family Flight,"Traveling comes with its own set of challenges.  Add children to the mix and you never know what will happen.  My husband and I flew to Columbus, OH with our two daughters, ages 8 and 3.  Our flight left early on a unusually cold morning.  Although they were sleepy, TSA was breeze.  The agents treated my girls like little adults and entertained their questions.  As we boarded the plane, the flight attendant asked them if they wanted to see the cockpit.  The advantage of traveling with children is that you get to board before groups B and C.  Well, when the girls decided to take the attendant up on her offer, we kissed that chance goodbye.  The pilot was wonderful.  He patiently answered every question and let them flip any switch or push any button they wanted to.  Each time I cut in to tell them it was time to go, he pointed out another feature.  He even let them greet the guests over the intercom. What I expected to be a minute of Ooohs and Aaahs turned in to almost 10 minutes of an airplane lesson.We sat in the back of the plane.  The flight attendant for our section was just as accommodating as the pilot.  She made sure my daughters were comfortable and entertained every question.  She even sent the away with a few of their favorite snacks.I was already a fan of Southwest, but this experience was the icing on the cake."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,First time flying this airline to the Caribbean,"Great flights,  airline crew were very attentive .  Must admit flight home was nice, crew were full of spunk"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Issue free flight.,Flight was on time and without incident.  The staff was professional and efficient.  The aircraft was typical of most domestic aircraft.  The seats in economy were small and too close together.  It was a very uncomfortable experience but no worse than most carriers.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good airline to reserve tickets,We were supposed to fly out from SFO to Denver on Southwest Air on Tuesday the 26th of November for Thanksgiving but we were warned that Denver would have a huge snowstorm that day.  We called Southwest on November 25th to see if we could delay our flight to the next day even though we knew flights that week tend to be very full because of the Thanksgiving holiday.  Southwest courteously cancelled our flight on the 26th and was able to schedule us on a flight the very next day.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,My airline of choice,Always chose SWA for all my flights and will never change sometime they are early or delayed but you get there
Date of travel: June 2019,10,"ALL-were late, delayed, gate changes. Worst trips I have ever endured - awful","Family reunion in MX - flight from MCO - FLL -CUN and same for return flights -- all were late, delayed, late gate changes - both ways - both.  I've flown SW for years but I'm probably done with them.  Worst service/experience I have ever had on 4 flights. Worst service both ways.Even with baggage fees on other carriers it has to be better than this.  SWA is Awful and disappointing.Zero stars to SWA .. zero.  LATE LATE LATE"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always a great experience with SWAL,"Fling for a week in Los Cabos with a 2nd FREE suitcase full of clean, used clothing for a children's charity there is a great feeling! Thanks, SWAL for being generous with your 2 Bags Free policy!  The morning went so smoothly, from check-in to landing in Los Cabos and getting thru baggage and customs, and I got much needed sleep, so that's a testament to Southwest's good operations."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Free bags,"I like Southwest especially for the free luggage, but I would so much rather have assigned seating. I always pay for early bird boarding but still get the end of the A line and even a low B. I do wish that NO ONE could recline their seats.p, it is just rude. Space is precious and I like to consider my fellow travelers. Reclining your seat makes the passenger behind you claustrophobic.Flights have been fine, but the TSA at Reagan was horrible."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,The Best,A typical (excellent) flight from SWA. Not only do they get you from point A to point B they entertain you along the way. SWA has a reputation for treating their employees right and the employees in return treat customers right.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,The whole flight crew very nice.,Crew very friendly . It's a short flight and the Pilot was very funny when we landed. He said now that we tested the brakes Welcome to Burbank . Burbank has a very short runway.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Panama Canal cruise,"Took a 15 day Panama Canal cruise with carnival which ended in Tampa.  Cruise was beautiful.  The southwest flight was spotless and the flight attendants kept feeding us snacks and drinks throughout the flight which landed in San Diego 10minutes earlier than scheduled.By the way, I’ve never been on a southwest flight that was bad!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Always friendly,"These were good flights. Layover in Denver was too long, though. Return trip was excellent to Nashville and was on time. We arrived in Seattle the night before our cruise to Alaska. The return and debarkation was early and in plenty of time to make our check-in and 10:00 am flight back to Nashville. It is always nice not to pay a luggage fee."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest Delivers,"During an extremely busy holiday week, Southwest delivered three of us on time first to Phoenix, then on to Portland.  Leg room was minimal, but hey there was no charge to check your bags (saved $90 for three of us).  I hate to fly but I actually enjoy the comedic banter of SW’s inflight crew, and it comforts me.  The ontime departure led to an early arrival, so we didn’t have to make a run for our connecting flight.  I do wish these smaller planes had inflight movies"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great connection to Las Vegas,"Great non-stop connection to Las Vegas.Have taken this flight  numerous times with no issues If you can acess Buffalo-Niagara, this would be a great choice.Depending on day you might have morning or evening selections."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Honeymoon,"Our flight was, as always, amazing.  I’ve flown southwest more than any other airline. It’s always fun, professional and on-time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Frat Reunuion,"Love flying Southwest, Great staff, crews, free snacks...and 2 bags fly free. had to change in Denver going and in San Antonio coming back. No problems with plenty of time to connect.."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Baltimore to LA,"Anytime I can, I will fly Southwest. I enjoy being treated as an adult. Love the boarding process and the feel of camaraderie amoungst the crew and how they  include the passengers in that process."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest,They are always the best. No baggage fee and quite a few non stops everyday. Added bonus- they are one of the most on time airlines both on departures and arrivals.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I mostly always fly Southwest Airlines,This is the best airline.  I always enjoy my flights on SWA.  The staff are always nice and friendly.  We usually get there a head of time.
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Terrible gate agent,"After waiting 3 hours, flight canceled. Gate agent was RUDE 😡.  We were booked on separate flights from our adult son.  We asked her to book us together, she said flight was full. Arrived back at our hotel to spend the night, called customer service and they got our son in the same flight as us.  I guess it wasn’t full after all!  First time I have had such terrible service from a Southwest gate agent"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Urgent need for Funeral,A sudden death in the family required us to fly home after just being there a week previously.  We needed to fly non-stop to get there before the funeral for not too much money.  I am disabled and also deaf/hard of hearing and need to have accommodations.  We were able to find suitable seating in the plane for my needs.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best value,"As always, Southwest had the best price and best schedule.  Checked bags always included,  flight crew attentive, flights on time.....what else do we need?   Highly recommended if Midway is a convenient airport for you."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Love Southwest Airlines,I travel a lot for business and leisure. I love flying on Southwest Airlines. Lots of time when I’m traveling to choose from. Great rewards program. Alway a pleasure to travel on Southwest Airlines.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Efficient, courteous and fun",I was on a business trip and there were 2 12 year young ladies ... the moms were across the aisle... the one young girl said it was her 12th birthday and her first time on an airplane. I told one of the Flight attendants... so after doing the service and taking care of everything... just prior to landing the head flight attendant had everyone close their blinds and ring the call buttons ‘candles’ and shared the information about the young lady ... and everyone sang Happy Birthday!!! Her have was beaming... now that is first class caring service ... made my day and that young ladies as well my guess a Southwest customer for life....
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"The best flights are ""uneventful"".  On time, no aircraft problems, great crew and leg room.","We always use early bird to ensure we are seated together.  I like Southwest boarding by place in line.  It goes smoothly usually.  We traveled to Mother's funeral and I had to pack all the extra pictures and items needed for the service.  So the ability to check two bags each was a real money savings.  Flight attendants are always pleasant on SW.  We had the first am flight which unusually wasn't full.  We had 3 seats for 2 people on both legs!  On return trip, planes were full but we still had plenty of leg room whether in window aisle or middle.  I have very long legs and economy flights on other major airlines don't provide enough room."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Visit Sister,We had a great time with my sick sister.  Spent Thanksgiving with family.  Had no problems at either airport and the flight attendances were very nice.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Quality flight, but not as good on time performance","Business select flier.  There seems to be tons of pre-boards these days.  Pilots from other companies get on before paying passengers.  So many handicap fliers, I wonder how in the world they would get off in an emergency.  I watched a shorter lady struggle with her bag in the over head bin, while a Southwest First officer sat in his seat 2 feet away and did NOT offer to help.  I guess he's too important and that work is beneath him.  I got up and helped her.  He should go fly boxes somewhere in a King Air.  Poor display of customer service.  Over all I like Southwest, but they are not as good as they once were."
Date of travel: September 2019,20,Avoid front row,"Flight to Albuquerque was great and on time, all smooth. Flight back was delayed but staff rerouted me. That’s was the good part. The bad part, was that I sat in front row; stored my knapsack overhead, and the full flight caused crew to move my bag without me seeing where/how they moved it, further back in overhead compartment. After I deboarded and left airport, I realized my $400 pair of sunglasses were missing from outside pocket of knapsack. I filed a claim but they never showed up again. The crew wasn’t pleasant to me and threatened to check my bag, even though I had boarded before others who moved my bag from it’s safe location. So I was A/ treated rudely b/ my property was lost while bag got shoved around by crew. I like Southwest overall, but I wish I had obtained the name of that nasty crew member."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Gotta Love Southwest Staff,Early Morning Flight and yet every Southwest Employe I encountered was pleasantly uplifting. . This particular flight had anextreme number of elderly in need of wheel chair assistance. The boarding seem to move slow and yet no one seemed to care. Flight attendants helpedSeniors with carryons to standing and restroom visit. The smiles were plentiful. This was the middle of November Chicago Weather was Cloudy and dark. This flight was cozy and bright.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Not a fan,"I cannot stand not having assigned seating, no leg room, and even though there’s free checked bags no one and I mean no one takes advantage.  I’ve been spoiled by a competitor who provides a much better experience."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flying to the Nation's Capital!!,I frequently fly out of Nashville and have never incountered a problem. I always fly Southwest and have never had any problems there either. The flight attendants are alway pleasant and willing to help.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,slight dealy,Short flight.  Best WiFi I have had on a flight for a while.  Southwest did not keep me update on the reason for the delay which is unusual for them
Date of travel: December 2019,40,EZ trip on Southwest,"Plan ahead, book in 24 hours on-line and show up an hour ahead on Boarding.  On this trip we were not TSA preapproved (.???) but the line was ~~~ 25 minutes .....not bad on a Saturday this time of year.  Remember that the rental car counter is across the street from the terminal.  SJC finally has a AMEX lounge in the American Airlines area."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Consistently good,"This was the first leg of a three legged itinerary to get me to my ultimate destination and back to my origination point. All three flights were on time or early. Few roads are without bumps, but overall all flights were smooth.  I confess to being a major SWA fan for domestic flights,especially when I'm going to check a bag. They become a no-brainer when I'm checking golf clubs, too. Staff is almost always super friendly and often chuckle provoking. Just another good all around experience."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Flight was smooth and uneventful,We have flown with Southwest for the last 10 years and this flight was about the same as previous. We had no problems right from the start - very nice people.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Smooth flight one hickup,Checking in a snap first leg to BWI went well upon landing told to go to gate C14 for connecting flight to TPA with plenty of down time a leisurely walk to gate area was accomplished. Hickup here upon arrival at gate we were told of a gate change back to A7 about 15 minutes away. The turnaround was accomplished and next leg was accomplished about a half hour later than projected arrival time. The crew was great and tried their best to make up for lost time with great service. Great job Southwest Airlines.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great airline.,"Round trip, non-stop, excellent time. Southwest crew always great and helpful, efficient and friendly."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,First time flyer,"For my First flight ever,  I found it to be relaxing and for as much anxiety as i had prior to this flight, I would say don't wait to fly!!!  It  was an incredible experience. I even enjoyed looking out the window. there was a little turbulence but it felt like riding on a bumby rode in a truck.  I'm patiently waiting to go on my next adventure"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,It was announced that the flight will be late by 45 minutes.,"Once the airplane arrived and everyone was seated, the plane made up the difference of arrival time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving with Family in Florida,"Flying during the busiest holiday season brought anticipated crowded challenges.We experienced none as Southwest made it almost completely effortless. From check in, to the flight and arrival, we had totally uneventful challenges and easily made it through the entire flight process PERFECTLY.Moreover, return trip characteristics were like wise equally pleasant.A factor may have been that both flights were 6:30 am and 5:30 am."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Dependable,"Never have an issue with Southwest.  Even when the flight is delayed, they always seem to arrive on time.  Flight attendants are kind.  I don't think I have ever experienced an issue with that airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,southwest is mediocre,"I don't care for Southwest, but I chose this airline because I knew that the flight from MSP to MDW was not going to be very long. The reason I don't like SW is because the overhead bins get full very quickly and our luggage is never above our seats. I did end up paying to get closer to the front of the line and I would do that again. It was nice to get seats close to the front of the plane."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,“Some of the skies are (still) friendly”,"Flew via Jax- this was my fault - made  travel arrangements too late to get ideal route. As usual, gate attendants on top of embarking and despite full flight, we took off on time and arrived on time. Attendants are usually smiling, saintly professionals — these were no exception. Flight crew in the cockpit and in the cabin always make me feel safe.... flying via Southwest usually makes me feel that “ some of the skies are (still) friendly”."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Big Blues Bender no Blues with Southwest,Love the ease of booking and travelling with Southwest. Changing flights are not difficult and no extra charge. I travelled with another airline and the company wanted a change fee which was double my entire trip. Needless to say I stayed and waited until my original booked flight.Love the no seat assignments cause if I don’t want to sit with my travel partner after spending a week in Vegas together I don’t have to. Ha ha ha just joking. I always meet someone interesting on the flight as well; new friendships developed
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Seating could be a problem,The flight was on time.  Fairly comfortable seats but no TV.  Their process of seating could prove to be a problem.  We were lucky that their were empty seats so we were able to seat together and have an empty middle seat.  If it were a full flight and you do not get an A or high number B board you may have trouble finding the seat you would like.  Flight attendants very nice and their cancellation policy is great.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,vegas three day trip,usually fly non stop but this time we had a layover in phoenix in turn into a 3 hour layover instead of i hour but the pilot did make up 20 minutes and they did keep us up to date on what was going on it was smooth flight
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I fly Southwest whenever possible.,Another comfortable and on time flight for me. I love the 2 checked bags and not having to pay extra for a seat for a reasonably priced flight. I drive extra distance to fly SW because of the ability to change the flight without taking a big financial hit if my schedule has to change.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great customer service. Friendly flight attendants.,I use Southwest as much as possible. They have some decent fares but I love that they do not charge for baggage. The only complaint I have is the seats are cramped and the seat belts are tight for plus sized people.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,direct flight Mke to Hou,Flight staff friendly and effiecient. Flight smooth and on timePlane clean and very comfortable. Pilot communicated well with travelers on the plane.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,On-time and efficient,On time departure and efficient cabin service was excellent on this flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Raleigh.  Aircraft was very clean.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great experience as always,"I love southwest plain and simple. JESUS LOVES EVERYONE.  Flight attendants were awesome as always. Pilots need to be more open, and more customer focused."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent Flight,"Great flight, excellent airline always clean and flight are on time.  Th flight attendants are extremely competent and make sure your trip is as pleasant and comfortable as possible."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Airline,"We have used Southwest Airlines several times a year, for 7-8 years.They are dependable, usually as good a price as can be found. You can take a carry on & check your bag for free. The best part of Southwest is being able to cancel your flight up to 10 minutes before a flight, with no penalty. You can reschedule at that time or have the full price of your ticket kept as a credit to use next time. The credit is kept for 1 year from date of original booking. If you book a flight & then later find the price for that flight has gone down, you can call & get credit for the price difference. You can also change your flight, no penalty, just pay if there is a price difference for new flight. Southwest has no assigned seats, you can check in 24 hrs ahead of flight & get your boarding order.When you board you pick your seat from the available ones.  We recommend Southwest to everyone."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,"Good service, pleasant experience!",Good service and pleasant experience.  I like the free baggage...dislike that people bring more than they're supposed to on the flight.  Southwest often has good fares so I'm a customer!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Nice Trip,Southwest Non-Stop to Cabo is the best way to get there and back on a very Friendly Airline. They take very good care of you like you are their only passenger. Customer Service is always their primary objective right after Safety First. Don't forget that your bags fly for FREE.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Unfair seat selection,"Took this flight home.  1st before boarding began and everyone had to get in there cattle pens people were walking onto the plane without scanning a boarding pass they were checking them on some kind of list.  Then when boarding did begin, 1 wheel chair 5 more people, one Cain 4 more people.  When I finally arrived on the plane there was little overhead left, so many backpacks that the stewardess should make people put them under their seats but didn't.  I finally get to and open seat by the exit and a stewardess is saving 2 seats for someone! I have never seen this before.  Never Never again will I fight southwest for a seat, unless I have no other options.  By the time I would have upgraded with the $25 to beat the crowd or as I call it fight for a seat, its not much cheaper then other airlines. Southwest really brings out the meanness in people!!  I'd rather not experience that again!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Our ""go to"" airline!","Southwest is the best. Free luggage. Free rescheduling. Funny airline attendants (unless you're unfortunate enough to get some stiff who was trained by another airline). Sure, legroom is still based on the average height of tiny Mexicans or Asians, and you'll still get the cheapest pretzels on the planet posing as ""snacks"" but, when you've flown via Delta, United, or American Airlines... You realize that Southwest is actually TRYING to be a decent airline."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Houston to Phoenix,Flight was on time. Smooth flight. A little turbulence but nothing upsetting. Flight attendants as usual were phenomenal!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always First Choice,Great early direct flight usually gets in by 10:30 - 11:30am giving you most of the day to enjoy resort destination. Usually early arrival. Bring a pen to fill out immigration docs.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Trip to St. Louis,The process in general was very good and fast. It was easy to get the boarding passes and luggage id stubs. The boarding process was also very organized and the travel times and schedule were met. Excellent trip to visit our son in St. Louis.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest Airlines is the way to travel,This is the only airline we use.  We like how we can travel with our reward points from our Rapid Rewards credit card.  We also like it when we qualify for the companion pass where one of us can fly for free.  They have great friendly service on every flight with no extra fees!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Great flight, lousy weather, wonderful crew",The weather was terrible and the flight out of Minneapolis was late arriving into Minneapolis. We were scheduled to transfer in Baltimore to another flight to Norfolk. We missed our originally scheduled flight.  The flight crew kept us advised of the planned departure flight to Norfolk.  When we landed in Baltimore the flight crew and terminal personnel wisked us over to the gate adjacent to ours onto the next scheduled flight to Norfolk. They actually held that flight about five minutes to get us AND OUR LUGGAGE aboard the next flight.  It was a miracle. Great Job Southwest Airlines.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,to NYC from Denver and Back,I always try to fly SW Airlines as often as possible.  Their staff are always friendly and helpful. Our flight was overbooked and many people were trying to get all of their luggage on the plane. I personally hate it when everyone wants 3-4 carry-on's and hold up the entire plane for them and don't bother to consider other's.  The counter said they would be taking over sized or more than 2 pieces on board and loading them into the cargo bay. You should have seen people trying to explain to the ticket person how their suitcase or multiple carry-on's were more important and needed.  They were pitching a fit and held up the take-off by 20 minutes +.  Thank you SW Airlines for sticking to your rules.  Keep on Flying.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,SOUTHWEST - APPRECIATE FREE BAG CHECK,San Jose to Burbank- A very short hop but pleasant flight. On time. We were staying for a week and attending a few dressy events so really appreciated the 2 bags check free.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,NY to FL,"Our flight was to be on Tuesday (but was cancelled).  Due to 2 feet of snow it was delayed until Friday.  They notified us right away, then was so helpful on the phone get us on another flight!  You've gotta love the bags fly free"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best Employees,This flight was full & passengers were not wanting to cooperate! The staff handled them wonderful & they even sang the instructions and had everyone laughing and back in a good mood before we took off! Drinks were mixed & served with a smile! Flying again in December & I know I will have another wonderful experience!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy Peasey,Great flight with excellent crew!  Southwest is the best for budget flying. Smooth flying and usually early or on time.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Polka Hall of Fame Awards Weekend,"For a US carrier I will fly Southwest every time.  The still have aircraft with seats that are comfortable and give you a little room to breath from the seat in front of you.  Compared to American and others they are far ahead in customer service, and on time flights.  I hope they don't change.  :-)"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,South*!#% Airlines,"Booked travel for a Wedding in Palm Springs. No direct flights, so decided to do the layover in San Jose, CA and have son & daughter in law join that flight and go onto Ontario, CA. Before even leaving Reno, NV we were informed that flight delay to San Jose, CA would cause us to miss connecting flight to Ontario. Next available flight would be 2 hours much later than our 1 hour delay. Upon arriving to San Jose, flight  originally to Ontario was still on tarmac and folks were running to make the connection. We were not informed that we could have made that flight, but probably not our luggage. This is totally unacceptable! SouthWest knew there were multiple flights and did nothing to get us into Ontario with our luggage in a timely manner. This  seems to be a normal trend for South*!#% Airlines. This Airline does not enforce carry on limitations. Wish I had just took my luggage and crammed it in the overhead as other passengers do. South*!#% did absolutely nothing to compensate us for delay, Ruined the beginning of what was supposed to be a Wonderful Blessed gathering of Friends and Family at this Wedding we were so looking forward to attending. As their Slogan says, ""we know when you fly, you have many choices-Thank you or choosing SouthWest."" I will definitely be looking at other options, rather than letting South*!#% West ruin my travel experiences."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Southwest,Southwest offers awesome service and with friendly employees.  I really like they way the board; it is much more organized than the other airlines.  No rushing the crowd to be on 1st.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,On time and well done,Mid afternoon flight times can be effected by many earlier issues. On time as almost always and friendly helpful crew.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"As far as I am concerned, Southwest is my first choice.",The best airline to fly. One of the few that does not charge for baggage. This in its self saves you a lot of money. Most of the time I can get a flight to where I am going at a rate less than the otther airlines. Service is good and so are the those that represent Southwest. My last three trips have been with Southwest and I am very particular.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Better than most,"I was able to get business select, so I didn't have to worry about my seat. Friendly service, on time. Great for trips that are less than 3 hours, but could not fly a segment longer than that as they aren't the most comfortable seats."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,oakland to PDX after Thanksgiving weekend,"The flight got delayed twice, but it arrived, things worked well. This was a Thanksgiving weekend so delay in flight was kind of expected."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Early Flight but So-so In-Cabin Service,"The Southwest flight went well.  The lead cabin attendant wasn't the typical ""Southwest customer-service friendly.""  Also the WiFi wasn't reliable.  While the flight arrived early, which is very good, the in-cabin service was very poor, which ""nets out"" a poor rating.  That said, I usually give Southwest flight good ratings."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,It is what it is,Southwest flights to and from (round trip) were on time departures and early arrivals. Nothing to complain about; nothing to praise. Southwest doing its thing.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,KC to DEN,"Efficient crew, very courteous & helpful. Handicapped Assistance was great. Typical beverage & pretzels served. Sufficient but still average. Used iPad to watch a movie I had downloaded."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Horrible,Why would you fly from Sacramento 600 miles south to go 600 miles east?And then to return SLC to Phoenix to Sacramento?We were going to Idaho and thought flying halfway was faster. We learned our lesson. No!  13 hours in the car under our control rather than at the mercy of corporate greed.
Date of travel: February 2019,50,Airline of choice,We have used Southwest now for several years for our annual winter getaway. We have never had any issues. There have been a couple times because we fly winter time that a couple of the flight were delayed. One was cancelled and they accommodated us quickly on another flight. We will continue using Southwest as it is convenient and affordable.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,3rd rountrip flight,"As with the other two, easy booking, on time travel and pleasant flight. Their staff are friendly and helpful. Seats are definitely more comfortable than AA. Love the 2 free checked bags per person. Have twice come in handy."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent flight to Cancun,We just took a round trip from Sacrament to Cancun. After researching numerous carriers to Cancun we selected Southwest.  They made the trip painless and we had no charges for baggage.  Connections were great and we had no issues at all. Great staff. We highly recommend them
Date of travel: November 2019,50,First Flight with South West,"Taking air plane without seat assignment, first come first serve was very uncomfortable idea for me. But I've heard many good reputation. So I tried.I booked, and I made alarm 10 min before 24 hours prior to check in. And it was worked!. I got earlier than A50 for boarding. There were no problem to seat with my companion. Crews are kind, leg room was spacious, Cleaner than delta. Flight schedules are correct. And I should changed flight on Atlanta for 40 min. I was little bit worried about time to transfer. But the place i got off, that was same place to board for connecting flight.So It was great!. Convenient and reliable."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight into Ft Lauderdale,"Our flight into FLL was on time and early the entire way. We boarded on time, took off early and landed early as well. There was minimal turbulence and drinks/snacks were served quickly. Our flight crew was great, as always, SW's crews always make you feel so at home and wanted! I always fly SW and will continue to do so. The few times I have had to fly other airlines just haven't been up to par!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Thanksgiving Holiday!,There was a delay in the flight schedule but we were prepared for it since I opted to receive text messages. The takeoff and landing were smooth and comfortable on both flights. Great customer service!!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy Breezy,After dealing with another airline (which will remain nameless) the boarding process was handled so professionally. No one pushing and shoving people out of the way. The flight attendants were courteous and helpful. Overall it was a pleasant trip. Will definitely fly with them again.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"A rap ""song"" started our flight","Stormy day had people dealing with raingear, frazzled nerves. One attendant rapped about "" put your tush in the cusch and the plane will push."" Much funnier when she said it. Turbulent flight but constant updates from the cockpit lessened anxiety"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,great flight for a great price,Extremely efficient airline operation . Paid for early bird boarding. worth it. Comfortable seating. On time departure and arrival. No charge for checked bags and the wait for bags at destination was minimal.

Date of travel: September 2019,50,Fun experience,"This was my introductory flight with Southwest and they did not disappoint. From the orderly boarding process to the cheerful (read: HILARIOUS)staff, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Definitely recommend flying with Southwest!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Pleasant Flight,The flight was pleasant and on time.  One needs to check in 24 hours ahead of time to get a decent seat.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Smooth and Fast!,"Although the weather looked gray and bleak, once airborne, we were off on a short jaunt which was fairly smooth. Thanks the pilots because we had been delayed and thought that the flight would be somewhat tumultuous. Our service was cancelled due to the announcement of ""bumps"", but it was actually quite nice and people didn't seem to mind that there were no drinks/snacks."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flexible cancellation policy + free drinks!,"The prices are actually the same as United or American Airlines. Sometimes better or worse. What's really good about Southwest is the flexibility they give you if you are frequently moving around your schedule, and have to do modifications to your flights. Plus, they regularly send me drink coupons, so I always get my Bluemoon beer for free if I want to. In addition they have a good selection of movies for free to watch on your own device (phone, tablet, or laptop), and free messaging onboard (you need to sign in with your southwest account first). Be aware - there is no first class. And seats are not assigned. To get a better seat you have to check-in as soon as possible (24 hours ahead)."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Smooth flight,"We like Southwest and most of the time it is a non eventful flight. This time though they changed our flight and re-routed us through Chicago and on to Tampa with out even telling us! We called the airline and they changed our flight to a direct flight. We were glad they could change it for us, but they should have notified of the change in the first place."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Beach Vacation,Southwest Airlines is the best!  They had on time arrivals coming and going which makes for a great trip
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Montego Bay  to Fort Lauderdale,"We have never done Southwest from out of the country back in. We came from Jamaica to Fort Lauderdale. Once in Fort Lauderdale to catch our transfer, we had to grab our bags off the turn style, recheck them and go back through the TSA to board our next flight.  Not sure if this is how Southwest does all their internationals or just this one.  Times were close and we got a little nervous."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Our favorite airline,Everyone at the airlines is cordial and accommodating. The flights were smooth and on time. The take-offs and Landings went great.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great.  Needed special assistance and they were great,Love this airline.  Have never had a bad experience with them and most of the time they're early rather than late.  Always punctual
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Typical great flight to and from with Southwest,"What can I say?  Southwest Airlines knows what it is doing.  Booking the flight was very easy and changing the flight was equally as easy; however, if you have flown Southwest, you already know this.  Southwest has boarding down pat.  It gets you on the plane and to a seat faster than any airline.   Flying First Class on an airline might be faster but that does not hold true for the rest of the passenger classes.  Simply stated, I fly Southwest whenever I have the opportunity.  The price is right and they act like they want you to fly with them."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,always pleasant,never have a problem with southwest they are always on time the people are always kind and considerate that is why i look to them first
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Nov San Diego,"I try to always book my flights to San Diego on Southwest Airlines.  I haven't had any issues finding a flight that is convenient for both myself and my daughter who lives in CA.  The flight attendants are just the most personable and funniest around!  My flights have over 95% of the time been on time.  When there was an issue of delays, Southwest emailed me two $100.00 vouchers for my inconvenience!!!  Plus I love having 2 bags fly free and no penalties for changing/cancelling flights."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Southwest, yes!","Good airline, have never had any problem(s) with them.  Too bad other airlines do/will not follow their example(s).  Recommend them without reservation(s)."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A very smooth ride and friendly flight attendants.,"Since I need special seating on the plane, I am always granted a pre-board.  This makes the trip a lot easier of me.The flight was very smooth and efficient to reaching the arrival time.They are all really great people from the gate attendants, pilots and flight attendants."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"More to it than ""It took off, it landed, my bags were there.""","I fly Southwest almost exclusively and while sometimes it's more expensive, to me it's worth it. First, I can check my bags with no extra charge. As an older American, I can no longer hoist a carry-on into the overhead and sadly, the number of folks volunteering to help have diminished over the years. And I don't like to ask. So I simply check my bag and there it is, waiting for me on the other end. Yes, I might have to wait a few minutes at the carousel but that's okay with me. Second, the seats are somewhat larger and more comfortable than other airlines economy class seats. And while many don't like SW's boarding system, I don't mind it at all. It actually lets me find a seat next to someone who is size-appropriate. Because I am small, often larger people choose to sit next to me, believing they'll have extra room. By choosing my own seat, I don't have to wait with bated breath to see who's going to sit next to me. (And if I've scored a good boarding number, I choose an aisle seat so I have a little extra leaning room in case I wind up with someone with ""floppage."" While this does put me in some danger of being whacked with a backpack during boarding, I am vigilant during this process. And an additional hint: if you see someone coming that you'd rather not have as a seat companion, simply cough. Cough loud and hard. I once met another small woman who held a small bottle of cough syrup while she coughed. Well played, ma'am.) And for those of you flummoxed by the letter/number boarding system all I can say is ""Wow!"" Either you don't pay attention at all or are truly dumb. You should have paid more attention in 4th grade. Next, SW employees are cheerful and funny. And SW pilots all sound like Texas good ol' boys when they drawl their greetings. I don't know why, but that's a good voice that commands ease and trust. You fly this plane, cowboy! This is a winning combination to carry me through the hours of an activity that used to be enjoyable and adventurous but is now stressful and anxiety provoking. That, plus the SW creative drink menu. The only time I met a surly SW attendant, was at the gate in Newark some years ago. But I forgave him. It was Newark, after all. I did write to the company, however, and got a nice voucher to use on my next flight. Very much appreciated. So, if SW flies in your neighborhood, give 'em a try. In this era of appalling air travel, Southwest is a good choice."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,We got what we expected!,We always seem to find the best deals and great flight times with this airline. As expected we didn't need a lot of fluff for a little over 2 hour flight. Highly recommend Southwest for there service!
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Abuse of saving seats,"Although we feel very satisfied with most everything Southwest provides there is one irritating issue. Flying Southwest does not provide assigned seating in lieu of this they assign a letter and number for your boarding sequence, if you want to pay a fee they will move your board letter/number closer to the front of the boarding sequence.That's all well and good however people have figured out they can 'save' seats for relatives and/or friends that have a much higher letter/number.I have written a complaint to SW however it doesn't appear they are willing to manage this problem.So I discussed this issue with a friend that has worked a long time with a different airline. She went up to the stewardess expressing her concern, then went to the person saving seats expressing they had two choices either allow them to sit in saved seats and stay or move to another location.  I think I will try this next time."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,I fly southwest airlines frequently.  They are generally on time and there are hardly any cancellations.,"I generally fly southwest airlines as they are excellent with cost and they are usually on time and low in cancellations.  The stewards were friendly and attended to your needs.The captain communicated when there was expected turbulence in the air.We spent time in Galveston, Texas to view the city and to take the free hotel shuttle to the cruiseline for a cruise trip with Royal Carribbean."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Vegas Getaway,"This was our first time flying southwest, it could not have gone any better. The plane going out was crowed, everything went well except for the rude passenger that insisted on listening to his music with no headphones. Almost forgot in flight entertainment was out on the flight to Vegas, lucky I had my iPad."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,The worst flight ever,This was terrible. There were 25 wheelchairs allowed on first and then could get off first. At least 10 dogs and none in carriers.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,2 free bags!!,Easy check in and St. Louis is  a modern facility.  Orlando on the other hand is a zoo!!Auto rentals are tricky to find.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Airline,Travelled to/from Buffalo to Orlando for a golf trip.  Excellent service and golf club transport by Southwest Airlines.  Continues to amaze me that they include both golf club and ski equipment as a free service as part of 2 bags flying free.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flying Southwest Airlines is always a good experience,Southwest is consistently very good.  Leg room is typical of being somewhat less than desirable like other airlines.  I really enjoy the flight attendants as they add humor to their announcements & they are always courteous & helpful.  Will keep flying them.  I love the fact that even if you have to cancel your flight you don’t loose the money. Just apply it to your next flight.  Excellent!
n/a,50,Southwest is the best!,"We have been flying Southwest for our recent domestic flights. The boarding process is very easy, no chaos, and the price is very affordable especially when you just ""wanna get away"". Lol! Flight attendants are very nice and helpful too! Clean cabin and great service.Already have 2 round trip flights booked for February and April. Woohoo!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Quick and Easy and Cost Effective flying,"If you need to get to Cleveland from MKE I would highly recommend Southwest flight 2948 to do so. The only downside to taking this direct flight is the arrival time, for it arrives in Cleveland after 10PM, but it is a sort and cost effective flight that is on time and the service is great !!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Non-stop to Wine Country,"With Early Bird seating, non-stop is the way to go.  Saves time, wear and tear etc.  SW always friendly and efficient."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Summer vacation,Southwest airlines is always on-time and low cost with their free bags.  Flight left on time and arrived on time.  Service was adequate.  Flight was comfortable
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Mother/daughter trip,"Enjoyable flight.  The airport at LaGuardia is crazy, but our flight was good.  Flight crew are awesome.  Had some turbulence, but they handled it well.  Friendly crew."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Love this airline,"Love flying Southwest!!! Luggage is free (2bags), check in is easy. They don’t nickel and dime you. Always friendly staff. Love this airline!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest is the best!,"You just can't beat Southwest Airlines for customer service -- both on the ground and inflight. Nor does it hurt that they still let you check two bags and take carry-ons with you for free! Nice job, once again, Southwest!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving 2019,"I’ve flown Southwest numerous times, fastest way to get to visit with family in Houston, so I am familiar with the process. First signed in is first in line and it’s open seating, etc, so with it being Thanksgiving week, all seats on my flight were booked.We were delayed on our departure due to foul weather in Chicago, where the flight originated, but once loaded and in the air all seemed well and the holiday off to a grand start.Suddenly a severe thunderstorm rolled in as it happens in Texas and what had been a normal flight suddenly became a bucking bull or roller coaster, so much so the flight attendants had to get strapped in to their seats for their safety. Needless to say, there weren’t any snacks or drink service on the flight, LOLThe pilot and cockpit crew as well as the attendants kept us well informed as well as reassured and we landed safely and smoothly in Houston, no worse for the wear. The most danger came when opening the overhead luggage bin as everything HAD shifted during the flight and a few bags came close to hitting passengers.I know all about flying as well as the sudden pop up storms here but the Southwest crew were well trained, absolute professionals and I applaud each of them for a job well done! Congratulations Southwest for such well trained staff, I’ll definitely fly you route again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Outstanding Captain SWA Flight 1716,"My wife was waiting for a wheelchair at the bottom of the jetway when we arrived in Dallas.  There were no wheelchairs available. Upon deplaning, the Captain noticed that we were standing in the jetway and asked, ""if he could help us"" .  We mentioned we were waiting for a wheelchair. He immediately said, "" I'll get you one "" and walked to the top of the jetway to retreive a wheelchair. He subsequently helped my wife into the wheelchair and proceeded to push my wife in the wheelchair to the top of the jetway were our son-in-law pilot was waiting at the gate. The Southwest Airlines Captain on Flt 1716 from PHX to DAL , November 25, 2019, displayed service above and beyond the call of duty !! We give him 5 Gold Stars for his act of kindness !!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Nearly always a pleasure!,I look forward to flying Southwest . Nearly always a pleasant experience and this was no exception. Had to change planes in Dallas outbound but it was no big deal.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest Flight from STL to BELIZE CITY BELIZE,Great flight just remember if you have a layover check your gate as soon as you get off the fiight they are known to change.
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Quick Transportation to attend a Wedding in Lake George,"Any time we fly north from Florida we like to use Southwest.  Flights are reasonable and easy to book, the gates are well organized and usually move quickly, the planes are clean and the staff is courteous and professional. Southwest does have a rewards program and senior rates if you fly frequently but we usually use the “wanna get away” plan. You can also book a hotel and reserve a car if needed. For a nominal fee you can upgrade your boarding position and we also get TSA pre-approval most of the time."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Favorite airline,Love southwest. Very efficient boarding process and efficient crew. I fly them on a regular basis. Good credit card point program.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,SW TAKES CARE OF YOU,"Connecting flt cancelled just before flt out of AUSTIN ... in 15 minutes SW rebooked me on more expensive non-stop, refunded my early bird fee, comped my A-list boarding on the new flt & was able to pull my bag & get it on the new flt as well.  What more could I ask for.  Awesome airline!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Love Southwest!,"I always try to fly Southwest when I can.  The friendliness of the flight crew and the no baggage fees have me sold!  Plus, their flights are usually the most reasonable!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,visit family in San Antonio Texas,"Left Atlanta, Ga. at 8:30 am, on time, arrived on time in Texas.  Smooth flight, good service.  Overall, the flight went well and the service was good.  Would recommend to others."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Flight was good,"It was my first day time flying Southwest as I usually fly Delta. You can’t reserve a specific seat (which I don’t like) but you board based on the order you purchased your tickets in groups. So the first group to board would be the first 40 people who purchased a ticket....in the order purchased. When boarding, you may sit anywhere. We were in the 2nd group to board and found seats fairly together for our party of 12 flying but we weren’t all together. I also couldn’t access the wifi for movies, whereas Delta offers free movies on their flights. Southwest is a little cheaper so that may be part of it. The crew was great and the captain greets you as you leave the plane. It was on time and clean."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,SW round trip to Seattle,I love flying out of ONT and not LAX. Closer and lot less hassles. SW has the most flights and connects to were we are going.  Flight are on time.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Southwest is the BEST!!,I’ve been flying Southwest Airlines for years!! It’s truly my favorite & unless it’s not available it’s definitely all I fly!! Can’t beat service.. hospitable & so convenient with luggage!!
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Direct flights are the best.,Direct flights are the only way to go. Flight crew was fun and pilot got us in early.....thanks for that!!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,We travel Southwest when possible.,Southwest is good dependable service. We love free luggage and finding your own seat. Seats are reasonably comfortable and my tall husband has good leg room. Every flight I've flown has been on time. Their safety record is tops.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest Flies High,Easy access to Love Field and lots of destinations including the Hawaii and the Caribbean.     Friendly service and the pilots keep you up to date
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest is always a great experience.,"I fly several times a year and wherever I fly, I choose Southwest if it's available in the vicinity in which I'm flying. Their price is competitive. The seats and leg room is adequate. And best of all, there is no extra fees for baggage!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Another wonderful SouthWest flight,"Another great flight with SouthWest airlines.  Have flown 100+ times over the last 10 years and flew another airline 3 times.  Every other time has been SouthWest.  Love them, and fully trust them.  Wonderful and very pofessional crew on Nashville to Vegas and return flight.  Thank you SouthWest."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Last flight from San Diego terminal one,"This review is about treatment by TSA and Southwest's apparent lack of concern.My wife and I, both in our mid-70's, have flown out of Terminal one numerous times over the years.  However, on a trip to visit grandchildren in the Bay Area in October, I was pulled out of the line by a TSA supervisor and thoroughly examined by what I think was a TSA trainee. The supervisor watched the exam, which included patting down my T-shirt, rear end, and private parts in front of 20 or more other waiting passengers.  The supervisor never took his eyes off of me during the entire examination. Right or wrong, I feel like I was selected for the ""full Monty"" treatment because I am an older white male.  At best, it was perhaps a crude attempt to demonstrate that they don't profile passengers for enhanced inspection. Even if I am mistaken, this type of examination of anyone should be done in a private area, not in front of other passengers.Needless to say, this was highly embarassing and I am still disturbed about this undeserved treatment.  My complaint to Southwest on their standard email asking me to evaluate the flight went unanswered.This is likely to be my last flight on Southwest out of San Diego. Terminal One is and for years has been absolutely awful, one of the worse we have seen anywhere in the U.S., and this incident was the final straw."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,NonStop preferred,"Key points:  1) digitally check-in 24 hours prior to flight time (not boarding time) in order to get your queue number; 2) if in Group C, just take the first seat you see.  Don't waste people's time looking for two empty seats; 3) on ANY flight to Orlando, a couple should not expect to have an empty seat between them."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Orlando to Pittsburgh 11_6,"This a great place to fly into for visiting friends in eastern Ohio. Flights are cheaper and the airport is well done, lots of shops and restaurants. Easy to navigate."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,The only airline I use,"Every leg of my flight was on time. The flight crews were attentive and friendly. Having no extra fees for checked bags and the ability to change flights while paying only the difference in fares is huge, since some airlines charge even for carry-ons. The fare comparison calendar on the website makes getting the best fare and schedule so easy. While there is no assigned seating, I find the seating process goes very smoothly, and while no airline has great legroom, they have more than many others. I did pay for early bird seating this time because I got such a great fare, but typically I check in myself online, wind up in the B group, and have no trouble getting a window or aisle seat. They are also very accommodating for passengers needing assistance and pre-boarding."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Vacation,Southwest is my favorite. Never a problem so far. Have been flying with them for many years.  Enjoyed!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Cancun Flight!,"The flight from Austin to Cancun was seamless! From boarding in Austin, to landing in Cancun (early arrival by 30 min as well), everything was great! The flight attendants were kind and entertaining, but most importantly we were ON TIME! I always recommend Southwest (for business and pleasure) and I'm looking forward to flying again soon."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Seriously amazing airline,"I fly southwest frequently. I often love the flight attendants for their spinal and humor to make everyone’s flying experience fun. On this particular flight back from Las Vegas, when we were about 30 minutes from landing a passenger prices that another passenger started having a seizure and called for help. The attendants rushed down the aisle to assist. I was very impressed with how responsive they were with the situation. Thankfully another passenger was a RN and was able to help. The flight attendants notified the captain right away. He came over the speaker to notify everyone that we would be making a medical emergency landing and that paramedics would  Be boarding upon arrival at the gate. I’ve never experienced something like this but I can say that southwest handled it with ease and professionally. It took 15-20 minutes to land and we were at the gate faster than I’ve ever seen. The attendants made sure to get the passengers items for her and once she was off safely they announced de boarding of the plane. After exiting the plane it made me feel good that Southwest Airlines puts customer safety first and that they genuinely care as a company to make things like this happen without a hitch."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Traveler Friendly,Southwest gives the best value and most pleasant experience. The crew seems to enjoy their work. I do miss the peanuts.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A great low cost airline,"I love the way they board people..No selling seats.. You board in the order you check in and then you sit where you like, in any available seat.. The crew are great, friendly and they have a good sense of humor. And your baggage (up to two checked bags)  and one carry on fly free!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving Flight,Very good service and flight. Transfer of luggage waws very good. Frequenty flier miles ueed and aside from the taxes. all was good.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Surprised by space,"Returning home on a Sunday night when the Chiefs were in New England meant that fewer passengers were leaving KC.  The flight arrived late from its previous airport and the pilot tried to make up some of the lost time.  The rapid decent upon approach gave everyone ear problems.  I did have a row all to myself which allowed me to lay down.  I like SW in general, and this flight had its good and bad."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,New Orleans,My flight to New Orleans was great and comfortable. As always the airplane is aleway'sclean. The crew is always so nice.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Safety in the skies,"I enjoyed an early morning flight to Phoenix last Thanksgiving. I recommend others to go early in the morning because there is no traffic and very lea time. Checking in bags was no problem and the lines were small. TSA was also light on their feet (could you imagine that?). The flight had a small delay for safety reasons, but the ride was swell. The flight attendants were acomodating even when a passenger got a little bent out of shape about his electronics issue wasn't convenient for him. Boom, got an extra Ginger ale. BW"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always a Great Experience,Southwest provides a consistently great experience. Being able to check your bags in for free and already having great rates is a real blessing to frequent travelers.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Even worse than Air France!,"The flight crew was excellent on the four Southwest flights, but the planes sounded as though they were about to fall from the sky.  Also, the seats are cramped in all directions (e.g., sideways, forward).Southwest's response to my complaint about its HP assistance for the flight that arrived at Logan suggests that it couldn't care less.  As such, I'm considering escalating my complaint to the Federal regulatory agency.I'd rather walk than fly on Southwest again.  Southwest makes Air France seem like luxury!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Only 45 people on board, 130 empty seats.","2 hour flight, great landing. some turbulence at beginning, but subsided after 10 minutes. Attendents were very accomadating and courteous."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Uneventful but comfortable flight,"Southwest is consistent, if nothing else.  The crew often have a good sense of humor, which helps ease the stress of cramped seating and storage space, as any airline has today.  The flight from Norfolk VA to BWI was smooth (about 50 minutes, gate-to-gate)"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best ride in the past few years!,"Our flight attendant was smart and funny, kept us focused and amused. The service was far better than what we have experienced with their competitors, far more individual attention.I’ll use them when possible from now on."
n/a,50,My favorite airline to fly!,"I have been flying to Vegas once a year for my birthday since 2013 and have always flown Southwest out of Baltimore (BWI).  As in previous years, my check in and boarding was a breeze.  When i booked the flight, the website told me it would be a 5 hr. 25 min flight, but once boarding we were told the flight would only be 4 hr 30 min. Bonus!!  The flight attendants were pleasant and friendly and really seemed like they enjoy their job!  I will contonue to fly SWA when possible"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Not fair to have only half a seat!,"Do you see any room on this row for 2 other people?!If you are going to take up two seats you should pay for them!My husband and I had to share one seat because this lady was all over mine. It was impossible to use the table in front of me or to access my personal items stowed under the seat in front of me. In addition, my seat was broken and would not recline.We endured only because we are slender, but it was absolutely unfair and definitely UNCOMFORTABLE!Don’t know if we would ever fly with them again unless it’s in business class.PS We have had previous issues with this airline, but they gave us comp tickets to compensate so we tried them again. Hmmmmm?!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,75th birthday celebration,On time and crew was friendly ad helpful. Will always take southwest as my first choice in airlines!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,the best airline for the money from ict to most anywhere,"No airline is really wonderful, but Southwest is the best of the airlines available. I really like the cost ot fly, no baggage extra cost, consideration for seniors, extra space for large people, best airline leaving from Wichita, KS"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A Most Accommodating Airline,Southwest Airlines is a no hassle company in terms of changing flights. Call them on the phone and its accomplished immediately. And I've never had trouble with flight delays. And oh yes----two check-in's are allowed.
n/a,30,Late departures! ,"I love Southwest for the convenience of flying in California, but was very disappointed that both flights (going to LA and returning) were both about an hour late and neither were weather related! They're ruining their on time statistics!😕"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Late, but more than made up for it","Our flight out of LAX left 2 hours late, then when we got into Phoenix, the jetway wasn't working.  Another 1/2 hour delay. But a couple days after we got home Southwest sent both my husband and I a $300 voucher each for our inconvenience.  I have never had an airline do that for a delayed flight.  Southwest rocks!!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Uneventful flight with great crew.,Our flight departed and arrived on time. The crew was friendly and delivered services efficiently. Enjoyed the chief flight attendant's humor which is something that I look forward to on a Southwest flight.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Where given a voucher for a flight delay with our asking,"The airline I would always choose when available.  Free luggage, no charge to change flights or cancel.  Always treated fairly and with courtesy"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Never any issues,"I never have any issue when flying Southwest. I enjoyed our flight straight through, no layovers. Flight attendants are always pleasant."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,The Usual,"Used Southwest for out Vegas trip. I was pleasantly surprised to find the plane was not full. Seems to be a big difference when I have more room. Plane was on time both directions for the most part. The trip back was smoother as usual. I don't enjoy flying, but the lack of congestion was as good as it gets."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Awesome airline,"Great flight, awesome service and you get to pick your seat. 2 bags for free, just wish they flew from more airports."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Straight forward, Friendly Service","Always have good flights from South West.  I like the 50 lbs per bag, 2 bags allowed free policy.  Staff is always friendly"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,I think I shrunk,"Couldn't get anymore on this plane.  I have been cramped before, but WOW !! This was cramped.  I think even my fingers ached at being so constrained."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,More Comfortable & Reliable,"In October/ November, we did 4 flights on Southwest. We tend to choose this airline for all of our domestic travel. We rely on comfort of the seats (compared to Economy class on other airlines), free checked bags, punctually and reliability. These flights, though taken during a bad weather period, were no exception. Known as a discount airline, the fares these days are comparable, if not higher, than other big airline companies. Nevertheless, we do intend to continue to fly Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Friendliest Skies,"Every time I fly a different airline I regret it. Southwest always has pleasant, helpful staff. This flight was no exception. Everyone has cheerful, happy to help and quick with a joke."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Organized cattle drive,"I used to enjoy flying. Now I feel like just one of the herd on a cattle drive. Yee Haw! I arrived and returned safely. When making reservations online, I did feel it was misleading to charge more for business class, which I did not opt for. Because when you board the plane, if you've ever flown SW, you'll know that all the seats are the same.I did end up paying $25.00 extra for departing and return flights in order to be toward the front of the boarding herd. Was it worth it? Maybe. Maybe not. I have extreme allergies to colognes and perfumes. As in, I can't breathe if someone near me is perfumed up. (and why people have to splash it on before getting in a confined space with others who have allergies is beyond my comprehension).  I make up a little sign, worded politely, informing people who may choose to sit by me of my allergy.(as an aside, HEY SOUTHWEST, WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME?  You accommodate people that need support animals and ultra-large people who need 2 seats. What about me also with a legit health issue???)Anyway, my purchase of $25.00 to get on earlier moved me up in line about 100 people. But someone who had been 100 people in back ended up sitting next to me.SW personnel are allowed to ""try"" to be funny and some actually succeed. Most should never think about quitting their day jobs and becoming comedians.One more note, when 737 MAX are allowed to come back into service, I will take an alternate flight or airline to avoid that. In my view the public was lied to. In my research, I found that an earlier version of the MAX for the military included safety features that were deleted for the public passenger version in order to save money. SW and other airlines should put passengers ahead of profits.  I do not trust the 737 MAX and those in power who foisted it on the unsuspecting and trusting public."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,nice flight,"I always fly southwest when I can. the people are very nice and work very hard to make your flight a good experience,"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest is the only way to fly to Maui,"We flew from Houston to Maui with one stop in Oakland on Southwest Airlines and we were so glad we did. The 737-800 that Southwest uses to fly between Hawaii and the mainland provides spacious seating that you only experience on the other airlines when you fly First Class. As usual, the staff was pleasant and the flights were on schedule.  And Southwest doesn’t charge for you to check a bag. If you want to fly comfortably to Hawaii without paying for first class seats and paying to check luggage, we recommend Southwest Airlines. We fly Southwest every chance we can."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,High guest service!!!,Wonderful experience Thanks for excellent services I’m very happy !!! On time and flight was relaxed Good job!!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Great flight, helpful attendants","First time I've flown since 2005 and all of the new TSA regulations. Was surprisingly easy and the attendants were helpful. Even with the transfer, it was easy and uneventful."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Round Trip Kansas City to Baltimore,"Flew roundtrip with my wife from Kanas City to Baltimore on sequential Saturdays.  Did not take the Early Bird option.  We checked in as soon as we could and, on both flights, got boarding numbers in the ""mid B"" range.  No issues with overhead availability.  We each checked a bag, for free.  Courteous staff, adequate seats, no power connections/USB ports on board.  Overall a very good experience.  We fly SW when we can in the US.  Usually good prices and reliable service."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Two bags still fly free,"Having sampled several other airlines in the past year, I still claim Southwest is the best, few delays, great staff, and simple seating as long as you remember to log in 24 hours before a flight, or pay $15 for earlier choice seating.  Southwest is still the best.Dtew"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best airline in America,"It is so much more relaxing to fly Southwest, because we always pay for the Early Bird option.  We also have their Visa Card, and accumulate miles--last year enough to be rewarded the companion fare."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Can't beat the price...,"Fpr the money ad sevice you can;t beat the price...especially since there's no up charge for bags and carryons. 2 hours and 20 minutes Tampa to Hartford. A little longer coming back, but it was the last flight of the day (left artford at 9:20PM) and there were only 68 poeple on board. No hassle!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,When will Wheelchair Passengers become a Priority???,"Ever since Walmart became the leader in inventory control, consumers have enjoyed having products on the shelves. Why can't airlines and terminals get it right when preparing for passengers needing wheelchairs. The arrival destination is advised or should be advised when the plane takes off. They should know how many passengers need wheelchairs. Why is it a surprise when the plane arrives? We had to wait almost one hour for wheelchair assistance and were told that the chair pushers ""did not know,"" ""had worked already a ten-hour day,"" lacked chairs,"" and ""lacked staff."" The pilot and co-pilot actually pushed us up the arrival ramp, perhaps so the next flight could board and depart on time.If this only happened once, well it is an exception. But it now happens seemingly everytime we travel. Airlines have come a long way on delivering on-time arrivals. But when you have to wait an hour to get your bag and fo go home, it makes flying a stressful activity. With an aging population, this can only get worse if the issueis not addressed!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Saved by a last minute change to OAK,"Had to get to Sf for a 1:00 luncheon and learned when we got to the airport that our flight to SFO was delayed by 2 hours. Fortunately, Southwest alerted us by text message as soon as the delay was known and was able to get us onto the next flight into Oakland. I will always book into OAK instead of SFO going forward, since SFO gets fog and more frequent delays."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest...awesome as usual,"As usual Southwest delivered. Love their customer service, ease of check in and their friendly flight attendants.  My trip out was direct into Austin.  Coming home we connected through Houston.  The trip to Houston was so fast they started taking drink orders before we left the tarmac.  I always chose Southwest when I can.  I love their check in and self seating. I don't like to fly and the flight crews always make feel more comfortable."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good flight,"I love flying Southwest because each passenger can check two bags for free. I didn’t rate 5 stars because I dislike the non assigned seating. Mostly because people save seats and no one says anything to them. We always purchase early bird seating and it is frustrating when someone cheats and gets on early and saves a seat. I feel like if my husband and I did that, we would get “caught” and made to stop saving the seat. The on time rate for this airline is pretty good, although we have experienced delays before."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Flight,"It is definitely not first rate, but for the money, this can't be beat.  The attendants are always upbeat and friendly.  I fly Southwest whenever possible and have never had a bad experience."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Crowded flight works out,Flight was very crowded but flight attendants were very good at keeping everyone satisfied.  The pilot cut in several times with viewing info about the area we were flying over
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Best airline....if you are into a relaxed fun vibe!,The flight was bumpy because on bad weather on the eastern seaboard. The Pilot kept us informed. A member of my party had air sickness and the flight attendants were attentive but was still able to prioritize safety.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Inexpensive, routine, easy","Nothing special.  Got a real bargain, flight was comfortable and uneventful. Check-in was easy, Not much to eat on board but not expected."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Southwest Airlines... Simply the best!,"Southwest Airlines is simply the best airline to fly... fast boarding and attentive, friendly staff. I always feel appreciated when I fly Southwest Airlines! Thanks to the flight crews that make flying Southwest a pleasurable experience!!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,By far the best domestic airline,"Over my 40+ years of very frequent business flying I have at one time or another been loyal the three of the legacy airlines. As their service went downhill and their nickel dimeing increased I gradually shifted both my business and personal travel to Southwest and for the past 15 years or so have flown only them when possible. Southwest has pretty much everything you could ask for in an airline and they far outshine the legacy airlines. Their flights pretty much run on time. Their boarding process in quick and efficient, greatly helped by the fact you can check up to two bags free which eliminates the eternal hassle of trying to find overhead space which you get on other airlines. Their people are friendly and helpful and seem to enjoy their jobs. You can change you flight due to unforeseen circumstances without the cost and hassle of other airlines and you can actually use your frequent flyer points. Their seats are comfortable and you don’t feel packing in like a sardine. I don’t know why anyone would fly the unfriendly sky’s of other domestic airlines."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Satisfied Customer,"Our flight to Louisville, Kentucky was on time, smooth and comfortable.  The Flight Attendants were friendly, professional and efficient.  We had no issues."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great flight,"We like traveling with Southwest because of the points acquired, check in, easy to book flight, and fights are fairly good price."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Airline of choice!,I have travel on Southwest airline for a few years now and I must say it is my airline of choice. The staff that I have encountered are friendly and willing to assist with my requests. I mostly appreciate the fact that Southwest airlines makes it simple to fly without all of the added charges for this that. I also appreciate the price choices available for the flights.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Trip to Tucson AZ,"I fly Southwest when  ever the flight is under 3 hours, the seats are not that conferrable for flights over that amount of time, they are not the cheapest but they are handy for most destinations.  overall if it were not for the seat room they would be a lot more comfortable."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great crew and flight - on time,The cabin crew was great and very helpful.  They were very courteous and caring.  Helped passengers put luggage into overhead bins and helped remove it when we landed.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flights to and from Nashville,"Being disabled, using a walker, Southwest takes care of me.  Check in was aided by a Southwest employee, from obtaining baggage tags, going to the counter to check the luggage and check in, the employee was with me, helping.  The next step took a little longer, when I had to wait for a porter to get me a wheelchair and take me through security, which was streamlined because of my disability.  I would never have been able to negotiate the long lines.Once at the gate, I was allowed pre-board status, my walker was tagged so that I could use it all the way to the door of the plane.  As a ""Customer of Size"" I also require an extra seat, i.e., my body will not fit between the arms of the seats.  To not impose on other passengers, you are allowed an empty seat.  I sat next to the window both directions and enjoyed the views.Once we landed in Nashville, it took very little time to get my walker up so that I could leave the plane.  It took a little while for the porters to get there with wheelchairs (there were five of us needing them on that one flight), but the porter took me all the way to baggage claim and even went in the back to try to get my bag from there.  He couldn't find it so I finally let him go.  My companion had met me from another flight, so we took it from there.On the return trip, the disability arrangements in the Nashville airport was not as well organized as in Houston.  We were told where to go to check in, but because we misunderstood, it was considerably longer than necessary.  Without someone walking us through the process, it was very confusing.  When we were finally checked in and baggage checked, we were sent to an area of chairs to wait for porters to help with wheelchair assistance.  Yes, it was a busy Monday afternoon, but there were just not enough porters around to help.  It took almost an hour before we were taken through security and to the gate where our flights were leaving.The return flight to Houston was uneventful, and the porters in Houston were numerous and plentiful, so it took no time to get my baggage and out to be picked up by my hotel shuttle back to my car."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Southwest usually great, but....","Usually, Southwest is great with everything, customer service, check in, etc. However, I have to say that the on flight crew, mostly one flight attendant, is very unfriendly, almost has a snarl in his expression. I, unfortunately, encountered him several times as I needed to use the restroom more than once, and got up to stretch my legs another time. I usually say hi and smile to the fly attendants, but I didn’t dare say anything to him. He told me coldly that I could not wait in the back of the airplane for the bathroom, which I understand, but the manner in which he expressed himself was almost to point of rudeness. My husband said he had the same experience. I have encountered this flight attendance once on another flight and his attitude was the same on both flights. It’s too bad one bad apple poisons the whole cart."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Southwest - Basics, but good at it!",Southwest Airlines is a good airline at a good value.We fly Southwest a couple times a year and they have really become our exclusive airline.The prices are always good and the open seating is a plus for us.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Business and Pleasure,"great flight, easy boarding and deplaning, love that you get two free bags, price was very competitive without all of the add ons"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Routine flight to Ft. Myers,Plane was jammed full but loaded efficiently by SW. and arrived on time although departure was 15 minutes late.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy and on time,"Flight was on time, plane was clean, In flight entertainment worked and it was a direct flight. I was in boarding group A. The plane was completely booked. People at the end did not have room for their luggage and had to gate check."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,on time and not too crowded,"We fly Southwest all the time. They are great for travelers - free checked bags, easy boarding, no fees to change flights. These are nice perks and I hope they never change. Our flight to New Jersey was on time and uneventful. The crew was pleasant and the plane was not completely full. Sometimes the planes are filled but the crew always seems to manage that with a smile.Note - Southwest announced it won't fly to Newark (EWR) anymore. Instead, Southwest added flights to / from LaGuardia (LGA)."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Flight,Great quick flight non stop from Lubbock to Las Vegas. I try to fly Southwest Airlines as much as I possibly can when my route allows it. Always great service.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Las Vegas rest and relaxation,Southwest is the best in customer service. Never had an issue with Southwest. No nonsense...no extra charges airline.
Date of travel: June 2019,30,Flight to San Francisco,I traveled to SFO for an event. The flight was delayed for 30 minutes. That was not a huge issue as I fly 48 weeks a year for over 18 years so delays do not bother me. When I sat down at a seat I notice trash on the floor and the seat pocket was full of trash. I tried to way a flight attendant over but they would not stop as they were boarding people. I like American airlines and who I try to fly and now I know why. Southwest let me down.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good service and ground support..,Love the free extra bag.. Very good ground service with wheelchair assistance in boarding the aircraft and assistance on placing carry on bag above the seat.. Much appreciated..
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Convenient and Friendly,"I have over 500k miles with United, American and Alaska.  I was Summit with Frontier but fly mostly Southwest now.  Alaska is still my favorite, but being based in Denver, that's not an option for me.   I have had some not nice service encounters with United although they seem to be friendlier these days.Southwest offers affordable options with direct flights to most major cities out of Denver.   I have A-List preferred so my wife flies free if she wants to join me on a work trip which is also very nice for vacations"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Family Visit,Great flights. Both legs were on time. No long wait at counter to check in and service was on par with what I am used to with Southwest. I have come to really like flying Southwest becasue of their service and equipment that they fly. I really like to convenience and option of earlybird checkin which makes things so much easier. Connections in Dallas are a breeze and the Love Field terminal has a lot of immenities that are great. Much easier to make connections than in some of the much larger airports.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always on time!,"Love Southwest. The BEST thing about Southwest is the fact that if you have to change your flight--they do not charge you the cheating, gouging fees that the other airlines do.  If you cancel, you can save the funds for a future flight.  If you change, you need to pay the fare at the time of your change (which is only fair!) but no extra fees.  On some airlines, by the time you pay their ""change"" fee, you may as well throw out your ticket.  This is why Southwest is the best, most fair and decent company."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,WE  LOVE  SOUTHWEST !,We love Southwest and bags fly free ! Makes a big difference when most other airlines charge up to $50.00 per bag. Learn the Southweat proceedures so you know what to expect at the airport. My thoughts as a seasoned SW customer...Book as early as possible and check in as soon as possible...If you are going to carry-on please try to keep items to a minimum and pack light to allow everyone to board quickly and have some space for their items.. It's not really an inconvience to check your bags and you won't have to carry the through security and lug them to the gate. SW  is usually pretty quick getting your bags out to you at your destination.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,horrible seats,"I like Southwest overall. I jumped on the confirmation at the microsecond it opened, and got B24. I'm unsure how any of the C list people found seats, as I was relegated to the last row. But I was happy enough to have a window.Unfortunately. the seat was much smaller than normal and was part of a ""squeezed - in"" row added in a redesign, so the curve of the plane wall took up arm space. Also, my tray table was broken so I couldn't even distract myself with tabletop activities. 4 hours of discomfort!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,First flight in 40 years,Smooth operator best describes the Soutwest Airline pilots. The Southwest Airlines crews from check-in to departure and arrival were great! Thank you Southwest Airlines. Job well done.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,A little rest and relaxation on the beach,As I book this trip to fly down with Southwest everybody thought that I was crazy. But why not fly with American. And honestly for the couple of more hours it took for me to get there because I’m having to land in Houston. It was well worth it. Either way you go it’s a short trip from DFW to Cancun.When the price was an effective one with me. To get one to price match with American I would’ve had to gone to Florida and then back to Cancun. No thank you
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest is awesome,The flight was great they do an incredible job if you have to change your plans at the last minute you can return your ticket and get another one they let you check two bags for free with Southwest you don’t need to go through all the crap like the other airlines.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,FLYING TO LAS VEGAS,"As always, flight was very good and on time. The crew were very couteous and very efficient as always."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Smooth travel experience,"Both legs of our flight were smooth and we had on time arrivals. Pleasant flight attendants. The luggage even came down in a timely manner when we arrived in Detroit, which has never happened for me. I do hope this was the beginning of a new practice in customer service at the Detroit airport. It is much appreciated."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always a pleasure to fly SW,We have always enjoyed SW.  This trip flew PVR to Houston.. Houston to Stl with change plane in Dallas. Leaving Dallas booked solid....Twenty nine people took the flight from Dallas to St Louis and the flight crew was exceptional. Wanted everyone to spread out and be comfortable.We love SW for its companion pass.
Date of travel: June 2019,40,Flight was on time,"There was a little bit of difficulty in Ft Lauderdale, because I needed a wheelchair for my Mom. I had to go inside to get some one from the airport, and then switch her into a SWA. wheelchair.Also I had Royal CaribbeanCruise do our boarding passes, and they were not for Pre-board access."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest Thanksgiving Trip,"Polite staff, never had issues with checking in luggage or boarding. When I fly other airlines, I seem to have issues, but Southwest is on point!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Simply the best airline,"I flew to Denver on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, and back on Saturday the same week. Both flights left in the evening and arrived quite late.Both flights were completely full. The Southwest method of seating, where you grab a seat you like rather than having one preassigned, made for far more efficient boarding/unboarding. Despite there being so many people on each plane, the crews were attentive and friendly, and everyone on board seemed to have room for their carry on luggage. In addition, the seats are big enough so your knees are not in your face.The planes were clean, the flights on time, and the luggage policies are the best in the industry. Southwest is my airline of choice any time they serve my destination."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Coast trip,"The flight was easy from check in, to deplaning. The crew was very kind. Plane was clean and roomy. Would definitely recommend Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Reasonable rates and on time,We’ve flown with Southwest to Cabo for 6 years.  Every flight has been on time.  They are so efficient in keeping on schedule.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,LOVE Southwest,"We always fly Southwest if possible - no baggage fees, staff is great - fun and friendly, and the flights are normally on time or early."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,The best one to fly unless . . .,"I have always enjoyed southwest airlines personally.  I love not having to pay for baggage or carry-ons.  The service is great and they are very good about letting you change your flights around.  This however, is NOT true if you are flying with a group and have made group reservations.  The bags are still free, but if you want to change your flight dates, they are much more uncooperative.  We had a group of 8 going to Cancun and wanted to leave Cancun one day later but keep our same departure date.  We were told that we would have to pay for new flights and the old ones would not get reimbursed. I was shocked!  We ended up keeping our same dates and rearranged our trip internally to make it work."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Vegas Trip With Brother,Originally booked a flight from Dallas to Denver and on to Vegas. The Denver flight had a problem and was going to arrive an hour late in Denver. Our connecting flight to Vegas was leaving in 45 minutes from our original flight arrival so we were going to miss our connection. We were rebooked on a direct flight to Vegas from Dallas and given $200 each ( $400 total)  in Southwest travel vouchers.We arrived Vegas an hour and half later than our original arrival time .  Flights were great and Southwest really took good care of us after the problem.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,It is what it is,"Who can complain about Southwest?  Decent fares, friendly employees and no extraneous charges.  It is what it is."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Why spend the extra money?,"It seems like the seats keep getting smaller. Both flights going to and returning from Orlando were full. On the return flight there were only a couple of seats open. At home the night before my return flight I sat with my computer on my lap with all my info already entered on the screen . As soon as it was at the 24 hour moment I hit the send key and still ended up in the B seating. What really annoys me though is they board all the people in wheelchairs (when the plane landed almost all of them jumped up and walked quickly off the plane) then the “A” group then family and then the “B” group. So they try to get more people to pay the extra money so they can board in the “A” group. I understand some people in wheelchairs truly need the help something needs to be done to stop all the people that just say they need the wheelchair but really don’t .  So if that’s the case I might as well fly Frontier and fly much cheaper. Why pay more and still not be able to sit with my wife ,Frontier is my next flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Beat airline for point to point travel.,Southwest always performs. It is a no frills airline but so are other airlines. I used to travel airlines with guaranteed seats but am tired of having to change planes at airports. What has worked for me is traveling Sothwest and renting a car to get to my destination.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,My Southwest Airlines flight was excellent!,This was a typical Southwest Airlines flight for me!  The flight was delayed 15 minutes due to bad weather (not typical) but the flight crew made up the time and then some by getting us to Las Vegas 10 minutes earlier than the scheduled arrival time.  I was happy to see that Southwest streams recent movies on your device if you download their app.  I did this before boarding the plane and enjoyed watching The Avengers: End Game for the majority of the flight.  The leade flight attendant was funny enough to have his own Las Vegas comedy show!!!  LOL
Date of travel: October 2019,50,The best way to fly,"We fly Southwest whenever they fly where we are going.  We fly quite often since our daughter and family moved to Colorado and we like everything about Southwest:  2 free checked bags and free carry-on's;  a generous rewards program; plenty of free snacks and beverages; free in-flight entertainment; no charge for flight changes.  We are fine with the open seating - we just check in right away at 24 hours before departure and we are always able to board in time to get window-middle seats together.  If we didn't do timely check-in we could pay extra to get at the front of the boarding line.  Interesting, the extra cost is less than the extra we paid to select seats before checking in at the airport, the last time we flew American. As an extra bonus it is not unusual to get flight attendants who are humorous.  By the way, the flights to and from Nashville were fine.  All good!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great airline service,Pleasant round trip with caring and supportive service is my top priority! With this kind of service makes me want to go back again. It is very important to me that we have safe trip.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Trip back to DC from New Orleans.,"Great flight. Still not a fan of the festival seating, or how crowded the boarding area is due to the way you have to line up. But the staff were super friendly, very attentive during the flight. We had great flying weather, the cabin was decent, and clean. Things were on time, and I got home safe. You cant ask for much more in a flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Unaccompanied minor program,"My 11 year old flew alone for first time. They let me walk to gate with her. Great program. Safe and reliable. Very organized with pick up and drop off. If you ever have a child flying alone, I recommend southwest as the best!!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Great Airline, Great Service, Great Price","We always fly Southwest to New Orleans.   They always have time frames to choose from. We always fly early in the morning and with the hour you gain, we arrive early enough in the morning to have the entire day.   They are friendly, economical (bags included); and if you pick the Wanna Getaway rate it's usually well priced."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Never use another airline,Always experience a friendly staff and clean aircraft. They love going above and beyond for their passengers.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Easy and stress free.,I always fly Southwest. Great prices and free bags (2). The flight attendants are always friendly and some are just down-right entertaining!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Always fun in flight,"Love the LUV airline. The fact that they allow their employees to make decisions at the point of impact allows for best passenger convenience. They have done many amazing things for us one the years. Staff is not only friendly, but helpful, and they offer more nonstops from our city (KC) than any other airline. Fast boarding and unloading, no luggage fees, and lots of smiles make this our 1st choice in flying!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Southwest experience,This was my first time using Southwest due to it’s direct fly service.  The company used open seats assignment so there is no seat selection available.  The overall process was smooth and passengers seems know the boarding process. I just followed crowd and was told to seat any where available by an attendant.  The flight was on time and service was ok compare to other airlines that I used before.  I will use the airline in the future because its price and direct flight service.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Did a round the South east excursion,"I did the grand tour of the Southeast part of the US. We stopped off at San Antonio to visit family, then Atlanta to a friends wedding in Florida and then a visit to another friend in Columbus, GA. Had a grand time and the flight via Southwest was top-notch in my book. Thank you."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Visiting Ft Lauderdale,"We have used other airlines for our travels in the past, but for the most part we use Southwest Airlines. In our many trips we have never had any problems with our flights. This trip was no different. Friendly, efficient staff, on the ground and in the air. Arriving earlier than expected is always a good thing! We will continue to use Southwest!"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,sucks as usual,"Waited on the tarmac for an hour at SAN awaiting clearance to depart.  People jammed one upon another.  Less than friendly staff and attendants.  Further, they offer few non-stops to anywhere most people need to fly into.  Pathetic is an understatement."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Southwest to and from San Diego - a good experience,"Our family of four grownups recently made a round trip from Kansas City to San Diego (stops in Phoenix and Denver). Everything went well.  The revised boarding process (at least 'new to me') went much better than the old 'cattle call' days. Seats were comfortable and the aircrew and ground crews were quite nice and helpful. All in all, a nice trip to and from San Diego."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Very sick child,"My daughter became  and the flight attendants were amazing, extremely calm, and helpful at the same time."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,I have only flown for two trips!,"With this being my first and second only flying experiences, the flight attendants helped me be at ease.  On the second trip home, had a little turbulence and the ladies could tell I was getting a little freaked out.  ""Keep watching me.  If i act like it's no big deal, then you're ok too.""   And guess what, I made it safely.  A little freaked out, but I made it.  :)"
Date of travel: January 2019,40,Round trip from Denver to San Francisco,"Employees are friendly and efficient. My complaints would be the large number of dogs on board (one of which took up much of the flight attendants attention). Can they ALL be support animals? There are no first class seats on their flights and the small amount of leg room provided is darn near painful, which I suppose is a problem on most airlines today."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Hassle free as always,"Smooth from start to finish. I wish the pilots would speak up when they make an announcement, always hard to really hear it."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight during Thanksgiving week!,"I had dreaded flying Thanksgiving week because it is such a busy travel season, and there is always a weather event to gum things up further. However, this flight was a delight. The plane was full, but the flight attendants were just awesome! There was the right touch of humor in the announcements, and the service was done with great humor and efficiency. The pilots were great at keeping us informed of any changes. Love Southwest!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,I LUV SWA,"I love Southwest and fly it whenever I can.  I book early and checkin early usually, so am not bothered by the seating process (no assigned seats).  Our flight departed promptly and arrived on time both directions.  Southwest staff tend to be lighthearted and friendly!  Pricing is usually very competitive and often lower than other airlines if booked at the right time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great straight flight!,"So happy that Southwest has a direct flight to Austin.  Traveling with kids, this makes life a lot easier!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,many good flights,"We have flown 8 times a year on Southwest for last 12 years. Always on time, always good service, always nice flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Fast Way to Fun,"Southwest's non-stop flight to Las Vegas from Orlando is definitely the way to go.  The flight was ontime, fast, and economical. The service from gate to gate was excellent."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Even High Expectations Met,Took an early afternoon flight from Tampa to Denver on SW #552. I prefer this non-stop and really liked the departure time as it gave us plenty of time to access the airport from our SW Florida location. To top it off there were 30 empty seats and my wife and I benefited from an open seat in our row. Though we passed through some bumpy air and had the drinks service suspended it was only for a short time and we arrived within 10 minutes of our schedule time despite 95 mph headwinds. I expect a lot form SW as they have served me well in the past and this flight met all of my expectations.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Experience!,"We have been flying on Southwest for the last few years and highly recomend them for vacation packages. Booking is easy, flights are always on time, and the prices are very reasonable. We  love not having to pay for checked luggage. And you can book your seat 24 hours in advance."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Short, but nice trip to DesMoine.",Recent trip to Des Moines was without any problems.  My seat was comfortable.  I usually fly a discount airline without much leg or elbow room.  The attendants were friendly and helpful.  I enjoyed my drink and snack.  Look forward to my next SW trip.I still like not paying extra for my bag.  Checking in was fast and efficient.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flight options and sometimes they sing to you,"I fly between Louisville, KY and Baltimore, MD several times per year. This particular trip was for me to guide two friends on the Bourbon Trail in KY. I recommended that they fly SWA simply because of the multiple times the flights fly between the two cities. The attendants were quick to tell up that up to 5 fifths of bourbon could be shipped in check luggage and that you can bring as many bottles as you can carry onto the aircraft as long as you purchased them once you went through TSA screening."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flying experience!,Flew non-stop from Love Field to Minneapolis and it was great!  The staff was excellent.  Made it in 2 hrs and 3 minutes.  Amazing!  Thanks so much for the great service!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,awsome as allways,The flight was great. We left early and even arived early. The attendents were awsome and went out of there way to make me more happy.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,"SW is going down hill,  four flights all with late boarding, dirty floors and the last with equipment issues","We flew SW four times in the past week. All four flights (# 4035,1242,3692 and 1934) boarded late (preboarding started after the expected boarding time, (three of the four delays appeared to be late crew issues) and the planes were dirty (food debris on floors in all 4 flights)On the last flight 1934 on 12/7 Hou to LAS the front bathroom door wouldn't lock and the occupied sign always showed occupied). We generally fly and like SW  but these were some of the more mediocre SW flights, seems like they are not as good as when we flew them last year."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest airlines,Took a flight to Cabo San Lucas. Had a layover in La. The flight crew was such a delight. Flight was on time and it was a smooth ride.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Only lowcost if you stop 2 or more times,"Plane was booked to capacity with very little room.  Unless you pay for early checkin you will be in a middle seat.  2 stops, all 2 flights full!BUT.....Bags fly free :-)"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,It’s so easy to fly SouthWest from Hartford,"I flew the busiest time of the year- just before Thanksgiving. No lines at check in, no lines at Security. The plane took off on time and landed at BWI in less than an hour. Wonderful flight attendants. The luggage came out quickly. Couldn’t ask for anything more."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Plus and minuses,"Gotta love Southwest for their liberal baggage allowance - 2 checked in bags for free, as well as 2 carry-ons. Wow! So if you're going far with a lot of stuff, it's worth it. Their mileage plan with their credit card is pretty good too. But otherwise, yikes! No assigned seats, for one. Make sure you check in the moment that 24 hour advance check-in window opens. You'll still get ""B"" boarding, because some people pay extra for early check-in. (Really?)Next - their seats. Really not accommodating. In fact, quite small. Considering that you never know who you'll be sitting next to, this could really be problematic. Another reason to check in as quickly as possible. The center seat is the last place you want to be.Don't expect direct flights; many destinations require a change of planes. Another issue.For a short, direct flight with a reasonable check-in letter (A or B), Southwest is great. Sit in an aisle seat and take the grandkids loads of presents. For longer flights, consider getting credit cards from other airlines, which wil give you at least one free bag and more comfortable seats, and a choice of where you would like to sit. (Although, in fairness, most airlines now charge for a large portion of their seats, even in the main cabin!)Happy flying!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest A ok!,"Great ticket price(round trip).Flight crews top notch! Seats actually comfortable,all around a nice experience! Will continue to fly with Southwest!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Southwest is my regular means of travel,The flights to and from were just fine as usual..I usually try to stay with Southwest because they seem to have the flights and times that I need for a particular destination...If O am going to Europe I start off SW and then they switch me to Air France and KLM.
n/a,50,Last Flight To Raleigh from Chicago,"This is a very popular flight (#1645) as it leaves Midway at 7:20 pm and arrives in Raleigh at 10:10 pm which allows for a full day in Chicago. I took this flight on October 26, 2019 and it was totally booked. Departure was about 20 minutes late and arrival was about the same 20 minutes late. The gate staff were excellent and well organized for boarding. The Flight crew were very professional and courteous and kept the cabin lights off so people could sleep. No lost baggage so it was a nice flight."
Date of travel: July 2019,30,Best flight crew but....,"The crew is always great, but the seats are getting so small and compact it’s really not comfortable. Everybody feels like they must have the aisle seat...why? It seems I always get stuck in the middle seat...come on southwest please give us back some knee room! It’s really ridiculous and your cheap prices are gone. I’m going to begin using others after my next flight, it will be my last flight!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Little walk from plan to baggage pickup.,The flight was good.  Attendances were very nice.  Just long walks from terminal to pick up baggage.  Older people need more help with this.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,ALWAYS GREAT !!,"Southwest is a great airline to fly with !! I had flown with them for years even before joining their membership. we've have never had a problem with their customer service, flight attendants or anybody which is GREAT !! you don't see southwest dragging people off planes or some of the other crazy stuff you see happening with other airlines. the flight attendants always make the flights funny in some way or another."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,This was a round trip flight that both left on time and arrived early. Planes were both newer and clean. No complaints and the price of $336 was responsible for a weekend stay and non-stop.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love this airline...and their people.,"I usually try to fly Southwest, especially when travelling for business, for three reasons:  they are almost always on time, if I upgrade to early bird status I can almost always get an exit row seat (next best thing to first class), their seats are comfortable and the flight attendants genuinely seem happy you are there.  I guess that's four things.  Could say more but you get the idea.  They don't nickle and dime you to death."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,America's Finest Airline Co.,"Took our usual non-stop to DenverGreat flight, friendly flight attendants, smooth ride...Priced fairly inexpensively after Labor Day."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always a pleasant flight,"I always enjoy flying with Southwest, their crews tend to do their best to keep the passengers entertained in addition to being sure safety is their number one priority."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,no service,"after being delayed, we boarded. Once we took off, we were told there will be no service because the pilot thought this will be a very rough and bumpy ride. And that there will no beverages or snacks served. During the flight, we did not noticed any rough conditions and thus we were not served anything. There was no offer to compensate for this as some airlines will compensate by giving a free beverage or snack on a future flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Timely on and off the plane.,"We had fun and friendly flight attendants. They were so clever in getting people to watch the safety briefing. Saying"" Is this your wallet?"" I like that on longer flights they give yousomething other than pretzels as an option. Nice crew!"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Why I don't fly SWA,"I used to be a fan of Southwest Airlines, but because of all the other options available out of Orlando, I hadn't flow SWA in years. Maybe my experience with the other airlines have jaded my opinion, but I just don't have the same affinity for SWA I used to have. While the open seating plan was a sacrifice I didn't mind making when I was saving tons of money, now that SWA is no longer the cheapest flight, I don't like the idea of having to worry about sitting together or having to pay an extra fee to ""upgrade"" my place in line. Just let me reserve my seats in advanced, please. My second gripe is the ""free internet"" that is (not) available on SWA flights to anyone using an Android device. Neither my wife nor I could use our Pixel phones to connect because Android Chrome blocked the connection as being unsecured. I have read numerous complaints of this issue online, yet SWA still has not fixed it. All around, the experience was not worth paying a premium for, and it appears unlikely that I will fly SWA again."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Southwest Provides Unremarkable Flights —- That’s Good!,"Our flights from Sacramento to Seattle and return over the Thanksgiving holiday were on time and uneventful. We paid extra for first group boarding. We are in our “golden years,” and are willing to buy any comforts we can find.   We think that SW does a good job of managing the flight experience for their customers. Makes one wonder why so many other airlines do such an awful job."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Assisted a family member in moving,"Flights were on time. The staff was nice and friendly. Even though southwest is 1st come, 1st serve, we were still able to get comfortable seats. The flights weren't overbooked."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love 💗 Southwest Airlines,Always a great crew and easy flight when you fly SWA!  This flight was on time and landed softly. Thank you SWA for your service!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Family visit,Great trip. Efficient boarding. Helpful flight attendants. Cabin and restrooms clean.  No problems with flight.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Pleasant, Flight Attendants were very pleasant!",I always fly Southwest because they aim to please every time.  They work to ensure that we all feel safe and they are very pleasant.  The pilot talks to us and it truly is a pleasant experience.  HIGHLY Recommended.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Fort Lauderdale to Paradise,"Fort Lauderdale is a perfect hub on Southwest to the Carribean Islands. Just a Hop, Skip, and a Jump to Grand Cayman! 2 Bags free helps with the Scuba equipment, cameras, and luggage. Southwest is personable, clean, on time and service with a smile! Couldn't be happier. Flying in and out of Lauderdale is an easy accessable airport for customs and immigration and Park 24/7 valet makes pick up and delivery a breeze!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Anniversary trip,No doubt the best airline in America for the money very organized you can bring 100 pounds of luggage for free really good customer service they really put attention to detail 👍🏼
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Cross country flight,"I have become a fan of Southwest Airlines after taking several flights with them  the past few years.  Not only did I get 2 free bags checked and there was no fee to change a flight, their staff were friendly and helpful.  They even came around with free extra drinks and treats, whereas other airlines serve only once.  It also seemed quicker to earn a free flight with my points. I now check with them first when flying! ❤️"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,First time on Southwest Airlines,"Wasn't sure what to expect. Took my sister's advice and checked in online 24 hours prior to flight time.  Got scheduled to be in the middle of the pack when boarding.Interesting way to board, finding your number and standing in line when your group is up next.  Seemed to go fairly easily.  Getting on the plane was smooth since people weren't hunting for their seat number.  My wife and I sat next to a young lady sitting next to the window to fill out the row.  There seemed to be plenty of overhead bin space even with the full flight.  We did not take advantage of the free checked luggage that comes with SW since we're use to traveling with carry-on luggage only.Everyone seemed quite friendly during the trip.  Even the other passengers.Best part, when I went to check-in the website was noting a winter weather advisory for the day we were flying.  This was concerning since we had a bit of a drive to visit family after leaving the airport.  Southwest's check-in page gave us the option of changing our flight to the next day at no charge!  This was a shock to me, never having flown Southwest before.  I've had to pay massive fees for any change on other airlines before.  (on the same note, I had made a typo on my wife's ticket.  The customer service corrected it for me with no problem or charge.  -  I tried this on another airline before with absolute no luck without a massive change fee.)  We changed our flight to the next day with a few clicks online.Only problem I had was one of the other passengers was wearing perfume. Luckily it wasn't too strong and she was around 6 rows away from me, but my eyes were still burning and I had a sore throat from the reaction (allergic to perfumes) by the time we got to Seattle.  Shame there isn't a way for the airlines to control that..."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Affordable and convenient.,"Flights in the US are always crowded and have fees attached. SouthWest is the one that gives you two bags free and no extra fees. Flights are reasonably priced (cheaper than most) and snacks are served but they allow you to bring your meals on board so that you don't have to get by on crackers and water. The only drawback is that most flights have connections so no direct flights. If the weather is bad, southwest is one of the few that will try to make the connections work. Flight attendants are nice and willing to help with almost anything!! They do allow small animals in carriers for a small few, too (no baggage compartment for them)!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Flight canceled,"Unable to get home,  second flight canceled due to maintenance issue! You would think they would know when they are grounding a flight. Drove 8 hours to get home from Baltimore."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Mr,"Excellent service committed totheir customers always. I have flown with them several times even on Buddy Passes, and they always accomodateand try their best to get you where you are going."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Check the model of plane,"I have heard good things about Southwest, this trip was grueling.  Small plane, packed and very uncomfortable seats.  Several people around me said they make the tripOften, and this was the first time they had such a Small plane.  I believe there is a way to see the size of plane you will be flying on.  I will always do that with southwest from now on!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always a great flight,Southwest is always great when I fly and I would use no other airline whenever possible.  They are the only airline that allows free baggage.  There is curbside check in and all of the employees go the extra mile to make their passengers comfortable.  I travel with a walker and have had nothing but pleasant experiences whether I check it in and get a wheelchair to the gate or use it to go to the gate.  If using it to go to the gate it is left before the airline entrance door where they pick it up and put it on the plane.  Once landing it only takes a few minutes to get it from the plane luggage area and bring it to the door of the plane.  I have never had a problem if having to transfer planes with my walker and the service of the airlines is fantastic. The staff is always friendly and helpful from the start to the finish of the flight.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,"The best around, hands down!","The most impressive characteristic my husband and I found was that ALL staff were so positive, friendly and helpful; consistently on our return flight as well. We used to fly with another airline who had options for amenities, however at the beginning and end of a flight you really just want competent and friendly service that makes sense!  Southwest provides this; even considering getting their credit card for some benefits allowed to cardholders.  Keep up the good work SW!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Had desired schedule, no baggage fees","Good flight that actually got in early , baggage arrived unharmed this time on Southwest.  Return flight was late getting off but made it up in the air, so that was good."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best Of The Best,"I Always Fly Southwest, But One Occasion I Had To Fly United... BIG MISTAKE!! Not Only did I Have To Pay $25.00 for One Suit Case, The United Hostess Was Very Short And Rude With Us... If I Can't Fly Southwest, I Won't Go........... Southwest Goes Far And Beyond My Expectation To Make Sure I'm Comfortable Before, During And After My Flight......"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Trip from D.C. to New Orleans,"I fly all of the time, and tend to use different airlines depending on destination. Southwest is nice with no fee for baggage, but I do not like the festival seating they use. It never fails if you are not in the (A) group or one of the other like ten special groups that board first, then you will walk in and see row after row of window and aisle seats filled with nothing but middle seats left. I wish airlines would assign seats and start filling the plane from the rear forward. It would be much more efficient in the long run. But, the staff were nice, not stellar but nice. The flight was rough, but that is not the pilots fault, the weather was just bad. There was a little trash left in my area from the previous passengers that was not cleaned up between flights. A little unusual for Southwest. ."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Smooth Travels over Thanksgiving,"Thanksgiving is always the worst time to travel. Weather typically messes up flights and airlines/airports are overwhelmed with anxious passengers trying to get to family or home for work. That said, I must commend Southwest for four no-hassle flights while traveling from CA to PA and back for Thanksgiving. Our first flight took us through Chicago Midway. Despite heavy winds and a very bumpy ride, Southwest kept us on time (in fact very early). In fact, even though we pushed away from the gate for all of our flights a tad late, we ended up landing either early or on time. Southwest may be no frills, but all the flight attendants were pleasant; all the pilots were skilled; all the gate staff were efficient; and we got from point A to point B and back with no issues! Now that's something to be thankful for."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,YMT National Parks Tour 2019,"We like SW because they are reasonable, no hidden fees, luggage is free, and it is conveniently located away from the crowds."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,I love this airline,"I travel a lot, especially now that I am retired and I can't think of a better airline to fly for a myriad of reasons: a) bags fly for free, b) the flight attendants are fun with great personalities, c) no charge if I change my flight when other airlines charge at least 75 or 100 dollars, and d) they are almost always on time......like I said, there is no better airline to fly."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Keep that flexibility, SW!!","I just wanted to let Southwest know that their flexibility policy keeps me buying every ticket I can on their airline. I strongly need to be able to change flights on short notice and I really resent other airlines’ (you know who you are, Delta) charging me $200 to change my flight. Please keep this policy, SW, and I will keep flying with you!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Everything ok,"I took off safely and landed safely. Those in the front of the plane and those in the back, landed safely as well. We even got there at the same time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy and Quick,As you know Southwest has a great boarding experience. Our flight from Ft Lauderdale to Cancun is one hour twenty minutes airtime. Left at 10am arrived at before noon.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Relax and Enjoy the flight,"I travel a lot since I have to take care of my mom, sometimes, and we also have family in New York that we go visit very often.  Flown many others before & had some issues with flight attendants, sometimes they don't like 1 parent with 2 kids cause it takes a little bit longer to accommodate everything and they got a bad attitude and not willing to help.  Southwest have very nice people working their flights, they joke a lot, free bags and good prices, what else you can ask!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Most fun-loving and accomodating,"Everyone should love their jobs like the employees at Southwest Airlines. It shows and no matter what you have going on, their cheerfulness lightens the burden a little."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Love Southwest Airlines!,"We fly Southwest on most all of our flights (except to Alaska where they don't go).  We always have a smooth check in, lots of help available if needed, and wonderful, friendly staff.  Love that the bags fly free too."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,southwest as usual met our needes,Great airline for domestic flights.  Checked in at exactly 24 hours before and we always have plenty of isle seats to choose from. On this flight they needed two people in one row to give up their seats so family could sit together and was rewarded with free drinks. Staff always friendly.  Prices always competitive and though we did not check bags this time many times we do and it is free.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,great flight,it was great- got in a little early. But they stopped non stop flights now so we will use another airline

Date of travel: November 2019,40,Southwest to Hawaii was a pleasant surprise,"My wife and I took a chance and flew southwest to Hawaii. It was a pleasant surprise. We flew out on their 3rd trip since opening this route. Everything went like clockwork. Our ""short"" flight from Denver to Sacramento was even pretty nice. The 6 hour flight to Honolulu was comfortable and pleasant, Even with the Max8 fiasco in the mix. SW had to juggle planes to put their last generation 737-800's on the route since the Max8 was grounded. It seemed that the seats were larger than we remember from previous flights, their snacks were upgraded and the drinks and beer were free.The cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. Coming back it was shorter due to high tail winds. We had a medical emergency on board and they asked for a doctor or nurse over the intercom. Several people responded immediately and medical emergency was quickly handled with little inconvenience to the rest of us. We would fly with them again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,On Time Even with Snow Story,Weather was horrible but Southwest go us there on time.  Love how quickly you board the plane with Southwest.  Even though you don’t have an assigned seat you do have a number assigned to board the plane.  Because Southwest allows you 2 free checked bags you don’t have a bunch of bags in the overhead bins making loading and disembarking go faster.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,ALWAYS PROFESSIONAL,"Despite a mechanical issue that caused a delay, the pilot and flight crew handled the issue in a most professional manner and kept the passengers informed as to status, etc.  Flight was rough, but we were also told of air conditions till we crossed into Mexico and again once it was safe, service was done.  The check-in process was fast, efficient, and the wheel chair assist to the gate and boarding were smooth."

Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy flight,"We flew from Houston to Costa Rica for a fall break/vacation. Southwest Airlines always makes travel so easy, easy on easy off, flights are usually on time and who doesn’t love two free bags for every trip? We had a lovely vacation and no drama or stress with Southwest Airlines going to or coming from our tropical location"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Wonderful trip to New England,First time flying where I had to take my small dog. Experience was wonderful.

Date of travel: November 2019,40,"flexible seating, but early bird is useless","Buy early bird ticket and hope I can get better seat order, but instead I only got B2 rather in the A class.

Everything went smoothly. I plan on going back to Nashville in June of 2020, and I am choosing Southwest Airlines, again!!👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 If you fly with Southwest Airlines, you will not be disappointed at all; the flight is smooth and the crew was extremely nice!!👍👍👍😄😄😄"
Date of travel: June 2019,20,The plane that wasn't there.,"Arrived at the airport checking before hand that every thing was going on schedule as planned, not so. The plane departure was delayed 5 times, suppose to leave at 9pm and the plane did not turn up till 130am. They chased everyone off the arriving plane and raced us onto it within 30 min.without cleaning it up. I took the train the next time from AZ to IL, much better trip, great scenery, better hospitality, a longer trip but if you have the time, do it."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,good people,"Like flying with Southwest.  The funny thing is on my return evening flight back to Norfolk, the pilot announces the weather will be rough so no service.  There never is rough weather, it is a short flight and they flight attendants would have to rush to get all orders placed.   Just tell the truth."

Date of travel: November 2019,40,Have had several good experiences with SW,"I now buy the early check-in option, it makes the pre trip stress free. Since SW is first check-in, first seated(24 hrs before flight), If you wait until even 23 hrs, you will end up in middle seats, and not together with the rest of your party. I have always found the flight crew polite, and often joking around. The last trip was a first flight for our grandson (to Disney), and he enjoyed the flight almost as much as Disney."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Loved the singing,You just can not go wrong with Southwest. This was the second part of our trip and we traveled on Thanksgiving day. They were such a great crew and loved the singing. Made me feel special. I hope that crew had a wonderful Thanksgiving day once they made it home.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Flight,"So took a flight from PHX to Las. I think we were only in the air for 45 mins and bam we were in Vegas. They had our bags ready for us as soon as we got off the plane. Great and easy flight here, did not cost much ither!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Pretty Nice Airline,"Good trip to Vegas, no surprises.  I'm not a fan of the boarding procedure, but we did OK with just waiting until 24 hours to check in and got pretty good boarding positions.  In the past I have paid the early bird fee and received poor seating compared to friends who just did the 24 hour check in.  So I won't be paying for Early Bird again."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,ON TIME FLIGHT,"Always enjoy flying on Southwest.Although seats are still too narrow and the services are limited, the flights normally have on time departures and arrivals, which is a good thing.,"

Date of travel: November 2019,10,Poor Service,"Worst flight experience ever by Southwest. I was a Southwest loyal customer. While coming home from the Breeders Cup At Santa Anita, I encountered the worst flight attendant ever. This guy did not do his job, was yelling at my wife and I and embarrassed himself by stating he was the “supreme supervisor” on the flight. I reported him to corporate and they issued an apology and the ground supervisor issued us a refund for the flight. Here is a picture of this loser. I will now look to other carriers in lieu of SW."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Cabin Crew makes Holiday Travel FUN!,"LV-based cabin crew served my flight from SMF to SNA. Stan on the PA was cheerful; efficiency of all three attendants took stress out of holiday travel. Despite a forecast of severe storm over northern California, the rain wasn't heavy during the departure. Mild turbulence meant the captain kept the seat beat light on longer than usual. Less than full flight enabled most passengers to have aisle or window seats -- and arm rests! Surprisingly few carry-ons left plenty of overhead cabin space... * jaw drop * Babies & children on this evening flight behaved well too!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,ALWAYS A GREAT FLIGHT,"As always, a GREAT FLIGHT. No need to worry about extra fees for baggage. Cheapest airlines that I have found to fly on. You can get cheaper flights with other airlines, but you end up paying more if you have a suitcase or carryon. I always shop the sales and book my flights at that time. If I book a flight ahead of time, I always check when they have another sale, and rebook if it's cheaper. There are no fees, and I get to use the extra money on another flight within one year. As many times as I've flown Southwest, I have never been disappointed. The service was always top notch. I also love using the miles that I earn for free flights. Thank you Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Watch for short layover times in San Diego airport,"Really did not have any major problems but travelers should be aware that if they fly into San Diego to make a connecting flight they may have to leave the secure area and go through Security again.  If you have a long layover in San Diego you will make your flight but if its a short layover you may have problems, especially over the holidays.r"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest airlines is the way to fly.,"Everyone we dealt with was very nice and accommodating. The flight was uneventful, which is good. I always fly Southwest when I can."
n/a,50,Great service,I really enjoyed this round trip flight. The price was the best I could find. You check in on line and get a letter and number. Line up when call and get the available seats. Awesome! Great attendants. Smooth flight. On time! My favorite airline now! Highly recommended! Keep the good work Southwest!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Reasonably priced comfortable international flight,"We have a large family and with five children do not travel light!  Southwest is our go to airline of choice as the flights are reasonable and they allow up to two suitcases free per ticket. The flights are often full these days but there is adequate room and they do offer free in flight tv and movies. For the best savings on Southwest flights take out a Southwest credit card from Chase. They often have special bonuses for signing up that include enough points for two to three round trip tickets, you just pay for the taxes.   Makes it very affordable if you use the fight points to your advantage!"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Great Service!,Great experience! I highly recommend upgrading to Business Select when traveling (expecially on international flights)! It's well worth it!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Love this Airline,The service on this flight is always excellent.   I travel about 4 times a year to this destination.   Sometimes I have coupons for free cocktails and sometimes we just enjoy a beverage anyway.   The staff at Southwest is always entertaining and fun.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Airline in my area,"I am a frequent flyer on SWA.  In my opinion they are the best Airline serving the Milwaukee Area. Planes are clean, basically comfortable and the staff is excellent and will go out of there way to please.  This is the only airline I fly, have tried the others and am so glad we have SWA.  Also they are generally the most reasonable."
n/a,50,Frequently Prefer SouthWest,"Living in New Mexico, We can get SouthWest flights to many of our travel destinations. Their reliability and on-time record is notable. I have always enjoyed the upbeat manner and often the humor of the Flight Attendants. The equipment in their fleet is up to date. We continue to select them in the mix of carriers as several other Airlines have such awful service records over the last several years of flights."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Southwest Air to Phoenis,"Friendly service, nice not to pay for backage handling, also free wifi off their app so I could watch Ohio State football game live.  Would like a better way to checkin as you have to connect right at 24 hours to get a reasonable spot in the que."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,ABQ - SDF - ABQ,Flights were on time even though weather was a factor on the return trip. Flight attendants were courteous and helpful even thought all the flights were full. Passenger safety was a key concern due to turbulence on all flights.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Though there was a weather-related delay, the flight and the crew were great.","The crew was so apologetic but did everything possible to make the delayed flight a good one. The pilot was able to get us back to Denver in record time anyway, and the flight attendant comped our cocktails!"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Excellent Flight,I have traveled with Southwest Airlines a bunch of times and they have the same great service every time.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,"No longer a fun bargain, just an overly expensive cattle car","Southwest used to be an efficient, fun airline and one put up with the barebones flights with only pretzels because attendants were playful, everyone flying was equal, and the boarding and in-flight management was efficient.  NO MORE.  Yesterday's flight from Philly first to Phoenix and then on to Reno was a nightmare.  This was not an inexpensive flight.  Moreover, now you can fly business, do early boarding, or just be a peasant and take what you get.  Although I chose not to fly business (an extra $365 one way for the same seats and pretzels, just up front of the airline but still with three people on a full flight), I did opt for early boarding, only to find that I was still A 57 and 55.  Moreover, the boarding process was an interminably, slow nightmare, standing around in the flyway waiting forever to step onto the plane.  Gone are the days where people walked to the ""William Tell Overture!""The flight lasted about 4 1/2 hours and was totally packed.  Unless you brought your own food, you were condemned to chips, Lorna Doon or pretzels forever. Moreover, you had to bring your own computer, book or other device if you want any entertainment, as there are no screens on these planes.  Seats are narrow, even for a small person like me, and don't go back well for sleeping. Aisles are narrow and the seat belt sign is kept on to discourage people from standing and stretching (something health experts recommend on longer flights).  The toilets are minuscule and one  has to pity anyone who is overweight or tall.Finally, one has to pity the poor flight attendants who are locked into the pretzel and drink service.  I remember seeing them dressed as Santas or laughing with the travelers.  Sadly, those days are no more.  Instead of having fun, now the job must just be drudgery.All of this would be fine, if you chose Southwest because it was a discount airline, but it is not!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,SWA from MDW to Aruba,"First trip with SWA to an international destination and to be expected it was a long day of travel. There are no (or few) SWA direct flights from MDW to any interantional destination and flights are very limited and sometimes seasonal. Points and companion pass helped make the costly flights more affordable for a family of four.  One concern that is creeping into SWA's system is the abuse of ""Pre-board"" and ""family"" boarding. If you have A List status or pay for an upgrade to A1-15, the benefits may not be of much value depending on the time of year and location you're traveling."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Airline,I’ve flown SWA numerous times. They are always on time. Great staff. Highly recommend SWA. In an industry with high costs and waning customer service SWA is tops.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Very uneventful flight,As usual Southwest had the best price for a flight.  Better yet a non stop from Omaha to DC.  We left on time and arrived even early.     The best flights are the ones that nothing weird happens and you get there with no issues.     Southwest has been that way for me many times.Thank you Southwest
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Packed flight to Orlando,"Packed flight to Orlando, full of excited kids going to Disney. Nothing unusual about the flight. SW does a great job of flying 737s point to point. Just remember to check in early or you will be boarding last with little overhead space."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Flying injured,"I flew round trip to Honolulu with a broken ankle and received the best service. I was seated in the Bulk Head so that I could elevate my foot over my knee. I had extremely kind assistants to push an airline-provided wheelchair at every gate. These people work extremely hard so if you fly and need assistance as I did, tip generously!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,The BEST,SouthWest Airlines is the best!  Always on time with well trained and friendly flight attendants!  And the pilots keep passengers informed about the flights.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Date of travel: November 2019,40,On time and loading was fine,"On time service and since I purchased early bird seating, no problem with carryon and choice of seating. Seating is a bit cramped and I would like to get back to prior room between seating rows."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Southwest to Maui!,"I wanted to take advantage of Southwest's new flights to Maui to build on my Rapid Rewards program and I just love Southwest overall.  It's not easy getting to Maui from KC.  I had to stop in San Diego and then San Jose before getting to Maui.  I also could not find a return flight on Southwest on dates I was looking at, only on way there. Luckily, the stopover in San Diego didn't require me to change planes and layover was only 40 minutes.  We did, however, arrive on time to San Jose (small bridge issue upon landing we had to wait for at airport), We arrive about an hour ahead of schedule in Maui, but was so early, there was not a gate for us to park and we had to wait 25 min on the plane.  So, just some new issues to work out with new destination.  The planes are same size planes you would take in the continental US, so they don't have the fancy monitors or accessories that other major airlines would have traveling 5+ hours.  But, wasn't entirely uncomfortable.  I would do it again."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Best Airline I'v ever flown with,"I have flown with Southwest Airlines for so many years and the Service is pretty good. I only had one Issue with Southwest a little over three years ago, but it wasn't that bad. Like other Airlines Southwest does have flight delays at time, but the delays are not as bad. This past July I flew to Orlando Florida for a third time. I had to Change Planes in Houston Texas which was not an Issue, but even though my Flight from Oakland was Delayed for thirty minutes which ended up being only around twelve Minutes I still got to Houston at Gate 1 with barley time to spare to catch my connecting flight which boarded at Gate 52 since another Passenger in Oakland made the 12 minute delay even longer I still made it. Southwest has always been the best Cheap Airline. I'll keep using them."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Late October get away,"You can’t beat Southwest’s service and pricing. From low fares, to free baggage, to no cost flight changes or cancellations. We’ll always have a great flight with excellent on board service."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Tampa to Louisville,The direct flights between the cities is excellent.  2 quick hours and you are there.  Southwest got us there on time despite terrible weather over most of the country.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Scottsdale,Flight was on time.  Everything went very well.  The flight was smooth as silk.  You could not ask for a better flight.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Love this airline,"I always purchase the early bird option, what is getting out of hand is all the people that are using wheelchairs to get on first  and most of them do NOT need a wheelchair.  It is getting way out of hand.  The early bird people buy this option to get on the plane first but if you have a wheelchair you get on First.  Let me be first to say that people that are in wheelchairs legitimately deserve to get on the plane first but for you all that is saw walk very well into the airport shame on you for using an ailment that they would gladly switch with you!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Free Wifi is limited,"Always been a big fan of Southwest.  They do have free wi-fi, which is nice, although it is limited to texting or movies.  Internet browsing costs $8."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,First Time,"The plane was quite spacious for economy class. The service was very cordial. I don not, however, like the ""no assigned seat"" thing. I would not book with them again, for this very reason. Also, the in flight entertainment wasn't working. They rebooted it 3 times and it still wouldn't work."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Wonderful Flight,Southwest Airlines is so accommodating! Always friendly and helpful. Tot trip was a (10). Best Airline.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Both flights delayed...luggage lost and not found after 2 months,Leaving Houston flight was to leave at 7 am in the morning and we didn't leave till almost 11 am.  Delayed because of a windshield wiper not working.  That should have been discovered prior to boarding.Leaving Nashville we had to miss our flight because the carry on we just purchased had a battery in it and we were not told by anyone that it could not be put in cargo.  It went from Houston to Nashville with no problem. So they pulled us from the flight and said our check-in bag would be in Houston when we got there...the next flight was delayed almost 3 hours so it was close to midnight before we got back to Houston and the bag was not there...still has not been returned 2 months later.
Date of travel: February 2019,50,Always the best deals on local flights,"Southwest just about always has the best deals and they include luggage, so you just cannot beat flying with them."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Mco to MHT,"Always friendly and professional. Flights leave on time and arrive before or at the time scheduled unless situations out of the airlines control.Highly recommend Southwest airlines. No assigned seats. Most planes have WiFi. Seating is based on when you call in to check in. Available 24hours before the flight.If passengers purchase business class ( higher priced ) they are seated in section A.Wheelchair passengers are seated first in the front of the plane. Families with young children are seated after section A. You pick your own seat once on the plane , no saving seats."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A good flight experience,"Southwest planes have a good amount of leg room, you can choose your own seat as you board. First 2 checked bags free. Pleasant staff. Only thing that didn't seem to be the most efficient were the snacks and drinks.  They went thru and took orders for drinks then came back thru, just one tray at a time and passed them out, which took a long time. Then in between taking orders and getting the drinks, they came thru with snacks. We had our snacks (Ritz crackers and pretzels) well before we got our soda. Most flights come around with the cart and ask what soda etc you want, and give you the drink and snacks all at once. After a few bites of the crackers, we waited til the drinks finally came to eat the rest. Other than this one thing, Southwest is a very economical choice for a good flight!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,On-Time Travel,Advance seat boarding always welcome on Southwest..as they have no assigned seating....but they leave on time and arrive early..
n/a,50,Pleasant flight experience,"Easy to book low cost fares, friendly employees, updated air craft. Flying out of Dallas Love is so much more convenient that DFW. Closer in parking; just an easier travel option. Southwest Airlines occupies the entire terminal, so no getting lost. Shorter security lines move quickly. Good eat options"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Nice flight and service,My recent flight on southwest was pretty good. First time flying southwest... nice plane and very nice service!! Not a fan of the boarding procedure... I prefer having an assigned seat when booking!
n/a,50,Love Southwest Airlines! ,"Southwest has been a consistently good experience for me. The ground and flight crew are friendly and helpful. Returning from my trip on Halloween was entertaining in the FLL terminal. The gates of Southwest were decorated and all personnel were costumed in some way. I didn't get his name, but the gate agent dressed as Jafar from Aladdin really made my day!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good flight for the Rainy Weather,"Was a fast flight with no beverage service because of turbulence, but they flew that plane with ease."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Flight rerouted delayed and cancelled,Flight from Burbank to Austin was rerouted thru Dallas causing us to arrive in Austin later than planned. Return flight was rerouted through Oakland and then flight was canceled without notification.We found out about the cancellation when we went to the gate to board our flight.  We were rebooked on a flight that arrived in Burbank 4.5 hours after our original arrival time. Upon arrival in Burbank found our luggage was not on the flight. Luggage had been placed on an earlier flight and we found our items sitting on a sidewalk totally exposed where anyone could have taken them.Have flown Southwest numerous times with few issues but if this trip was indicative of a new standard of service I will find it very difficult to recommend them for air travel
Date of travel: November 2019,40,For the price it was good!,I like the luggage policy better than other airlines.  The flight was good but the planes are small.  I like a larger plane but it was a short flight.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Pleasant flight to Charleston,We had a good flight.  The layovers weren't too long and the in-flight service was pleasant.  We enjoyed the overall experience.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Quick easy trip to Houston Hobby [HOU],A great quick trip to Houston. Gate and flight crews were great and had the usual Southwest personality - friendly and efficient. Price was better than anyone on this route. Bags came off the plane quickly and at no extra charge! Smooth -- no problems!
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Never ENJOY flying Southwest but at least it gets you to your destination even though it's so crowded.,Can't beat the price flying to Denver from BWI if you book well enough in advance.  Also the fact that they don't charge for luggage is a big plus.  Sure they crowd as many as they can on the plane and it's not comfortable for a 4 hour flight but it's worth a little discomfort to save hundreds of $$.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flight from Orlando to PR,Great Airline.Comfortable seats and good leg room. Flight attendants were nice and professional. Definitely I will travel with again with Southwest Airlines
Date of travel: March 2019,20,Sad start to vacation,"One day before flight noticed that flight was canceled, so called airlines to reschedule but had to travel an additional 2 hours away. When got to that airport they canceled that flight also. And both cancellations were done without notification. Called after returning from our trip and southwest response was they were sorry 😐"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,vacation,"flight delayed to illness, crew handled very well.  They kept us informed of what was happening.  Did give us a year long voucher towards another flight. wish we could have gotten more snacks.."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Friendly staff,Super as always just over 2 hours each way .Easy on and off great flight.Southwest is the best to Rochester.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always Pleasant,"Southwest is always a pleasant experience. They have a fun, knowledgeable staff. My only recommendation would be new snacks offered."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Another great flight on Southwest,"Had a maintenance issue before boarding in Sacramento that caused us to leave late. With a short connection in Phoenix, wasn't sure we would make it but they held the flight in Phoenix for the 4 of us that were delayed. They kept us posted in Sacramento and told us at the gate in Phoenix they knew we were coming. Had some doubts our checked luggage would make it with such a short time to transfer, but it was in Austin with no issues."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Obnoxious people on the plane,"flight attendants were oblivious to what was going on during the flight. people behind us were loud and obnoxious. loud enough that rows away were turning round.they talked about their trip to Atlanta, STDs, cussing (Mother-F), what happens in Atlanta stays in Atlanta with details, guy types and 'things' they want, etc.Extremely loud. Enough that my noise cancelling headphones were useless. Non-stop from the time aboard till the time off the plane. Flight attendants should have stepped in. I would have said something, but my wife asked me not to do it."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Good airline ,Very helpful.........","My wife and I both need wheelchairs and from the time we check in to the time we are taken to the curb where we are picked by family. we are helped assisted all the way, all pre- arranged by the airline, Thanks to them......"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great service and comfortable planes,Very nice experience.  The 737 is a very comfortable and clean aircraft.  Always on time or even early.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Delayed, cancelled, delayed and finally there","We love Southwest!  Sometimes there are problems, like on any airline, but they keep you informed every step of the way.  Would never fly any other airline (especially Spirit)."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Love Southwest,We love flying Southwest! We understand the check in and boarding processes and don’t mind picking our seats. The flight attendants have a great sense of humor. Love the fact we can bring our golf clubs at no additional charge as part of our 2 pieces. Will continue to fly with them whenever we can.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Convenience of Southwest,The ability to change your flights without a fee or a penalty is one of the most important reasons I fly this airline. Travel to DC at least once a month. Have not considered any other airline because of this simple convenience.  Plus two free bags. Thank you Southwest.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Consistent, on-time, professional and friendly","I fly the MCI-FLL-FLL-MCI trip reasonably frequently - and am always confident I will get there safely and on-time with SWA.  I prefer the non-stop flights, but I never turn down the chance to spend a little time (layover) at BNA where I can go enjoy the music at Tootsies or one of the other fun spots in the SWA terminal.  My only complaint is that SWA is too polite and doesn't enforce the 'don't save seats' rule.  I pay for early-boarding, and I feel I should get any seat I wish - unfortunately there are unethical cheapskates who feel they can early board 1 person and save an entire row.  Other than that - SWA is the most consistent airline out there."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great flight from Ontario,"We had great flights from Ontario to Midway and Midway to Albany.  We had early bird check in and were in the first 30 passengers so we had our choice of seats..Flights were smooth, on time and service was great.  The only complaint I have is that Southwest seats are very short and I am only 5""2"" tall.  Baggage was off loaded in Albany relatively quickly too."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Car,Excellent.  I traveled to Dallas to pick up a car and the flight was great plenty of room and uneventful.  The Flight Attendants were very nice.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,good service,"Kudos to Southwest for accommodating a change the day of the trip at no cost because of weather.  As a result, my mom and I were able to get out and home on a timely basis."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Best Carrier, Hands Down",We haven't traveled with SW in a while and I was very happy with our experience with the airline during our last trip.  Everyone from the baggage check in to the flight attendants were very professional and polite.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,GETAWAY TO COSTA RICA,"Good flight and on time, will continue flying with Southwest. Very convenient and reasonablly priced with allowable luggage."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Passenger needs comes first.,"flight was delayed on arrival.  however, before boarding there was an issue with one of the bathrooms.  After a little while, they gave up on fixing the bathroom and took us to another gate with a fresh plane waiting for us to board.  It turned out to be a brand new plane, recently put into service."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Southwest easy travel,We had a great flight from Houston Hobby to Love Field and onto Orlando. Flew nonstop from Orlando to Houston Hobby. Lucky to have excellent flight attendants. Ear buds are imperative when flying with babies having ear problems. Great selection of music and in flight movies.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Had a great flight,It was a great flight over the Thanksgiving holiday. The attendants were fabulous.  Smooth flying even with a little weather.
n/a,50,A start to a GREAT vacay!!!,"I've never flown Southwest. I've flown all the other carriers, but not Southwest. I was totally impressed and thought it was a cool idea to book by groups. I found it a game! It also reminded me of a airbus, it made stops😅"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy from A to Z,The entire process from check-in to the actual flight to baggage claim went smoothly and without incident.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I try to travel as much as possible!,The airport when Southwest Airlines flies out of is 45 minutes away from where I live but well worth the drive. I recommend 100%.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Very satisfied,"Always happy to travel on Southwest. After a long international flight with another airline, And having to wait for over an hour to retrieve my checked bag, I really appreciated how quickly Southwest unloaded luggage."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Never disappointed!,"Always enjoy flying Southwest, always friendly service! Remember to check in early and 2 bags fly free not including carry ons! That’s a big perk!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight,"Perfect for a quick trip to FL. No delays, getting a seat with a window and overhead space was no problem, got the app on my iPad and watch a movie for free."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,free luggage,Overall a good flights except for the long layover on the way home. The planes were clean and the in flight service was great.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Just what I expected,"Your typical flight. If you know SW you are familiar with their boarding procedure. My husband did not like not having an assigned seat, but liked the free luggage."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Squished sardine...,"Yeah, so it is only 2 hours through TSA-airport, but when you finally get on board, you just want to ""relax."" Screaming kids (because, of course it is Universal/Disney) no leg room, people behind you kicking the back of your chair. loud voices, no free snacks...just Sardines! Just NOT a pleasant experience for my sister and me!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Family Thanksgiving  visit,Was scheduled to fly at 8:10. was notified after getting to airport that flight is delayed until 1:00   Then told at 10:00  delayed until 2:00  then told at 12:30 delayed until 3:45!  This is because of the shortage of 747’s that have been pulled and causing a 75 plane shortage for this airport!  FIX THE PLANES!!!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,They get you where you need to go and save you a little money,"We wanted a single flight with no-stops for our flight to Seattle to catch our cruise ship. Southwest delivered. NIce piece of mind knowing your lugguge is always on the plane you are on and not getting loist trying to make the transfer on a stop to change planes. Seats were great, plenty of room. Pay the extra to do the early bird boardking, my wife and I were about to get seats together and enjoyed the flights to and from our destination."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Round Trip On time take offs and landing,Traveling the Monday before Thanksgiving and returning home the following Monday we knew were some of the busiest travel days of the year.  But those were the dates we needed to fly.  SouthWest was not only on time takeoffs on each leg we landed EARLY.  Doesn't get much better than that.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Gate Experience & Flight...,"The gate experience was good and the flight was on time, as usual. The in-fight WiFi worked great and watched a movie on the way. Good Navy landing in Chicago..."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Southwest flight,"sat in exit row,good leg space.Flight was on time,crew were nice,no problems. My wife and I like the open seating,wish other airlines did the same thing."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Reliable and reasonable costs with no hidden costs,"As usual, SW was on time (actually a bit early), with comfortable seats and reasonable costs.  No hidden fees."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Crunch Time,I was probably the last section of boarders and obviously knew I would be stuck in a middle seat. Ended up 2nd row from back next to enormous guy who took up half of my seat.They should have required him to buy two seats.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Another good trip from SWA,"Another good experience with SWA, my experiences is that they don't disappoint and offer a competitive price, both major ingredients in offering the consumer great value."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,The Friendly Skies,"The first leg of the Flight the Flight Attendants were delightful, the second leg not so much.  Overall it was a great flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,"Excellent flight out of Buffalo in October. Buffalo Airport was great very easy to navigate. Southwest agents were helpful and flight was outstanding. Plane was clean, prompt service from the staff. My only beef is the cost of EB Seating went up to 25 per one way. So families are starting to pay for only 2 members and then save seats. Once the US dollar becomes more reasonable Buffalo becomes an outstanding option as oppose to Pearson."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Easy trip,"Perfectly pleasant flight, attendants, had no problems at all. Southwest for the most part has never disappointed us."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Southwest Flight to Austin,"As always, great service.  Left on time and did not wait long for bags.  I fly Southwest whenever I can due to the great prices and customer service."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,No more peanuts,I love flying southwest they are very friendly and the pilot sometimes said something funny The only thing I missed the roast peanuts I wish they can change it instead of those broken pretzels. overall love flying southwest
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Awesome Staff,We had a very short layover between our flights and the staff at Southwest went out of their way to make sure that we made our connection.  We were traveling with two wheelchairs and 3 small children.  It was awesome!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,MSP to SAT - three times!,"This past year, I had to go to San Antonio, Texas, on three different trips. Each time I flew, I chose Southwest out of MSP (First time doing so) to SAT. I typically fly Delta from MSP to almost anywhere and haven't had too many poor experiences over the years. And, occasionally, I've flown from Fargo, ND, if the timing, weather and flight options or OK (love the parking price and security). For me, having two bags free - because I fly with riding gear like heavy boots, helmet, etc. - is perfect. Unsure about the seating method, but it worked out OK for my trips. Bring your own snacks! Southwest was a perfect 3-for-3 for this guy. Throw in easier parking at MSP terminal 2, shorter security lines, Caribou coffee (T2 baggage claim) and good, friendly airline service and I may have to reconsider how I fly from MSP. Pricing matters, too, especially if the whole family joins me, but it's nice to know of other options if needed."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Came with two cats as carry ons,We have never flown with our cats before so we paid a little extra to be able to board in group A to secure a window and middle seat (the space under those two seats is larger) Southwest was great we had no issues. Our cats were quiet the whole way sleeping mostly to the point noone knew they were there.One of the big perks about Southwest is they still offer two free checked bags which allowed us to have the cats as carry ons.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Good trip to Denver,First time flying Southwest.  New routine as far as boarding.  They permitted us to sit together even though we were different boarding classifications.  Trip was smooth and staff were pleasant.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight,"Very comfortable, on time!  Only snacks but short flight.  Arrived on time.  Flight staff efficient and helpful with baggage Love albq airport which is small and organized."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Simple and easy.,"The staff on Southwest really enjoys their job. You can just tell. If traveling with a family, I do recommend upgrading your spot inline or at minimum check-in early."
n/a,50,Little Rock to Dallas,"Very quick flight, under and hour, from Little Rock to Dallas.  Love this flight. Love field is so much easier to navigate and is so much closer to downtown Dallas than DFW. The flight barely gets to a cruising altitude before it begins it's descent into Dallas. Almost always, this is a full flight.  Unless, it's the first flight of the day AND you have priority boarding expect, at very least,  to be at the rear of the plane. And if you fly this route in summer expect a super hot, crowded flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,"We got there, no problems","You basic flight, nothing special.  No problems or complaints.   Not sure what else I can say.  Need 100 characters for some reason."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always a good experience for me.,"Southwest flights are always a good experience for me.  I buy Early Bird so I am one of the earlier ones to board.  Since I fly alone, I inevitably find a window seat near the front, my preferred position.  My flights have been on time. My top draw to Southwest: if I have to cancel or change a reservation, what I paid is put into my account and I can use 100% of that amount on another flight. I have had to do this several times.  Two free bags are a plus, of course."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving 19,Midway airport is small enough to get from the ticket kiosh to your terminal very quickly and a direct flight is all the better
Date of travel: December 2019,30,A few glitches and shortcomings,"Southwest is reliable, this flight had a few annoying aspects.  First, the 1 and 1A gates at San Diego Airport are in a confined area with few opportunities for shopping or eating.  That said, passing through security was quick so you shouldn't clear security too early as you will just have to pass time in this substandard space.  Stay in the main terminal with much better options.  The flight was delayed a few minutes due to weather and there was no service on the flight due to choppy conditions.  That's understandable but unpleasant.  On the plus side the luggage arrived promptly after landing."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Always a pleasure flying with Southwest Airlines,"I've switched from United to Southwest Airlines four years ago and have never been happier.  At first I had to get used to the boarding process, but the open seating style is always a good thing if you are in the A or B boarding groups.  I tend to spend the $25 dollars extra to get the early bird check-in and have always been in the A group and have not had the hassle to try and check-in online and hoping that I got it early enough.  Although returning from Cancun to Fort Lauderdale, for some reason it did not give me the TSA pre check for some odd reason.  Free check-in baggage is always a plus.  I'll be a loyal Southwest Airlines customer from now on."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Cross country flight,"Always fly southwest. Great prices, no luggage fee and very polite and sometimes funny flight attendants. Was very comfortable on both legs of my flight. There was a great choice of free movies to play on my own device and the time literally flew by"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Early Arrival,This flight left Chicago about 5 minutes early and arrived at Ft. MYERS 15 minutes early. Very smooth flight. Free movies. Snack and drinks complimentary
Date of travel: October 2019,50,To the Mile High city and back!,"Always the best service, and easiest booking. With 2 free bags, golf clubs always go with me. And one suitcase I am good to go."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Nothing worst that getting the text your flight will be late and you are already in route to the airport,"I got the text that the fight would be delayed an hour.  Not that bad considering, but I was already dropping by rental car off and that meant an extra hour in the airport.  Good thing there is a great place to get a cubano sandwhich."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight Attendant,"We always pay for the early bird b/c my husband likes to sit by the exit doors. He is 6'4'' and needs the leg room. As we were headed to the exit door the flight attendant was standing there. My husband said excuse us we would like to sit there.  She said ""No, you can sit on the other side"". He said I like this side of the plane for the view. So, if you don't mind we would like to sit there. She said ""I do mind!"" and moved. Then she read the instructions for us for sitting on the exit doors. The guy in front had headphones on, not ear buds headphones. when he did not say Yes, b/c he did not hear. She smacked him on the head with per pamphlet. then she had to read it again. Wasn't it her fault that she did not see he had those big bulky headphones on? Her name was Heather. She needs to find a new job!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flown Southwest for years!!!,"Flown Southwest for years and love them. Prices are great, no hidden fees, 90% on time from my experience and if you get the Southwest credit card, you get to gain credits to free flights. Best Airline out there IMO."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best Airlines,Southwest airlines is the #1 to fly.❤❤ I enjoy my trip I will most definitely fly again because of the services. Bags fly free.
Date of travel: March 2019,50,I fly Southwest,I fly Southwest almost exclusively because of their friendly attitude towards those who are in need of a little extra help getting seating and overhead usage. Their 2 baggage fee policy is a great incentive while still being able to bring on a carry-on.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Passenger notification of flight changes,Flight was changed to 1 1/2 hours earlier and I was not notified!!!  Almost missed flight.  Airline said they have no responsibility to notify of changes!  All responsibility is on traveler.  NOT A PASSENGER-FRIENDLY POLICY.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Comfortable and efficient flight, good value","Southwest is a good choice for simple trips.  You don't have to buy a round trip ticket, the website is easy to use, checking up to two pieces of luggage is efficient and free. Our flight from Oakland was routine, the plane wasn't full, check in and boarding was quick and easy.  One advantage of the Southwest boarding system is you are assigned a position in line so you can wait to the last minute before your section boards to get in line.  Our only complaint was it took a few minutes for our baggage to arrive and it was with, but since it was raining that was understandable."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy boarding,I have never had an issue with this airline.  Lineup is exceptional.  The seating may be tight for some people due to their size but recently the persons next to me have been very good at not being oblivious to their neighbor.  Thank God for short flights.  The staff are wonderful and always very professional.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Thanksgiving Travel,Was in A seating section so I was able to quickly find an aisle seat near the front of the plane. Flight was on time and it was a smooth flight. Flight crew was friendly and no issues event though every seat was taken with holiday travelers.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Friendly service,Flight was on time both ways plane was clean and the flight crew was great got a exit row with no seat in front of me so I had plenty of leg room early bird check in was worth the extra money because the flights were full
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Another easy flight,"Flight was ahead of schedule and uneventful - just the way I like them. Return flight was the same. Only disappointment was coming home we got to the airport 4 hours early and hoped for an earlier flight. The was one and seats were available, however, it was going cost an extra $700 to get on it, even though the flights were the same price at booking."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fly southwest !,"We always fly southwest and have always been pleased with their timeliness , friendliness and professionalism . Their prices have gone up recently so that’s my only complaint ."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,SOUTHWEST AIRLINES FOR GOKF,Great airlines especially for a golf trip. Two free checked bags including golf clubs. Great  airlines for business and leisure.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent service and price,Excellent service.  Very well organized to board the plane.  Very pleasant flight.  I went to Nashville for Thanksgiving.  It was a very busy weekend but the airline handled the crow without any problems.  I will fly again with them.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Got Sick before flight!  They moved me to another flight the next day!  No Charge!,This is a great airline.  They took good care of me when I got the stomach flu and moved me to another flight a day later.  Thank you Southwest.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,On Time Easy Boarding On and Off,"We had a good flight to Chicago with no issues. We opted to check the bags, although they were small enough to put in the overhead. Frankly, hoisting them up there and getting them down is now harder over 70. Since they checked them for free, we took that option. The boarding in groups was organized and people were cooperative. We did get to sit together, although that's not guaranteed with group boarding. The bags were ready almost immediately when we deplaned and our arrival was on time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy flying,"My flight was normal, smooth and easy. As it should be.Boarding was quick, flight was smooth, we landed early, which is always a plus.I love flying SW. They are the easiest to communicate with, cheapest flights, least amount of cancellations."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Customers treated well,"We fly Southwest whenever we can for lots of reasons: no fee flight changes, free baggage allowance, free snacks, and really great attitude among the staff. Sort of like what flying used to be before airlines discovered the financial advantages of charging for everything. Best part are the employees - they look like they enjoy their work."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Very enjoyable !,"Flight was on time to include connections, the seating process was very well organized, seats were clean and roomy and flight service was very friendly. Thevcheck In was easy."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Buffalo NY to Ontario CA,"Actually flew business class. As usual with Southwest Airlines, smooth trip. Easy boarding, timely departure. Layover in Phoenix. Enough time for breakfast, on time departure for second leg to Ontario. Easy arrival, and no luggage issues."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Flight,Southwest usually does a good job with everything but lately it seems they are losing luggage more and more these days and it takes a day or two to get them back .Luckily I have gotten of them back eventually . But the Custom Service as a whole in every department with Southwest has declined drastically over the years and that is truly sad because they use to be the best .
Date of travel: November 2019,40,As expected,People always expect too much from a flight and this was a good crew and seemed like they worked well together. The plain though run down was quiet and the people were really nice. It's four stars due to older plane. Crew was first class. Enjoy your time with Southwest but remember they did give you the best deal and as my dad always said you get what you pay for!
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good for domestic flights in the US,Good airline for domestic flights. The only one how offers checked bags which is great! Boarding can be long if you don't check in with enough time.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Christmas at Disney World,"The flight left on time and arrived on time.  Instead of the Disney bus, we used a local Disney service because 2 year old needed to go to sleep early."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Acations,Excellent service on flight and From Desk. Puntal and aircraft confortPersonel with excellent attention and cortesy. The order on the terminal was organised
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Always a good experience,"My wife and I utilize SouthWest Airlines whenever possible.  The Crews are always friendly, flights are on time and the reservationists are very accommodating.  Our last round trip was from Milwaukee to Phoenix.  Business for her, pleasure for me.  I do wish the seats could be a bit larger but that is the time in which we live."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Once Southwest always Southwest!,"Flight was on time, went smooth, free drinks and wifi. Leg room was fine. Service from Airlines 100% I have been flying with southwest for decades. :)"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Pleasant to fly,It's always a pleasant experience flying Southwest.  The plane is clean and the flightcrew are always nice.

Date of travel: August 2019,50,Flight was not full so the crew allowed us to spread out. which was very comfortable,Great service funny flight crew enjoyable trip love the non assigned seating! on time and both gate and flight attendants seem to care.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flight to and from Cabo - we are sad to see this flight go,We love this direct flight from OC to Cabo.  Unfortunately Southwest is discontinuing the flight next year.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,The flight was on time and quite comfortable.,The flight was direct. It was on time and relatively comfortable. The airline personnel were friendly.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,On time in-spite of bad weather,Flight was in time and with beverages service in-spite of snow storm. Anti freeze treatment in Logan was fast (~20 min).
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Free luggage,"I fly Southwest frequently.  It is an easy flight from LAX to Tucson.  I knew I was not going to be able to get my ticket at the magical 24 hour before the flight and did not want a C placement.  So I paid the extra $20 and even though I did get an A, it was not that much better than what I would have gotten if I had been able to get the ticket myself.  The flights are okay.  Nothing special but then I am only in the air for over an hour"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Very Helpful,Crew was very helpful to me. Have a leg brace and cane after two back surgeries.Attendant made sure I got seated and stowed my cane.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Luv Southwest,"On time, no problems, smooth flight. Traveling with my wife, plane left on time and arrived a little early."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Friendly Skies for Sure,"Normally, I fly United and will continue to do so as I have a lot of miles.  Rarely able to use them unless you want to fly red-eyebrows horrible times and connections. So when I couldn’t get what I wanted, I tried SW which I had not flown for a long time.Stellar non-stop service with great personnel who made the trip so much fun!  I will certainly use them again!  And the price was great!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great flight,This is the second time I’ve flown with Southwest and I’ve been very pleased both times. The prices are reasonable and the employees were nice.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Smooth Travel,Our flight was full and still on schedule.  Luggage check in and pick process was smooth and without incident.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving Flight,"Even during the most traveled weekend of the year, the experience was uneventful. Flight was not full, so carry on space was adequate."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight to Reno,I always enjoy flying Southwest.  As usual it was clean friendly and smooth. I highly recommend anyone who is flying to give them a try.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Very pleasant flight crew and smooth flight,We were flying in for a funeral. There were 9 of us all together and 2 were toddlers and one infant. We were all able to sit together which really helped manage the kiddos.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fly for almost free,I usually like to use my points for flights . Sooooo I put everything on my southwest credit card and fly for $ 11 to Florida to visit family all the time
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Great plane,"Southwest is a great airline. Tickets were reasonable, flight was on time. Staff was friendly and helpful and snacks were great. I highly recommend flying Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight,We only fly SWA because they fly Boeing 737. Don't believe all the stuff about the 737 Max. My husband is a retired pilot and the crashes that happened in the third world was because the pilots were not qualified to be pilots.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy travel option,Southwest makes boarding smooth. Staff is friendly. An easy and economical travel option. Rewards credit card is great for earning miles for free flights!
n/a,40,Good Flight,"Choose your own seat after standing in line is OK but I prefer selecting my seat when I make a reservation. My flights were fine. Both left on time and I actually arrived in ABQ a bit early. Since I fly to ABQ regularly to visit my daughter I would like a non-stop available but...It seems to be getting difficult on occassion to find overhead space above one's row. Too many over sized bags perhaps? Exiting is pretty fast and easy both for connecting flight and at destination. A wider variety of snacks is needed. I like Delta fruit selection. As one can tell, my flight overall was fine as usual. However, some attention to my rather non-serious complaints would provide a higher review."
n/a,50,Great service ,"Leaving from Islip, MacArthur when possible is so pleasant. The fact that Southwest has some great nonstop connections makes it one of the best. Convenient parking is a plus. It's worth driving from Nassau County even if you are closer to JFK."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Easy round trip Tucson to Denver,"We like to fly Southwest. We’ve developed two objections on our last couple of flights. Early Bird checkin is too $$$ now. People are allowed to save seats because only one books early bird Checkin. That’s not fair for those that book for both.Too many families are allowed to board before B’s. Do they pay extra for that?We enjoy the friendly atmosphere of Southwest. Also, being able to check two bags makes travel much easier.How do I get drink coupons?"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Better Service, Half the Cost","I couldn't believe how authentic and helpful the staff was. How quickly we boarded, despite having no assigned seats. How smoothly everything about this trip ran! And it cost Ssooo much less than any other airline. I have 5 more trips planned, all with Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,excellent in every way,"I am always happy with Southwest Airlines. A very loyal customer because of their caring service, being on time, humor and customer awareness. We arrived 15 minutes early on this flight and the captain quipped, ""Now, remember this when we are late on another flight"". In 2007, when I explained to the customer representative on the phone that my mother died that morning and I needed to fly from Albuquerque to Oakland the next morning, they got me on a full flight with absolutely no extra charges. I always flew Southwest when it was available, but after that, Am I loyal? You better believe it. Also, their prices are excellent."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Non-stop MCI to FLL,"They were pretty standard Southwest flights.  I've never been a big fan of the cattle-call boarding process, but it is what it is.  Current process is at least better than it was before.  Outbound flight was delayed by about an hour.  (Thanksgiving travel... to be expected.)I booked our flights w/ SWA because they had a non-stop option, whereas Delta would have required at layover, making it a much longer travel day.  The airline personnel that we had on both flights were all friendly and professional."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent,Great service and flight crew! The flight was on time and even got to our destination a little early. The crew avoided bad weather on both ends of the flight and it made for a very easy time.
n/a,40,Easy as always,I fly with Southwest 9 out of 10 times when I travel. The staff is always helpful and nice. Seating can be confusing for people new to flying with Southwest but I personally like it and enjoy it.  My only complaint is there is never Gluten free options for in flight snacks.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Southwest Airlines always our first choice,We don’t fly much but when we do we always make Southwest Airlines our first choice. Problems can happen in any form of Transportation but we don’t have complaints about any of our Trips on Southwest Airlines.
n/a,40,2 bags fly free.,Rate was great and 2 checked bags are wonderful. I dislike open seating. I always have to sit in the middle seat.   But otherwise it was a good flight. Left on time and arrived on time. I can't remember if this flight had to change gate but I had to change at tge last minute which was okay.  I don't carry any baggage but others do.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Quick Trip to San Diego,"Non Stop flight of just about 2:45 hours, not problems what so ever.  Don't mind the boarding process, as long as you check in online at the 24 hour opportunity.  Seats were comfortable, plenty of space to store 1 carry on overhead.  Trip back to Spokane was even better, plane was only 1/2 full so plenty of room to ""stretch out"" in the row of seats chosen."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent Southwest Service to Norfolk VA,I flew from Orlando to Norfolk last month - the flight took off and landed on time and the service was excellent. Most Highly Recommend!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love their style of check in!  Fun and friendly attendants!,"I am really happy flying Southwest.  Their attendants are always fun and friendly.  Check in is so fair and efficient, great system!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy process,"Southwest has it right, no posing in a line 1 hour before boarding and other hassles. Look at the number on your pass, board when it is time and choose a seat. If you want a better boarding position $40 - $50 will get you priority boarding (A1 - A15). Flight staff is great and I feel there is more leg room than other airlines. Points add up pretty fast also towards A-List status."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Checking out the Check In!,"We knew better, but we fouled up when we bought gifts of CA wine to take home. But Southwest saved the day and our wine. We were able to put the wine in bubble wrap, specially made for the purpose, (paying $5 for the wrap), and checking it in our second bag free of additional cost. It arrived safe and secure! The service was exceptional! Thanks, Southwest!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent,"I have family in Madison, Wisconsin.  I have flown many airlines into Madison but it always entails a two flights with a stop in Chicago. I have be stranded with layovers many times....waiting for the weather to change or a plane to arrive. Much to my surprise it saves time (and money and stress) to fly into Milwaukee with Southwest, rent a car and drive to Madison. I intend to stick with Southwest in the future visits to Wisconsin."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Always a pleasure,I'm rarely ever dissapointed wtih Southwest Airlines.  The staff is always pleasant and accomodating.  Can I mention 2 FREE CHECKED BAGS!! What's better than that?  I had a connecting from Boston to NOLA and the entire trip went without a glitch.  My next convention is in San Antonio and the first thing I did when it was announced was check my Southwest app.. I will be flying with them again.  I LOVE this airline.
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Love this airlines,"Great prices, you can bring two pcs.,of luggage and a carry  on  at no extra charge. This is important when your charges end up being more than your ticket.  Service is great! You can get all the regular drinks you want,also snacks are offered to you at least several times during a flight. Flight attendants are great! I love flying this airlines. Their heart❤️ Symbol really does mean something."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Frustrating trip,"Been a longtime fan, but under the perception that Southwest did not allow seat saving. However it does, see the response below.  On a recent flight drew the “A” Board, but had three different folks saving seats,( got my window at the second to the last row).  I told one attendant that I didn’t think Southwest allowed seat saving.  She did not respond, so I inquired at corporate. Just upsetting to see folks buy one early board and then save rows.  I get the same indigestion when people cut line.  “I regret learning of your frustration with our open seating policy. We don’t have a specific policy regarding saving seats, and our Flight Attendants typically don’t prevent Customers from saving seats unless it interferes with our boarding process. While we understand that Customers want to sit by their friends and family members and enjoy each other’s company, our hope is that early boarding Customers will not save too many seats for their traveling companions as it can be frustrating to a Customer when his/her seat of choice is being saved. Our open-seating policy comes with good points and challenges, and I am sorry you were disappointed with the handling of this particular situation.”"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Totally surprised at the RUDENESS of staff at SW counter in SJU,"2X in 2 months....SMH at the process to get wheelchair assistance at SJU airport. A traveler is required to go into the terminal, CHECK IN for flight , take a ticket to another counter and then get a wheelchair!! My thing is that if a personal traveling ALONE could do ALL these things after being dropped at the curb WITH luggage, why in the world would they even need help. To top that off, I'm standing at the counter asking ""agents"" for help since my bags were still curb side!  I was told to get ""IN LINE"", and a agent by the name of ""Tatiana"" that ""There's NO priority treatment"" here and said that ""well you keep asking me the same thing"" JUST wait your turn, rolled her eyes and walked away WITH ATTITUDE like I've NEVER experienced from my favorite airline 100% shocked and disappointed by SJU staff and contractors.  Then after my long flight I waited on the plane for the wheelchairs to arrive and finally came off and got in one that was in the gangway, a gentleman from SW said it was too cold out there to be waiting and took me up ""TOP"". I then sat there for another half hour while Prospects { I think company name} arrive 40 minutes after the plane touched down in BWI"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,The people are Great!,This was my first experience on SouthWest. Not a big fan on the style of checkin or seat selection process. Buying up for better seat selection is still a gamble.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Used to be good,"I've flown Southwest airlines many times in the past, and recently have seen the decline in the airlines. Worst of all, both flights on this just recent trip we delayed an hour or longer. Unable to contact anyone at Southwest with any authority.  The delays caused issues with other reservations and returning home in a decent hour prior to work. I will never recommend Southwest to anyone and make them one of my last choices in carriers when choosing to fly. Very poor and extremely disappointed."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great,Always good. Know what is going on and consistent service. Line up and board. Flight attendants with a good attitude.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great airline,I usually fly American or Spirit. Southwest airlines is comfortable and open seating is great. The con is open seating and they're in Dallas not DFW but same price for me on Uber.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Probably the best out there,"Crowded flight at Get Away fare, but fair and friendly treatment from SW personnel nonetheless. In my experience, the best economy air travel for service and value is SW."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Too cramped for too long.,"I have been tolerating Southwest for years but never taken a flight longer than 3 hours before.  This trip has me seriously rethinking my choice of travel.   Five hours in a plane with no leg room, sitting cheek to cheek with strangers is extremely uncomfortable.After 3 hours my legs began to swell and cramp followed by the backside falling asleep.In addition, the seat belt sign remained on most of the trip due to rough windsSouthwest is always uncomfortable but I do think they are decreasing the leg room to the point that many people can not even drop the tray in front of them."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,"Terrible airline, terrible customer service.","I will NEVER fly with Southwest again. They have cancelled my flights several times the day of the flight and have been hostile and threatening in forcing me to pay for flights when I had already paid. I flew to Phoenix this weekend to attend my husband's Dining Out with the US Army and when I tried to get home, they told me they had cancelled my ticket and told me I would have to pay an additional $363 to get home. This was the second time that had happened in less than two months. The airline tried to blame me and their manager literally threatened me. I have never written a review online and this airline has treated me so badly that I have to speak out. Terrible airline with the worst customer service I've ever seen."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,SW Flight 4081 (LAX to IND),"Flight 4081 (Los Angeles to Indianapolis) was the final flight of 2019 Melbourne International travels on Sunday, December 1st.  I paid a pretty penny for the flight (Sunday after Thanksgiving :(It left on time and arrived early (a welcomed event due to the 3 hour time difference between the cities).   There were no issues with the flight.  Check-in, boarding, and deplaning were a breezed.  The flight attendants were very courteous. They even recommended a drink to make me sleep (don't ask me what it was, but it did the trick haha!)"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Southwest Flight 469 (IND to LAX),"I took Southwest Flight 469 from Indianapolis to Los Angeles on Wednesday, November 13th.  I have no complaints; in fact, I recommend this evening mid-week flight because it doesn't seem to be a popular flight.  The ticket was cheap.  The plane was half full at the most.  I had no problems with check-in, boarding, etc.  The flight attendants were very nice and efficient.  And we arrived a little early."
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Flight to Phoenix in the snow,"We were flying to our other home in north Phoenix, which we don't get to see that often anymore. It was snowing at BWI and they had to de-ice the plane. After that was done, the pilot came out and looked at the wings and said we were ready to roll. We took off in the storm and the takeoff was a bit bumpy, but we made it. If we would not have made it, I guess I would not be here writing this review. Overall, the direct flight went well and will fly again."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,The very short Buffalo flight,"The flight was very quick and there were no issues. Before we knew it, we had landed. The flight was pretty smooth."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Still The Friendliest In The Skies! 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"What more can I say? Wonderful customer service makes all the difference in the world! Not to mention the ease of flying directly from Austin to Cancún. I’d highly recommend getting a Southwest Credit Card if you think it would be worth it. Companion Passes make flying Southwest an even greater value. I was recently horrified to discover that a couple of pilots were secretly caught taping from hidden cameras in the plane lavatory, and I’m watching the news to make sure they’re prosecuted fully. Reports are saying that the flight attendant whistleblower has been retaliated against by the company, and if that ends up being the truth I will cancel my card and start flying another carrier. But with Southwest’s stellar reputation, I’m hopeful the company will do the right thing. You need to Southwest! I want badly to continue supporting you!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Direct Flights,"Direct flights are the best. We leave very early and take a snooze and viola we are in Las Vegas for breakfast.  We have to get up very early, but it’s so worth it.  I love flying Southwest, cause they’re the best!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great crew and plane operation,No issues.  Click early so you get A boarding without paying the extra fees.  Families with small children board between A and B groups.  Being in A can help you get a quiet part of the plane if that's important to grab a nap on the plane.  Safe travels
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Rising to the occasion,"We had an emergency while in New Orleans and couldn't make the flight. After explaining the situation they moved our flight to the next day without an up-charge and had a wheelchair ready for us at both airports. The money saved will be spent on the ER bill no doubt, but it made a stressful situation easier to handle."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,2 Checked-in Free Luggages is sublime!,"When I knew I had to carry two checked in luggages, I knew Southwest would be the best choice because of the 2 free checked-in luggage policy. This allowed me save money and reach to destination with a pleasant flight. Staff was polite and flight was punctual.Highly recommend this flight if you have to move with a lot of stuff."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Hate the Boarding Process,I do not like that you can't pick your seat before the flight. Not sure it was worth the money I saved.
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Nice flight with extremely pleasant airline staff!,"I have flown many times but this was my husband’s very first flight, and we were taking a 5 hour trip to Las Vegas for a family trip. We flew economy with 3 row seating and were surprisingly comfortable. The flight crew offered continuous unlimited snacks and tasty beverages throughout the duration. My husband handled this trip with a breeze and it made him eager to fly again in the near future. Thank you Southwest Airlines for your kind, and professional services!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest to Ft. Lauderdale,Southwest as usual does a great job. We paid a little extra for earlier boarding. Easy and quiet flight even though it was full. We use points plus senior wanna get away.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Los Angeles to Chicago Midway,Southwest is a no nonsense budget airline. Free checked bag and first come first served seating. We left on time and arrived on time. No problems. That seems to be most of my flights with Southwest.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,SOUTHWEST NEEDS TO FLY EVERYWHERE,southwest needs to fly everywhere it the very best airline. after i discover southwest i didn't want to fly with any other airline.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good budget airline,"This was my first trip with this airline and overall it was okay. The ticket price was good and it included checked in luggage which is great.  I found the boarding system confusing and had to rely on another passenger to explain it as there were no clear instructions given. Boarding did seem efficient though. The plane took off 2 hours late but they did give us a free alcoholic drink on board, although it was not announced and we found out after we ordered the drinks. As budget airlines go, this one is fairly good and I would travel with them again when travelling within the USA."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Comfortable and easy to book & fly with,"Always love flying Southwest, 2 checked bags fly free, early check in and quick service. Comfortable seats."
Date of travel: March 2019,20,Dirty Unorganized and Fake,"This airline is dirty and gross, not comfy seats and boarding process is meant to go as fast as possible because they don't want to deal with customers. food is ok but just anything you can get at the store. They don't have in-flight entertainment."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Fast efficient always a pleasure!,"I only fly Southwest. I have not had a bad experience even one time. The people I have encountered over the years have been great. The prices are reasonable and sometimes really great! If you book they don’t penalize you if you have to change your flight. Two bags each fly free! That is more then my husband and I need. Now for the “cattle call” reference. You can pay a little extra and get your boarding position moved up, loading on the plane is organized and not much different then any other airlines. It is not worth the exorbitant prices other airlines charge for everything under the sun just to have your particular seat confirmed so to those that complain I say lighten up. This is an airline for the people and we love and appreciate them. I would say that is why they are #1!"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,What happened to Southwest?,"In general, I like Southwest, but the seating is cramped. I hear the new planes have better seating, but just spreading them apart more on the existing planes would help. The higher seat backs are nice. I'm 6' 2"" and the older planes seat backs are too short for me to rest my head. Anyway....Southwest Flight Attendants used to have great attitudes. I'm not sure why, but on this flight they seemed to be just ""soldiering on grimly.""The movie selection was pretty amazing.Just before we landed a flight attendant reminded me to ""return my seat.."", but failed to do so for three other men who were within four feet of me. I thought that a bit weird."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best airline around for US domestic travel,"I travel several times a month and LOVE SW airlines. Their flexible and customer focused attitude is refreshing. That boarding queue thing takes a little getting used to but it really does work out fine. Coincidentally, that’s how I met my now husband, in the boarding line in front of me! You never know where you’ll meet someone special and for us, it was boarding a SW flight on 11/17/16!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Flight! Friendly Crew and On Time.,"Flew from Pittsburgh to Baltimore then onto Birmingham. Flights were on-time, passengers boarded poltiely and the crew was friendly. Good flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,BEST Airline around,"BEST airline around. Why the other major airlines don't follow SW in operations, I have no idea. If SW can exist w/o baggage fees, why can't the major airlines. SW makes flying fun too after getting through security."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,My favorite airline,"I love Southwest.  Their customer service is outstanding, great value for the money and we have two credit cards amassing points for our flights.  We were overjoyed when they came to the Atlanta market and we fly Southwest primarily.  We cruise a lot and always have two bags, no extra fee.  If our plans change no worry redeposit miles for FREE.  We used to fly Delta, but you don't accrue miles on a mile per mile basis any longer and it fees, fees, fees.  Southwest will continue to be our selection whenever we fly.  Thanks SW for caring about your passengers."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Simply the best,"I find it hard to believe what great service Southwest provides, from ease of booking to check-in to in flight care.Our family only chooses to fly Southwest as it is worth it in many ways."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Reminded me of a Stock Yard,"I have had the ""joy"" of flying twice with Southwest BUT never again.  It is always a challenge to fly any American airlines given their low level of service and I dare say that if animals were treated in the same way as American flyers the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals would be called in.  I have just read the Tripadvisor  awards for the Top Airlines and somehow, although I think it could be a joke, Southwest is there.  If Southwest is actually there it is only because the people voting have not flown on real airlines such as Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Ethiopian, Cathay etc"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Airlines out there!!,"We love SW and always fly with them whenever we can. I never worry about booking with them, if something happens and we are unable to go on our trip, there are no change fees and you can bank the miles to use next time. Two free checked bags and two free carry on’s is the cherry on top. The staff are so professional and fun to be around. ALL the other airlines should follow their lead, why do other airlines charge up to a $300 change fee when it takes a “key stroke” to take care of it? Price gouging at it’s finest...NO EXCUSE! Southwest is best!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,No nonsense airline,No Nonsense airline. very nimble.. efficiently run airline... funny and entertaining staff and groundstaff..
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Always Southwest,"This is just one of many flights I have taken with SW.  Even if I have to fly into another city than my destination, if it is within 100 miles I will drive to my destination as I always rent a car anyway.  Went to Rome last April, but unfortunately, SW doesn't fly there, and not within 100 miles.  I love SW, they're friendly, helpful, and when I needed assistance they made sure everything was right."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,"Have met some of the rudest, laziest employees when flying SW","I have flown SW for business and pleasure for over 2 decades. Atlanta ticketing/baggage personnel at 4:30 AM: all lazy. Of 8 employees behind counter only 2 were working to process at least 75 waiting passengers. Of those 2 only one could review passports and tag baggage. Extremely rude and NO customer service skills. Same with gate agents and cabin attendants. Southwest has a warped sense of customer service. SW mgmt doesn't care, and won't fix. My advice: hire better people with customer skills and then train and test at least annually. What an embarrassment! Best US airline? What a joke!"
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Low Cost is Low Cost,Always remember you get what you pay for and given this fact they are no longer always the least expensive. They people of the company are outstanding from the counter to the gates and every place in between. The seating is cramped the seats are brutally unforgiving definitely not good for anything over an hour. Flight attendants are wonderful and the snacks are free but very limited. They have carved out a tremendous niche in the industry and if you are simply concentrating on getting from point a to point b they are fine. Don't expect the extras and I would think the trip to Hawaii is a chiropractor's dream If they could only improve the comfort factor a bit.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,San Cruz visit,Flight was very good even had a little entertainment from flight attendants.  they had great sense of humor
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Never again,"I am a senior citizen and I booked a non-stop in June.  They contacted me and changed my itinerary.  I had 2 stops, one in Missouri and another in Iowa.  And they delayed my flight coming home by 1 day.  When I asked if I was going to be given accomodations and food coupons, she said, ""Oh, we don't do that.""  So I was on a plane for 7.5 hours plus.  AND could their snacks be any smaller?  And their lavatories were the smallest ever.  And I could watch a movie or a tv show on my own device!    The only plus was the crew."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Great price, on time, good experience","We took a flight on one of the busiest days of the year, but all was smooth. Southwest offers easy kiosk bag check, and FREE bags (unlike so many airlines these days!). Good trip!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best nonstop flight out of Kansas City,"We continue to be amazed at the super service we get when flying with Southwest Airlines. Our most recent trip came in November (2019) when we drove from Omaha to Kansas City to catch a direct flight to Baltimore. We spent a restful night at the Ramada Inn in nearby Platte City, where we were able to park our car for the 12 days we spent in Baltimore. The flights both ways were, to quote a certain president, perfect. As our shuttle headed back to the Ramada when we landed, I realized my backpack -- containing our car keys -- was left at the terminal. Miraculously, it was turned in to the Southwest lost baggage office. Thanks goes to Southwest for the smooth flights and for saving us the agony (and cost) of getting a locksmith to allow us to make the two-hour drive back home."
n/a,50,Great flight,"The flight was on time and the flight attendants were great; nice and friendly.   I think we landed a little early.   Check-in was fast, boosting was fast and orderly.   Luggage took a few minutes but it was announced when it would be coming out and which luggage carousel it'd be on."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Their policies made them my only option- thankfully,"We were flying back home after surgery at the cleveland clinic. We were not sure what day we would fly as we did not know how long we would be hospitalized after the surgery. I booked flights for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. When we learned the day of the flight, I cancelled the other 2 days without any charges. Only southwest permits this possibility.The only reason I did not give them a 5 rating is that the cabin seems to be smaller as they cram more seats in, just as all airlines"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight ,Flight left on time and arrived early Just what you always get when you fly Southwest The flight attendants were all great and friendly as they always areI love Southwest
n/a,20,Early Birds BEWARE ,"The purpose of me buying early bird check-ins,  is to ensure that at least my wife and two kids can sit together.  I try to sit in a row across, behind or in front.  But I will pay extra to have them together.  Well, early bird doesn't guarantee that!  After paying for this, we were still in boarding group B.  Which meant that 90% of the plane was filled before we could board due to sooooo many people being allowed to board after group A, but before group B...for various reasons.  Southwest will gladly take your money for a service that has ZERO advantage at times, like in this case."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great customer service and friendly crew!,"Before booking my flight I was hesitant because it was a connecting flight with an hour layover. I called Southwest with my concern, the rep was very reassuring and helpful. I had to contact Southwest a couple other times with questions, again the reps were very helpful. I was pleasantly surprised how organized the boarding process went to board the plane with open seating. The flight attendant made the safety demonstration entertaining while being thorough. After the beverages were distributed and disposed of the flight attendants asked each passenger if they would like anything else which was nice. Hope to fly Southwest in the future."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Best US based airline I've ever experienced,"Hands down best experience on a US based airline! Short flight however the upbeat music upon entry, service with a smile and the jovial warm attitude of the staff were a breath of fresh air!Chris if you're not already - you should be doing stand up comedy somewhere bro - 😂😂😂"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Light passenger list,"Never the same.  Todays flight was very early, leaving Orlando at 6:45 am.  We were easily on time as the plane was on 1/3 full.  The flight attendant as we boarded said we could all have our same seat and lay down to catch up on our sleet.We received our drink and bag of cookies very quickly.  Unlike other flights, we were not offered another round.  I just found this different for Southwest."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Service Service Service,i just love this airline... i would fly it over and over again. the staff is always so kind and patient. they are funny and courteous
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good flight - slow baggage,"Flight was on time and in flight service was decent, but baggage handling was extremely slow at Midway - took 40 minutes to get bags."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Made me feel at home,Everyone at the airport was helpful. The plane was clean as well as the inside of the airport. Easy to find what I needed. The flight attendants were pleasent
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Worst Airline Experience,"Let me start by saying - It was open seating and seats were comfortable. Maybe there was too much ice and very little water in the cup but the flight was pretty smooth. So I have nothing against the crew in flight. Its the ground service at counters which is terrible. I work in the hospitality and tourism industry and am more observant in terms of - are you understanding and relating to the customer, even if not able to do anything according to policy? Answer is ‘No’ for the Indianapolis staff of Southwest Airlines. Not that anything more was expected from this state. Having stayed here for my whole college experience, I know that ‘Hoosier hospitality’ is a big lie.  I was treated with a straight cold faces, an absolute ‘no’ to all my requests and a frustrated ‘you should have gone to that counter’ (I had left my bag tags at the counter next to her - what a sin). In short, they have convinced me to believe the opposite of all that I have heard about Southwest - Its a terrible airline and I’d rather pay the extra bucks for my bags than enjoy the cold hospitality of this company."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Super way to travel and not have to pay for baggage or exchange fees!,"The Southwest experience is always great. In Raleigh, they are in a separate terminal which makes check-in less of a hassle and the TSA lines are shorter. Flights are always comfortable and on-time if not a little early. Can't say enough about the free bags and no change fees. Great way to travel if your plans are flexible or change."
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Always a Great Time,"We've flown Southwest many times. Our flights are always on time, or pretty close to on time. The staff have at times had the whole plane laughing. They're always in a good mood and clearly enjoy their jobs. Good prices too!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,First and probably last time with Southwest,"My family traveled on Southwest for the very first (and probably last) time this past Sunday. We booked Business Select tickets from Nassau to Providence with a stop in Baltimore. It was supposed to depart at 4:10 PM. We knew they were expecting bad weather in Baltimore so we were checking the flight status all morning. At about 1, I received a text stating the flight from Baltimore (not Nassau) was cancelled. I called customer service and their suggestion was to get to Baltimore and then figure out how to get home from there. We checked in at Nassau ~3 hours before departure and were told we weren't flying that day. Apparently the entire trip was cancelled. A few minutes later, I get another text stating we're rebooked on a flight the next day with a ~8 hour layover in Ft. Lauderdale. Neither my wife or I could miss work the next day so we told them we had to get to Baltimore and would rent a car and drive home if necessary. It would have been a rough ~7 hour trip in rain/sleet/snow but we didn't have a choice. I reserved a car at that point. After much waiting around, they rebooked us on the same Baltimore flight but this time it was on Wanna Get Way tickets. At no point we were told this. I specifically paid top dollar for the Business Select tickets for a few reasons, including the ability to board early so our family could sit together. We were also presented with flight vouchers, each worth ~$200 with no explanation. We assumed it was because the original flight was cancelled but it turned it was because they cancelled the Baltimore to Providence fight altogether. When we boarded the plane, there were only single seats available so my 8 and 10 year old kids each sat with strangers. I spoke to the gate agent at BWI and asked if there was any way we could get on the later flights to Providence or Boston that night. Eventually they were able to book me on the last flight to Providence and the rest of my family on the last flight to Boston. However, in addition to using the vouchers we received earlier in the day, we had to pay an additional ~$350. I called their executive customer service today to complain. They offered to refund the extra money paid and also offered $75 ea in vouchers but I still think we should have been entitled to much more. If they communicated better I would be more understanding but it was a disaster!"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Love this Airline!,"This was the first time I've flown Southwest, and it was one of the best flights I've ever taken! I didn't feel crushed into my seat like other airlines. I'm right at six feet tall and usually my legs are pressed against the seat in front of me. It was comfortable and having the in flight WiFi was a huge plus! I plan to flight Southwest every chance I get in the future now!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Customer Service,"We prefer to fly Southwest because of the friendly service, efficiency of boarding without spending additional fees and offer of checking bags free.  On this flight, we even chose to connect in Baltimore in order to take advantage of Southwest's features.  Weather delayed our flight from Atlanta and we had only 15 minutes in between flights, so we accepted the fact that our checked bag would not arrive in Boston.  Voila!  It did....attesting again to Southwest's commitment to great customer service!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Bad travel experience turned around by GREAT customer service!,"My husband and I went on a trip to Napa Valley and on our return flight we sat through a 2 hour delay, 1.5 hour total power outage at the airport, even longer delay and then eventually a cancelled flight. I wrote to Southwest about the experience and I had a response in less than 24 hours with $400 in vouchers (to offset the cost of a hotel and other expenses because of our canceled flight) and a lengthy apology. I had a previous problem with American Airlines and spent countless hours on the phone and emails and they did nothing to try to make things right. Southwest is HANDS DOWN the best customer service airline and I'm a loyal customer for life now. PS - the free pretzels, cookies, drinks and fun flight staff is a bonus!"
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Horrible organization in Punta Cana,"Thinking of flying Southwest Airlines to Punta Cana - you may want to reconsider! We did early bird check in and had A 57, 57 and 58. With no notice in the airport they put last call on sign at the gate and called each group of 15 up and sent us outside to the buses. We boarded the buses and then all the B and Cs got on after us - we roads to the plane and all the B and Cs got off before us and boarded the plane ahead of us - we had paid for early bird and they let everyone rush and push to get on the plane I whatever order with no organization. Very disappointed in this airline and the service provided in Punta Cana. Also selling drinks for $7 in a tiny poured cup is ridiculous."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Anniversary trip,"In my opinions southwest airlines is the most affordable, convenient and closest to travelers that live in the Southside of Chicago. I love the fact that i get to take two checkin luggage at no charge plus your carryon and personal bag. I get to take everything i need for my vacation. I highly recommend southwestvacations.com for an affordable package."
Date of travel: January 2019,50,"Great flight, free pretzels and 2 bags FREE !!","After flying various airlines this year, great relief to fly Southwest. The airfare was a fair price and we ate free pretzels with a complimentary beverage. We enjoyed ginger ale and a Sprite. Also it was nice to bring all the shoes, clothes and buy souvenirs without the hassle of limiting items we could take. We could fly empty and shop to fill our luggage. We also brought a bottle of wine ok. We are slender to average sized people so we were very comfortable in our seats."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,I can see why people like SWA,"I’m an Alaska frequent flier, but chose SW because it offered a nonstop option to PDX. Booking on the website is straightforward and easy. I even paid $10 for early bird check in, but never used it (more on that in a bit). SW provides two free checked bags and free changes to flights (you’ll only pay a difference in fare, if applicable). I arrived at the ticketing counter and it swelled with people. Panicked, I lined up to print my bag tag. To my relief, the lines moved quickly and I was on my way to security. There is no assigned seating. Rather, you’re given a boarding zone (A-C, 1-30, 31-60). The earlier you check in, the better your boarding zone.I’d never flown SW before so I found the concept baffling, but it worked. People queue during their boarding zones and the lines move along. I paid for early bird, but couldn’t check in before the 24 hour mark. I’m still not sure if that’s the privilege of early bird. In any case, I received A25. In the end, it didn’t matter because I changed to an earlier flight and they assigned me C10 :( Luckily I checked in my bag so I wasn’t scrambling for overhead bin space. As expected, only middle seats were available when I finally boarded. I asked the gent in row 8 if I could sit in the middle and he obliged. SW has quite comfortable seats. They’re thick and well-padded. I dozed off during takeoff. The crew were friendly, but I didn’t interact with them. I even missed the drink service, but it was a 6 am flight so sleep (catching up on it) was a priority. We landed in PDX on time and my bags was one of the first out. Am I a SW convert? No...I still enjoy my free upgrades on Alaska. Would I fly SW again? I would. It’s a solid experience."
Date of travel: January 2019,30,No Reserved Seats,"If it were not for the baording system, I would rate South West excellent.Let me explain, when you purchase a ticket you do not get an assigned seat, you get a position ex. A, B, or C. Lets say you get A20 that means you may go in early perhaps 19 people before you. Thats what you think!!! No, first the wheel chair patrons and partners go in, we usually count about 20 to 30 wheel chairs at Islip, That is approx.40-60 passengers before you.All of these people go on with wheel chairs, but many walk off (a miracle flight) on their own. If this is not enough another group goes on before you, those who need extra time (whatever that means)Now you can board the plane, You were first on line but about 70 people went before you, so you may get a seat past the wing.What if you have B or C?? Good luck hunting for seats together for a family, you may have to seperate and sit where you can. I hate this system, but the reps. at southwest tell me most people love it. I dont know many people who like this system, but South west refuses to go to a system of assigned seats. With assigned seats, you know where you are sitting. it would reduce wheelchairs for those who do not need them. Your bloodpressure would not climb everytime you try to get a seat.Why does South West refuse to assign seats ??????  Its only FAIR!!!!!! and it would stop me from complaining every time we fly SW"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Funny, professional flight attendants","We love Southwest Airlines. Start with great prices, lots of flights including non-stop,free baggage, then add in that many of their flights have attendants with hilarious sense of humor making the routine safety instructions fun yet informative; makes for one great airline. Changing your flight with SW is easy and a $5.40 fee it isn't financially crippling when life happens and you have to change your plans. You can spend the extra money and pay to board first but I've never done that and still end up with a seat. Going on towards last means I get to pick my seat mates. We travel with SW as often as possible as we never experience anything but professionalism and top notch service!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Cleveland Ohio to Tampa Fl.,"My wife and I have flown SWA many times ,and like how we have been treated by all we encountered .There have been times we checked in late to load an had to set apart. This can be avoided by useing a preboard opion which adds to the cost. By whatching how we spend allows us to go more places. A little inconveneince of not setting togather is ofset with being able to check in 2 bags each plus have a carry on as needed. The planes are clean and its nice to be offered drinks and pretzels. We will fly them again in the future."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Fly SWA to Paradise!,"Yes, it’s under 4 hours (in air) flight. Getting on SWA in Indianapolis was a breeze for the nonstop to Lauderdale. The connections were nearby, so you didn’t have to panic for the next flight. Lauderdale to Cayman was a quick 1.5 hr. The airport is small and clean. We walked right outside to our rental car. Customs was quick and easy to maneuver. We were greeted by a local island band! 🌴"
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Great customer service,I had to cancel my flight. Southwest gave me credit for my cancelled flight valid for an year.Not many do it. Good customer service
Date of travel: November 2019,20,"Cancun, Mexico To Philadelphia, Pa. on Southwest Air",Paid for priority A boarding and got C  boarding. Tried to discuss the problem with the service desk and were told they couldn't help me. I even had my receipt to show proof and was told that wasn't enough.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Mostly good,"My coworkers and I traveled to Orlando for a conference a few weeks ago.  I did not realize that Southwest allowed families to board before passengers who are in a boarding group lower than A.  I'm assuming this is because they want people to pay to upgrade to early check in to get in that A group. We wanted to sit together on the way home, so we all bit the bullet several days before the flight and paid the $20 upgrade fee. When we printed our boarding passes, we realized that some of us were still in the B group, which meant that, even though they paid the upgrade, early boarding fee, they were not allowed to board until after all the families. They asked the desk about getting a refund and were basically told, too bad. I realize they want to look out for families (especially since there are tons coming and going to Disney), but it's kind of crappy to allow people to pay more knowing full well that they will still be boarding behind at least half of the plane. Maybe they should only sell as many upgrades as there are spaces in Boarding Group A. Maybe this is only an Orlando-centric problem seeing as how the number of families is probably ridiculously higher on these flights compared to other destinations. Other than this, there were no issues with these flights."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Late.,Frustratingly we got held up because they messed up there connecting flight schedule.  The excuse was we were waiting on people from the flights... we sat here for 20 minutes and no got on then we took off. Sounds like a pilot had to go to the restroom right before take off on an already delayed flight.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Stolen Items out of my luggage,"In mid September, my husband and I took a short flight from OAK to PDX, as we were moving up to our new place in Portland. I packed my wedding flatware, which I use for special occasions in my check in luggage, thinking that if I added it to my carry on, they could consider it to be dangerous. Up to this point, the other issue I had with Southwest over luggage was a few years ago when they smashed up my new Samsonite luggage from OAK to Long Beach. They did correct the situation by reimbursing me for the damage.However, when I arrived at PDX and our new place, I did not unpack all of my luggage immediately, since we had 4 bags between the two of us. A few days after we landed, I looked for my flatware and found it was missing, except for the butter knives. Someone took out the 12 dinner forks, 12 salad forks, 12 Soup spoons and 12 teaspoons, I called Southwest right away and was told that they would process the claim. When I called customer service, I begged and pleaded for them to find it and return it to me. I don't even want the money for the flatware, I just wanted the flatware because it was sentimental to me. SouthWest said someone could have taken it out of my luggage and not returned it to its place and that many times it ends up at a lost and found in Atlanta. Well, I put in a claim, sent a letter and asked them to check in Atlanta. ALL I wanted was my flatware. it wasn't extremely expensive, but it was Mikasa and it had been discontinued. They denied my claim and when I appealed the denial, they sent me a letter stating that they cannot reimburse everyone for what they ""claim"" they lost  and hoped that I would not give them bad online reviews because of it."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,As scheduled,"Everything was on time and as expected.  Southwest's plan of boarding with open seating is good - especially if you don't mind sitting between people.  Even if you are not in the A seating, there are usually many spots between the aisle people and the window people in the front of the plane."
n/a,10,International check in,"Us citizen flying Denver to Cancun. Online system would not allow me to check in without Visa information. Duh, Mexico does not require a Visa. Took 20 minutes and 4 resets for system to fina7lly accept check in, with a high boarding number. Customer service was completely unhelpful. After an hour of frustration I gave up. Won't fly them again"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best Airline to Fly with Your Pet,"We have flown Southwest Airlines twice on this route now with our miniature poodle (as a pet, not an emotional support animal) and the experience could not have been better! On top of no bag fees, the best flight attendants in the world, and the easiest airports to get in/out of, now I can add flying with my pup to this list as well. Thanks, SWA, for always making my vacation better."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,great airlines,"I traveled over thanksgiving, had a bag to check with a hand mixer in it, also brought two glass pie dishes, 5 pounds of brussels sprouts, and checked it, they but fragile sticker on the bag, was perfect, every thing was in tack."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Southwest, simply the best ! - They do what they say and do it well, consistently.","What can I say?  Other airlines should look at this business model and follow their lead.Start with reasonable fares, not always the cheapest, but usually within a few dollors of anyone else.  Change plans, need to swap flights, dates or whatever?  Pay only the difference in the cost of the fare (or even get a credit!) No BS, no upcharge, no change fees, and this is just plain normal way they do business everyday.  Want to check two bags (max 50# each) and bring a standard carry on and a ""small personal item"" (think backpack or big purse) OK, no sweat and no charge... nada, zero, zilch those FOUR items fly with you for free, ALL THE TIME.  Plus, you get your seating on a first come first served basis, you pick... No pre-assigned seats but you can pay for earlier boarding if you need a special seat or just take what is available.  If you fly solo, this is great as there are always open seats well into the B boarding group for solos... Pick where you want to be and who you'll sit next to.  I usually get in in the first 10 rows and generally find some smaller people to sit next to, so not crowed.  Flight to NOLA was a breeze and totally on time both ways. LOVE SW Airlines!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Better than expected,I was hesitant about flying southwest as I camt pick my own seat and I fly with my child. This particular trip we had another person flying with is that hasn't flown in over 30 years. It s very stressful not having your own seating chart. However the flight attendants and even other flyer s were so nice and helpful in getting us all seated together. I will definitely be flying with them again
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great flight,Great flight for vacation. Southwest is on time most of the time with more baggage flexibility than other airlines!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,perfect landing,"flight was uneventful which is the best kind of flight. the landing was one of the smoother landings that I've experienced. Domestically, I fly SW pretty exclusively. Another airline has to be extremely price competitive or more direct to destination for me to want to change airlines. That seldom happens. SW has some of the best routes and competitive prices. Appreciate the free baggage and no change fees too!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Typical Flight,Flight was on time.  Pretzels are awful.  Worst snack there is.  Really wish Southwest would look into something else.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Never again,My first time flying southwest. Never again. You board by class. I did not know that. I was always in class C. My husband and I never got to sit together. Ever. Closest was 12 rows apart. I always got the middle seat. Had other couples angry that I had no choice but to sit in the middle of them  as they would not give up the window or aisle seat. Unfortunately all flights were fully booked. Couples would pass stuff back and forth across my lap. Ask me to move and loudly talk across from me and give zero armrest space. I’ll pay the extra 60 dollars in the future for another airline.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Quick Hop from Tulsa to Denver,"Southwest is always an efficient way to go, with no first/business class sections. It's seating is assigned on a first come first serve basis with a frenzy of check ins at exactly 24 hours before the flight to get a decent boarding position. But, if your willing to pay a fee, surprise, surprise, you can guarantee a premium boarding position.One warning to those normal to large size folks!  Don't plop yourself down in the front row if you don't want to be in pain by the end of the flight from being wedged in between two hard walls housing the snack/drink trays.The seats lose about 2 inches of width for each tray. So if your butt is bigger than a typical 12 year olds', move on to a row with normal armrests."
n/a,50,Service and the little extra make the difference. ,"The flight was at the right time, to the right place at the right price. There were a few other airlines that fit the bill but we are happy we went with Southwest. Great price and bring luggage, incredible!! Two checked bags, plus what you bring on and no up charge. They plane had comfortable seats and room for a full backpack in under seat storage. Southwest seems to still understand old school travel with crunchy and sweet snacks and a drink complimentary. My recommendation is to to download the Southwest app ahead of time. They offer free movies and TV through the app while you travel, good way to pass the time. It is important to check in exactly 24 hours before your flight. Your boarding position depends on when you check in. I checked in as the 24 hour ahead minute struck and ended up in B about mid way through. The pickle is if you are traveling in a group you risk sitting seperate. If it is dire to sit all together pay the upcharge to early check in. The exception to this is they preboard families, the children don't end up sitting seperate from their parents. We liked the service and will fly Southwest again..shortly we hope."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,enjoyable,"other than some flyers being their annoying selves,  the flight crew was great, ticketing was easy and the agent gate was very friendly and help when i needed assistance.  plane was clean and pilot was very nice when spoke to on exit."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Another Good Southwest Flight,"Boarding was easy, the inflight entertainment had a constant signal, the pilot gave a few clear pieces of information, and the flight was calm.  The landing was harder than usual but all else was very good.I was happy that the Thanksgiving travel was enjoyable."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest All the Way,"After flying Southwest three times in the past three months, I've pretty much finally decided I'm sticking with them for domestic travel (and Costa Rica/Belize).  I'm generally a budget traveller and look for the best deals, but after decades of flying, I've had it with the crazy on all the airlines.  Southwest is generally on time and their staff, especially their flight attendants, are pleasant and funny.  The flights I'm on seem to also attract more of a business clientele, so the trips are usually pretty calm and quiet.  Also love that I can sit wherever I want, aisle or window, depending on my mood."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy easy easy...as it should be,"The plane arrived on-time and boarded easily.  Arrived on schedule, as did the luggage.  No issues.  I love SWA"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Sacramento here we go!,"Always a treat if you are in the ""A"" section. The airport at Sacramento is among the best in terms of accessibility and food choices beyond boarding border control. The Southwest fleet is usually clean and there is nothing worth eating on the short flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,my favorite domestic,"I swear - I've met two grumpy people who wokr for SWA in all the flights I've taken. I find the boarding simple and I love t he ability to change easily without a huge hit when my business plans change. Definitely the most business friendly in the domestic market. Boarding: I've heard complaints about the ""cattle car line up"": have you SEEN the crush when AA announces boarding?? This is WAY easier"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,EASY CHEESY,I really like Southwest Airlines and fly even when other carriers are cheeper.  Friendly and efficient boarding process.  Always clean  This flight lives up to their standards.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,On Time performance at Thanksgiving,"Flying for Thanksgiving I was expecting a mess but was pleasantly surprised with the ease of boarding, on time departure and arrival and rapid delivery of checked luggage"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Recent flight to Florida,"The flights were great. My only issue was seating. On the way down my husband and I couldn’t sit together due to a full flight and people saving seats for people that were not on time!!! On the way back was better. Even though I registered the exact minute I could, 24 hour in advance still was at the end of section B. Doesn’t seem fair if you are not on time to board you have your seat held!! Wish the attendant could do better with this."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best airline Southwest,"Free checked bags,  non stop flights, polie, helpful employees. Pay a little extra to get checked in 36 hours before flight, no getting up early to check in 24 hours ahead of stopping during dinner to check in. Many nonstops so you don't have to worry about bad weather. Easy website to use. Only airline l use."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Southwest Airlines JAX-ABQ-AUS-JAX,"Let's face it flying today in ""cattle class"" is never a pleasant experience.  Reduced seat pitch and extra light seats have made the journey even more uncomfortable than i could ever imagine.  Having said that Southwest is still my preferred discount carrier.  Boarding is clearly spelled out and organized.  The cabin crew is always friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs. I could go on and share my ways for the carrier to make things better for passengers, but I am sure profits matter over comfort so why bother."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Great fare, flight on-time","Great price, includes luggage in fare, one of few non-stop flights, left and arrived on-time.  Only downside is Southwest's way of seat selection."
Date of travel: March 2019,40,Friendly and informal,"The Short flight from Tulsa International to Denver international, about 1 hr 45 min was on time with clean comfortable seating and friendly crew. The boarding process is different to other airlines so need to be aware. Passengers are to board the plane as per boarding group A, B, or C and number 1-60. which are assigned when you check in. Since I traveled on Business Select, I was in group A Group which is followed by Rewards Members and the remaining Customers in the A Group, adults with children, before groups B and C. It has an open seating policy, so sit in any available seat when you board. Boarding and selecting your own seat gave an informal atmosphere, but I am not sure if everyone would like it.Flight has paid WiFi access during your flight, however need to download the Southwest app before boarding if you want to view. No fancy snacks just preztels and a drink. Being in business Select I could choose an alcoholic drink if I wanted. The view on landing on the mile high city was nice as the snow was slowly melting being in late March."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"On time, no hassles, smooth flying from A-Z","Just to let you know another great flight. From the assistance I got for my pre board pass, to the flight attendants, ground crew, and the pilots that got us home. The pilots let us know beforehand about the upcoming turbulence, which was comforting. Thanks again. The only way to fly is Southwest, or drive. ✈️👍🙏🏻🇺🇸"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Birthday Trip To Seattle,"My wife and I went to Seattle for a birthday celebration. Fortunately, I had a companion pass for my better half to travel for taxes only - essentially a free fare. The flights (outbound and return) were very good. We left a little late going to Seattle but arrived on time. In-flight service on both legs was very good - typical SW efficiency. The outbound flight involved a transfer in Oakland which is always inconvenient. But for the return, we were “throughs” (stopped but did not have to change planes). Flying SW of Ontario, flight options to most Western states airports is good but for travel to points east of the Mississippi, Los Angeles is probably a better option."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent employees.  Helpful and friendly.,All employees both in the terminal and on the flight were extremely friendly and helpful.  I was in a wheelchair and received exceptional service and ALWAYS with a smile!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Never fails me!,"We are never disappointed with Southwest.  On the worst of days they far outshine their closest competitor.  In the instances where we cannot fly Southwest we will re-route our plans, if possible.  They take great care of us and our luggage.  There are never fees for luggage and never a small little plane."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Great airline! Efficient, flexible and a great value.","Have taken this route several times now, and it has been a pleasure each time. Southwest does a great job getting you where you want to go, and the crews are always cheerful, and they make the trip a breeze.The free piece of checked uggage, and the ability to reschedule your trip without a hassle are also great perks."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Mrs,"The best airline, the employees are funny, make feel as a family . There is not better airline. Excellent customer services, their priority is to give great services to the customers. Outstanding. Please do not change."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,A slight delay for one connection but overall good experience,"Initial flight from DEN to LAS left on time, but final flight from LAS to RNO was delayed in boarding for a half hour or so. Then, when the aircraft pulled back from the gate, a 2-hr delay ensued -- 1hr for repairs and 1hr for paperwork. Flight crew kept us informed and the flight went smoothly to RNO. Kudos to Southwest and our particular crew for handling a difficult situation well."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,No brainer to fly SWEST...,"Love flying SWEST, they truly know what they are doing:  easy purchase on-line, great pricing and times, hassle-free boarding, you pick your own seat, so I almost always get an aisle seat and love the snacks they hand out for free."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Hassel Free Lowest Fares,"I think most would agree that SWA is the best airline. First they do not charge for two bags, they have low rates and you can usually get the seat you want by getting your boarding pass 24 hours ahead of the flight.My last trip was very enjoyable, the young man sitting next to me was celebrating his 21st birthday and when the stewardess found out she had the whole plan singing Happy Birthday to him.Oh did I mention the snacks, cookies yum!!!Free wifi"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Up and back,While Southwest isn't my favorite airlines they did a great job on this up and back the same day business trip.  They were on time and efficient.  Price was great too!
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Will never fly again,"They messed up our flights more than once, damaged my luggage beyond fixing and didn't care, we booked out flights at the same time but the put my wife is boarding group a and put me in C? How does this happen? No organization and unprofessional staff."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,replaced luggage,"A piece of our luggage was damaged between the time we dropped it off in Oakland and picked it up in Maui.  We brought it to the attention of a very polite and helpful attendant at the Kahului airport who took the details, took photos, and gave us information on how to have the piece replaced.  The website was easy to navigate and three days later I had a brand new piece of luggage delivered to my door.  I am very happy with the care and attention I received."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Smooth sailing!,Flying with Southwest is the best way to go and be sure to check in early for best seat selection. Smooth flying and all flights were on time.
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Roundtrip to St. Louis,"Totally uncomfortable seating. I've driven between Philadelphia and St. Louis in the past, and for this level of discomfort, I'll go back to driving."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Making customers pay for bad management,"This was a return leg from an trip to Las Vegas for a granddaughter's birthday. We had an early boarding position on a non-stop flight to Baltimore. The problems are as follows:(1) Absurd pricing. Why should there be a $200 per person difference each way in flying from Philadelphia to Vegas versus flying from Baltimore to Vegas? For $800 we'll drive the extra 90 minutes each way to BWI, but its a hassle.(2) Text message at around 1:15AM cancelling the flight ""for mechanical reasons."" Really? At that hour? And of course there are immediate long wait times for agents since the night shift is understaffed.(3) Automatic rebooking into a flight that is really inconvenient for us, without giving us a chance for input. I got to bed at 4:30 Thanksgiving morning. I would rather have flown the next day.(4) Loss of boarding position. For a flight the next day, I to get my original boarding position, I was quote a $1,000 surcharge. The agent also told me that Southwest had restricted what agents could do to help customers. As it was, to be able to sit with my wife on the first part of the inconvenient diversion through Nashville cost me an extra $100.(5) Inconsiderate agents. I was told if I had problems with the staff, I should write the company.OK, Southwest is short of planes because they made a blunder in overcommitting to the 737 MAX aircraft. Not my problem. They understaffed for the holidays. Not my problem. They provide no considerations to the customer, and in fact I'm out an extra $100. That is a problem. And I have to put up with cramped aircraft and rude staff. That is a problem."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best North American Airline Out There,"Southwest is consistently the best airline for flying throughout North America for me. I love their staff, they make the website easy to use, the free bags are great and everyone seems to actually /care/ not only about their job but your experience. I am thrilled to find an airline I can depend on."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Trip To DC,I fly Southwest quite a bit and I particularly like flying with them on trips to Washington DC because the Reagan International airport is so convenient. Baggage pick-up is right  on your way out the door and it never seems to be that crowded.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Southwest as Usual,It was a standard Southwest Airlines experience. As an A-list person I find the experience very good.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Love Southwest!,Anytime I fly I look directly on Southwest.com first. I will pay more to fly with Southwest (although that is rare!) because they are so nice to their customers. First 2 bags free. No designated seats. Great flight attendants with a great sense of humor.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always a delight,"I'm a regular Southwest flyer for several reasons: - Their staff is always courteous and helpful. They seem genuinely happy that you are there. - No silly fees. They don't nickle and dime you will fees for bags, seats, etc. - Easy to cancel flights and rebook. No crappy fees to do so."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Dropping MKE to LGA,"Very disappointed SWA will drop their round trip service, w/o explanation. Planes usually full. Or near full."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,"Transparent pricing, all inclusive!","I searched for weeks for the best deal out there. I used KAYAK among other search engines for flights. Each had you pay for your luggage, variant seating prices, WiFi; all added on to a base price. Southwest Airlines included all of that within their price, which made deciding very easy. Once I added up all the expenses I would need for bags, having a semi-decent seat it was always more or just about the same price as Southwest Airlines. There are all inclusive ticket price is worth it. On this trip I flew on three separate flights. For each of these flights, they were comfortable, drinks were great, and WiFi worked well. Very enjoyable flights all around. I highly recommend!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"good service, on time and pleasant","Good service, nice people, on time. No hassles. A little turbulence, but hey,  it's flying. Could not go have gone much better."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Do not reserve ahead of time as they may arbitrarily change your flights,"I make the drive one and one half hours from southern Maine to Manchester, NH to fly Southwest to receive the benefit of direct flights. I reserved one such flight around June, 2019 for a scheduled vacation in November, 2019. Assured that my party would arrive in Orlando in plenty of time (around 10:30 am) I reserved a dinner show which had to be pre-paid. I received notification in late August that Southwest had eliminated the direct flight to a connector in Baltimore which would arrive in Orlando at 12:50 pm. My dinner show being at 6:15 I was unhappy and called the airline to get back my direct flight but was told the flight had been eliminated. I asked for an early bird option gratis to compensate for the lost direct flight but was told we do not do that. In Baltimore we were delayed not once but three times finally arriving in Orlando after 3:30 pm. The transfer from the airport to my resort was another 45 minutes (this is standard). We reached that destination after 4:00 pm and were told that the free Disney transportation would probably not get us to our dinner reservation on time and had to hire a cab at an added expense of $43.00.I have flown Southwest several times in the past but now am considering other options. I can get a connector flight 15 minutes from home in S. Portland why bother to go with Southwest as they may drastically change your plans at any time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best crew !,The experience with southwest is a different type then all othersFirst at the gate they had us play silly games like guess the game for southwest cards drinks and money and there were 4 winners !In the flight quick efficient not 17 class like some airlines simple check in get a spotLast on the plane the staff was great Even the rap provided was entertaining
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Only a Few Faults,"For the most part, Southwest has been our go-to airline for many years. We haven't noticed many things wrong until this year when things seemingly began to fall apart. In May 2019, we took a short trip to Florida. On the night before our 5 am flight back home, we received a text saying our flight was canceled. No explanation. They made us book a new flight, and charged for all of the available non-stop flights back (you had to pay for all new tickets), although we had previously had a non-stop flight, WITH prioritized check-in. We had A- boarding passes, and with our new tickets, we were given C boarding passes. It was one of the most stressful trips we have ever taken, thanks to the flight problems. Not only that, but on the way there, our flight got delayed because of a late flight attendant, not allowing us to get there until the late hours of the night, and making us miss our ride to the hotel. Along with that, on a flight home from another destination in August, nobody arrived to the check-in counters until less then two hours before our flight. Everyone was left standing, waiting to check in, and the workers were getting coffee! Southwest has never had problems like this before, and for the most part, flights with them are unproblematic and smooth. Your best choice is to take morning flights, as they always seem to run much smoother! I would reccomend Southwest all of the time, just always make sure you are aware that problems like these can occur, and can happen."
n/a,50,Flying SWA is a Pleasure,"Flew from KC to Midway Chicago. No problems, left on time, landed on time. Would highly recommend!! Midway is under construction, but still easy to get in and out of. Excellent service and attendants were very nice."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Great flight!,"As always, we had a great flight on SouthWest.  I am a travel agent and I do extensive research before booking a flight.  Southwest always has the least expensive, non stop.  The luggage is included and they don't kill you with the ""extra"" charges."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Flight,"We fly Southwest often and there is a difference in the flights.  This one was so enjoyable. From the time we boarded until the time we left, everything was seamless.The inflight movie I watched was just a bit shorter that our flight time.  It was nice to watch the entire film from start to finish.The flight attendant who told us about the safety features had a very pleasant voice.  The pilot did not talk throughout the flight and the few announcements were not overly loud."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Terrible,"Rude FLIGHT ATTENDANT!! (The asian girl)Flight 1596Nov 27, 201911:20AMI am really pissed. She was really rude! Worst flight attendant ever!!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Comfy and lots of leg room.,Both flights had a little turbulence but flight crew was very informative and made the flight comfy and enjoyable.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love flying with Southwest,"I broke my leg the first day in Mexico.  I did not want special attention on the flight home because my boyfriend said I would be the last one off the plane.  When I got on the plane with crutches, the stewardess placed me in the very first seat for extra room.  She then helped me disembark the plane first.  I wish I had gotten her name.  She was so wonderful.  Kudos SW.  I hope I never have to fly another air carrier"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Annual Trip,On time or early departure on both outbound & return segments and friendly service.  The one issue is the preboarding of wheel chairs passengers & their caretakers who sometimes number 3-4.  There were almost 15 wheelchairs & caretakers who preboarded on the BWI flight but somehow most of them were able to walk off the plane & to their next flight.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Dependable and Efficient,"I have been flying Southwest since 1974. While many things have changed over the decades, what has not changed is their focus on customer satisfaction. Some people do not like the ""no reserved seats"" policy, but that's what helps keep prices down. I spring for early bird check-in, and no worries. Love that you fly with bags free and that you can change or cancel without a fee. LUV Southwest."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,OK for an airline,We flew from Baltimore to Las Vegas via Southwest. There are no longer any really good air lines so our expectations remain low. Southwest got us there and back without incident  - so that made it good. Southwest - nothing special but not a disaster either. Unfortunately SW is probably the best airline from a group of mediocrity.
n/a,50,Business trip,"The flight was inexpensive but, great service, as always. The crew were helpful and efficient when getting us snacks and drinks. The flight was smooth. The Wi-fi wasn't working on the flight out but time passed quickly by conversing with the lovely lady seated next to me."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Always the best choice for cheapest fare and nice service overall.,"Been traveling SWA past 20 years. Standard snacks, Frito's, Pretzels and Lorna Doone on this one.  Bags arrived at LAX but took 45 minutes to get them at the baggage claim. Other than a full flight - (which SWA flight isn't full) - it was a good one. Wished they didn't put so much ice in the cup, so you can get more soda.  Bring your own in flight entertainment. No power ports on these planes, so charge your phone or tablet fully beforehand."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Arrived early!,"As always, they made the common uncommon with their support for the OSU Buckeyes  in their safety speech. Flight attendants were friendly. Pilots were cognizant of mild turbulence. We even arrived early at our gate."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Poor customer service,This flight was horrendous. The customer service at the kiosks and the counter were worst i have ever seen. Just herded into a cattle shoot of a line. Stood there for 1 hour 45 minutes to get to the counter. People that complained enough were literally ushered to the front of the business line to keep them quiet. Stood there watching this practice for that long just so workers can get back to talking with their coworkers. Once at counter the girl there was actually very nice. Don't recall her name because i was still seething from waiting that long. Then once at gate was told flight was still on time although my app was showing a delay. By the way the flight was not on time. First off change the rules for who can do pre board. Charge everyone or no one.  Funny how some people get pushed to the gate in a wheelchair and pre board and then once to their destination sprint off the plane like they were Jesse Owens. Back from my rant. They started loading passengers before those with small children which is also absurd and then had to let the families skip in front of everyone. The ones with small children should be boarded before everyone. Their lines were unorganized at best. Once on board the flight attendants were not pleasant and made no effort to even act like it. They kept yelling at everyone for putting small things in the overhead bins and that there was no more room in the overhead bins so put things under seats. the bin my things were in was half empty. Then they started repeating angrily the same things over and over again. I really liked when she said to not block the aisle way about 15 times and no one was even standing up. Then the wifi did not work so you couldnt even block the attendants out. Other than that it was a good flight. smooth and landing was spot on. They need to send someone to Jamaica and work on that system a little more. Oh and i thought there was a rule about elderly sitting in  the emergency rows. There is no way that lady that was seating there was helping anyone.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Still an excellent choice to fly,We've been flying Southwest for 20+ years and they are still the best US airline.  They always have pretty full flights.  This time I noticed that more people are paying the $20 one-way fee to get bumped up in line.  It used to be $5 when it first started.  We were in the B30+ line and still managed to get seats together.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Routine Fligt,A routine flight is always a good flight. No surprises. Southwest got the flight loaded and away from the gate on time and arrived a little early. Boarding and deplaning we’re without a hitch or delay.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Points,"All was fine with my flights. Each leg of my journey had completely full planes but that did not matter. Of course I wish they had more direct flights from Providence, but the Baltimore airport is a decent place for a layover."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always reliable,"What I love about Southwest is their timeliness. Doors are shut on time or even early. Pilots often save time. Flight staff are accommodating, I try to fly Southwest whenever possible."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight,I use Southwest for most of my air travel. The price is right and they offer great customer service and a large selection of scheduling and destination options.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Going and coming,Last March or April  I purchased tickets on Southwest to Fly to Los Angeles for a connecting flight to Brazil.  I also purchased returning tickets from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City.  About a month before our scheduled flight I was notified by Southwest that our return flight was cancelled and they had scheduled us a different flight.  However that scheduled did not guarantee our Brazilian flight would allow us to make the connecting flight back to Salt Lake City.  So we had to take a later flight which meant a 4-5 hour layover.  After a long flight from Brazil we had to an extra long walk to the Southwest terminal at LAX where we discovered out later flight was delayed.  At 77 and 75 years of age this was very hard on us.  Had We known what we would have faced we would have scheduled our return flight with a different carrier.  For this reason I could not give Southwest the highest rating.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Friendly people, on time departure","We fly Southwest whenever we can. The crew is always friendly, departures are almost always on time, and 2 checked bags fly free! The choose your own seat system takes a bit of getting used to, but when you know what to expect, it works. The free snacks and soft drinks help pass the time and are also appreciated."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good flight and on time.,Southwest takes 2 bags per ticket for your flight and was on time and easy to get good seats by logging in remotely 24 hours before you flight.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Return from country,Back end of first flight.  Love the loading process.  We had no problem getting a seat and space for carry-ons. The flight was smooth and arrived on time.  Also great value.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Country Getaway,1st time wit Southwest and we were very pleased.  We liked their loading procedure and the service on board was quick without disruptions.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,you get what you pay for...,"Prices are inexpensive, especially when bags are included.  Just a basic flight though with no bells and whistles.  Wish they had inflight WIFI and diet mixers.  If you are diabetic or watching calories, plan to bring your own from the airport.  I don't fly with Southwest enough to remember to check in early so that I won't be the last one seated on the plane.  They use an in order check in system instead of prepurchasing seats.  I should just remember to set an alarm on my phone to check in 24 hours in advance."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Quick and smooth,"Excellent flight, flight attendants with a sense of humor ! I love Southwest because I could check 2 bags for free. This was important because after my 4 days in New Jersey and New York  I boarded a ship for a 10 day New England cruise which means I had clothes for 14 days  of cool weather, so long sleeves  sweaters and jeans ."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,SW continues as an excellent airline choice,"SW Airlines does a great job hitting the Golden Mean between being a budget airline and offering lots of extras. Budget because the prices are lower than the main airlines with no reserved seating and few frills. Extras include 2 free checked bags, carry-on at no charge, friendly check-in and gate staff and on-board flight attendants. Greenville to Baltimore is daily non-stop, something that neither AVL or other GSP carriers offer."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Direct Non stop,"I fly Southwest because they seem to have the best and easiest mileage program.  Assuming they have direct flights from where one starts that is, they are great to deal with.My only complaint is they are down to just pretzels.  For those of us gluten free, that leaves us with nothing. Peanuts have become taboo.  How about cashews? Or anything not containing gluten?"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,No hassel,"I haven't flown in years but the flight was very smooth, attendants very nice and welcoming, check in luggage outside very fast. Enjoyed the flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest reliable as usual,"Southwest was reliable as usual on my last trip to San Francisco. I'm not a big fan of making connections but decided my options were slim to now for my recent trip to and from San Francisco. So I was on a total of 4 aircraft on this trip. Although one of my flights had a slight delay, I had no trouble making connections or getting where I wanted when I wanted. Friendly flight crews help me relax as well."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,My favorite airline,We always fly Southwest because we can get a direct non-stop flight to Ft. Myers.  They have several daily flights from Indy to Ft. Myers and we can pick the time of day that I want to fly.  We also fly because they don't charge to check a the first two bags!
n/a,50,Great experience,"I travel with a folding walker.  I used it to the door of the plane and when I arrived at the gate in Dallas, it was right outside the plane.  All around easy trip.  Flight attendants were great.  I would not hesitate to fly southwest in the future."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Airline...or Airport.....Not sure...,"Bit of havoc....bit of nonsense...but grateful we got to & fro safely.So we were set to board at 9:15pm, until the airport employee explained our crew had not arrived....and she assured us she would start boarding once they showed...which they did 10 mins later, and finally allowed us to board 5 mins after that (that's 9:30pm in case you're counting)...When we arrived, we were told the airport was short staffed and missing a jump gate and we would be waiting no more than 5 mins....15 mins later they were finally attaching the gate.Meanwhile, the crew just stayed in the front, next to the cabin, with no measure or means to control or direct the already on their feet and lingering plane passengers...So....airport or airline...not sure where to point."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Comfortable and convenient. Fort Lauderdale to Indianapolis with SW,"Very inexpensive, comfortable seats and convenient time. Fort Lauderdale to Indianapolis with Southwest Airlines also includes the bagagge. No drama."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flighting SW to Cancun,I always try to fly Southwest Airlines when I can.  Great flight.  On time.  Nice people. Snacks. What more can you ask for?
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest Airline flight,I have been flying internationally and within United States for over 20 years.  Over time I have been witness to all of the limited rights we used to have dwindle to slowly being almost non existent.  My recent flight on Southwest airlines was so refreshing!  The other airlines charge for both check ons and some for carry ons now. Also for international.Southwest gives 2 check ons free and 2 carry ons!  They are friendly and my flights both ways very comfortable and non stressful!  They now go international and I highly recommend going without Southwest next time booking a trip.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,On Time,"No complaints from me against the Southwest Airlines staff on this flight.  It would be nice if other customers would not be so rude, would not be running late, would follow rules and not bring more or bigger luggage on board than allowed by the airplane and just check the luggage in."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great airline!,"We were travelling to Florida and frequently fly Southwest as they do seem to be on time. The flight attendants were very nice and had cheery dispositions as did the pilots. They smiled and it seemed they actually enjoyed their jobs, unlike other airlines I fly.  I like watching movies and TV shows as it makes the trip faster and SW offers a nice variety of free movies and live TV channels. If you are a frequent flyer you get free drink coupons and the service is usually pretty fast. Flying is not what it used to be, but at least Southwest makes the extra effort for its passengers."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Best of the low cost airlines.,"This was a one stop flight with a change of planes in St. Louis. We like Southwest due to reasonable fares, free bag, no extra fees, and you can use your miles for any flight. People either love or hate the open seating system. The employees are generally friendly and helpful or even hilarious. Cons: having to check in 24 hours in advance to get a good place in line, and not as many non-stops as I would prefer."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Flight!,"A friend and I recently flew from Sacramento, CA to Providence, RI.  We flew non-stop to Baltimore, then a quick flight on to Providence.  Both flights were on time, and the flight attendants were friendly and took very good care of us.  I'm always impressed with Southwest.  The prices are great, and they're almost always on time, or early. Another great trip, in part, due to our Southwest flights!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,They take pride in what they do!,"We traveled R/T from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale Fla.  The check in app on my phone worked excellently, The bag check in staff was efficient and pleasant and the plane's crew from the capt. to the flight attendants were excellent.  Both planes left on time and arrived on time.  Finally, our bags arrived at both destinations with no delays.  This airline does it right.  We flew on the ""want to get away"" ticket and the price was the best for our travels.  Keep up the good work!  Our favorite airline!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I could hear the flight attendant. He needs to TEACH EVERYONE ELSE,"It’s not that I have not heard the emergency instructions before. It was VERY REFRESHING to listen to the man from Gulfport, Mississippi on the Baltimore to St. Louis leg intentionally talk slow and clear enough to clearly express that he cares enough that we hear and understand. He communicated effectively and that is rare any more. So I listened. Thank you enough for caring."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Southwest is good for short haul trips.,"Southwest is a great low cost airline.   They started that way under Herb K, and they have built quite an airline.   I would give them 5 stars, if they would give me just a bit more legroom.    I have a tough time understanding how the FAA allows such small space between seats.   There is a rule that, in case of an emergency, everyone must be able to be evacuated in 90 seconds.    I don't think that is possible on SWA.  Other than that, a great airline, even though they have stopped serving peanuts."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest Airline Superb,"We've always been very happy with Southwest Airlines, and this flight was no exception. Everything ran on time and every person with the airline staff was very friendly and professional."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Southwest’s typically nice staff,On time flights. 2 bags free. I was happy that the arrival gate was next to departure gate for transfer at FLL.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,ok,"car broke down on the way to the airport. changed our flight no problem. had to wait at the airport 8 hours for the next flight.airport is so overpriced for every and anything. I don't like how you get in line according to section and get whatever seat is available.lucky if you get a seat together with anyone with you and always stuck in the back. with no carry, on have to wait forever to get off. I think people with no carry-ons should be closer to the front so you can just get up and go.since it was Halloween the brochure in the seat said we get a free cocktail. we did have to ask and was made sure to be told only onall drinks even a soda is a very small plastic cup.new orleans southwest was so unfriendly.not sure they are really worth it flight was not cheap."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always reliable,"I’ve been a fan of Southwest Airlines for years. When I get on a plane for short hauls, I just want to get from Point A to Point B, safely and in relative comfort. Southwest is that go to choice for me. They’re the first airline I check when planning a trip. Their staff both on the ground and in the air are always courteous.  The fact they don’t have assigned seats really doesn’t matter - check in early on line and you’ll most likely be fine. And “2 bags fly free” is a big plus, especially on top of their low fares."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Wonderful Airline!,"Southwest is awesome. The staff were nice, the two free bags were great, the seats were comfortable and they reclined, unlike Spirit, whose seats didn't recline. I also loved the free snacks and drinks, too. The staff were funny, and treated you like family. The only complaint I have with them is the entertainment. I couldn't watch movies on a laptop. Otherwise, they are wonderful. We will be flying with them again for sure."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,avoid LAX,After our first flight was cancelled? moved? or delayed by about two hours we arrived at the airport for our scheduled 3pm flight. This flight was delayed another hour. Kinda bummed. The good news is Southwests flight crew is really personable and friendly.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Easy flight to Orlando,"Short flight without any issues.  As you are heading to the ""Land of Disney"" be prepared for many children on the flight.  Fortunately we only had one screamer - and that was at the end of the flight during decent.  Paid for the ""early bird"" registration but still ended up in the A group, 35-39 range.  Desk agent said to pay the extra $40 wasn't worth it so keep your cash in case you need a drink ! ! !"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight,Had a great flight experience from CA to CT. Flight was on time and employees were very friendly and helpful.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,ENJOYABLE FLIGHT...........,"We were flying from Washington-Dulles to San Jose with a transit at Denver. Flights were ontime. Complimentary beverages with snacks were very nice in both sectors. Checkin, boarding, inflight service were very good. Wheel chair service were good at all airports. It was a pleasant flight all through."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Plane felt much roomier!,"I don't fly often, but when I mentioned to my husband how much roomier the plane on our recent trip felt (I thought for sure the ceilings were higher!), he pointed out that the design of the overhead storage compartments had changed, which resulted in a much ""airier"" feeling all throughout the plane.  The colors seemed brighter, and I even felt there was more leg room.  On the way home we were given only ONE tiny package of mini pretzels compared to two on the outbound trip, which made me want to say, ""Why bother?"" but other than that our experience was better than prior flights mainly because of the redesign aspect.  Without paying extra, we did get seats in the upper ""B"" category on the way out and the lower ""C"" category on the way home, but still were able to find seats to accommodate the six of us traveling together in adjacent seats."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Get What You Pay For ....Low Cost Carrier Flights,"Our journey from Puerta Vallarta to Sacramento via Los Angeles be it a long journey the airline in question did the job at a great cost and included 2 free checked bagsThe arrival at Los Angeles at Tom Bradley International to clear customs & immigration was a nightmare as we landed the same time as three flights from China , UK and New Zealand and this took over an hour to complete , thank god we had a two hour plus connection onwards as it would have been tight for the next flightOnboard staff were pleasant and on both sectors complimentary Soft Drinks & Snacks were given out and to be honest it hit us from A to B with little stress ...."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,You get what you pay for,"Listen, typically each flight experience is episodic, some great and uneventful, others not so. This particular flight went off without any problems. The previous flight experience on this route, very problematic. Southwest has a product that tries to deliver predictability and efficiency and pass through savings. But you do get what you pay for. Spend more for a chance at better seat position, otherwise board not knowing where you’ll sit. The most frustrating issue relates to any delay in the system because they compound if they occur early. Southwest relies on multiple segments daily with quick turnovers. Any weather or mechanical trouble and you’re looking at 2+ hours of delay. Lucky if they don’t outright cancel on you. Buyer be warned."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,THREE HOURS DELAY,This is unbelievable. My flight got delayed by three hours. And when I went to talk to the gentleman at the counter his response was “I’m sorry the flight got delayed. Things happen”. Such an inconsiderate response. Then he hands me a piece of paper and tells me “here is a $100 voucher for your next flight valid for a year.” To which I responded “as if I would ever fly with Southwest ever again”. And because of this delay I missed my car rental because they were closed by the time I arrived and I had to wait at the airport for another THREE hours till they opened to get my rental since I had no other feasible options. NEVER AGAIN.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Worst Airline Experience Yet,"I have flown Southwest more than any other airline throughout my life; in fact, there have been years when I've flown Southwest several times per month each year. It goes without saying that until this experience, I was a die-hard loyal Southwest customer.On November 20th, 2019, my husband and I were arriving back in the U.S. after a week-long honeymoon. We had experienced amazing service with every other airline we'd flown with, including Singapore Air and Korean Air. Knowing that I'd always experienced great service with Southwest, I wasn't expecting to run into issues at LAX following nearly 30 hours of travel. Unfortunately, Southwest gave us nothing but problems.We attempted to check our bags in as soon as we arrived, but were told we needed to wait until 4 hours before our departure time, which was at 1:05 pm. While we were there, we discussed earlier flight time availability with the customer service representative. During this conversation, we were told nothing of flight delays or cancellations. We decided to keep our afternoon flight and checked two bags with them at 9:10 am. After going through security, we checked the departures board only to see that every flight from LAX to LAS prior to ours had been canceled. We were concerned and went to talk to the representative at our gate for more information. She told us flights were being delayed and canceled due to rainstorms. Then she got rather snarky with us when we asked for more information about the weather and said ""Obviously, lightning isn't good for planes."" Yes, we know...we're not children - we just want to know if we'll be able to make it home after almost two days of not showering and getting almost zero sleep.Our flight was canceled just after 10:00 am. We went back to the gate to talk with different representatives. We told them we were going to drive to Vegas and could they please give us a refund since they canceled the flight and we need the money to rent a car. They told us they don't offer refunds for flights canceled due to weather. Really? No one is denying that the weather is no one's fault, but why should we have to pay for a service we won't receive? We aren't getting on another flight because we have to get home by a certain time. We have to rent a car and drive 4 hours to Vegas due to this cancellations. Give us our money back!My husband and I asked for our checked bags back. The representatives at the gate told us they would be in baggage claim. We went to baggage claim. No bags. The Southwest employees in baggage claim said they would be at carousel 1. After 20 minutes, still no bags. We went back to their office and talked to them. They said they didn't know how long it would take for them to give us our bags. Essentially, it was a ""It could be 30 minutes or 4 hours. We don't know."" Excuse me? We checked our bags less than 2 hours ago, and you're telling me you won't be able to find them for up to 4 hours? Why? Oh, you don't know that either. Okay, cool.They offer to put our bags on the next flight at 4:15 pm to arrive in Vegas after 6:00. They type our names into their computer and write down our information and reassure us that they will put in a formal request for our bags to be delivered to our home in Las Vegas. Then they give me the number for the Southwest baggage claim department in LAS. Cool, thanks.We rent the car (shout out to Enterprise who took great care of us!) and make the hike to Vegas. On the way, I call the number the Southwest reps gave us in LA. It's not their sister baggage claim department; it's the number for the lost and found office in McCarran Airport. The helpful woman on the phone did what she could to help me, but ultimately informed me that Southwest is known for being extremely unhelpful and that she wasn't surprised I was given the wrong number. ""They don't want to deal with you,"" she said. Awesome. Fortunately, she patched me through to the Southwest baggage claim office. No one answered, so I left a message. An hour later, I receive a call back from a woman who assured me she would keep an eye out for our bags and give me a call back once they arrived. She gave me the direct number for their office. By 10:00 pm, we had been safely in our home for several hours and all my dozens of calls and messages to their baggage claim remained unanswered. Finally, I receive a call from Beth.Beth says my bags aren't there. In fact, not only are they not in Las Vegas, the Southwest representatives who supposedly typed all our information into their computer didn't do anything. There was zero intention for our bags to be sent anywhere. They were going to stay in LAX indefinitely.Beth was awesome - she not only created a report for our bags (something the LAX reps were apparently supposed to do and simply chose not to), she put a rush on them to be on the very first plane out to Vegas. She also contacted the next-shift supervisor, Raven, and put in a request for a courtesy home delivery because, as she said, ""This wasn't your fault and you shouldn't be punished for someone else's mistake."" Thank you, Beth, we feel the exact same way and we appreciate that you understand where we're coming from!The next morning, I received a voicemail from the LAS Southwest baggage claim office. ""Your bags are here and ready to be picked up!""I spend the next few hours calling the number I was given by the first baggage claim rep, as well as calling the McCarran Airport operator to have them transfer me to the Southwest baggage claim office extension. I left several messages on both machines to no avail. Finally, by 12:30 pm, I was just over the entire situation and drove the 45 minutes from my home to the airport to pick up the bags. I paid for parking and walked into the Southwest baggage claim office.Up to this point, I had been excusing their office for lack of communication by telling myself and my husband that there must not be many people working in the office at any given point in time and that they are most likely fielding multiple calls and in-person customers simultaneously, making it less likely for reps to get back to me in a timely manner. Yet, when I walked into the Southwest baggage claim, I saw no fewer than 5 employees working in the office. 1 employee was standing outside the door of the office. 2 of them were helping one couple with a lost bag report. The employee who ended up working with me was walking in from her break, and the supervisor was in his office. After calling dozens of times and leaving almost as many messages and receiving almost no callbacks for nearly 24 hours at this point, I was absolutely livid.Trying to keep my composure, I asked Kylie, the representative who had walked in, if I could have my bags. She pointed to a group outside the office window. ""Are any of those yours?"" she asked. ""No,"" I said, getting angrier by the minute. She led me to another group outside the office and gestured to them. ""No!"" I was getting even more upset. We finally located my bags in their storage office and I asked to speak to her supervisor.I overheard another rep tell Kylie that he was in his office watching a web video. When he came out, I detailed my entire awful experience that I'd had with Southwest. They looked up my information on their computer and saw that the supervisor on the morning shift, Raven, had actually confirmed a courtesy bag delivery to our home that morning when the bags arrived. Yet no one had even thought to look before calling me to tell me to pick them up or even respond to my voicemails all morning. Now I was enraged.This is completely unacceptable. Not only that, it's utterly flabbergasting. I have spent my entire adult life and much of my childhood flying Southwest. I have berated people for choosing other airlines over Southwest because I've always believed Southwest to be the best domestic airline currently available. Now I doubt I will ever fly Southwest again.You refused to issue a refund for something we should absolutely have been refunded. I know it's not Southwest's fault that the weather was bad. But you know what? It wasn't our fault either, and to hold our money hostage when you refuse to provide a service that we already paid for is ludicrous. You refused to give us back our property when we demanded it. If you are canceling all your flights prior to us checking our bags in, why aren't you prepared to cancel our flight as well and have those bags in an easy-to-access location when it happens? We were not the only people in the LAX baggage claim office demanding our bags back so we could drive to Las Vegas. There were several groups attempting the same. You withheld our property for an indeterminate amount of time for no reason whatsoever.You refused to aid us in any way, first by not putting our bags on the next flight, as promised, and second by giving me contact information that was incorrect because, as I now believe wholeheartedly, you simply ""didn't want to deal with [us]."" You had no problem leaving our bags where you left them after we checked in earlier that morning because you just didn't care.You returned my calls twice in 24 hours. I left more messages than I can count and called even more times than that. The ""direct"" number I was given did NOT work. I now know the names of several of McCarran's operators because that was the only way I could get ahold of you, and yet, of the 5 people working in the Southwest baggage claim office at any given point in time, no one had the mere courtesy or respect to call me back.You didn't do your jobs by taking a look at my information before calling me. You assumed that because the bags were there that your job was complete. You forced me to drive an hour and a half out of my way after spending nearly 2 days traveling from the other side of the world and unexpectedly driving 4 hours to get home the day before. You couldn't be bothered with treating my husband and I like the good customers we have always been to you. This is not customer service. I feel utterly disserviced and disrespected on all fronts. The only people I commend at Southwest are Beth and Raven, who obviously know how to do their jobs. Everyone else, including the 5 employees in LAS who worked in the office on the afternoon of Thursday, November 21st, 2019 and the 4 employees who worked in the LAX office on the morning of Wednesday, November 20th, 2019 should be fired, or at the very least, reprimanded.Almost everything we experienced with Southwest over the last few days could have been easily avoided. Instead, you now have many people who will be avoiding your airline as much as possible for the foreseeable future. We will tell everyone we know about how poorly we were treated by Southwest and how horrible our experience with you was. I'm incredibly disappointed and upset by this. If you're a fellow customer reading this, please don't ever use Southwest for any of your important travel. Wedding, honeymoon, funeral, anniversary, birthday, holiday - whatever. They don't know how to do their jobs properly and they don't care about you. All they care about is money in their pocket and butts in seats, and that's all any of us is to them."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very enjotable flight,"I have been on SWseveral times and each one has been a great experience.  The staff is very professional and superb   customer service skills.  Interpersonal skills speak for themselves-;literally.  Each was very patient with each customer whether ambulatory, disabled or with children.  Each wanted to speak to everyone on board and help them transition from customer to friend."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,No frills no problems,Whenever possible I’ll try to fly southwest especially because of the luggage policy as well as the price Over the years I have yet to be impacted in any way that wasn’t expected. I have almost always had issue or inconvenience when flying American or United
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Still one of the best airlines,"Always on time and friendly. Even though the flights are packed full, you don't feel cramped or miserable like on other airlines. No issues on the flight and luggage was delivered quickly. I hope the delay in 737-Max aircraft doesn't hurt the airline as they really are the best one out there."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Swear by Southwest,"I am in my mid-twenties and I absolutely swear by Southwest. It's perfect for me. They allow two free checked bags (up to the standard weight limit) and there is no flight change fee, you only pay the difference between flight costs. The staff is always personable and friendly and the seats are comfortable. I am a Rapid Rewards member and have the SW credit card so I get lots of perks and miles for my spending. It's the best airline credit card I've seen for the price. Being in my twenties and money-conscious, this airline is perfect for me, though I would recommend it to anyone."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best airline Ever,"I seriously recommend Southwest to anyone traveling domestically. This is the only airline I can say has always been a pleasant experience. This last time we traveled was with me, my husband and two year old. Bob was our flight attendant and he was very nice and courteous the whole time. That's especially needed when you travel with a child. Thank you Southwest for once again being the best airline out there!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Cancun for the week,"Used our points, and companion status, to take another trip to Cancun.  Arriving on a Sunday morning meant LONG customs lines, I think it took us an hour.  The flight though was great!  Coming home we had a mechanical delay that meant an hour at the gate waiting for maintenance to come check out the problem.  The flight attendants were great, and Southwest even offered one of us a voucher for a flight at another date.  It seemed a little odd that we both didn't get the offer, but it's all good.  We love Southwest."
n/a,50,Great experience,"My wife and I recently used Southwest Airlines to fly from home to Orlando and it was a wonderful experience. Boarded and departed on time for the most part and arrived even a little early. Nothing bad to say asides I'm always okay with tickets getting cheaper, but otherwise the entire experience was great."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always a great flight on SWA,"Flew home from SD on 11/17/19.  I didn't get the FA name (with the Denver crew), but he was the nicest attendant we have ever had.  Always smiling and asking everyone if they needed anything else.  I hope I see him on another flight!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Birthday Long Weekend,"My daughter and I flew to Phoenix for a long weekend on Southwest. The price was affordable. The crew, both directions, was great. There were 2 minors seated behind us and the staff were very attentive. I live being able to check a bag and carry a bag on for free"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Very crowded,It is so bad how many people they pack onto a plane.  I don't like the open seating because I could not sit with my husband.  Finding two seats together was impossible.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good flight,"Good flight even though it was full. My husband had a window seat and that was important. Attendants were great. A little turbulence as we got closer to Cabo, otherwise it was good."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love Southwest,Love Southwest - Ease of reservations and flight selections to the accommodating and super friendly staff make traveling with them a breeze.  I fly somewhat often and their rewards program is generous.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,PIT to SA,"Thankfully Both legs on time as usual. Just wish there was one nonstop between these 2 cities. Love the fight attendants, did have to wait for the jet way to connect to plane. Had to call maintenance to fix it."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Atl to Pit and return via Southwest Airlines,"I checked in online. Made reservations online. I used the QR code on my electronica ticket to move through the process of getting to my flight. I arrived early, because of TSA anxiety, even though I have pre-check. Lucky me, I was selected for further inspection. One thing that I didn’t like was that you could look up Delta flight on the monitors very easily. Always living with the potential of having to change boarding areas, I was at a loss to try and find Southwest’s.  It was not immediately apparent to me one hour arrived at Concourse C, how to get to my boarding area. There is signage, but it does not adequately address directionality. I really liked that the Atlanta boarding area seating had lots of charging stations. I disliked that the boarding area in Pittsburgh had only a few.  Are used Wi-Fi onboard. I found it very wimpy. I am hearing impaired am I always ask the flight attendants to let me know about any additional announcements, beyond what is explained before takeoff. There’s always announcements. No flight attendant has ever come back and told me what the topic of the announcement was, perhaps weather, information about flight times, etc.  i’m an older girl, i’m lifting my luggage up to the luggage bins, is rapidly becoming more and more difficult. I never trust checking my baggage. I always have just a purse and one standard sized suitcase. I don’t know how this could be addressed, but it sure would be nice if there was a way for me to encourage staff to help me with my luggage up to the luggage bins. The plane was clean. The staff were really really nice. I’d like the itty bitty little teeny pretzels.  The flight was comfortable. We arrived on time. I felt that Southwest is attendant to their patrons and their needs, mostly. I most certainly would recommend Southwest to my friends and family.  Photo:  Dawn from Concourse C."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Pleasant and on-time,"Flying Southwest is always a pleasure. Hit some turbulence but the pilots handled it very well. No long waits, responsive staff, good prices."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great experience!,"First off, I want to say that all of the employees at Indianapolis International Airport were very polite and helpful! Everything went smooth all the way through. As far as Southwest goes, it was a great experience as well. The plane boarded in an orderly fashion and the flight was on time. The attendants were very nice and quite funny. WiFi on the plane is great and the seats were comfy for me (5’7”). I will be using Southwest as much as possible!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"The crew was so nice...the plane, not so much",Sadly there are not options besides Economy. The seats are squished. There are no options for seating. It's basically 1st come 1st served. The crew is very very nice. They make the flight as comfortable as they can and have very positive attitudes even with the most unruly passengers.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,SWA All the Way!!,"SWA is the best airline hands down!! From the call center to the employees at the airport.  I wouldn't fly anyone else.  If SWA doesn't fly there then we don't go to that destination.   We buy at least 75,000 points a year to keep our bank full at all times.  They're points program is by far superior than all of the competition.  Thank you SWA!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I love Southwest,"We recently flew Southwest from Chicago to El Paso with a connecting flight in Dallas, and then back but this time through Denver. So in all we had 4 flights. ALL of them and everything about them was perfect. We had a pleasant experience with checking in, wheelchair service, the flight attendants and our luggage."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,I was pleasantly surprised,"I'd never flown Southwest before, and was skeptical of the boarding plan. I was pleasantly surprised by how well that system worked! Other ""pluses"" include the personable and helpful crew, the seat comfort, and the TWO FREE checked bag offer!We did have a delay when we changed planes in Orlando; the notification system left much to be desired. We reached our destination a couple lates late, but safe and sound.I would not hesitate to fly Southwest again."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Nice clean planes,Flight was on time both leaving and arriving. Although the total flight time was only 2 hours it was a very pleasant flight. The plane was very clean and quite modern. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. The only downside was that the flights that we picked out when we first made our travel plans were changed without notice. We were not told of these changes till the last minute. Other that our flights to and from our destination were very pleasant and comfortable.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Southwest is always our choice for flights.,"We have used Southwest exclusively for around 15 years. We book our flights several months in advance to get the best pricing.  We always purchase the early bird check in option to gain better boarding placement. Southwest has a consistent and organized boarding process in place that is easy to follow. Beverage and snack service is consistent from flight to flight. They usually offer Lorna Dune Cookies, Pretzels and occasionally a small bag of chips Several choices for soft drinks are available. The only complaints I have is the ""Early Bird"" program. (You pay extra to get earlier boarding placement. You are required to check in, on-line, in advance. The check in opens 24 hours before boarding). I always check in the second it opens for check-in. In recent years I have noticed that we always seem to be in the A-40 and above placement. The trend has continued for many trips. This is despite checking in exactly 24 hours before boarding. (The second it opens for check -in I check in. I suspect I could wait for another 12 hours and get the same boarding placement.  The seats are somewhat small and uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight. Leg room is an issue if you are tall or long legged. I try to never sit in a middle seat due to these issues. The aisle and window seats offer the most room."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest A Lister,"I have been flying Southwest for at least 10 years.From the flight attendants to the staff at the airport, Southwest is consistently top-notch!With the exception booking a specific seat Southwest has to be 1 of the best Airlines for Value, comfort, and confidence!Joseph F."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always fun attendants!,Southwest trains their crews to be fun and helpful.  Always a joy interacting with them!  Love that they still offer pretzels also!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent Flight,Southwest always provides a great flight. Everyone is friendly and helpful. It is my number 1 recommended airline.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I fly southwest ,"We travel quite a bit every year and we like to fly with SW especially we both like to golf ( two bags each no charge, no brainer) we don’t care if we have a meal or not , we like their systems if you travel enough you learn to work it , the service is always great and they give us a laugh or two , the bottom line is that we get there"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Beautiful view,"This is an easy flight.  It only takes a little more than an hour.  As you're walking into the plane, sit on the right hand side (driver's side).  This will give you the best view of all the islands on the way to Turks and Caicos.  Make sure you have a pen with you to fill out the customs forms."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Comfortable and enjoyable flights,"We departed out of Nashville TN direct to Fort Lauderdal, the boarding process is normal for Southwest and went quickly. Paying extra for the advanced check in is worth getting a spot in the the A group."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good flight,"Direct flight, non stop was on time, no delays.  Check in was smooth, no issues.  We have flown Southwest a few times, the prices are competitive.  Staff on the flight was very good, no issues."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Not paying bag fees is nice.,"Southwest always has good rates and they usually have a non stop flight to my destination available,  I like not having to pay to check up to 2 bags,  I do wish there was a bit more room on the plane. I think quality over quantity is importan  That being said it was a nice flight overall."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Worst baggage experience,"I don’t know where to start. Let’s just say they lost my bags. So I followed their instructions to locate my bag. They said they located it and we should have it the next day. It was time for us to leave and they still hadn’t located our bag. They asked us for receipts for the items that were in the bag and they compensated us for approximately 300.00. Strike one, the bag was never found. So they told us to file a claim and send receipts for the items lost. We did that. Made sure all the information was correct, made copies and submitted the originals through snail mail. Southwest confirmed that they received our information. And proceeded with the claim process. We claimed a little over $5,000 worth of items. Made sure we followed all of their guidelines. We then waited and waited for follow up and correspondence, there was none. So we decided to call, they told us they sent a letter out and read an address to confirm. Strike two, we told them that was the wrong address. And they tried to tell me that was the address I provided. I went back to my copies of the information I submitted to confirm that I sent the correct information. Southwest later admitted one of their agents made the mistake. In addition to that mistake they forget to validate the receipts. Somewhere in the middle of all that they decided to issue a check for less than half of the $5,000. We told them that we weren’t willing to accept that and they continuously told us there was nothing they could do. So now we are just just waiting for them to validate everything and re-issue the check. By this time, three months have passed since I took the trip. I got a message today (November 20th 2019) from Southwest saying that they will not be issuing a check. They have voided the check and they aren’t compensating me. Strike three!! This is so crazy to me. All we wanted to do is get to Vegas with our things and get back home. They are supposed to have services in place to help for things like this and they’re not willing to do anything for their customers. I say don’t book with them. They’re not here for their customers."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent Trip,"I flew on Southwest to attend a destination wedding in Cancun.  I have physical limitations and needed a wheelchair in the airports.  The wheelchair was readily available which doesn't always happen with other airlines.The trip went smoothly and the flight attendants were friendly, helpful and competent throughout the flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Their customer service on this flight was the worst,"I purchased a round-trip ticket with Southwest between Houston and Boston on Flight 294 on October 2, 2019.  The flight was expected to depart at 2:30pm, which subsequently changed to 2:50pm.  At 1:40pm, while I was in route to check-in I received a message stating the departure was changed to 4:50.. which was subsequently changed to an hour earlier.Given the ups and downs of all the time changes for this flight, a restless mob of passengers boarded the plane.  My wife, my daughter and I boarded in the B group as the angry mob in front and behind us pushed their way into their seats to get to Boston reasonably close to the expected time.  My 10 year-old had a separated shoulder so I was carrying her carry-on along with my own. The flight attendant in the attached picture said something but I was not sure she was talking to me or what she said.  She then made it very clear I was only allowed to bring one carry-on and she was extremely rude in the way she said it.I was quite puzzled as all three of us had paid full fare for this flight and had a preconceived notion that Southwest was friendly to customers.  In any case, I was the last one to exit the aircraft and as the pilot and customer services team was boarding the aircraft, I asked why I was not allowed to bring a carryon for myself and my daughter.  The customer service representative then said she should have carried her own carry-on or checked it in..  I was just stepping off the plane and then I stepped back to say maybe you do not know all the facts and he yelled for me to exit the aircraft.I don’t believe TripAdvisor shares true bad experiences with people so I reluctantly took the time to share this; however, within 10 minutes of arriving at my hotel @ 10:31pm I sent a note to the president of Southwest, Gary Kelly.  I was then overwhelmed by phone calls in the morning from his office to clear this off their to-do list..  I told the person who called I was on route to a meeting and passing through several tunnels where I was unable to hear him.. he did say he was sending a $50 gift certificate and “he considered this issue closed.”As I told this person, I was not in a position or place to talk and I did not consider this issue closed.  Yesterday, I visited the Texas Children’s Hospital so my daughter could see the Adolescents Sports Surgeon who is overseeing her rehabilitation, who reminded me not to let her do any overhead activity.. so, I attach a redacted letter from one of Houston most renowned medical facilitates and physicians stating she has/had a separated shoulder and will be receiving physical therapy into 2021.  I also attach a picture of the flight attendant who so rudely told me we were only allowed to put one item in the overhead, even though we paid for three tickets.  I wish I would have taken a picture of the customer service person because he should be fired from that role.I do not fly Southwest very often and after this experience I have no plans to fly with them again.  Their prices were not any lower than United, who allows us to know where we are sitting before we board the plane and gets there on time.."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Good flight, clean plane, on time.","Southwest well organized, they keep things moving along at the airport, flight was long but very few bumps, service was good, flight attendants very friendly and professional,  overall a pleasant experience."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Highly recommend Southwest!,I have never had an issue with a Southwest flight. The staff is very nice and helpful and the flights have always been on time. I highly recommend Southwest for business or pleasure.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I'll never fly anything other than Southwest Airlines,"I have been flying Southwest since I was 15 years old, we are talking 14 years now!I have had a few poor experiences with 3 different stewardess in my 14 years of travel with them but all and all, I would have to say my flights with Southwest are usually always on time, comfortable and the crew always makes you laugh! I appreciate Southwest and will never fly anything else!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always Southwest!,"Good price, great staff, well organized, on time, clean plane!  Always my first choice, never disappoints!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Pleasant and no bumps,Always on time unless there are some major storms.  I have been flying Southwest for perhaps over 20 years now and obviously I like the airline.  One of the perks is that you can change your flight at no cost which I’ve had to do on occasion.  Eat before you fly or bring a sandwich as they only serve snacks. The space is adequate for the short durations. If you need more room then try for the first row where you can spread your legs out if your very tall. Stewards come around often if you need drinks.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Airlines !!!!,"Southwest Airlines is the best airlines to fly. I love that they allow you to check in two bags with out a charge fee. I love that the still give you beverage service with out paying for it. The Flight Attendants, Check In Attendants and Pilots are always, friendly, humorous and helpful. I appreciate that they have a good record for timely departure.Southwest is my number 1 option in booking flights."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Keys Getaway,"Flight departure was on time.  Arrival on time.  No issues with flight, exactly what you expect in service."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,What a pleasure!,"Flying with Southwest was pure pleasure!  We have flown with several major airlines in the past...late flights, cancelled flights, uncaring staff.  But with Southwest we were on time, the staff was friendly and helpful.  There was a whole different attitude.  We will be flying Southwest in the future hands down!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest,"I always use Southwest Airlines when I am flying within the USA. I like Southwest Airlines because the flight staff are nice, helpful, professional, informative and provide assistance when I need it. I like that Southwest offers non-stop, round trip flights to the places I travel to and it is convenient for me. From my experience, Southwest always boards the plane on time and arrive at me destination on time. Southwest provide a small pack of delicious shortbread cookies on every flight. I always bring my own food and water on the plane. It would be nice if Southwest found a better and quicker process to board planes at the gate. Larger seats and more legs space on the plane would also be a nice feature. Every landing was smooth and perfectly. I will always fly with Southwest. Since I always take 2 pieces of luggage it is easy for me to travel and follow the carry-on policy."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flight from Honolulu to Kona,We registered for the early check-in and it was not really necessary as the flight was not really full.  We were the 5th to board (after special needs) and we were able to sit in the bulkhead.  You board outside on both ends of the trip.  They slide a ramp-up to the aircraft and you de-plane. It's a short and uneventful flight.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Recent flights Baltimore to New Orleans and return,"We flew to NOLA when the ""old"" MSY terminal was operational.  The flight was no frills but comfortable and on time.  The terminal efficiently handled our luggage and we had a nice lunch on the premises.  However, during the week we were in NOLA, the ""new"" terminal was open. While we did not have any problems or delays with PreCheck, I have read that since then the airport is suffering long, SLOW  lines.  While waiting for our flight, it was obvious the terminal was not prepared for the volume of travellers.  Some bathrooms lacked toilet paper and hand soap.  Emeril's, where we had lunch, had many food and drink items on the menu unavailable.  Our flight home was not as comfortable as the previous one.  Every seat on the plane was taken.  We got off to a little late start but arrived safely at BWI."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Favorite Airline - hands down!,"Southwest is the only airline I consider flying with when flying commercial.  From 2 bags free, free soft drinks and snacks, friendly personnel, in-flight entertainment available, generous customer of size policy, not to mention affordable flights, how can you go wrong??"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Good flight, good crew, this is why I love SW because staff saved the day!","Good flight, good crew, and skycap saved the day!Boarding: orderly boarding in normal SW sequence  Plane: Boeing 737-800 Cleanliness: average Cabin service: Good flight attendants. Lead steward had a great sense of humor. Seat comfort: above average  Misc:  The SW skycab saved my skin on this trip. I was running late and missed the deadline to check in luggage. For a $20 tip, he got my bag not the plane and saved the day."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,"Flight delay 3+ hours, dirty plane, too hot, tuned-out flight attendants","Flight delay 3+ hours, dirty plane, too hot, tuned-out flight attendants    Boarding: Cramped boarding area at Reagan. This airport is a cramped nightmare.  Plane: 737-800 Had a 3 hour delay departing which was weather related due to storms on the flight path. But pilot stated other planes were taking off and he didn't want to risk it. I hate flight #166 because it’s always crowded and the plane is generally filthy. This flight was no different. The plane was absolutely dirty.  Flight attendants were exhausted and not very good on this flight. Plane was very hot and no air was coming from the vents. Asked for some air, nothing from flight attendants. Asked for some water; nothing.  On the bright side, received a free drink!  Cleanliness of plane: filthy. Stained seats, food everywhere, dirt on carpets…."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Delayed departure but on-time arrival, dirty plane, good flight crew","Delayed departure but on-time arrival, dirty plane, good flight crew  Boarding: Orderly boarding, nothing out of the ordinary  Timeliness: delayed departure of about 30 minutes but pilot made up the time and got us there on time Plane: newer 737-800, but showing some premature signs of wear and tear. Carpeting in front my seat was coming up. Also, the plane was simply dirty- food particles and random detritus all over the seats and floor.  Flight crew: Good flight attendants. Offered second round of drinks and snacks. And a medical issue arose with one passenger. Flight crew showed genuine concern."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Completely full flight, decent service from flight attendants, good takeoff and landing","Completely full evening flight to Vegas Boarding: orderly typical boarding Plane: older 737-700 Cleanliness: average, some dirt and grime here and there. That’s life on SW.  Flight attendants: Provided decent service  Misc: fast takeoff with very little taxi time at the San Antonio airport"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great service despite hiccups,"We have always been big Southwest fans, and fly them whenever and wherever we can.Our most recent flight to Phoenix had a curious twist. Originally, it was supposed to stop in Los Angeles to pick up passengers en route to Phoenix. The morning of our departure, I got a text saying the flight had been cancelled!  We went straight to the ticket counter at San Jose (our departure point), to see what we could do.  Fortunately, the ticket agent, in typical Southwest fashion, put us at ease.What had cancelled was the connecting leg ot the flight--not the flight itself. So, we got a direct, non-stop flight to Phoenix! Some airlines would have handled this with much less ease.  Southwest proved again why they are so popular."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love this airline ,"I try to fly Southwest whenever possible. Love that when I had to change my flight, there was no additional charge."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,It was an uneventful flight without issues.,"It was an uneventful flight without any issues. No delays or problems. There was the usual events associated with economy but that isn’t really the airlines fault (people trying to jam oversized bags into overhead, people not being able to decide where to sit so they stood blocking aisle so others couldn’t board, etc). Flight attendants tried to facilitate boarding. They were pleasant.  Seats had enough knee room so I didn’t have to sit at an angle. Snacks were the usual fare. They did offer extra water during second portion of flight fir hydration. Compared to other airlines that I’ve used this made SW better than some."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Seems to be slipping,I like southwest better than other economy lines but their recent younger people they have hired are not welcoming and not friendly. They act like you are imposing on them as you fly. It’s very disappointing
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always a pleasure,We flew recently from Chicago to Orlando as we do the same time each year. Flight crew was professional and flight was nice. Never a complaint.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,No Assigned Seats,"I like enjoy flying Southwest, though its a gamble. The gamble is getting your line assignment. This matters because if you're in A group (You have to pay to get in A1 to A15) you get the best choices. If you get B25 and up expect to sit in the middle."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Non Stop Flight From D.C. to Los Angeles,"I love Southwest. I did not have to pay bag fees like I did with the American flight to my vacation. We left at 5:30pm and the flight was packed. People came prepared with neck pillows and eye shades, so they must do this often. There was a beverage service with a cookie when we departed. Most people went to sleep so it was a quiet flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Friendly service,"It was a wonderful flight to and from Albany to San Antonio, Texas.  Even though we were encumbered with a delay due to snow in Chicago, I did not miss my flight home.  Southwest was quite helpful."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good Flight,I frequently fly Southwest airlines from Kansas City to Phoenix for personal reasons.I feel safe traveling with them.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,My airline,They make an effort to take care of us...................    Everytime we travel we go on Southwest.   No matter where it is they are the best value if you can book a few weeks or a month in advance.    The are our go to airlines!!
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good flight.,"Our flight was on time and the crew was very nice, the price was good for us because we had a big group and each person got 2 checked bags, 1 carry on and 1 personal item. They also do give you complimentary drinks and snacks."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Poor Experience ,BAD flight experience tonight on flight #2154 SEA to PHX.  Attendant D.L. Ellis making up arbitrary rules w/ no ratonale.  I was carrying my pillow and sitting in EXIT ROW  as I have 43 other times this year. She insisted I store it. Referred me to Safety Card and NOWHERE did it indicate I must store a pillow. Not on the sheet or FAA website. I confronted her and she the replied I must comply with flight attendant crew instruction. A complete arbitrary response and a simple fall back.   ‪@SouthwestAir
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Rough Landing,"One of the rougher landings I've had. Surpised because the weather was fine. Felt like we had a free fall when we made contact with the ground. Other than that, everything was fine."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Uneventful,"Plane left on time. Crew were friendly and professional. Plane was jammed full, but a short flight. Arrived on time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Back to Mexico,Southwest did a great job in getting us to our vacation destination and then home again.  Sure there are some inherent bumps with any airline.  We use Southwest as often as we can.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,the best,"Always the best airline.  Just get on, fly the plane, get off - and do it all on-time at a reasonable cost.  What else do you want?"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,On time all the time,Low cost with no frills.....still a great airline and the people who work for Southwest make the difference!!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Chicago to fort Lauderdale,Leaving out of Chicago Midway airport is easy and simple. Flight check in was quick with completely issue free. Plenty of kiosks to enter information on. Lots of eatery's on the way to the airplane. plenty of seating in the lounge area. Flight time was 5;30 in the morning. Quick and easy flight.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,good flight,"On time flight, pleasant flight as well, helpful the crew, the pilot kept informing of the status of the flight,we just sat and relax...."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I would never fly with anyone else!,"We only fly with Southwest!  With the free bags, and their consistent arrivals and departures, we always chose Southwest!  We did fly with some economy airlines, and after all the charges, it was more than Southwest!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,go direct,"I love flying southwest.  The only knocks i got against them is their pay for early seating.  It seems like i get a high number but then 10 spots in front of me are open and they try selling them at gate.My other knock is some times they don’t use their beverage service .  It happened to me from nashville to pittsburgh and chicago midway to pittsburgh.The planes are comfortable, good leg room and free wifi.  All the employees are friendly .  Every time i flew southwest i was only delayed once"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,You expect on time and get it,"We always fly non stop if possible-  this flight departed at 6am. So we stayed at the airport Hyatt, a good experience.The flight left and arrived on time. As a no frills airline , we do not expect food service , but had adequate snacks. Like that bags fly free , and there are no penalties for rebooking a flight. Bags arrived quickly-  remember this is Las Vegas-  and we were on our way.  The return was equally as pleasant.   I would rather save the dollars , than get the frills of a higher priced airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,WiFi not all there the whole flight but...,"Who cares.?! You are doing 400 mph to your destination. We did have a plane change in Oakland, which was not scheduled, but it was the gate right next door. I don't think there was any real lots of flight time to Portland overall!Efficient, fun Crew aboard.Will always recommend Southwest."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight from Saint Louis to Fort Lauderdale,Great as usual. I would be nice if all air lines had larger seats but they dont so. The boarding went smooth and the flights were on time which is always great.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Wonderful flight and amazing crew,I took an early morning flight from Orlando to Houston. The flight was excellent and we arrived ahead of time. special thanks to the crew at the airport and the flight. Many thanks to the fight attendance Melavie.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always love flying SWA,"Excellent non-stop flight from BNA to LAX and back a week later.  Plenty of snacks, entertaining stewardesses ""I""m gonna tell you like my daddy told me when I turned 18, 'get your stuff and get out'!"" when we landed at LAX."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Trip to Austin TX,Southwesy is Awesome! I had a very fragile package that I was checking in and it arrived it perfect condition plus no extra charge! This saved me over $100.00 dollars in shipping fees . We got great prices for our round trip and all flights were on time and staff very friendly!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest Airlines Fan,Southwest Airlines is probably my favorite airline because of their Baggage policy (2 free).  I find that Southwest staff are always nice and courteous...and actually pretty fun.  Their flights are usually on time and include a buffer in case they get a little behind.  I was on a recent flight from New Orleans back to Baltimore/Washington Thurgood Marshall International.  Unfortunately I was flying the 1st weekend after the new New Orleans airport opened and the security lines were absolutely HORRIBLE.  I've never been so grateful for TSA Pre-Check.  A number of pilots held the flights and delayed departure because of the security debacle and a number of passengers were grateful that the planes were held.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Horrible...,I flew with Southwest and I got to the gate 20 minutes early when they said it was delayed half an hour... everyone started boarding way earlier than they had said and all the seating arrangements were everywhere ..... it literally took my family and I 15 minutes walking back and fourth throughout the plane with literally NO help from the staff other than sitting in middle seats after we had already picked seats all together. Makes no sense to have seating arrangements during purchase of the tickets if you don’t apply it when your customers come looking for their seat. Really disliked the airline. Literally so unorganized. I’m giving 1 star only because I have to..
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Excellent flight, as usual","We have flown Southwest a number of times.  The flights have always been on time and we have not encountered an difficulty.  We go to Las Vegas a couple of times each year and select Southwest for fares, flight schedules and friendly staff."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Red-eye value flight to FL, to hit the theme parks at a run...","Flew the red-eye (first flight of the day, early AM) from Houston-Hobby to Orlando, FL for a family trip to a theme park. Yes, it was the very early 5:50AM, yes with kids (13 & 10) and our senior aunt. It was however the best value for the $$, even with adding on the Early-Bird Check-In option both ways (pay for it, totally worth it!)Check in is always easy with SW, and easy to get reprints of boarding passes, use the app on your phone, etc at the gate.LOVE flying SW because they don't charge for baggage - we have flown with skis, snowboards, green chile, lots of suitcases, etc and never had any issues.Now, if only the rest of the public that flies SW would comply with the rule of no small bags/backpacks/computer bags in the overhead bins...there would be more space for carry-on bags."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Average flight,"Average flight nothing stood out either way, Everyone seemed pleasant! I like the fact we weren't charged baggage."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,ONTIME FLIGHTS - FRIENDLY STAFF - ORGANIZED,"We haven't flown in 10yrs. I was apprehensive about going through security. They were polite but not overall friendly. At the gate when our flight was getting ready to board, it was very organized. Everyone lined up with the number on their boarding pass and entered the plane orderly. The airline attendants have it very organized on taking drink orders and passing out snacks. SW has a free app to let you watch movies or TV for Free!"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,"Hat's off to Southwest""","My flight was very smooth going and returning.  And on both ocassions they were right on schedule, I loved that.  Met some of my mates onboard and we had a gorgeous time drinking, conversating and making the time passby rather quickly. Will fly Southwest anywhere they fly."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Kids Welcoming,"Great experience on this airlines from the time we booked our tickets. We took our Grand Daughter age 7 years and they treated her like a little queen. They acknowledged her while we were waiting to board with her boarding pass laminated since it was her first flight, The pilot announced once we were on the plane it was her first flight and the entire aircraft clapped for her. Then the Airline Stewart introduced himself to her, welcomed her aboard and told her anything she needed to just let him know. It was a wonderful experience for our Grand Daughter and us. We have no idea how they new it was her first flight but so glad they did."
n/a,50,Return Flight,"I have really enjoyed the flying aspects of the quality of service, management, and flight crew care.In particular our pilot on the homeward leg, went above and beyond in communicating with the passengers both prior to boarding, and then once seated.Speaks volumes, when the pilot debuses, and come off the ramp to announce that our flight may be 'bumpy ' on the way home! ""We may not be able to provide service due to flying conditions, so perhaps folks might want to grab something prior to boarding!"" Excellent! I managed to get the TSA green tick, which in theory offers a faster passage through the controlled area! Still had to remove my belt! ;-) it's always a bonus, and again, they are doing there job. Plane was well serviced and clean, especially the toilets. All in all a great flying experience between Phoenix Arizona, and Tulsa Oklahoma round trip.Note that this was my first time flying South West since all the changes came into place, and I found the self check in baggage labeling all good, and the boarding arrangements, it does pay to be online exactly the 24 hour deal to confirm, unless your status or you pay for the early confirmation. Side note, even with a late check in on my outbound journey at Sky Harbour Airport, ( I10 can be a pain! ;-) ) my luggage made the plane, and flew with me!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"o Ft. Lauderdale, FL - Ft. Lauderdale International Airport (FLL)",The flight was on time with no issues. The issues are with the air port. We went there 4 hours before our flight after getting of the cruise ship. There was no seating available anywhere. we ended up sitting on the floor till check in. After check in we were looking for a place to eat. What a joke almost impossible to find anything  the terminal. Then when we did order they were out of beer and soda. This would be my last choice to depart from.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Southwest is my ""company plane""!","I always enjoy flying Southwest.  I enjoyed it more, before all the rules & regs -- where you could stand up in the aisles, visit, have drinks, it was Fun!!  The Stewardesses still make it funny, at times though!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Southwest, the BEST Airline","Southwest very seldom disappoints, flights are generally on time and the few times they have been delayed is a result of conditions they can not control (weather, safety, etc.)"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Disabled flyer,They were very helpful as I needed to bring a portable oxygen constrictor with me. The staff on the ground and on the airplane helped me with my luggage and made sure I was ok. Ontario airport had a special line for the disabled which made the security part much easier.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Favorite Airline,"There are two factors that stand out: Free Bags and No Rebooking. Rebooking is the great wild card since you never expect to rebook. All other airlines indicate too bad and too sad. You eat the fare.All the new Basic Economy Options on other airlines are BS. Last on plane and limited to no carryon. There is a reason why so many fliers like Southwest,"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"On time, reasonable cost","As usual, both SW flights were on time even arriving a few minutes ahead of schedule.  The price to pay for a low cost, no hidden fees trips are slightly more narrow seats and leg room.  But I can deal with that.  Skip the pretzels, they tasted stale or were of low quality."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Left on Time & Landed Early!!,"We sat in a two person row at an exit.  Thought it would be more spacious but it wasn’t.  You always know what to expect from SWA - move em in, sit em down & fly em out! Wish you would get the whole can of pop instead of a small cup - wth?"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest Airlines is like a family,"Love flying Southwest Airlines, great pilots always seem to their homework to inform us of future flight weather etc. Oakland Airport is easy to load into your plane. Great a flight!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Found my bag after another ""client"" ran off with it",Shout out and hats off to Kiki at Sky Harbor's SW baggage office (aka 'the Kiki-ster').  Another passenger did a grab 'n go with my bag because it was a similar color.  I was bewildered when the carousel stopped and an employee told us that no more bags were on the flight.  Kiki quickly used our information and the abandoned bag of the other passenger to find her contact information and get a message to her. Within about 20 minutes this person u-turn'd it and came back to Sky Harbor with my bag and its contents intact.  Thank You !  A stressful situation resolved with much success.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent,Southwest is always on time and we love how you can pick your seat and do early bird too.  Plus they allow 2 luggage free and in flight drink and snacks offering additional if needed   Attendants are always nice too.   Will always use southwest if direct flights
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Never Again,"Business Class - I expected a comfortable seat at the Business Class price Southwest charges. Its an economy cramped seat, but you get a free drink, and get to board first for the extra $600."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,They lose luggage a lot,"Last time I flew SW before this flight, was to Montego Bay Jamaica several months ago and they lost my wife's luggage for three days. On this flight they lost my golf clubs on a direct flight for two days. Other than that, it's a well run airline with pretty good in-flight service and good flight attendants."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,11/09/2016,"This flight was top notch. All members of the crew were friendly, gave assistance as needed. Ground Crew on the arrival city, had multiple passengers needing assistance deplaning and we’re great."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,coming home,"We use Southwest all the time,  they have great prices if you are flexible on when you fly, that means really early or really lately or somewhere in between.  Our son and his family live in Houston so we go back and forth 3 to 4 times a year,  and also when we visit friends in Florida. The staff is always friendly and there on time schedule is really good. Plus having no baggage fees also helps because we always have something for the grandkids."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Smooth sailing from Tampa to San Diego,"I'm a nervous flyer, so to say I was worried about my first non-stop flight from Tampa to San Diego would be putting it lightly. All my worry was for naught. While there was some turbulence, it was minor and didn't even shake this nervous nelly. The flight was smooth. The attendants were courteous, friendly and helpful. Checking in and out was a breeze. Not one single problem - a great flight. (Looking forward to going back!)"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Flight attendants that are wider than the aisle between the seats don't fit well.,"Flight out was okay. Plane leaving SA was delayed because it hit a bird..this caused us to have to run across the Vegas Airport to catch our connecting flight. No offer of a cart ride..We are 60 and too old to be running across an airport. Flight attendant was wider than the aisle between the seats. Come on SW, really?"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,No issues at all!,I flew on this flight free with Southwest miles with my mother. What a great perk! Perfect flight and service. Love flying Southwest! It seems we are always on time or even early!
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Dirty Planes,"Seats uncomfortable,plane not clean ,poor internet staff unprofessional didnt feel safe on plane.************************************"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,My sw flight,I had a direct flight to Vegas and arrived promptly and on time. Service was good. I have no complaints
Date of travel: November 2019,40,top notch,Very comfortable seats with lots of legroom.Both flights were on time(round trip) and the prices were unbelievably reasonable
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"On time, friendly service",Southwest Airlines always performs well.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  Flight was on time.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Very good, as usual","How can you beat low fares, 2 free checked bags,  a good record of on time arrival and a  flight staff with a sense of humor?"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Worst Airline Ever,"Terrible service!  Rebooked without my knowledge. Original flight left hours ago while I’m still waiting for the “rebooked” flight, which is the last one out and may or may not allow to make a connection.  Staff couldn’t care less.  Terrible service all the way around.  I’ll never fly this god forsaken airline again."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Confused a bit,"I am a bit confused about the way our flight 1500 on November 13 was handled.  When I booked our flight early in this year I booked a nonstop flight from Tampa airport to Midway airport in Chicago.  Then my flight was changed to a direct flight from Tampa to Columbus then on to Midway in Chicago, which also changed the total time and the departure time.  When we landed in Columbus we were told we had to change planes to continue on to Midway in Chicago.  Our original arrival time at Midway was supposed to be 8:15, but with the changes it wasn’t until approximately 9:30, and by the time we got to our car and pulled out of the economy parking garage, it was 10:30.  Now we had to drive and hour and a half to our home in Indiana.The confusing part is how a nonstop flight turns into a direct flight and then into a plane change.  I fly Southwest for both pleasure and for business, and hopefully Southwest can be a little more proactive to inform its passengers concerning flight changes.  We did get home safely, and for that we are happy, but being on a, originally 2:30 nonstop flight, flight from 6:15 to 9:30, and then driving home, makes for a long evening into the night."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Always runs on time!,"I exclusively fly Southwest unless there is no other option.  The fares are reasonable, the service is always on time, and the staff are friendly.  I have never had a bad experience on a flight.  Excellent choice when you like to fly non-stop."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Flying Southwest (WN),"Southwest was selected as it serves AUS nonstop from MCO and the fares were reasonable. In addition, the schedule synched up well with our needs. Southwest is typically very dependable and you get what you pay for; basic transportation. Not a knock, just fact. I will say the B737 -800 we flew to AUS is roomier than the B737-700 we flew back to MCO on. I will watch for the -800 in the future. I am tall, and big, so every inch is meaningful, especially on flights that are over two hours.I like the lack of a charge for checked bags. I wish more people would check their bags and not try to bring so much on-board and then try to stuff it into the overhead. Long wait for the bags at the AUS end. Not sure what the delay was. They also had more than three flights working the same conveyor belt. This makes it very crowded around the belt and difficult to see your bag and then get it off the belt without hitting someone else. All-in-all a noneventful flight just the way you want."
Date of travel: March 2019,10,Worst Hypocrites in the Air,"Major blizzard coming and we changed our flight. Southwest announced no penalties for changing the following morning. Think they would extend the discount to us? No way and no how. The “love” airline? That is a load of marketing crap because in the end, their dollars mean more than my 30 years of exclusive loyalty. Will never use them again and haven’t!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"We flew to LaGuardia Airport in New York City for a cruise To Bermuda. Our flights going & coming were on time ,","As usual are flights were on time the employees were professional knowledgeable andFriendly. We will continue to use southwest,as a matter of fact we will fly to Tampa in feb with several other people for a Caribbean cruise."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Quick response to cancelled flight,"We flew from San Francisco to Orlando on November 10, with an expected change-over in Denver. Because of a snowstorm, however, our Denver to Orlando flight was cancelled. A Southwest representative immediately got us on a flight to Orlando via New Orleans. There were more delays due to the weather, but I was very happy with the Southwest response, as well as their delivery of our baggage to our home the next day. I love Southwest! Okay, so I'd like more leg room, But at least we don't pay for luggage, get some pretzels, and always get warm, wonderful flight attendants. We paid for early bird seating, but we got a refund on that within minutes of being rebooked."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,personal,"Southwest airlines was most part very pleasant to fly. The leg that went from Denver to Seattle-Tacoma last Thursday night was a bit uncomfotable due to some residual fuel was not clean to the left engine.  The cabin was fill with smell of aviation fuel thru the AC system.  The plane had to pull back to the gate to be checked by mechanic.  The process took almost an hour.  It seem that the flight crew did not take any efford to make the customers feel comfortable beside informed that safety is SW priority.  We all know that,however sitting in a place to wait for an hour was very unpleasant.  Hoping that SW would changing the procedure to make customer more relax and comfortable."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,SOUTHWEST FLIGHT,"Southwest does a fine job with their flights and attending to passengers. I have not gotten warm to their boarding procedures, on the other hand. To ensure you have a choice of seats you must pay a $25 fee on any route and they list you A with a number. I'm not sure how they allocate that number, but that's the process. The flight attendants are very friendly and will respond your requests within reason. My flight to Louisville consisted of two legs. While had a short delay in Boston to Baltimore, that did not impact my Baltimore to Louisville leg. We arrived about 20 minutes past the scheduled landing time, again, that did not impact my planned arrival at my hotel. While flying in Southwest's territory, I would fly again with them. Be aware of the fee for a higher boarding position. As this is the norm for flying, i.e. more leg room, this will not stop me from flying Southwest."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,"Delay, pot holes in Love Field runway?","What a mess....a 1 1/2 hour delay, because of a pothole....and then when I finally got to Houston, they asked if I wanted to check my carry on-so, I went up and said ‘sure’...but, I had already checked 2 bags, so they told me it would be $30.  I declined.  Then when it was time to board, I had purchased the ‘early bird’ for $25 more...and I was A21, and was excited to have an early boarding...but when I got to the boarding man, I was FLAGGED to NOT BOARD and to go to the desk (Customer Service) where he had somehow FLAGGED me NOT to board...because I had tried to check the bag with him 15 mins before!!! Now I LOST my place in line, he fumbled around trying to fix it, I hemed and hawed, finally he fixed his mistake, I got to the gate and now they were up to B 10....arrrg...there goes that effort!   Boarded and sat where I could fit...arrrg. Frustrating."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,SMOOTH FLYING,"Hospitable attendants and pilots as well as those at the checkin desk.  The seating is always ""cozy"" but manageable for a 2 hour flight.  Love the flexibility of changing flights, the free checked baggage and the economy of the entire experience."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Las Vegas to Chicago midway southwest,You get more than you pay for . Luggage free service on plane was awesome . Free soft drinks free snacks . Free texting free movies and tv come on southwest is killing it Hard to find these freebies now days. Conform ot of the seat ya that is the normal suck but the new plane does have more leg riff and shoulder room . So all in all 4stars
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Leaving the family,I have been home for a month taking care of my dad while he recuperated from prostate surgery. What’s the longest time I have been home since I graduated high school. I enjoyed sitting and talking to my parents each day and having dinner and catering to them as if they were my own kids. I was sad to leave because I have grown accustomed to seeing them every day. The weatherhead got down to single digits and I was freezing my butt off so I came back home to Washington DC. Flight was OK it was just a little late and I was tired but even with flight delays I get home at a decent hour which is 1 AM. And I am happy to be back. I miss my pairs though. 😘
n/a,50,Customer service ,Flight attendents went more than above and beyond to keep my brother as comfortable as possible when he had exteme motion sickness. I was blown away by this service. Felt like he was a child being cared for be his mother. Phenomenal service.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Early bird check in,"Southwest does a great job, however, even though we bought our tickets about 2 months in advance our seating position was #56-57.  Looks like paying extra for Early Bird Checkin is being outed by another program you can buy at the gate for an even higher rate.  Return flight had a delay, but when you fly late in the day, well , it happens.  We shipped wine home as part of our luggage and all was good."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Mexico flight,"There's a little confusion at the Southwest lining up procedure at this airport as there's very limited space and passengers just bunch up in a semi-unorganized fashion. Gate attendant checking for boarding passes was pretty short in patience and attitude. Also, we took off a few minutes early and landed 25 minutes early only to sit on tarmac in Houston waiting for a gate. That was a little frustrating! Flight itself was fine."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Fantastic Travel Experience,We boarded our flight in Panama City which left on time. Short layover in Nashville that provided time to grab breakfast. Flight from Nashville to New York was smooth and right on time.......Flight crew was professional and attended to all our request. I have been flying SWA since 1994 and have never had a bad experience.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I love this airline.,Southwest is friendly and efficient and you never have to wonder what you’re going to get. I’m a senior so I was in the first boarding group and the wanna get a wage fare was more than reasonable. I fly with them whenever I can.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Economy with Service,I have traveled on Southwest in the past and have always been pleased with the service rendered. The process from ticket purchase to check in to boarding seem to flow without problems. My outbound and returning flights were not filled to capacity and so gave an opportunity to spread out. The cabin personnel were welcoming and in the short trip made all as comfortable as possible. They normally beat other airlines when it comes to price and service. Southwest will be my first choice when looking for flights.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,not 100% satisfied!,"The crew on the airplane were very nice and friendly but the people working at the front desk of Southwest Airlines Were very rude, not helpful at all! Once inside the plane everyone was very nice, I travel a lot but but mostly on another airline and I was not impressed this time around."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Comfortable, classy and affordable","My flight was comfortable and on time. The plane was clean, new, neat; and the airline personnel was friendly and welcoming. We arrived safely and I had full confidence in them."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Safe, Enjoyable and On-Time Airlines","My wife and I have flown Southwest many times in the past 7 or 8 years.  We have yet to be disappointed.  It has always been on-time, safe, staff courteous and very affordable.  We have also qualified for their Companion flight, which means one of us flys FREE!!  Their baggage fees are also the best.....FREE!!  We are always happy with their servide."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Dallas to Las Vegas - September 2019,"My last flight to Las Vegas was just the way I like it....on time and no surprises! As a matter of fact, our return flight from Las Vegas to Dallas, arrived 20 minutes early. Southwest is the best!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,"Took a quick trip to Ft Myers Florida on Southwest Airlines and, as always, the flight was on time and the attendants were great.    I always fly Southwest unless they do not service the area.  Side note:  Indianapolis and Fort Myers airports are so easy to find your way around, clean and the baggage is quick to arrive."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"We had to wait while they fixed some arm rests but, it’s always easy flying with southwest:)","Great as always and you get two bags. The only thing I wish is that all of the plans have USB chargers and that the snacks were better. I feel like there used to be more variety. The Ritz cheese crackers and the pretzels are terrible. I don’t know who decided on that snack. I feel like you can always win with potato chips or those maple cookies. Lol I like peanuts too but, almonds or cashews would be awesome! If it’s allowed."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,On time and great experience,Flying is no longer enjoyable.  The best you can expect is a good price and on time.  Southwest gives that.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Florida to Michigan & Return,"2 Checked bags fly free, why would you ever carry on???  Okay, you do not want to what for your bags at your destination...  but you get to decompress and relax before going again...  take the time...  boarding is so much less hectic if you do not have bags carry on..."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best airline ever,"Southwest Airlines can’t be beat compared to other airlines. Having tried different airlines over the years nothing comes close to the service Southwest offers to their customers. There are no tacked on fees for baggage, seating, and my experience is they are always on time. The staff is superb to other airlines, fast, efficient and friendly. I have yet to encounter in years of flying anything but exceptional service. They rate number 1 for me when choosing an airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Despite weather problems, cheerful customer service","Winter weather in the Midwest was causing delays and cancellations all over the country. Passengers were understandably anxious.  I had a connection I wasn’t sure to make in Nashville, which meant I wouldn’t have gotten home to RDU until the next day.  I double checked flights the following day and looked up hotels near the Nashville airport and stayed calm.  I overheard many conversations between concerned passengers and customer service team members which kept the atmosphere on a much calmer level.  I’d like to express my appreciation to those team members who smiled through the tough times!"
n/a,50,Good round trip flight ,"Flew from phoenix to Charleston. No direct flight so we had to change planes both directions. Flights were good, they were on time and we received all of our luggage.   No complaints with southwest airlines.  I will fly them again"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I adore SW,"I love SW! every flight on time, with professional, kind, and humane flight attendants! often, easy to check in... but we were in a little weird room to line up in Corpus! but all in all, I""m a fan!"

Date of travel: November 2019,10,SW Airline app is ridiculously confusing ,"Spent over 2 hours trying to figure out how to access my boarding pass on my phone! RIDICULOUS!They state that it’s “easy”, but forgive me for giving up after never figuring it out.Had to call SW Airline help number only to be left on hold for yet another 15 minutes or so. Spent 29.5 minutes talking to a lady that was very curt, certainly not understanding, only to be even more confused!If SW Airlines are trying to piss off their customers, they have succeeded beyond description!!!WAKE UP!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Follow-up to my “Smelly” Southwest experience,"To date, not even the common courtesy of a response from the airline about the “smelly” experience.  Took four days for the headache to subside."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Be careful about fees,Airline raised fee for early boarding for no good reason other than greed.  Still no baggage fees for at least one bag that is not over weight but this is off set by early boarding fee doubling.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Bwi to Cancun,Southwest doesn’t disappoint and remains my airline of choice. Flight was on time and smooth. Wasn’t able to get an A or B boarding priority but I still had an uneventful flight. Stewardesses were nice and friendly as usual.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,BLOWS ME AWAY,"You cant find possibly find better prices than SouthWest!!! Not only do they give you not one but two free check in bags but also one full carry on and one personal bag !!! The customer dervice cant be beat by any airline, in addition to the above, I needed to change the date of the flight for unforseen circumstances, no penalties !! Huh...none, other airlines you need to buy insurance and still may be a small penalty otherwise, no insurance you lost your ticket !!!! and thats not all, the price was cheaper than the cheapest I can find due to all the baggage !!!! It came out less and finally the Customer service cant be beat, they symphasized with me on my reason of changing  and made any day flight for just a few dollars more, I am sure the flight has eveb nore entertainment than the rest as well... Of these reasons makes me not want to fly any other airline in the future. Their customer service just canr be beat !"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Terrible customer service associated with an SWA delay,"SW a delayed our flight. When I tried to talk to customer service and request it changing my flight to accommodate an appointment, I was told to go standby at the gate. When I got to the gate I waited in line for 20 minutes only to be told the customer service was wrong and it changed my flight was not possible. Estaview Waze customer service was terrible, gave me bad information and was unapologetic and unhelpful related to my attempts To offset their delay."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flying Southwest Airlines,Southwest Airlines is the best airline in the U.S. Every time we fly this airline we are impressed by their commitment to an on time schedule. They value our time as much as we do! Ticket prices are a good value and they offer special rates frequently. Love the crews that share a sense of humor. Just wish the seat and leg room was a little more generous! Keep up the good work’
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Cancelled flight AGAIN!,"Yesterday, we were scheduled to leave Orlando airport at 10:20 am.  They texted us at 5:13 AM to tell us of the cancellation and informed us we would have to rebook our own flight.  I was not aware of the communication until 7am while on our way to the airport.  I immediately went online and the Denver direct flight was already sold out.  The next one listed on their website was leaving at 11:30 (ha ha, that had a delayed departure of about 45 minutes) via Philadelphia!  So, I asked at check in if we would be qualified for a LUV voucher as this would cost us extra in meals and parking. They did grant us that which can only be used for another flight, which I am a bit hesitant about. This is the second time this airline has done this to us and causes much difficulty for us.  The also would not book us on another airline, who may have had open seats, because the don’t do that service.Air travel in general is getting very hard anymore.  Customer service is nearly extinct, planes could be cleaner, prices for extras are out of sight;  it’s just no fun anymore."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Changing flights last minute without notice,"Deliberately chose a more expensive nonstop flight out of an airport that was farther away. 1. Southwest changed my flight last minute, forcing me to fly 3 extra hours with a flight that had a stop for myself and 2 other family members 2. Upon calling ""customer relations"", gave me some key buzz words like ""flight was changed due to federal regulations"", ""nothing we can do about this"", etc. Why have a customer relations department when there is no effort to maintain a relationship? 3. terrible, terrible, terrible service. Would give 0 stars if I could."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good,"The flight and boarding were great but the TSA staff were not.  They delayed my check in, I lost my bracelet because the machine signaled.  The agent knew it was only my bracelet and had to me to remove it.  She could've taken the wand and scanned me instead of having me to remove my bracelet to walk back through the scanner again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I only fly Southwest,"I love Southwest, the customer service is outstanding from start to end.  I received a noticed my upcoming flight was modified to unfavorable times compared to my original flight.  I went online and found even better times the same days of my original flights.  I called Southwest to ask if there was a possibility in getting my flight changed.  The answer was yes and for no charge.  Thank you for your outstanding service and policies, no other airline company treats their customers this good."
Date of travel: February 2019,10,Southwest steals your travel funds money,"I am very unhappy with Southwest's travel funds policy. Recently, they changed their policy so that points don't expire--but travel funds do. That's like stealing my money. I had to cancel a trip early this year due to medical reasons and now I can't use my travel funds to pay for a trip next year. They will let me extend my travel funds for six months--for $100, on the day they expire. That's crazy, too. Who can keep track of all this. Money is money--it doesn't ""expire""--Southwest, you are on notice! CHANGE THIS POLICY!"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Early Bird Fee,"I really have a couple of axes to grind with SWA.  First the forward lav was nasty.  The trash bin was overflowing and on our return flight it was even worse.  The seat on the toilet would not stay up while we males were urinating.  This may seem nasty to some people but I can only say you should have been there.  No wonder so much paper was generated.  Probably from attempts to clean the seat.  I know SWA does fast turns but take enough time to clean it please.Second complaint is against there misleading ads.  Yes they don't charge for bags.  I don't pay for them on AA either because I do the credit card deal.  Here is your hidden fee.  My complaint is against the ""Early Bird"" fee.  This is something you have to pay in order to be among the first 60 to board and the farther you are down the list the less it is worth.  If you want to be assured that you will sit with your traveling companion or sit near the front of the bus or be assured of bin space then you have to pay an extra $25 per person per leg.  Note that some people manipulate this by having one person pay the fee and then save a seat for their companion.  We were 29 and 30 outbound and 30 and 31 return.  When we were boarding the plane we were told by some people that they were saving a seat.  Gimmick your fees and people will work to get around them.I made a reference to the ""Bus"" earlier.  I have not been on SWA for some time.  We did it this time because their Saturday morning run from DAL to Fort Lauderdale  supports cruise departures and AA does not have a similar flight.  SWA is really like riding Greyhound including lining up to get onboard.Just remember to add $25 to every quoted fare.The Flight Attendants are still nice at least."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,LUGGAGE IS FREE,"My husband and I always try to arrive early to get through security and to our gate without a lot of stress. We had a 6:55am flight. Because of a health problem, we had requested handicapped boarding for the first time and that went very well at the check-in. We were flying out of Austin the Tuesday after an Austin City Limits week-end, so the airport was EXTREMELY busy and for the first time in Austin we experienced drug dogs at the check point, which made the check point very slow! (We have flown through Panama and had to walk by drug dogs before, but never in the US.)The plane wasn’t full, so when we boarded we were able to get an aisle and window seat with an open middle seat, which was great!The flight attendants were very pleasant and we were served very quickly and asked several times afterward if we wanted anything!Don’t forget that each passenger is allowed two checked suitcases FREE!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Don't Know if I Can Continue my Alligence to Southwest,"While I'm not a frequent flyer (I fly only once or twice yearly), I have enjoyed flying on Southwest for quite a few years.  I'm now 61 years of age, over 6 feet tall, 220 pounds, and in decent shape, but with a few aches and pains that come to the forefront when placed in uncomfortable positions for an extended length of time.  My trip from Florida to Chicago this past week was my most uncomfortable and painful experience since the 1980's when I squeezed into my seat (sized for someone less than 6 feet tall) on a European aircraft while in the U. S. military.  This was my first time aboard Southwest flights with the new seats that angle slightly downward toward  the front. These new seats are totally aweful, uncomfortable, and painful.  They put unbearable pressure on my tailbone.  The only saving grace is that I had to change planes both going and coming and all the flight segments were no longer than approximately 2 hours (give or take), including being seated and delayed at the gates.  I'm seriously thinking of using up all my rapid reward points and using another carrier going forward.  I sure hope they don't have the same seats on the Max 8 aircraft."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,great service,I was so touched by the attendant helping me put my bag in the overhead bin. The flight was on time and I have no complaints.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Exciting crew that made the trip fun!,"The crew were so personable and accommodating. They spent time with the passengers, serving and talking to them."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest customer service does it again. Phenomenal Customer Service!,"We flew from Vegas to San Francisco today and unfortunately I was struck down with food poisoning. It’s horrible to be sick while flying, but Debra the flight attendant was our hero. She made an impossible situation so much better. She made sure I was taken care from the beginning of the trip to even after the flight was over. Thanks Debra, we can not thank you enough! The male steward also helped us by getting our bags down. Can not say enough nice things about Southwest’s flight attendants."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,ABQ Gate Agent to the Rescue,"This is more of a review of the help I received from 3 gate agents while waiting for my flight. There is a little back-story so please read it all...Having booked my November flight back in July I booked a direct flight from ABQ to KC and then had to do a ""one stop - change planes"" to get back home. No biggie, have had to do that before. In late August I received an email declaring my itinerary had been changed and that my new return flight was going to have ""two stops - no plane change"" and that my total time in the air would be a little over 9 hours. They told me that I could attempt to make a change within about 36 hours or so but the timing was such that I didn't have time to sit on the phone and wait for the next available customer service rep to help me make the change. On my departure date I was in the ABQ airport awaiting my flight to KC, with time to kill I wanted to double check that my early-bird carried over to the new itinerary they sent me in August. While they were checking on that, Nezbah, Sheila and Steven (it was a team effort) were curious as to why I chose a flight that had two stops. I told them the story above and Nezbah told me to hang on a moment and began tapping some things on the keyboard. After a few minutes she found a direct flight from KC to ABQ, it left later in the day than my original and amended flights but I would arrive home a full 5 hours earlier than I would have if I would have kept the same flight. Needless to say I was very glad to be able to change that flight. They truly helped me to be a happy traveler!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Hawaiian Island Hopping!,"Unfortunately had to ""Hop"" stateside as well with two stops between San Antonio and Maui direct out of San Jose, CA. Got into Maui too late to make connection to the Big Island and had to spend the night one night on Maui and continue on the next day! Problem having to route through Honolulu on both legs of spending a week in both Kona and Maui (ie. Maui-Honolulu-Kona & Kona-Honolulu-Maui). We  were required to de-plane and walk considerable distance and wait in the terminal only to board the same plane in one instance. I understand that this may be corrected soon, with direct flights from additional West Coast locations.Love the free Wi-Fi and access to 46 movies and numerous TV shows in flight. The flight crews and attendants were genuinely pleasant and interactive; not ""burned out"" and just punching a time clock so to speak. The 1st landing in Honolulu was the smoothest landing I've ever experienced and was completely unaware of our having touched down until the pilot reversed the engines and applied the brakes. As a former military pilot, I have high expectations on a pilot's abilities when he flies commercially for a living! The Hawaii crews well represented Southwest Airlines and Southwest will be my 1st choice in Airlines when flying anywhere."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Free baggage,Self Check In was great. Printing own Boarding Pass was simple.Boarding plane went smoothly.Offered free soft drinks and coffee during flight.
n/a,30,Just a Snag,"We love Southwest Airlines and fly with them frequently. This time we had a snag because the Boarding Pass didn't show TSA pre check, even though I had entered the information on the website. Had to visit a Southwest Airlines agent to get them to correct the information and print a new boarding pass. Once I got through that process, everything else was easy and smooth. The flight attendants were friendly and the flight itself was fine. Just remember to ensure that the airlines website has precheck info loaded correctly and check your boarding pass."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,It's the usual girpe that they seem to have made the spaces smaller (while in actuality I have gotten bigger)...,"All flights seem full these days, but being routinely placed on standby sparks my O'Hare PTSD from the USAF, when I ended up spending almost two days wandering around that airport, snowbound. What's with the ""stand by"" status when I bought my ticket a week before travel and checked in the day before? I just do not understand.."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,They just do things right..... with the exception of their cattle boarding !,"Southwest is consistent across the board. Pricing is fair, equipment in top notch shape, flight crew for the most part very professional. My only negative to flying with SW is not getting a seat assignment. And having to either pay more to get a good boarding position or be at the computer to check in 24 hours and hope you get a decent boarding position. When possible, we prefer to fly Jet Blue as they check all the boxes for a positive air travel provider."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Cattle Car Carrier/No Benefit With Upgrade,"My husband talked me into giving Southwest Airlines another try when visiting a friend in KC, MO, from Sacramento.  It had been a decade since my last flight, and the price was most affordable.  Flying is a thrill and a luxury for me, not like taking a subway, and when I fly I like to have a window seat with a clear view.  For me it's half the fun to see our beautiful country from up high.  I also expect the basics, a clean vessel and safe flight.  First of all, there is absolutely NO REASON to pay the extra $20 for whatever improved seating you are hoping to find with the stadium style seating mode.  It guarantees NOTHING!!!   On this recent series of four flights, my four boarding positions were always A06-07 which should have ensure the seats I wanted.  Without sounding insensitive, about thirty passengers would get on first who had special needs and sat in the choicest seats without the upgrade cost I paid which left me over the wing or in the cheap seats.   The pre-board lining up at the numbered poles based on boarding number on ticket is akin to going to the greyhound station or returning from elementary school recess and no one really abides by the number given, a travel free-for-all.  The cabin felt like it was never tidied up between boarding, magazines awry, seat belts disshuffled, not a hint of disinfectant in the air.  Worrisome with the chorus of coughing heard and knowing that air was recirculating to a your nose.In all fairness, the attendants were always pleasant and accommodating.  The pilots are exceptional and drive the 737 like a sports car, very smoothly, and I am very confident with their skill.  The fare is competitive.Between the cattle car boarding, no guarantee of the seat I expect and at a higher cost, and the possibility of the killer 737 MAX being reinstated, I think I'll pay a little more with another carrier and have a set seat and civility."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,SOUTHWEST SUCKS,"Not only are there flights always delayed, but they must have animals loading and unloading the luggage. Previously, I had a brand new suitecase which was ripped at the pockets, ripped inside, zipper handle missing, etc. and extremely dirty like someone had mopped the floor with it. Since I still had the receipt for the luggage, I took pictures and filed a complaint. I gave them hell and was refunded the price of the luggage.  On this trip to LAX on 11/1/19, not only did my luggage not make it to my connecting flight (I had to wait almost 4 hrs. for the next flight to bring my luggage) but when my, again, new luggage (now not material but hard cover) arrived, it was all scratched and had a huge dent in one of the corners!!  The customer service agents for Southwest were less than sympathetic and, actually, the one that was ,supposedly, helping me had a nasty attitude as if I had done something wrong!! The thing is that Southwest will issue ""Luv vouchers"" to try and compensate you for whatever but that means you have to fly with them, AGAIN, in order to redeem vouchers...damn if you do, damn if you don't!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Annual Visit,My annual Las Vegas Bikefest trip was scheduled for October 2-6 and I booked SWA.I book SWA because of their great customer service and reasonable fares.  Their Rapid Rewards program is one of the best.  SWA seems to keep very close to their on time schedule and if they are late in leaving seem to make up the time in the air.The folks at SWA are very friendly and helpful.  They will continue to be my go to airline.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always Southwest,"15+ years of flying Southwest, some years 50 weeks flying out Monday and returning Thursday. The best airline there is, only time I don't book is if my destination is not available. I love the change flight options, often for work we have last minute changes to arrival or departure dates, never been an issue. All of the staff, from ticket counter to gate agent to flight attendants to pilots, such a friendly airline"
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Not good for couples or families,"Just writing as advice for others regarding the southwest policy for boarding.  If you are flying solo then the boarding process seems ok and fair.  But, if you are traveling with children over 6 or as a couple, the order of boarding is a major consideration.  They board in assigned order - A 1 to 60 then B 1 to 60 then C.   So if you are say B 40 and 41 then you are the 100 and 101th person to board (not counting other special groups boarding ahead of you).   If you are down in the list of priority do not expect to sit together.   This is awful if traveling with children (or friends or family) over 6 years old.  Only option is to pay extra to board earlier.  For us this was $40 each.   So for me it would cost $80 to sit with my son (for every leg of our multi stop round trip) or have us randomly separated into middle seats and have him sit between strangers.  Not a great position to be in just before boarding and definitely an unfair penalty & unfair choice for families traveling.     If you are traveling with others who you would like to sit with, just understand this and plan to pay additional or find a different airline."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Lauderdale to Cancun,"Southwest offers great round trips from Lauderdale to Cancun. 1 hour 15 minutes, just enough time to settle in, grab a beverage and start your vacation. Service is always great and usually quite entertaining"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Another great experience,"My wife and I continue to enjoy our experiences with SWA.  Their people are great, willing to help and when asked for help, they are not reluctant to assist.  Their planes are clean, their customer service is 100 and overall, we have little and zero issues with this airline from time of booking to getting our luggage at destination."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest does it right with great value,"My husband and I are not small and we suffer mobility issues. We do buy three seats as ot not bother others and to be as comfortable as possible. I can buy an extra seat in my name online. They refund that extra seat once you've flown. they permit two full checked bags for free. The attendants are always courteous and often display great sense of humor. Planes were clean. We have to have wheelchair assistance and they are great about being there on time when checking in, transferring, etc. They have free inflight entertainment and for additional fee, internet service."
n/a,50,Non-stop CLE to ATL,"Was lucky to catch a $99 each way, non stop, flight that Southwest had on sale.The flight each way was on time.  Check-in was flawless, no issue with my checked bags, and Southwest employees excell at positive customer interaction.Southwest is my airline of choice, especially considering their two bags fly free policy."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Worst service ever,Due to small snow front that arrived in Pittsburgh our flight was held up over 45 min to de ice the plane. Our connecting flight in Atlanta to Austin pulled out missing over 10 southwest customers from our flight and their agents could give two craps. You would think the airline would notify connections especially if they are within 5 gates of the other to look out for their customers. How is this airline ranked so high? Their customer service and care is horrible. This is our 1st and last ever flight with this airline. Worst airline EVER!
Date of travel: November 2019,40,weekend to Baltimore,good flight. on time both ways. I like the bags fly free deal. it seems other airlines overcharge for bags. Seating is tight.
Date of travel: March 2019,20,Cattle Ride,"Lets talk about ""No Frills"" This Airline should  be in the dictionary under that heading.  They were Late, smallest seats ever, stale old small bag of pretzels and  buy your drink. Going to salt lake use Delta, For 20 or so bucks more  world of difference. See my Delta review."

Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent customer service,"Due to snowfall and train rescheduling in downtown Chicago, I was going to miss my flight. I called Southwest, and the customer service representative I spoke to was very patient, reassuring and efficient. She found me a later flight and made sure I understood everything we’d discussed. She helped to turn a stressful situation into one that was completely manageable and easy."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Vacation to California for a wedding,"I bought 3 tickets at one of their speical offerings for this flight to LAX back in July.  It was only $132.50 a piece for one way.  This was a great price.  We did get into LAX at 1030 PM at night, but the service was good.  Our flight was delayed twice.  We left Louisville an hour late and got into Phoeniix and learned we would be another hour delayed getting out of Phoenix. Southwest always informed us if the flight was going to be delayed. The flight was smooth even though there was no service by the flight attendents on this 58 minute flight into LAX. The flight was full.  I needed a w/c and the crew in Lousiville did not let me board first as usual. They did not keep me in a w/c due to needing them at the airport. I was able to board early as I had paid the $25.00 for an early bird seat.- A 32. I did find a good asile seat.  There was a w/c waiting for me in Phoenix and the attendant was very nice. Over all I will fly Southwest again. I like their special rates they offer frequently."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,"Claimed to be ""No Plane Change""!  Guess what?  Read This! (Great FA, though)","11/5 WN 1465 SJC-DEN-IAD Grade: F-/A+ The SJC-DEN part was OK.  However, the notation on my itinerary provided by WN of “Stop: Denver no plane change” was Bull---t at best and an outright lie at worst as it wasn’t announced until after we’d been at the gate in DEN for a while before the FA’s notified the dozen or so of us IAD-bound passengers that we’d need to deplane and go to gate C41 as that was where the plane going to IAD was boarding!  So, we had to hike a considerable distance (especially for this senior citizen with some mobility problems) to the new gate.  However, to the credit of WN, those of on the inbound flight were allowed to board after those needed pre-boarding, but before those already lined-up for the flight.  However, I had to find that out from a fellow passenger, and not from any WN announcement.  Unacceptable.  Yes, there were already passengers lined-up for this different aircraft.  So, this didn’t look like a last-minute change.  Or, was it?  If you’re going to have a change of planes, be honest about it!  If it’s planned in advance, say so at the beginning!  If it’s a last-minute change, tell all your passengers ASAP!  And, not at the last minute!  There was no mention of this change when I checked my phone before leaving for the LAS airport.  And, there was also no apology for the change of planes made to us inbound passengers.  Also, this new flight was 21 minutes late in pushback from the gate at DEN (At least it wasn’t 9F degrees and snowing this time!), making us late into IAD.  The A+ on this evaluation is for the DEN-IAD cabin crew.  While both of the forward FA’s were the cheerful and friendly usually expected on WN, one of them had to “protect/defend” the area of the forward lav/cockpit door while the captain was in that area (restroom break) and a possibly inebriated passenger (He was swaying quite a bit!) made his way towards the area while one FA was blocking his path.  He (much larger male) kept approaching and she had to get quite demonstrative that she was prepared to “deal” with him if he continued his approach. At about row three (I was in 5C), he finally got the message and turned around.  In the 45 years since my first commercial flight (9/17/65 IAD-LHR on a TWA B707-331), this was the first time I’d seen an FA have to do what they’re supposed to do in the first place: Ensure the safety of the passengers!  When I complemented her later on what I’d observed, she initially brushed it off as if it happened every day.  If that’s the case, I pity the FA’s for a task more thankless than I’d previously thought.  I’m contacting WN about her performance."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Southwest to Cancun,We fly using out SW Companion pass and were not disappointed. It was as easy as it always is and uneventful. The in in flight WiFi and movies was a definite plus.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest is the best,"Our flight from Orlando to Chicago Midway on November 2, 2019 was on time and without problems. The biggest problem was the cold weather we flew into in Chicago. The boarding process was quick and efficient. So tips that are useful. Buy your tickets the day they go on sale. The information can be found on the Southwest web site. Pay the extra $25.00 for early bird check in and you will be in the early boarding A group. If you don't want to pay the extra money you need to check in exactly 24 hours prior to the time of your reservation. That way you may get in the late A grouping but you will be in the early B grouping. We always use Southwest. Can even go to Cancun, Mexico on Southwest. You can download your boarding to you smart phone"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,SOUTHWEST AIR,SOUTHWEST AIRLINES often goes out of they way to make your trip better.... PERSAY people with kids on my flight got extra pretzel bags to keep kids happy& the adults were kept happy on HALLOWEEN because the airlines gave us our first drink for free for flying with them on a holiday. Some of the SOUTHWEST AIRLINES employees were all festively dressed at their airport concourse ramps.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Met Expectations,SouthWest Airlines met expectations.  The free for all to seating (all flights were at capacity or nearly so) is a bit stressful. My wife and I got seperated on one flight.  We understand this.  IF SouthWest had a direct flight from Hartford to Las Vegas it would sweeten the deal.... They used to offer this. We paid an awful lot of money even though we had economy tickets to be treated like cattle.

Date of travel: November 2019,30,Still love Southwest,"Normally I would always give Southwest 5 stars. This time it's only 3 because of one of the flight attendants. Lorri just had a I don't want to be here attitude, which almost never happens on Southwest. My wife and I were seated in the emergency exit row. We flew on November 9th. The door was still opened and my wife was on the phone with my daughter. She asked my wife for her attention and my wife told my daughter she'll call her when we land and hung up. Then she said to her with a attitude in her voice, ""are you done"". I said to her ""excuse me"" and got a nasty look. Later when she was walking by with an hour left to the flight, I asked for a glass of water that I never got. But on my connecting flight to Manchester (4661), there was Stephanie who was beyond excellent."

The flight attendants were very cordial and helpful and their service was great.As usual, no charge for luggage and we each checked two bags, our suit cases and our normal carry on luggage cases.  It was so easy to get to the luggage bays and pick up our checked bags in a very timely manner.  Southwest is so efficient and moderately priced that you shouldn't pass out checking them out the next time that you fly."

You should give them a pay rise.

Date of travel: November 2019,30,Needs personal attention to attire,I have flown for year and have never seen the host and hostess look so terrible.  The Stewart’s hair was dirty and unkept.  He was older and had a haircut like a young man.  His clothing was crumpled.   Teeth were dirty looking and very unfriendly towards the customers.  One of the hostess had her hair piled in top of her head and between scratching her head and her nose it almost made a person sick.  She also was to busy flirting with the businessmen to worry about the rest of the customers.  This airline needs to look at some of the other airlines for examples    I was shocked at the overall picture of Southwest.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Joke boarding process,"Southwest’s boarding process relies on humans behaving decently to each other. In reality what happens is some stupidly candid attempts at edge hogging and seat reserving, while the crew turns a blind eye to avoid confrontation (can’t blame them). Honestly, I’ve flown southwest for business, and made the terrible mistake of doing it for leisure this one time with my wife. Either you get the early check in for extra money, or get ready to get into a staring contest with some random seat hogging lady that has taken an entire row with her bags."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Early Artival,"I liked being able to get on the plane, get seated, and take off without issues.  Our flight was easy, the crew did their jobs, and the pilots didn’t continue to interrupt us with announcements. We arrived ten minutes early."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"On time, friendly","When going from pvd to mco Southwest is our choice basically because it's the most convenient and the cheapest. Always been on time, friendly people, quick and easy check in. If we're going on a long flight then maybe we'd go to Boston where those flights are cheaper but it's more hassle and expense to park etc."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,great easy flight,southwest is always on time and flights can be full but it is always a good price. boarding is always fast and crew is always happy and willing to help. love that 2 plus bags can go for free
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Austin Trip,"Enjoy flying with Southwest for a few reasons, prices are good, no charge for check in bags and  the employees are friendly which makes it a quick fun trip."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always a pleasure,"It's always a pleasure to fly Southwest, even with the economy seating.  The flight to Seattle was especially fun because of the humorous flight attendant!  Good job, Southwest!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,On time service,"Excellent flight timing, departure and arrival. Friendly crew members. Ample legroom.And exceptional cabin overall environment and very organized boarding and exit. Good prices."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,A quick hop to KC,"As far as airline seats go, these were relatively comfortable.  With Southwest's system of not assigning seats, I was able to get a window seat for each of the four legs.Service was friendly and efficient.  Flights were on-time."
n/a,40,Southwest is Best,Always enjoyable to fly on points and get into A boarding. Snacks and beverage was complimentary as was the SW internet. Saw a movie as well as live tv. Also live texted while in air using whatts app for free....what more could you ask for? Left on time and landed early!
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Love Southwest except for seating procedure,"I always choose Southwest because the price you see is it. No games. Includes bags and changes if necessary. However, they do not assign seats. You can pay $15+ to get some priority but don't waste your money. I have paid it and not paid it and always get the same number B30s. Once when I did pay, I got in C! Also, you have to check in exactly 24 hours before your flight to get a decent B. Some passengers don't even check in because they have a business traveler in A saving seats. Yes, they save seats. Maybe it is just me, but I would rather know where I am going to sit in advance."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Nonstop flight. Great flight crew. Great service.,Appreciated the service and thankful other passengers were well mannered and no fuss during the flight. Weather was sketchy so we had some bumps but our pilot kepteveryone informed. Overall a very positive experience.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Friendliest flight crew EVER!,"I will be flying Southwest whenever possible from here on out!  It was such a pleasant experience - amazing crew, timely service - we even arrived a few minutes early.  They made the flight as personal and comfortable as possible."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Bday celebration,The Southwest flight attendant were THE GREATEST like every other flight I’ve been on. I’m always eager to board Southwest Airlines because I know the service is on point and really gooooood
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy SEA Flight To Las Vegas,"Flew from SJC to LAS for the weekend. Flight out of SJC was at the last terminal, so a bit out of the way. flight was delayed coming in, but We left close to on time."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight,Flight was on time for departure and we had a smooth ride always fly Southwest great customer service and always on time will continue to be a loyal customer.  We love flying out of Indianapolis International Airport
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest is a great flight,Great flight attendants! They make the pre-flight safety talk interesting and informative.  Excellent service. Love the 2 free checked bags!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Amazing customer service experience,The service provided by flight attendant Ester on my 2nd flight alone is my favorite part of my trip. She truly provided quality customer service and it’s something you don’t get often. Her hospitality and positive attitude is definitely the reason I would choose Southwest.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Smooth Sailing and Calm Cabins,"Southwest Airlines is my default airline of choice ! I love this airline. They are good to me and get me where I want to go when I want to go. Every time I can, I write oneThank You note to the entire crew from the Captain, to the First Officer, and the Flight Attendants. I hand this note to the Flight Attendant when I enter. I don't do this for attention or to ""get"" something. I do it to acknowledge their contribution and appreciate what they do. That being said about a third of the time they will thank me for doing that and be extra gracious during the flight. This particular flight was no different. Since this flight was a day before Halloween one flight attendant brought me a bag of Trick or Treat candy. Way to go SOUTHWEST ! I wish I had gotten her name but, oops, I did not. We were early on landing and everything went without a hitch. One day I hope I can fly somewhere and then turn right around and fly back. That is how much I really love this airline. And if you know SOUTHWEST you know love is  a part of their corporate culture. So please if you can make this airline your default airline. Tell them Ron sent you and if they ask who that is tell them."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Pleasantly Surprised,"10/29 WN 1163 IAD-DEN Grade: A+  Several of the cabin crew were wearing some form of Halloween costumes with their uniform.  They seemed cheerful and enjoyed their work.  The security check at IAD reminded me of going through customs and immigration into and out of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and Hungarian Peoples Republic back in 1980.  Having the palms of my hands swabbed with an unknown chemical which the TSA agent wouldn’t identify has me wondering if I’ve been exposed to a potential HAZMAT.  And, I got a “pat down”.  Finally, if you have an early flight out of IAD, be prepared with your own food as there is very little open early in the AM in terminal C."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Very disappointed,"Well I always use Southwest Airlines. This time they list my luggage in L. A. I waited 5 hours for the luggage crew in LA to put my bag on another plane to Chicago. Since there is a 3 hour time difference I was absolutely exhausted. The customer service desk in Chicago/midway was great and offered a flight voucher for my trouble, and also offered to Fed X my bag to Michigan but couldn’t get it there until two days later so I had to wait. Honestly didn’t think I could drive the two hours to Sawyer Michigan that night but did anyways. I was really tired and had been up since 3:30am to get to this destination. I wish Southwest had nonstop flights from Reno to Chicago."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Quick flight to Albuquerque,As usual getting early bird boarding was successful. Exit row seat obtained both coming and going. An advantage for tall people like myself. Staff was friendly and no issues with boarding or baggage. Great airline for short hops around the country
Date of travel: December 2018,50,Excellent,"This was a few years ago, but I still tell people about the wonderful care Southwest gave my friend and I.  We were stuck in the customs line coming home and they came and found us and helped us through so we wouldn't miss our plane.  I always love flying with them and hope they get more non-stop island flights."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,My Favorite Airline!,MY family traveled together to celebrate my graduation. My niece and mom are both handicapped so we were able to board first- and got the Bulkhead seat thankfully! The staff loved my niece and made sure everyone was comfortable. Also a tip: download the southwest app to have access to the free movies and wifi to use imessage!
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Different priced tiers with the Wanna Getaway selection????,"I fly southwest twice a year typically an easy peasy experience. Today I booked 2 tickets on the Wanna Getaway fare from Tampa to NYC for April 2020 and the total was $655. Once I entered the passenger information I received a message saying there were no seats available. I quickly re-entered the exact flights in the Wanna Getaway fares and it went through but now the new total was 675.00. I called Southwest and was told that someone beat me to the 655 fare and there are different tiers with the Wanna Getaway offering.  What???? Has anyone else ever heard of this?  You can be sure I’ll be watching changes in airfare for the next 5 months to see if I can get the flights any cheaper. To add insult to injury, I just flew SW 2 weeks ago and early bird boarding was $20 each. Today it was $25 each!  I told the woman that I’m finding little incentive to fly SW. Decided to use JetBlue for Thanksgiving!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Sign In Early or get the C Group,"Did not take the advice to sign in early and got C50, the last to get on the plane. Glad I had small luggage that would fit under the seat. Sat between a couple that shared a huge lunch. Nothing was offered to me but I did have the complementary tiny bag of tiny pretzels. Overall the flight leftnon time and arrived early. The couple I sat between were friendly and we had a nice chat, mostly about their son at West Point. Kudos in advance to his service. Ride was relatively smooth, service was friendly and overall Southwest gets a positive rating. On return, learned my lesson of signing in early and got a B group with an isle seat and luggage storage above the seat. Seniors get nice discounts and if money is not an object, you can always pay more for A group seating."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight,I always fly southwest. They always treat you like you’re flying first class. Great flight every time. Best crews and best planes.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Consistent good service and usually on time and bags fly free,Love the flight attendants on Southwest. They are always cheerful and seem to have fun help the passengers. This particular flight was actually a few minutes early on 2 of the four segments and the other 2 were right on time. Connections were within a few gates from each other making the transfer fast and stress free. Good job on this on Southwest.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Could do better!,The service from Southwest can be variable.Generally the actual flight and the cabin crew are friendly and welcoming.However the boarding process needs to be seriously addressed.It always amazes us that so many so called disabled passengers have to be loaded before those who have paid to board first and then miraculously are able to walk off the plane without assistance when reaching the destination!The crew on this particular flight were very good and my seat was ok. However some of the seats on the older aircraft need replacing. I understand the 737 Max situation is causing a problem with plane replacement but it’s not difficult to make sure all the seats are comfortable for the passengers in the meantime.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Friendly Folks,We have been flying Southwest for years and we love them!! Wish they flew to more places. Everybody is always so friendly!!!
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Mainly good!,"The flight from ABQ to MCI (Oct 17th, connecting in DAL)...on time Nice crews! No problems! The flight home to ABQ (Oct 20)was a little different story. It was exactly the type of flight I hate...Turbulence the entire flight...no inflight service...not to mention I was dying of thirst! The only thing that made that flight a really good flight was the flight crew, cockpit included! I would classify them as ""Keepers""! Thanks for a great flight! (but next time...no wind please! lol!)"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Amazing - children all around,All I heard was laughter and happy sounds on a 3 hour flight.  I complimented the parents...seriously I was expecting a rough time since my headphones had just broken...but it was the most pleasant flight I have taken in a very long time.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Low Prices But Not Worth It,"The San Diego airport is bad to start with, but then add SW Air being packed with screaming children and the flight being delayed a couple hours was just horrible. SW Air tends to be packed with kids because of the low prices"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Direct Flights Work Best,Southwest flies direct from wpb to LI but only “in season” when the demand of snow birds warrants it. As it was the start of the season the flight north was partially filled. That meant quicker boarding and a whole row to myself. Delightful! The onboard service was friendly efficient and helpful. The flight was uneventful with an early arrival which is always a good combination.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Southwest Flight,"Ontime, inexpensive, free movies, and no luggage fees.  Wish all airlines were as good as Southwest.  WiFi onboard but you have to download app."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Great Airline,"Awesome staff, the air host had a super funny repertoire that kept us most entertained. Service was excellent and flight was exceptional! Best airline in USA"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight to and from!,Both the departing and returning flights were on-time and the crew's service was excellent. The boarding process was efficient and organized.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Glad it was a short trip.,Paid way too much just for the ability to board early and have 2 free bags.  There are no special seats.  We had hoped to have more room.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,If Southwest Doesn't Fly There We Dont Go,"Whenever we are planning a trip, Southwest is our airline choice. Everything about Southwest is traveler friendly. No fees for luggage, easy to change or cancel flights, website is simple to navigate, flight attendants are both professional and personable. Fortunately, we do not have to travel for business; simply for pleasure, and Southwest makes each of our trips the perfect way to start and finish.PS...if there was some place we wanted to go and Southwest didnt, we would obviously choose another airline, but to date, Southwest has always taken us where we want to go!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,The fuc* is this setting arrangements!,Good luck sitting next to someone you came with. Seats are arranged for a reason! The amount of time people spend picking seats. Is a total waste of time. Cheep for reason. No first class you pick witch order you get to pick your seats. Won't be flying with southwest again.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,On time and efficient,"I do love SWA. Flexible, on time, efficient and friendly. Just about everything one needs for quick trips.  The attendants are so nice and really work hard to provide comfort. Not always easy with a plane completely full.  Well done SWA."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Great fares and good flights,Southwest had the best fare BY FAR!  The connections were good and the service was good.  The first flight to Oakland the seats were a bit narrow but from Oakland to PV was good.  We always buy the early bird deal as it helps you get a better place in line and is still cheap. Service was excellent!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Outstanding flight(s),Had 100 empty seats on flight to KC Had 29 seats empty back to VegasCan you say smooth flights?Plenty of leg room tooFree WIFIand pretzels of courseLove Southwest ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Fantastic service!!!!,"I recently went on a flight from Chicago to Columbus and I have to say, from check in to arriving at my destination, it was the best experience that I have had on a flight period. When arriving at the airport, I had a box of donuts for a loved one as a birthday dessert and my box was completely destroyed from the rain and snow. The woman who checked me in was very accommodating and helped me tape my box so it could make the flight home. When loading on to my flight, the stewardess’s on the flight were telling my how good my donuts would be and even cracked jokes about my box and if there were any extras. They also understood my hesitance to put the box on the floor and told me that they could sit on the seat beside me since my flight wasn’t booked. The flight and the donuts made it home safely and were very well received! Thank you so much for being understanding and helping me when I was having a rough day! Will refer this airline to everyone I can and plan on using them for future flights!"
Date of travel: December 2018,10,Voucher Fraud,"Gave me 3 $100 vouchers. No limitations, exclusions, rules of use whatsoever.Tried to use. Told can only use two. Talked to 3 reps who were worthless."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Denver LUV Jet,"We were in seating Group B. Wondered why there was a backup getting on plane. Then we heard the music and laughing. There were Southwest employees greeting everyone with posters, interaction and treats. We were the lucky ones to be on the LUV Jet. They made everyone feel welcome. Doesn't everyone deserve a smile in their day???  Before takeoff we saw them through the plane windows continuing the excitement. waving and dancing. :)This adds to my list of reasons to fly Southwest!!! #RockyMtnHospitality #DenSouthwestRocks"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,My favorite airline,"I love Southwest, they don't nickel and dime you for luggage and all.  Luggage is free.  Flight attendants are very nice and you always get a snack and a drink."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Stress free,My husband is not keen on flying.  We hadn't flown in about 15 yrs. and were anxious about our trip.  Everything went so smoothly much to our surprise!  The crew was very organized and super nice.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,On time with pleasant travel.,"Southwest is my go to Airline. Short direct flights to most of the places I like to travel.And, the new New Orleans airport is beautiful!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"A few kinks, but good.","It was ok, but late start.  They moved our gates twice, and we ended up at the same one we started at.  Good service, very friendly flight attendants, and a smooth flight.  Good leg room and restful.  Wifi was out.  They had to say ""sorry"" a lot."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Transferency,In my opinion Southwest is by far the best airline around both for price service and changes. The flight attendants joke around and have a good time so it’s a pleasurable flight.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Turbulent,The flight was turbulent but the pilot had warned everyone and put at ease. the attendants were very friendly.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I fly Southwest at least once a month and love this airline. They do everything right.,"I am a frequent flyer on Southwest because it has hubs in cities where I have to travel frequently.  They have wonderful client-friendly policies, like 2 free checked bags and one carry-on and one purse allowed...better than any other airline I know of,  and they do not charge you for changing your flight, even at the last minute.  I always arrive safely and usually on time. Their record is excellent and I find their app easy to use, too."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Fall getaway,"Southwest is consistent, you know what to expect other than where you will end up sitting.  I connected both ways in Houston which is overwhelmingly a Southwest terminal.  So changes of planes is easy."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,My one and only airline for US travel,"I have been flying Southwest for business and vacation since 1980.  At that time, passengers had to stand in line at the counter for the best seats.  Now I pay a bit more for my fares so I can be in the ""A"" line. What I like is the efficient ticket sales, boarding process, friendly online, counter and in-flight staff.  I especially enjoy the cabin crew who sign songs, tell stories and bring fill my coffee up all flight long."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,5 hour non-stop became 10 hour 1-stop flight,"Will only fly as a last resort.  They did not take of their customers.  Our flight was supposed to leave at 8:25 and arrive in Austin around 12:25.  A bad fuel sensor caused a 4 hour delay in take-off.  They had no mechanics in Boston to service the plane and could not get a contract mechanic.  Their solution was to empty the center fuel tank and stop in Nashville to refuel.  We ended up landing in Austin at 5:25 pm.  We were 10 hours on the plane and they only served a bag of pretzels, Lora Doone cookies and a soda.  This delay was within their control, they should have a mechanic available to fix mechanical issues.  I understand problems occur, but at least make it right, bring food on, they could at have offered us a sandwich.  we were on their plane for 6 extra hours due to a problem they could not fix (their fault).  That would have made a huge difference.  The way I judge a company is by how they respond to a problem.  I clearly cannot rely on Southwest to do the right the thing."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Review of my initial submitted complaint about excessive perfume on stewardess,Registered complaint with Southwest about the perfume and still awaiting a response. Complaint registered almost two months agp.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Great staff, organized boarding process, on time record is excellent. Can't beat the prices, which always includes free","Outstanding!! Great flight crew, comfortable flight. When considering airlines, this one ranks as one of my favorites. First two bags are free!!! That equates to a savings of anywhere from $25 to $100 dollars per trip, per person!!!  This a airline has one of the best on time records in the industry. Also, there are no change fees, and if you cancel for any reason, you receive a credit for future use!!! There Is free WiFi, and complementary beverages and and snacks. SERIOUSLY!!!!!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Worst Trip EVER,"I have been flying with Southwest forever!  However, my recent experience in trying to get to Tampa, FL through Atlanta sucked!  First I chose an early morning flight so there would be no way I could be late to board a long awaited cruise ship in Tampa.  After many delays in Raleigh (RDU) we left so late that by the time we got to Atlanta over a dozen of us were stuck with no flight that could possibly allow us to get to the port to board our cruise ship in time!  For the record ATL is the kiss of death when you are trying to make a connecting flight on time, but on this particular day it was all Southwest.  It will be a while before I fly them if ever again."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,great alternative airport!,"I traveled to LA for business, and due to flight times, chose this flight to/from Denver to Burbank instead of LA. What a great decision! The airport is so much easier to navigate, because of the small size and the drive times worked too. And as usual Southwest was on time & pleasant"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Midway is an easy in and out airport.,Flew to Boston for a long weekend and as usual Soutwest was ontime both ways.  Flight was full both ways but A list seating makes it easy to pick your seat.  Just sign in early for A list seating.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Loyal to Southwest,"We always chooses Southwest for our travel and they never disappoint us.  The flight was smooth, the attendants were great, sale prices are reasonable, and two bags fly free.  They don't have all the hidden, extra fees that you end up paying at some other airlines."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Typical Southwest Flight--Got me from point A to B with no frills,"This was a typical no frills Southwest flight.  Departed on time, arrived on time.  Nothing special.  Southwest did change my flight shortly after booking but gave me ample time to respond and change my plans if desired.  I was originally booked to fly through Chicago with a multi-hour layover.  They changed it to less than one-hour layover with an additional stop (no plane change) in Nashville.  Kind of inconvenient but we still got to our destination."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Viva Las Southwest Airlines!!!,"My wife and I traveled to Las Vegas via Southwest Airlines recently and our experience was great! The flights were on time and the air travel was smooth. Although I prefer assigned seating, Southwest boarding procedures were ok.  I purchased an early boarding pass which was worth the money to ensure my wife and I would be able to sit next to each other. I would highly recommend flying Southwest!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,flying,Better than most airlines.  My biggest complaint is their method  of loading passengers. If airlines really wanted to load faster they would load from the back to the front. The fact that Southwest does not assign seats really takes longer.  we cannot get settled until someone comes along to take the window seat since my husband thinks he has to sit in the aisle. It does not seem like the planes are CLEANED between flights any more.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Smooth as Silk,"Our first time traveling with Southwest.  No glitches or problems.  The open seating, at first we thought may be a hassle, but we confirmed our seats 24 hours ahead of time and got our choice of seats.  Put off a little by having to pay for WiFi, so if you have e-readers or laptops devices for entertainment, download software before boarding to avoid the cost.  Did not use the free checked luggage as we always travel light.  Snacks were provided on board.  Still the long flight after changing flights caused both of us to have back pain.  If you are older, I would suggest taking along a cushion."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Inter-Island Hawaii quick trip made easier with friendly service,"This flight was very reasonably priced, was very quick, and made all the better with a sense of humor and smiling staff.  Inter-island trips are more about boarding, timeliness  and moving people on and off the plane than about settling in for the long haul.  However, I found the seat to be very comfortable and the staff were happy and helpful.  As always, remember the no assigned seats and do your online check-in as soon as possible.  We did pay the fee for the early check in 36 hours before flight time.  This gives you a low number to allow you to line up in front."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Southwest Flight from Las Vegas McCarran to Chicago Midway,"Flying into Chicago, the flight was turbulent because they flew us into a thunder and lightning storm returning to Chicago. It was like being on a roller coaster that shook and shuddered. Like an old wooden roller coaster. The Flight Attendants are always very nice and very attentive.  The Pilots are always very informative and very nice when greeting and afterwards when leaving the airplane."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Problem with carry on luggage,The flight was ok except it is becoming a big problem with the carry on luggage. People bring luggage that is either too big or too difficult for them to fit or lift in luggage binsThey overbook the flights and then it is hard for customers to find space for their luggage It takes over a half an hour to load their stuff and they crowd the aisles so it is difficult to get to a seat. The worst though is the end of the flight when everyone is trying to get their belongings and another half hour or more to deplane. Those of us who check our luggage have to wait and delayed to get to our other flight because of this problem with onboard luggage I wish that everyone must check their bags and only take what will fit under your seat. Then boarding and leaving a plane would be easier
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best experience!,I had an unfortunate event the morning of my flight. Luckily I had enough time to cancel my flight before it took off. Southwest issued my a full refund. I’ve never experience such outstanding customer service! They are definitely my number one choice for any travel!
Date of travel: June 2019,40,Good Value,"Southwest is open seating mostly and that tends to stress me out.  However, for me, since I am disabled I can usually board before most people.  Once on the plane all was great.  Friendly helpful staff and good pilots.  For the value I highly recommend this airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Miserable flight,This was a horrible flight.  I was not allowed to sit with my husband because people pushed us aside to get in front of us.  There animal policy of fighting fir your seat rather than assigning them made this flight miserable.  This set a very unhappy tone fir our trip.  Do not fly southwest.  My back hurts from having to sit Gutwald because of lack of space. Terrible airline.  .
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always Good,"About 95% of my flights are booked with SW. I used to fly weekly (about 45 times a year). Now, it is only several times a year. With that being said, I can say that most of my experiences with SW have been exceptional. The only time I fly another airline is if SW doesn't have a flight going to that destination. They may not be for everyone, but, they are definitely for me. No hidden fees everything is upfront."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good discount flight,"This is sure a no frills airline, but I dare anyone to beat the price. Reccomend to bring your own meal, none will be served."
n/a,40,Hour late takeoff,The flight took off an hour late.  No reasons given.  I checked I. Online the morning of this evening flight had had a much lower boarding number than people checking in moments before the flight.  Not cool.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Friendly, comfortable and economical","Friendly flight crew and very good value. They create a fun atmosphere. The prices are very good when reserved well in advance. Flight selections can be limited, but advance reservation again is key."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Comfortable,"Very happy every time I travel on LUV Southwest Air,  It seems like the seats are more comfortable than the competitors.  And the big deal is value=They have more flight options to the cities I travel to most, and no bag charges."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great experience every time,"Always take the direct flight. Got in on a one day sale for $79 each way too! Worth laying for the early bird boarding; flight staff were friendly and accommodating. Best of all, the outbound and returning flights were ON TIME!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,We LUV Southwest!,"What a great flight despite the very early hour of departure.  Southwest does all they can to make your flight enjoyable.  This was a direct flight with a stop at Chicago Midway.  Departure and Arrival were both on time, bags were delivered in record time!We LUV Southwest Airlines!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest is the BEST!,"How can you go wrong with Southwest?  Great customer service, 2 free checked bags, open seating, friendly, polite and helpful agents and flight attendants.  Only complaint is the wifi service.  On some flights it's not the best.  Outta be sure wifi and inflight entertainment are top notch for long haul flights!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Easiest Nonstop,Always try to book with Southwest first.  On time flights nearly every time!  If you need to cancel no change fees!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Southwest from Hawaii!,"We've waited a long time for Southwest to offer service to and from Hawaii!  Honolulu Airport is BIG, gates are far, ask about the shuttle service.  Outside gate, so be sure to be at gate 45 minutes prior, they will board more than 30 minutes in advance.  Flight was uneventful, on time, lots of service on the scheduled 5 hours 15 minute flight.  Can't beat Southwest with 2 free checked bags."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,It’s a great value!,"For as short of a trip as it is from ATL to LGA, this airline is a great value! I fly Southwest a lot. They are very organized and friendly and almost always on time or early I feel. Great selection of things to watch for free on board from your personal device. The best part is that you get TWO free checked bags if you need to check and the carry on bag size allowed is a few inches bigger than the other airlines (it makes a difference!). They don’t nickel and dime you to death. You pick your seat as you board in order of the number you received when you checked in. And if it’s not a full flight, the flight attendants will joyfully tell you to spread out and enjoy the extra room, no need to use those middle seats if you don’t want to. The flight attendants and pilots are happy and really seem to enjoy their jobs which is a big plus when you have a bunch of people squished together in a metal tube. Also they have great “Wanna Get Away” sales.  I try to fly Southwest whenever I can."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Bad airline. Avoid.,"My flight got cancelled at the last minutes without any emails or calls. I just accidently found out when tried to log in the app to double checked the department time. Then they decided to pushed me to another flight with 1 additional stop (in stead of non-stop), increased flighting duration, and squeezed me and my wife to the bottom position. Nothing they could do for us except saying they were sorried and asked us to contacted maby different departments. Terrible. Avoid this one. Not recommended."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Won't fly any other airline unless Southwest isn't going my way.,"I think it is absolutely ridiculous to charge passengers for baggage. (at least one bag should be allowed as checked luggage), which is why I chose Southwest Airlines every time.  Who travels without luggage, for Pete's sake, and when you are like myself and cannot carry ANYTHING heavy due to medical limitations, Southwest works for me.  I always check my bags curbside, and the St. Louis skycaps are great.  They are quick, friendly, and they've never lost a bag of mine.  I love the smooth ride of Southwest Airlines' 737s (don't ever add the MAX, please), and the flight teams seem to be quite skilled.  In-flight staff usually have a goofy joke to ease anxiety, but if not, they are super friendly anyway."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Sick traveller,A 20 something girl got on and was hacking and coughing in the airport and all through the flight. I immediately got sick after I got home. Maybe you should have one of those free standing stations where people can take a mask or a wet wipe or hand sanitizer as they get on the plane. I would also cheer on any flight attendant who asked someone like that to please wear a mask out of consideration to other travellers.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Consistent.,I have been a loyal Southwest customer for years for 1 main reason - consistency.  You know what to expect from Southwest and they deliver every time.  Every employee that you interact with is very friendly and helpful.
n/a,50,Always love this airline ( despite the boarding process),"Free carry on, free checked bag, no change fee and snacks and drinks provided. Fun staff, and even at the end of B group ( we forgot to check in exactly 24 hours in advance) we still found 2 seats together.  Seats normal for economy. Price fair. Would fly again!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Great prices,First time flying with Southwest and both flights there and back were good. Delayed flight on return because of a cancellation out of Texas really messed up our schedules but it was still good service all around. I don't like that there's not assign seating but not that big of a deal if you're paying attention to that detail.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,My round trip flight to Dallas,There were no delays.  Everyone was courteous and kind.  The attendants were helpful as well.  I love flying on Southwest.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,The best customer service.,Traveled for first time with my wife in a wheel chair. They took us to a special desk person to check us in. Assistance to get on and off the plane was over the top attentive. Treated my wife special in all ways. Highly recommend.
Date of travel: June 2019,40,"Smooth Flight, Ample Legroom","This was a lovely flight. With only slight turbulence, it was a fairly smooth flight. We had ample legroom and excellent service from the flight attendants. The landing was a bit rough as it felt as though the plane slammed onto the tarmac. Overall, we love Southwest though!"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,The Best,"Southwest is the only airline we have flown since 2007, and that was because they didn't fly to Minneapolis/St.Paul at the time. Out of 6 flights this year, 5 were perfect from booking to landing with all getting in early. The 6th was late due to an act of God, and rerouted to Orlando for fuel, and then into Ft Lauderdale 1 1/2 hours later, but that's life. They do need to bring back the peanuts and enjoyed flying twice on planes with 2 bathroons in the back section, which made for no lines. Keep those fares low and no luggage fees."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Full Flights....Again,"I know other airlines fly with full aircraft, but there are a lot of reasons Southwest flights are (in my experience) always full or very nearly full.  Reasons include - choose your seat boarding, pleasant airline staff, they fly where I want to fly, your bags fly free, fair pricing structure.This flight was a one-stop, no plane change, flight.  And because of their seating policy, we were able to change our seat to facilitate our post-flight situation/plans.  This was after we chose our preferred seats for the flight segment to BNA.Not sure if I can ever go back to an airline where I have to pay extra for a preferred seat, or have to suffer with a seat toward the rear of the aircraft when I have a short turnaround at an interim stop, after I pay extra for my luggage to fly with me, etc.  Would drive me crazy.Fly Southwest!!!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,It's flying; what can you say.,"It's flying; what can you say. Airlines are pretty much the same. You buy a ticket and then the fees start in. Not as bad as Spirit, but at least you get a carry on and a checked bag included with your ticket price at Southwest."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Early Bird Check In,"Purchased Early Bird Check In 5 months ahead of flight. Two months ahead of flight SW changed the flight. Went to check in Early Bird got Pushed back to middle of the ""B"" Group. Called Veronica at Exective Office in Dallas and she basically said that's too bad. Been flying SW for years always paid for the Early Bird. NOT ANYMORE. What ever happened to that airlines that cared about their customers?"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Airline,Great Airline with good prices. No baggage or change fees. Only down fall there isn’t assigned seating and  paying for early check in.  But the pros out weigh the cons.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Pleasant Flight,It was a pleasant quick trip. I love that the plane boarded on time. The departure was on time. The flight was smooth. Pleasant crew.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,What I like best about flying Southwest AL,Been flying this Airline for 15 years and they are consistently dependable.  No lost luggage.  They do not serve meals but all else is excellent.The  Boarding method is very good.  Very caring crew and the pilots always speak to me. At least 2 flights per year.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Great price, and great flight","Had a great flight from DIA to Tampa with no issues, and on time on Oct 26th.  Then our return flight from Tampa to DIA on Nov 3rd was on time, and had no issues.  The flight attendants were polite both directions which made for 2 great flights."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Sacramento to Portland Easy Peasy,"Plane was on time, attendants were friendly and the flight was quick n easy. The online internet access allowed us to watch tv or movies, which was fun. I wish my flight had been longer so i could have watched something longer."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Southwest Airlines Vacation Package - Poor Customer Service (Apple Leisure Group?),"Just a warning for those considering Southwest Vacation Packages - KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON YOUR CREDIT CARD CHARGES :  We purchased and paid in full for a Charleston package through Southwest Vacation on Southwest Airlines site.  The flight was great. our first visit to Charleston was amazing but.... The Hyatt House Charleston Historic District falsely charged our card 5 times (during and after our stay) totally over $1000. We contacted the Hyatt hotel (twice) the hotel billing associate only said that the room was not paid by the Southwest Vacation group.He also commented that ""this happens all of the time"".  We immediately contacted Southwest Vacation team and also followed up with them.  It took another week to receive the credit for the charges.  No explanation of why the room was not paid for.  I sent an e-mail directly to Southwest Customer Service with a returned apology with a simple throw it over the wall response that Southwest only handles the flight portion.  The hotels, transportation, etc is serviced through Apple Leisure Group.  Disappointing Customer Service"
Date of travel: October 2019,20,one flight perfect ..return terrible,"i have to say my first time using this carrier and to be honest southwest can be the best airline carrier but the only thing that make my travel back to houston terrible experience is find out a lot of people take sits window and aisles just to leave middle available and a lot are relatives, the idea have more space for them  ...so if you are not IN the first half probably you have to go sit by sit asking if you can take the middle one ...I saw my wife with a sad face in the middle of 2 strangers and me far away....so southwest good price, good amenities..good almost all   ...but that system of first in fist choose SUCKS !!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,On time or early,"I used to travel other airlines for work. In the last two years, I only travel Southwest because I have never had a 'bad' experience. Check-in goes quickly at the airports I have flown through: SJC, SFO, OAK, SNA, PHX, LAS, DEN, PIT. I have never had an issue finding overhead space, or a particular seat of preference. The seats have always been clean, as have the bathrooms. On one flight a few months back, there were some crumbs on the aisle, but I would rather deal with that than the potential for a late departure or arrival, which would have been the case had a full cleaning taken place. My luggage always shows up with me, and the flight attendants are humorous while maintaining respectfulness. My least favorite part is the increase in cost for 'early bird' boarding, which is my choice to pay to ensure the choice of seat I truly want."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Billy in Houston was so helpful!,I recently had to rebook a flight to get home to a sick child.  When I got to the Southwest Counter I encountered Billy.  I asked him if I could switch my flight and he was so accomodating.  He found me a direct flight and helped me a great deal.  I really appreciate his help.  Southwest has always been my favorite airline!!
Date of travel: August 2019,40,On time arrivals and departures,"I flew round trip on Southwest in August from Sacramento, CA to San Diego, CA in August, Sacramento to Ontario, CA in September and Sacramento to Chicago, IL in October with no issues or problems.  I was very pleased this airline doesn't charge extra to check up to two pieces of luggage per person.  The boarding and deplaning process works well with this airline even though they don't use assigned seats.  They use a boarding number which is printed on the ticket when you check in. The fares  are reasonable."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flight to Atlanta,Southwest airlines is the best!  I always book on their flights first.  The airline gate attendants and the airline flight attendants are the best.  The humor is greatly appreciated as well.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight to Seattle,On time. Flight attendants professioal and friendly. Good snacks and plenty of them. Pilots kept us informed during a short delay. Always love Southwest!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,FABULOUS CANCUN,It was a long trip but Southwest was on time to and from Cancun.  The flight attendants were exceptionally thoughtful and nice.  Connection were also on time.
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Tight fit,The good news is it was not a long flight.  The ground crew were excellent as I was in a wheel chair and they treated me with great respect and kindness.  The plane was small and seating was uncomfortable. No business class and the stewardess were not at all friendly.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Family Vacation,"Southwest Airlines has traveling customers their number 1 priority from A to Z. From the time we checked in at the counter, through boarding and the simplicity of collecting our luggage every process went smoothly. The Southwest staff are always super friendly and helpful. I will highly encourage anyone to choose Southwest Airlines when traveling by air."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,The only way to fly,A great airline.  Has low fares with out hidden charges.  The employees seem to really enjoy what they are doing and try to make the process easy for everyone.  No charge for two checked bags.  Pick the seat you want wghen you get on the plane.  have been flying SW for years and still enjoy it.
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Philadelphia to Vegas - Great flight!,I was flying out and had to take two flights to Vegas from Philadelphia and the same back. Never had a bad experience with Southwest. Flights were good with no issues.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Like Always,We flew the last direct flight on October 2nd to Boston.  Just like always nice employees and great service.
Date of travel: January 2019,40,Affordable flights,An affordable airline with a long history in the Rio Grande Valley. The delays get a little unnerving sometimes. It's the reason for the 4 stars. The prices combined with a great points program makes them my favorite.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Flight,Flight and the airline folks were great.  Had a seat beside me each way.  I really have no complaints with either.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Fantastic service,"Flight was on time, and flight attendants were attentive to our every need. We had great snacks and beverages."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Easy peasy flight,"Once again so happy with this airline.  The flight out of Logan and into Florida was all on the same plane ... no standing in a line a second time.  I always TRY to fly Southwest but now that I am not in and out of Orlando, the planning is a bit more of a challenge.  But this was perfect!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always a great flight with fantastic support on Southwest Airlines!,"Easy check in, baggage check and boarding. Friendly help along the way every time! Love Southwest Airlines no matter where I am going!"
Date of travel: December 2018,10,Treated me & my SERVICE DOG horribly! Worst airline!,"This really happened in 2017 but I had to warn all my fellow ESA & SERVICE DOG owners. I’m always very polite when I travel with my service dogs. I ask others if they are okay with dogs if I sit next to them. The guy said yes please sit. My 2 year old corgi was new to flying and gets little nervous on take off. Door closes and no one sat between us so he said put her up on your lap and we will pet her to relax her as we take off. She was shaking on the ground. The woman flight attendant came over & yelled at me as if I were a child. Demanded I put her on the ground! Even the guy next to me couldn’t believe this. This was not the only time southwest treated us bad. Her first flight December 2016, we even PAID $200 for her to fly, they did same thing. Put your puppy in the bag under the seat that costs $189 for person to sit in...even though I paid $200 for my puppy to be shoved UNDER SEAT!? Honestly, flying with dogs have become hectic. I understand some have taken advantage of service animal laws. But for those of us that really need an ESA this has become a nightmare. JetBlue is the only airline I fly now with my ESA dogs. Make sure you call ahead...weeks ahead to send any airline your letters & records. Thanks to the crazy PEACOCK lady! (Pic JetBlue pilot loved him so he got VIP very important puppy service 🤣)"
n/a,50,Southwest airlines Friendly staff and crew,Friendly staff and crew. Sang to us which made us laugh. Short flight went even quicker because of the flight attendant's . It's always nice to be made to feel like a person who is welcome and not just a statistic or baggage.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Midnight cancelation of 6:00AM flight and 2 hours on hold to speak with agent,For the 2nd time in my last 3 flights S/W has canceled a flight after I had my boarding passes in hand.  The last was to Tampa for a cruise.  We up late packing and saw the message.  I stayed on hold for 2 hours to find out my only option was to fly to Orlando and rent a car to drive to Tampa.  We were taking a cruise and had to be in Tampa on time.  I love S/W but when they have to cancel 100's of flights on Friday night because of weather you would think they might want to add some additional agents to help the thousands that had be misplaced.  Very poor management on their part.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Fly to Vegas!,"Southwest Airlines continues to impress. With their low fairs and new fleet, they do a great job of letting you get away!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,best fares - routes,"We travel in spurts, but it seems that Southwest is always the airline that has the best fare and direct routes to our destinations.  Yes, they lack some of the amenities the other airlines have.  Some of the aircraft have increased leg room which is appreciated since I have knee issues.  Our last travels were Las Vegas to LAX -- and return from Ft Lauderdale to Las Vegas.  Our return flight had a layover of only one hour at Love Field, but since the plane was on time and the facility is smaller than DFW, the gate was only a couple from where we landed so we had time to spare.  One of the great benefits is that 2 pieces of checked luggage are included in the fare.  A disadvantage is it is open seating, but that can be reduced if you use the Early Bird option.  However, it does come with a fee.  A pet peeve of all the airlines is people who go to the back of the plane, put their carryon in the front overhead compartments; thus, leaving less room for the passengers who choose the front seating area.  They do have a priority boarding system for those who have achieved A status, special assistance needs, etc.  Some announce priority boarding for military, but it is not always clear if that is for active duty only or includes retired."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,A Great Airline at a Reasonable Price,My flight to San Diego included a layover in Las Vegas and was a great experience. I used Early Bird Check-in an were placed in the A Group for boarding.  Boarding is so simple and being able to pick your own seat is a great perk.  If you are in a different boarding group seat selection is limited.  The flight went well and we even arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule.  The flight attendants were great.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great airline,The staff are always nice and the flights are always on time. But this trip the wind was blowing so hard we were coming in sideways. We were about 50 feet from landing and the Capt decided to gun it and up we went. The second attempt was perfect.  I was so thankful he made the call to get us down safely!! I truly trust the pilots!! Thx SW!!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,The best !,"The kindest and by far the easiest to book and fly ! Always on time and if they are not, they make up for it without asking. Never have had a problem with them !"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Great Airline, free bags","I have no problems with this airline and the flight attendants are always very nice.  Both of my flights to Newark were uneventful, however, my flights back to Las Vegas were a bit delayed.  I guess I will not be flying anytime soon again as Southwest has decided to stop flying into Newark NJ airport.  The flight attendant told me as of November 1st, they are discontinuing this destination.  Now, what am I suppose to do???  Yes, the flights on other airlines might be less expensive BUT the charge for luggage makes it more then what I was charged by Southwest.  I usually stay for three weeks and I can not travel with just one bag.  I do not travel light.  So goodbye to Southwest from an unhappy traveler."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Another terrific flight with SWA,"I fly Southwest quite a bit and always have a good experience. The flight home from Sacramento I had an unusual experience with SWA. This was the first time that I am aware of that they offered passenger loading from the rear of the plane as well. We had the option to exit the entry way and down stairs to the tarmac, walk to the rear of the plane and up stairs to enter from the aft galley way. I was a mid B boarding group and made it to my seat in the rear of the plane at the same time as my friends that had low A boarding group numbers. I thought this was awesome."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Round trip San Diego to Nashville,"On time both directions and friendly pilots and flight attendants. 2 free bags.WHY, WHY do people feel that they must haul 2 large bags onto the airplane when luggage check in is free?? Our flights were both full and we were forced to deal with the absurd people in ""C"" boarding group nearly decapitating us trying to sling their bags into full overheads....Then, the ""C"" group people boarding and complaining and arguing with each other when they couldn't sit with their wife on the long flight. Yes, I understand you want to sit with your wife and you have 2 options: fly another airline, or check in sooner!!!I will NOT fly Southwest on another long flight if I can help it. It is just torture. Unfortunately they are the only non stop to several locations in the south...."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Wonderful airline,Wonderful staff. We were offered beverages and snacks multiple times throughout flight. Staff was pleasant and very accommodating. I'd recommend this airline over the rest.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Arrived early and of course, two free check bags","First time ever in 40 years of flying that we arrive 30 minutes early!!!  Of course, my two pieces of luggage were free of charge and the flight attendants were courteous and fun."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Friendly skies!,I always try to fly Southwest!  Airfares are reasonable and the list of cities they service continues to grow.  They have frequent sales and their Wanna Get Away fares are hard to beat.  The customer service is wonderful and they allow 2 bags to be checked for free!  I wish more passengers took advantage of this instead of carrying on their luggage!  It is worthwhile to pay the extra for early boarding (A) group if you have a seating  preference.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,I try to go only where Southwest goes when flying in the U.S.,Other U.S. airlines pale in comparison to Southwest. I fly other airlines only when I have to because Southwest doesn't fly there.  Please keep adding new destinations!
Date of travel: November 2019,40,A Connecting Flight For Me,"On time take off.  Seat comfort and legroom OK.  Non-alcoholic beverages and pretzels  included. As always with Southwest, make sure you check in on line 24 hours before the flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Very Average Flight,"On time take off. Legroom OK. Seat comfort OK. Because of their check in procedures, make sure you get your boarding pass, on line, 24 hours before departure time."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Don't Quite Know How to Respond....,"Everyone was very orderly and respectful getting in their numeric ordered line for boarding. Toward the end of boarding, a rather large man made his way back to the front of the plane. At this point, the flight attendants were trying to figure out who could switch seats to accommodate the man. Efforts were made, but nothing worked. Needless to say he reacting very aggressively to another passenger. The incident ended with him and his family leaving the plane. Reports had to be written, and we all sat on the tarmack for an hour. Needless to say, several of us missed connecting flights etc. Just am unhappy situation for many."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Return flight from Florida vacation,"Returning to NY via Tampa from our Florida vacation was NOT the same level of experience as our outbound flight to Florida. While the flight was fine and uneventful and the level of service from the Flight crew was excellent, there was NO wheel chair attendant waiting at the gate to take my wife to the connecting flight. The service company who provides this service said the need for a wheel chair was never communicated to them via their tablets they carry. This despite me confirming the need for this service during check-in and also identified as such on her boarding pass. I had to assist my wife (who has a fused ankle and walks with a cain) off the plan and up the tramway to the gate. Not a pleasant experience for sure."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Florida vacation visiting family.,"Excellent, stress free DIRECT flight to West Palm Beach. From check-in to wheel chair service for my wife both at Islip and West Palm Beach couldn't have been better. Thank You!!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good experience,I like the efficient boarding and the friendly and helpful flight crew.  I like flying Southwest as I don't have to pay to check a bag.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Phoenix to Denver,"Flight was great - everything went smoothly from the start.  Staff were very attentive and friendly.  We hit a bit of turbulence, but the captain was very good with updating everyone each time."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Not  the  Southwest Airlines  I know,"This  flight  connected in Chicago . The  flight from New  Orleans  to  Chicago  was  a  nightmare. The  attendant  we  had  was  rude, stepped  on my husbands  foot  which was not  in the aisle and  also overlooked  carry ons  being  improperly placed  under  seats . It was   so  different  compared to  the usual  southwest  flights  we have  taken. And  we  have  flown numerous  times  with  them...All I  can say we  could not  wait  to  get off  that plane  in Chicago. The  flight  continues  with us  going  on to Pvd   with another  plane  and  crew and it  was  good ."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,ON-time.,SWA gave me good prompt non-stop service - the only airline to offer that from STL to SAN.  My only 'complaint' is that it is an afternoon flight instead of a morning flight - or they could offer two flights a day.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Great flight.  No fuss, no muss and free bags","I've been flying Southwest for years and have always been impressed by the service in and out of the plane.  Staff is universally professional, efficient and helpful.  And, no charge for checking bags.  Can't ssk for more!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,INSPIRED,Southwest is my preferred airline of travel. The service from check-in to handicap assistance to boarding to arriving at destination is most  satisfying.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,A pleasant experience for a no frills airline. Check in process is interesting.,"Coming from Australia we are used to our no frills airlines being exactly that, you want anything, you pay for it. So we were thrilled to discover with Southwest Airlines, that not only do you get a complimentary soft drink, tea or coffee and a snack, BUT you also get free movies to access via their app. This was fantastic and helped the kids pass the hours. The choice of movies and shows was impressive too. So make sure you get download their app before the flight, instructions are provided on how to access it once on board. There was intermittent issues with the wifi in the air which got annoying, but for the most part it worked pretty well.The check in process is also different to what we have experienced previously. There are NO seat allocation. The order in which you check in (online 24 hours beforehand) is the order in which you board, when you board you pick any available seat. We checked in a few minutes after 24 hours before our flight and discovered we were check in group B, # 9-13. This meant that within the first few minutes, others had checked in before us. Group A I think is reserved for special members and those who wish to pay for priority boarding. When we got on, most window and aisle seats were gone, up to about row 25 or 30, so we had no trouble, but we had no more than 10 rows behind us. If you're in group C, expect to have access to middle seats only.When we flew on a later flight and had forgotten to check in immediately it was available we were group B, 34-38 so we were concerned we would not be able to sit with our kids. Fortunately at check in the lady gave us ""extra time"" which allows us to board after group A but before group B, so that was fantastic. If you have a stopover where you stay on the plane, you have the option to move seats if you want to, so depending on where you are this could be a good opportunity to closer to the front and a quicker exit for your next leg.Considering our longest flight with them was 4 hours, the seats were comfortable (3x3 formation), but typically not much room for 3 adults.One of the things we liked with Southwest, is that their prices INCLUDE baggage allowance, which with 5 people with suitcases, this made a big difference to the prices compared to other carriers.Overall, now we know how it all works, we would definitely book with Southwest again."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,las vegas trip,good time of day direct flight. friendly crew. very reasonable.not sure why anyone would fly any other airlines for this trip
n/a,50,All-star flight attendant-Bethany-Flight 6987,"This review will be short and sweet. I had never flown with Southwest airline before and beside the new experience of lining up in front of numbers as boarding groups which I am not used to, I have received the best service ever on flight 6987 from one of the flight attendants, Bethany. As soon as we came in, she was around the middle rows helping people get a seat and we stroke a conversation with her and she kept the eye contact, professionalism and kindness throughout. I had never experienced that, at least on that level, with any other airlines and flight attendants. Thank you and kudos to Bethany."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Superior customer service!!,I was attending a conference in San Diego when I discovered my flight home was changed to an earlier time. I would have missed some valuable presentations and I really didn’t want to. I called customer service and Abraham was so helpful!! He helped me look for alternatives and was able to get me on a later flight. What started as a stressful situation was resolved swiftly. Thank you Abraham! You truly exemplify excellent customer service!!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Love to fly Southwest,"My first choice for airfare is Southwest. So you don't get to choose your seat until you get on the plane but what other airline lets you change flights for no charge, cancel a flight , get a credit if the price goes down and bring 2 suitcases for no charge. Southwest is usually on the time and the staff is always apprecitive of their passangers."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Basic training travels,"Our flight went from Cleveland to Baltimore then on to Oklahoma City. Upon arriving in Oklahoma City and getting our luggage and child car seats we realized half of our clothes in the suitcases were wet, and the child car seats were soaked!"
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,"Cheapest flights with free baggage, free to reticket and great customer service.  Airplanes are clean and comfortable."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Another great flight,"welcoming crew, clean interior, and nice seating. Great in flight movies (Bring your smart phone and earphones) They set the standard for the industry. Highly recommended."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight,Flight departed on time and landed a little early It was Halloween so first drink was free Service was excellent as usual I always fly southwest they are the best
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I can’t believe it,"I can’t believe the male employee in the airport who assisted us in boarding flight 1590 around 7:44 on Nov 1st,  told us we were in line to fly to Hawaii!The people around me looked confused but then started cheering because they would rather go to Hawaii than Milwaukee. The man quickly corrected his mistake. I can’t believe the crowd laughed at him. The man remained calm and pleasant and kept smiling at everyone who boarded the plane. I can’t believe he pretended to love his job even though it was late in the evening. I can’t believe how friendly and fun he was even though he was suppose to be working. I can’t believe he took it upon himself to entertain the crowd as if he was a paid entertainer, he even tried to make the children smile. He made sure everyone boarded the plane on time and was organized, but he kept doing it with a smile. I can’t believe this man did not already get a pat on the back or a promotion because he definitely deserves it. I can’t believe I did not get his name! I think his initials are LC. Kuddos to this man for doing an amazing job! There are people in the world who genuinely care about their work. I can’t believe it!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Love Southwest,I love southwest prefer to fly them whenever possible. for longer flights I tend to go with other airlines only because southwest seats are so small and they dont have screens. But the customer service is phenomenal and my frequent flight to and from the bay area are always with them.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Newark Express,This was a convenient flight to Newark which Southwest plans to eliminate. They will fly into LaGuardia instead which is much worse than Newark. Our flight was slightly delayed but otherwise everything went smoothly.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Great Flight, no probelms","Great Fight, never felt crammed in. no reserved seating, but we did pay extra for early boarding, which is essential if you want to sit next to your loved one.. Well worth it."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Never again!,"Horrible boarding experience! The flight is average. Without seating assignments at their advertised prices, it was basically a competition to get seated together. Never never again!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Horrible Staff experience for our honeymoon trip,"Oct 15th thru Oct 22nd was horrible customer experience for our honeymoon week. Do not go with them because they are cheaper! So many reasons why we had a bad experience with the employees on each flight we took to get back and forth to Mexico and Sacramento.1.) It started off they switched our initial flight. We had to leave at 6:25am instead of 7:05am and we weren't notified about it until we called to checkin and had to ask someone to drop us off.2.) The flight from Sacramento 6:25am to Denver, younger attendant with blond wavy hair was servicing back cabin and she was rudely and onerly flirtatious with my new husband on OUR HONEYMOON to the point where it was uncomfortable for both of us and very unprofessional. After the flight when we landed. We told the southwest woman at the landing gate about it. I told her it was our honeymoon and I didnt have the ladys name. She wouldn't tell me the flight attendant's name and said she wasnt allowed. She said she herself has been accused of being flirty because of the southern hospitality and dismissed my complaint. I explained to her how that was professional and was pretty bad to the point where it was uncomfortable and I couldn't argue with the flight attendant during the flight to get kicked off. I asked if they work on tips and treat all honeymooners that way when they are paid to provide service. Also, I said if it would be a woman complaining about a man using the words sexually harassment, it would be treated differently and taken serious to avoid lawsuits.3.) Flight from Cancun to Denver comming back the brown shorthaired middle aged flight attendant providing service in the front was rude. I told her I had a question, she told me to hold on abruptly and continued to talk to another passenger about a drink. I asked her if they planned on turning off the seatbelt sign so I could go to the bathroom quickly. She answered rudely saying shes not in control of the flight, wont give permission for me to go to the bathroom and cant do anything. I told her I just asked a question and she shrugged her shoulders and walked away. During this whole time 4 people got up and went to the bathroom and she said nothing. I went fast anyways and she gave me a dirty look when I went inside and came out. 4.) We had to recheck our bags from Denver airport to Sacramento flight and nobody could help us where check in our bags and checkin into southwest after we came from Customs. We ran around for at least 20 minutes downstairs and upstairs in circles trying to figure it out and the younger guy at the southwest baggage recheck claim did not give us correct information.5.) My husband was flagged for flight checkin inside the airport only, for both return flights. I was given group A boarding status and had to try and save him a seat because his groups were B. We barely were able to sit next to eachother during our flights because other people were doing the same thing6.) Unpacking our bags after our last flight comming back to Sacramento my expensive $50.00 clinique moisture surge cream was unscrewed during the baggage process and spilled all over the luggage bag and stained it. We called and the next day the claim was denied without follow up.We have submitted an official complaint for everything and were told that they allow 30 days for a response. I would not recommend this airline unless your single and not traveling with anyone else. The staff was unprofessional for all 4 flights during our Honeymoon the entire time. They are not couple friendly or able to provide any assistance when needed."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Convenient Flights,"Warming up to Southwest. Lots of flight options which allow us to avoid the traffic jams in the greater Seattle area. Easy boarding, clean planes, great staff, and on time landing."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flight to Cali,"We have always had good service on Southwest, so I guess that's why I stick with them.  Love the cocktails, and free entertainment services online to keep from the boredom!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Gone South--But in a Good Way,"The employees at Southwest Airlines always are professional and personable. Because of health problems, I have to sit in the rear of the plane on the aisle so I don't cause problems for other passem=ngers. Even though I have no outward signs of a malady, the check-in attendant doesn't question my request for early boarding. This makes my wife's and my trip much more enjoyable. Thank you, Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always a good experience!,Southwest Airlines goes above and beyond to ensure you have a good experience. They always keep you updated with what's happening from the time the aircraft arrives through landing.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Smooth travels,Flights were on time. Very impressed with the Pensacola Airport. Easy to navigate after coming from Chicago.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great no frills airline,"Flight arrived at destination, Houston,  1/2 hour ahead of schedule due to favorable tail winds.  This is a relatively short flight which barely allows personnel time  to serve their drinks and snacks.  Encountered no issues on the flight to Houston.  All personnel was friendly .  However the return flight from Houston to Dallas was slightly delayed and then connection from Dallas to Memphis was delayed.  Due to weather it was determined that no drink/snack service would be done. The board was updated showing times when flights would be able to leave.  Aggravating but humans cannot control the weather which is what caused the delays.  Overall Southwest is a great no frills airline that I will fly again"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Reliable. Simple Pricing.,"I love the direct flight offerings out of Omaha NE to Las Vegas NV. The no-nonsense approach is easy to work with and predictable - you know what you get for the price listed... none of the extra fees! Unfortunately, both of my flights were delayed by an hour. While on the way to Las Vegas it wasn't so bad. On the way back to Omaha, it resulted in an arrival time after midnight. Good flight - just a long overall transportation time. I'll consider earlier flight times in the future to avoid the late hours."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Smooth and uneventful.,The flight was a bit over booked and crowded however it was a straight flight to destination. My one suggestion would be that better screening of luggage size should be addressed prior to boarding. Some of these bags have no possible way of making it into an overhead compartment.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Pros and cons of flying Southwest,"I have always loved Southwest.  Our whole family has the SW credit card and try to use the reward miles when traveling.  We have a trip planned for April 2020 for my daughter, her husband and 4 children and my son, his wife and daughter. What I don't like is that I had to purchase the early boarding because we wanted the family to be seated together. My husband and I went to Las Vegas in October and I purchased the early boarding because I did not want to sit with strangers."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,TO ARUBA,"Good flight from Baltimore to Aruba.  Left on time and arrived a bit early.  On the return, after 4 hours and 15 minutes , we arrived 25 minutes early.  Baggage claim was faster than usual too."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Southwest Cancels Flight and then makes me board much later guaranteeing me a middle seat,"Southwest canceled my flight after I had already checked in.  I am forced to rebook on a flight that takes 2 more hours and given a B60 and C5 boarding positions (now on 2 flights instead of 1). I had paid for Early Bird Check In.  Called customer service no help.  Nothing they can do.  But if there is availability to upgrade my ticket at the gate, I can pay for it?  What?  Adding insult to injury for this 20 year rapid rewards member.  I am at the point in my career where I don't pay for my flights and travel a lot.  Good Bye Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,The economy flights,We miss the direct to Atlanta flight.  Every time we fly more people get on through special arrangement-  mostly by paying more.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,SJO to FLL via Southwest,I frequently fly  his route and back.  To Ft Lauderdale is $122. My return flight to SJO is $98. Included is two free check in bags. And the real big advantage is I can change or cancel my flights without penalty right up until time of departure. Also with boarding you simply choose any available seat  when boarding. And that by grouping.  You can pay a small fee for Priority Boarding. But I have never had a problem in getting an aisle seat
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Naples FLA R&R,Security check point was a breeze both going and returning.  Flights were both on time and uneventful.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,First time flying Southwest; very impressed!,"We love to travel and typically have flown United and Delta in the past. We decided to give Southwest a try on our most recent vacation. We are hooked! We must admit we had some reservations (no pun intended) since we weren't sure what to think about the boarding process and picking your seat. Turns out, the boarding process was well-organized and very efficient and we loved the option of picking our own seats. The staff had really great personalities and added humor into the trip (especially on our first leg from Cinci to Midway). What was most impressive to me was, an off-duty Southwest airline employee helped pass out the snacks when he was flying as a passenger. Everything went smoothly, from the check in, to boarding, to picking up our bags. We will definitely fly Southwest again!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest is the go to airline.,"Always seem to be dependable. Check-in and flights were smooth. I only wish they could work out something with travel agents, like a rewards system. I would book more clients with Southwest if they did that."
Date of travel: July 2019,20,Different experience,"I am torn about this review because I realize the weather is out of the airlines control. However, I thought instead of flying through 2 major thunderstorms, we would have flown around the storms to minimize turbulence and the possibility of a lightning strike. I've been on a flight before that was struck by lightning (different airline), but this was the worst flight experience I've had so far. I was conveying this to a friend who travels a great deal for work and she said the airline doesn't avoid storms since they only fly into/out of certain airports. I have no idea if it's true or not, but it made sense when she said it. And, I've flown with other airlines where they fly around the store. I will think twice before booking another flight with SW. The check-in and boarding process was fine, as usual which is why I was torn about the rating I gave. But again, after this flight I had no desire to fly again anytime soon."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Please don't leave Newark airport!,"Heard rumors that Southwest airlines was going to stop flying out of Newark airport.  That's terrible if true. Finally find a reliable, on time and comfortable (I'm a big guy? airline! They don't charge for bags or carry on's. Bottom line, if you're not flying Southwest you're missing out."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Fun First Flight!,"First time with Southwest, and it WON'T be the last! Great price, great service - only took a couple minutes to figure out the whole ""how to line up"" thing...and it gave opportunities to reach out to other newbies once we caught on to how things go.Our flight back was super fun - really great staff with very funny safety speeches.Had 4 different planes - the newer ones do have more comfy seats..."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Cowboy Hall of Fame Induction Dinner,"My wife and I flew Southwest to Dallas Love Field from Sacramento and back. How could you not like Southwest? Great flights, great employees with great attitudes. I used  to fly 250000 domestic mile per year and switched to Soutwest because I was so tired of hearing airline employees complain about management and their jobs. Thank you Southwest!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Ho hum, another perfect flight.",Another perfect flight from SW. Both flights took off and arrived on time. Both crews were friendly and attentive. And bags fly free. What else could one ask for.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delayed,When you schedule a first flight of the day to beat the crowd only to find out flight is delayed for 1:20minutes because the third party company had people call out. We sat on plane until a replacement employee could be called in to push the plane back from the gate.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flight to New England,We flew to New England for a leaf peeping tour in October. Southwest is our airline of choice whenever we can fly with them. The employees are generally always in a good mood and our flight attendants and captains we great. We flew into the Manchester Airport in New Hampshire and the flights were right on time! That airport is a fliers dream. Very easy in and out and kept us out of Boston! Love Southwest Airlines!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Cancelled return flight but amazing customer service!,My flight at my connection in Chicago was cancelled last minute and re-booked for the following day very late in the afternoon.  Original issue was mechanical and then we were going to be put on a second aircraft but within 20 minutes of that decision it was cancelled for weather related reasons.  I was told there would be no vouchers issued due to this reason.  I called Southwest once I returned home and explained the scenario: I was issued a 200.00 voucher the following day!  Thank you Southwest
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Usually a great flight, with a few delays","SW is almost always spot on, and their staff usually have great personalties. No major mishaps, but each flight was delayed about 20 to 40 minutes, with no obvious reasons why. That is the one thing I wish all airlines would do is communicate delays better."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,SWA to San Antonio,"Basically a nice comfortable flight mostly.  Plane was late arriving in Charlotte, even though it was the first flight of the day, which delayed takeoff, and connection in Nashville.  Rerouted to Dallas for transfer to SA.  The airlines did make compensation for the delay without being asked to do so.  All in all, it was a good flight.  I would fly with them again."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Rough weather, reasonably smooth flight","This flight was significantly delayed by weather.  While there's only so much Southwest could do, we did have multiple flights stacked up at the same gate, and it got a bit confusing.  The letter and number boarding posts work fairly well, but in those conditions it was pretty difficult to follow the process.  I think they needed at least one additional person staffing the gate to make it work smoothly.  The flight itself was OK,"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Great airlines,"Easy and on time boarding, friendly and humorous flight attendants. Great fares and adequate leg room with space for carry on luggage.."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,COO,Will never fly southwest ever again! Missed our flight due to mechanical reasons. 100% swa’s fault. Southwest did nothing to take responsibility for their mistake. There are we no flight on southwest to get us to our destination on time and they left us to spend 8X morning he cost of our flight to book on another airline. Forgot southwest. Not even a low cost airline anymore. How are these clowns in business??
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Friendly, efficient service.","Make sure to get your ""Early Bird"" boarding to have your choice of open seating. And then enjoy the savings over more expensive options."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Easy,Friendly flight attendants.  Make sure you check in on their app to get the best boarding position.  Not like traditional airline tickets- you aren’t assigned a seat but rather you check in & get a boarding #. Free ritz bits & pretzels & beverages.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight and service,"Our flight was very good. On time, easy boarding. Staff very helpful. Plane clean and flight was excellent."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best all-around airline!,"Southwest, how do I luv thee? Let me count the ways: low fares, free bags, friendly reservation associates who go out of their way to fix problems at no additional charge, friendly, funny, entertaining flight attendants, no penalty for changing flights, on-time flights (or they make it right if there is a big delay)... I could tell dozens of ""Southwest to the rescue"" stories! I am a loyal SWA customer!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Return trip from military teaching duty,"Great flights, on time, smooth ride great flight attendant service - as always, and great seating system"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight crew as usual.,"I fly Southwest exclusively out west, border to border. I wouldn't think of anyone else. Since my first flight in the early 80's we hit it off and it's always very good. No attitude, no frills, just friendly transportation at a very good price."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Nice flight but...,"Southwest was, as usual, on time,efficient and friendly.   I do appreciate the boarding process, without assigned seating.  And here comes the ""but"".  It is most annoying when you pay for early bird seating and then board only to find many passengers saving seats.  I witnessed a party where one of the 6 paid for early boarding and blocked off 5 seats for the rest of his party.   He had learned how to work the system.   Another lady had set items on the entire exit row to hold seats.  When I later asked the flight attendant about their policy on saving seats, he said ""hands off"".   I will say the flight crew was careful not to allow physically impaired early boarders to sit in the exit rows."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Forgot How Great They Were,"Hadn't flown SW since a trip to Las Vegas.  Laughed the whole way.  This crew wasn't as comically gifted as the last trip, but was memorable in a good way.  With service and performance (not delayed/cancelled) this good, we're still fans.  American is in our rear-view mirror."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Reliable Southwest,Staff was efficient.   No problems.  One flight attendant in particular from the San Antonio to Chicago leg was quite humorous.  Be careful SW that you don’t lose her to stand up comedy.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Flight,"Had to travel to St. Louis, MO to watch my granddaughter perform for Bands of America regionals.  Flight was on time.  We boarded fairly quickly.  Attendants were friendly, entertaining, and accommodating.  Boarding area was decorated for Halloween.  Flight was routine.  Will fly with them again.  Just wish seats were assigned."
Date of travel: March 2019,20,Fair experience,Nothing special about the airline. The way they board the plane is poor. I am a 62 year old veteran with a minor disability. I was travelling with my 3 year old granddaughter and was told I wasn't permitted to board early with the rest of the people with small children because I wasn't the parent of the child. I will avoid this airline.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,great helpers,"even the pilot helps out!!! i got off the plane last because i had a wheelchair..i was going to push it up the jetway myself but when the pilot saw this he immediately said you sit in the chair and i will push you up the jetway!!!! He said that's what we do here at Southwest! we all help out!!! and i say Thank You, sir!!!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Priced Great along with Great Service,Family of 4- Trip from PDX to LAX and it was flawless. Service was great. Chairs were surprisingly comfortable and felt I had adequate room (and I am a bigger gal). Overall it was great and cant find anything negative to say. :)
n/a,40,Southwest is great as always,"Southwest is great as always.   Crew was fabulous, we generally fly Southwest to and from Phoenix several times a year.  Our daughter is a college student.  The flight was bumpy but the crew didn't miss a beat.  Boarding was easy as well."
n/a,50,Unique experience,So this is my first time flying on this airline. I can defiantly say this was a unique experience. Everything from how you get seated based on how fast you check in on line. I do like the price and value you get. I really enjoy the drinks and snacks. Just not the potential for a whole family to not be seated together.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Hopping to Hopkins from Dallas on SW,"While I am a great fan of Southwest Airlines, and an A Lister, I am finding it harder to enjoy the trips when I now have to make connections for flights that, until recently, were direct.  My flight to Cleveland is usually 2 hours of uneventful air travel.  However, those direct flights are gone now, and the most recent trip was a hop and change of plane in Chicago on the way to Cleveland, and in St. Louis on the way home.  Making the trips over 4 hours each way.  I understand that part of this has to do with the Max aircraft issue, but it doesn't make it any better.  I usually fly SW because the Love Field Airport is smaller and easier to navigate, and the flights are comfortable and usually enjoyable.  But, I am finding myself opting to go with another airline recently, because of the non-stop flights offered. Hopefully, they can get back on track soon, and give us back more non-stop flights..."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Girls Trip,"Southwest had on time departure but was delayed 10 minutes on return.  Some of the flight attendants were not that friendly!They have improved the boarding proceed a little since I have last flown, boarding Families with small children & Military service persons to board after group A!  They were boarding them 1st!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest hits a home run again!,"Southwest Airlines is my favorite of all the major airlines. Having flown a number of the other airlines in the last dozen years or so, it's the most carefree of them all. Of course, I love the free baggage check, always seemed to be a slap in the face from the other airlines, when I'm having to come out of pocket for bags.The customer service, especially the telephone representatives, is always spot on. I recently extended my trip by 3 days and the rep told me my cost actually went DOWN, saving $30!All in all, a great airlines, run by very efficient, happy employees. I try to get a chance to get to know all the attendants, and most of them are long term employees, that says a lot about a company.Thanks for everything Southwest, you ROCK!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great airline,"Great flight, prompt, on-time, comfortable seating, and 2 suitcases for each passenger included. The service was great and the staff very professional"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Consistent,Southwest is always consistent on their service and punctuality.  Not having assigned seats sounds like it would be difficult but I think the plane loads faster than with assigned seats.  I am a senior with some disability so I am allowed to board after the first wave.  This helps me a great deal in getting settled in a seat.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent Service,"Souttwest offers relaible, consistent and dependable service on a regular basis.  Southwest is our airline of choice."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Southwest,  Great Economy,  but seats are uncomfortable",We flew to Vegas to meet friends and to take a road trip from there.Going out was ok. Coming back we were in the very back row.  My husband is 6 ft and 240.  He was sick and absolutely miserable. I will probably fly Southwest again for myself because of the price but he has vowed to fly nothing but business class from now on.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Outstanding service,"Recently, my entire office flew from Oklahoma City to San Diego for a business meeting. The Southwest staff was outstanding, the flights both ways were on time and well managed, and as always it was a pleasure flying SWA."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Service wrapped in humor,"From the departing gate to the arrival gate, Southwest never fails to provide excellent service, and their added humor makes air travel a little more fun."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent Flight,"I had not flown Southwest in many years as I usually fly Delta; however, the flight was excellent.  The boarding process was efficient.  I do prefer to have an assigned seat; however, I did think that the number driven line-up is much more efficient than other airlines where people jockey for position in the waiting area."
Date of travel: June 2017,30,Vegas Trip,"Flight to Vegas was good. We cut it a little close on our transfer in Denver but all was good. Flight from Vegas to Denver coming back was delayed, then delayed again, then canceled and we were put on a direct flight to Baltimore which was good. BUT we had to recheck in to the new flight. Since this was an existing flight boarding positions were already taken and we ended up being almost the last people on plane. There were 4 of us and we were all stuck in the middle of a row. Our seating positions had been great - at the beginning of the B section. We went to the counter and they had extra seats in business class but wanted $50 per person. We had sat by the computer and checked in exactly 24 hours to get great boarding positions and were not happy that we got stuck at the end after the plane change."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Hot Time In Burbank, CA","The Soutwest crew in Burbank were super profesional and got us safely back to Louisville.   The fires in CA were awful and many flights out of Burbank were postponed or cancelled, but our Soutwest team worked hard to make sure our flight was on time and was able to leave at all.   Hats off to the the entire Soutwest Team!!!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,A nice flight,"Took a nonstop flight with Southwest Airlines to Atlanta. It was on time, and the flight attendants were nice. The restroom was clean. I’ve always liked its 2 free bags policy and the boarding procedures. Its price is transparent."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"I was impressed, and didn't even expect it","I flew both to and from Las Vegas on flight Milwaukee-Las Vegas, and both times the fight was right on the money time-wise. I haven't flown Southwest before and didn't even think flight can be on time these days (both departure and arrival), since there are factors that airline cannot control - like a long queue waiting for takeoff. The leg room in the seats was also better than most of the airlines I flew in the near past. Small downsides include no free beverage like juice or soda (but they gave free coffee on the flight back), and another downside is lack of seat assignments - it's kind of free for all, first come first serve (except if you're in group C, not much is left when you board). But that is all small - compared with grand inconvenience I experienced when flying most of the time - this was so good that I will actually be seeking Southwest in the future, if available. The crew was also very cheerful and helpful."
n/a,50,Southwest rocks!,"We aways fly Southwest if possible.  In my experience,  flights are usually on time or at least very close. I haven't met a grumpy flight attendant yet. They go out of their way to help you. It will continue to be my first choice."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best Airline ,"Of course we all like our assigned seats and with Southwest , it doesn’t work that way. But the flight attendants are great, and today especially Calvin and the rest of the crew .. you have to love you can take two bags and never pay a change fee.    We travel a lot , but seriously this is our airline of choice ..."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Wish for a thin person in the middle,"The plane was nice, the wheel chair transfer person from the Des Moines flight to this one wasn't the most pleasant, but he got he got me there, the slot person in Las Vegas airport,  was lovely and so nice.....would have helped to win a bitI felt bad for he man of size in the middle.  He seemed to be uncomfortable, i do wish Southwest would have a location so you knew what you were going over as you flew.,, The attendants were nice, but no snacks at all on this flight......diabetics make sure you are prepared; My other 3 SW fights were smooth, this on bumpy in places but it got me there fine...."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Wheel chair escort was wonderful and lovely.....,"I can't say enough good things about the lady that was my wheel chair lady, she was lovely, a lady of color and so nice and helpful. I wish i had written down her name.The plane was nice, not totally cramped and did have a nice middle seat lady beside me........ Only one snack tossed out, but i had bought a fruit, cracker cheese meal and it was okay, I'm an insulin dependent diabetic so two snacks would have been nice....... employees were wonderful and the flight smooth."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,"Old plane, it was better next plane","I hadn't flown since 1989, and usually only United, but i had heard horror stories about how small planes were and cramped, this one fit the description, it was old and cramped and chipped, and I wasn't sure what I had gotten into, however the flight itself was smooth and the employees were very nice.  The wheelchair transfer in Phoenix was very nice but it was mentioned that a tip expected......."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,surprisingly nice,"The plane to Phoenix from Ontario was not nice at all, the flight was fine, but when I boarded this one it was an opposite experience, it seemed newer and actually nice with a tad bit more room..... very pleasant employees........There is no """"Food"""" but  the they did give pretzels and ritz crackers but i did buy a fruit and cheese dish in the airport that was very good."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Direct flight,Flight left on time and we boarded with No hangups. Also free baggage check-in was nice along with one carryon per person which also was great. Free app once you were in air.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Work trip to Phoenix,Southwest is and has been my airline of choice for many years.  Most of the places I travel they have more direct flights than other carriers.  This affords me more flexibility as well as reduced travel time. Not to mention no bag fees. Crews are always great very seldom if ever have a bad experience
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always A Pleasure,"Anytime I fly, I always try to book my flight with Southwest. Everyone are friendly, and you never know when a steward might entertain you with a song!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Quick flight,Flight arrived early and left on time. Luggage arrives quickly. We had an easy check in and flight crew was very friendly
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest Air is the best,"Southwest Airlines has never let us down.Great flight to Orlando and back.Clean, friendly free snack and drink.Bags fly free."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,A  Smooth Trip,Smooth easy flight. Both flights coming and going were on time. Empty seats so the plane was not packed and had room to spread out a bit.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Quick and efficient,"We always fly Southwest.  How can you beat 2 50 pound pieces of luggage free and 2 carry-on bags free!!!The seating system has been perfected to a T. If you check in right at 24 hours before your flight you’ll almost always get a place in the seating line in the “B”s!  Families with small children Board right after the A section.  Those in wheelchairs board first.Attendants are always courteous and friendly and are efficient in their delivery of drinks and small snacks.For the price, Southwest can’t be beat!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest for your next Mexico vacation,Southwest is always my airline of choice. The flight crew to and from Mexico were amazing. I always enjoy the service and conversations with them. When I go on vacation I usual look for destination with Southwest. So excited for my next vacation. Oh and thank you for adding Hawaii!!!
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Dislike cattle call boarding,Southwest ck in and boarding procedure is unpleasant. Surely does not expedite the boarding process. Would prefer to choose seat upon booking. Attendants not professionally dressed. Travelers bring oversized bags trying to stuff them in overhead. All bags that do not fit under seat should be checked. That in itself would expedite the boarding and deplaning process. Seats really tight space. Not our favorite airline.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight non-stop to Denver,"We flew non-stop from Cleveland to Denver.  Flight was on time, no issues, friendly staff.  Would use Southwest Airlines again for my next trip to Denver."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best Airline,"Great service! Free bags, free soda and snack. Easy check-in. Southwest will always be my first pick!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Weekend getaway,Flight was great. One of the flight attendants wasn't the most friendly. She was rude when we were trying to put our items away before landing.  After landing she didn't announce for those going to the next destination to remain seated.  The couple sitting in front of us was confused about whether they should get off. Overall I enjoyed my round trip flight and will definitely fly with Southwest in the future.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Flight problems,Flight was delayed by weather.  We arrived at farthest gate away from where we needed to make a connection.  They were not helpful to get us to our gate so we practically had to run.  Guess they would have held the plane but they didn't say anything.  Otherwise our flight was fine.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Reliable, clean, friendly staff, free luggage and good price","The only thing that I have never liked about Southwest is the unassigned seats concept, this works out if you board early. They now have an option in which I paid $25 each way in addition to my ticket and they automatically check you in 48 hours before the flight I believe vs 24 hours if your doing it manually so to speak. I was in A both times 26~ which meant that I would not be sitting in the front but I had my choice of seats about 30% into the plane. I don't bother sitting to far up front (unless it is First or Middle class) so it worked out fine. The airline is almost always on time, staff are always friendly and free luggage. They have usually a better rate that most and luggage comes out faster than with most airlines."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delay,"We enjoyed our flights, found boarding confusing though everyone seemed to take more bags than just the onboard type into the plane staff announced only 26 checked bags offered to check in more for free - so overhead lockers jammed full, boarding starts at a ends at c so c don’t get too many options as overheads full and seating is wherever u want, a 2 hr delay in Dallas with little to no announcements made it a long day but cheap flights so expect delays"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Crew has no manners,We are sitting here waiting on the 3rd shuttle back to our car because the crews of all the southwest airlines feel they are privileged enough and ganged up and cut in front of us in line not once but twice now.  We will never trust our lives to a bunch of people who cannot even follow the simplest of basic procedures.  Next time we will fly another company.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Easy and no problems,"I have only flown SouthWest for the last 20 years.  It is always easy going, the flight attendants are great and I'm glad I paid for the early check in because I wasn't in a place I could print my own boarding passes.  I love SouthWest!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Always a pleasure,"Crews are always friendly, personable, helpful and accommodating.Nice to have free bags.Snack are always fun."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Sry predictable service,"I changed to Southwest as my primary airline when I started my job 12 years ago as this was the company’s preference.   On time departures and arrivals are the norm, not the exception. I can change my flights without additional fees.   Legroom is predictable and consistent from front to back of the cabin.   Southwest flies to most destinations that I want.    No excessive fees when I need to occasionally check bags.  What’s not to like?   United, American, Delta can’t compare"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Wet contents,"The contents in all four of our bags ha wet contents. I observed that they sat on a baggage wagon in driving rain in Baltimore the second  leg of our trip. I notified Southwest Baggage but they chose not to do anything about it. I have flown Southwest since the early seventies both on business and pleasure and never had any problems, but I thought they should know of the circumstances around this complaint"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Nice workers, clean planes and fun!!","Southwest is an excellent, inexpensive , safe airline and has such good workers ...thorough; but fun!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Nice Fligth,Always a pleasure to fly with Southwest. The prices are reasonable and the flight crew is nice. We also like that you can watch movies on your own device during the trip.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good Flight,"Booked only a few days ahead and price was still very fair.  Paid for priority boarding to ensure we could sit together.  Leg room was comfortable.  We were on time with no problems.  Southwest only flys nonstop between Detroit and Las Vegas on Sat. or Sunday, otherwise you will have a stop or two."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,flew for for the price,"cost for two of was low but i do not care much to fly southwest,there no seat policy at one was not to bad but now they want you to pay $30.00 to try and get A board but the best you can get is B boarding then you find out how many seats are saved so head to the back of the plane,guess only thing good left is free check on bag"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Usually a good experience,"This is the only airline I use.  They are courteous. They allow 2 free checked bags and when there is a delay or problem they are apologetic and offer compensation.  As with all economy flights the seating is a bit crowded.  They do,  however,  let you know if a flight is fully booked or not.  The boarding process usually is a pretty smooth operation."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Needed a preboatd,We had a full plane but somehow there was enough time for us to have a drink and pretzels. The flight attendants had to hustle because the flight was only one hour. There was no turbulence. It was a short but sweet flight.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Ideal choice!,"Roundtrip to Boston for vacation...flawless trip!  Everything was on time, well staffed, friendly, no complaints!  2 free bags was perfect for an 11 day vacation!  Great rates, will definitely choose Southwest again!"
n/a,30,Change flight time without telling me,"I had a flight from Dallas to Austin scheduled for 6 am departure.   Checked in online at 4:20 am and got a seat assignment.   Was to the airport at 5:05 am and online pass doesn't work.  Got in line at security and told to go back to counter.  At counter, was told plane due to weather was combined with another flight and left at 5:30 or 30 minutes before scheduled time.  Had to fly standby for 7:15 am flight.   Didn't get cabin service either.  Not a good flight from a usually reliable airline."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Gets you there,"I like flying with Southwest Airlines. It’s easy to book a flight and I like the Early Bird Boarding. Their prices are fairly reasonable and Southwest runs great specials sometimes. Two bags checked is very nice, too! I feel like leg room is sacrificed, but those deals help me deal with the leg room situation. I do feel the planes certainly do need to be cleaned a bit more between flights, but then that might put the flight schedule in jeopardy!  Sometimes the flight attendants are friendly and sometimes they are not. They don’t dress as professionally as some other airlines, but if I can get a cheaper flight, I’m good with it. All in all Southwest is the airline I use the most because of their prices."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Flight to LAX,"The flight and crew were good. Customer service on the flight was excellent. The one thing that I was not impressed with is that seats are not assigned. I was traveling with a young person and we had to be separated during the flight due to being boarded in the last group. If you want to board in the early group, there are additional fees."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Airline with best available prices.,"We love using this airline because you can find/get get prices and you can change your flight due to cheaper prices at anytime you find a new one, just update."
n/a,50,My favorite airline,"We fly Southwest pretty much everywhere. Now sometimes we need to take another airline if we want to go to certain international destinations, but domestically and for some international, Southwest is our first choice. Not only do they have low prices, but they give you a carryon, personal item, and 2 checked bags for free. Need I say more??"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,My favorite airline,"by far the best airline, great service, costumer service. They take care of every detail from the baggage to the services provided in the app"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Consistently Decent,"I travel frequently for business and the majority of the time I fly Southwest. Flying is not a fun experience. The best one can hope for is for it to not be too hot and to have a nonstop flight that arrives safely and on time. This flight met those goals. The air flowed, we arrived safely and on time."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Classy and Respectful Flight Attendants (HOU - RDU),"3rd and final quick flight back home with Southwest... The entire Flight Attendant crew deserves an acknowledgment, a GOLD STAR!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Polite and Accommodating Female Flight Attendants (SAN - HOU),2nd time flying with Southwest on MY way back home... This time the experience was a positive one thanks to the customer service skills of their flight crew.
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Condescending Female Flight Attendants (HOU - SAN),"First time flying with Southwest on My way to California to visit family... The airline seating policy of a ""first come-first serve"" basis was not a positive experience. Especially having to interact with a RUDE and IMPOLITE flight crew."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest delivers again,"Nashville is the main carrier out of Nashville, where we live, so we use their charge card, garner lots of miles every year and fly a few times a year. Southwest maintains a consistent level of service and I truly appreciate that. Flights are usually on time, the personnel are professional and pleasant. On this trip our MAJOR surprise was LaGuardia. We were there a year and a half ago ad it was an aging zoo. This time when we exited the aircraft, we were greeted with a huge new, sparkling clean, beautiful terminal. We always do the priority (automatic) checkin so we get in the ""A"" boarding group and can therefore take our carry-ons."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight,"I love traveling with southwest airlines flights are comfortable, attendants funny and friendly.  the pilots da an excellent job especially take off and landing is so smooth."
n/a,50,Great as always!,"We love flying southwest for domestic flights. I recommend them to everyone due to the great service and cheap flighrs. Also they have a lot more leg room than some of the other carriers. There is always room for improvement though, please add a little more cushion to the seats! We are loyal SW customers and even have the chase Premier SW card. Thank you for always treating us well!"
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Inconsiderate Male Flight Attendant,Usually the flight attendants stand in a premium aisle seat while boarding. I usually ask if can have that seat when I get a B boarding class ticket and they generally have no issues. Well this time the male flight attendant refused to allow me to sit there and even told me I could take the middle seat in the aisle in front of him. He then gave up that seat to a C boarding class member. Shame on you for not obliging a loyal customer....this seat class system was designed by you Southwest and to have your attendants not oblige the customers who followed the rules is rude and goes against your policy.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,"flight was good, but delayed an hour","We got on the plane in time, they had us sitting and weaiting. then after about 40 minutes they said they were waiting for a couple people. then finally one person comes on... a southwest employee that was in uniform and wanted to catch a flight!!!! Unbelievable. They held up an entire plane for 50 minutes due to waiting for an employee to get a free flight? Just going by what they announced. The flight itself was good, they were offering some free drinks, but didn't offer all a free drink. Whats up with that? Some people I guess are more important than others? Not my favorite southwst flight, but they are still the best company to fly."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Round trip from New Orleans to San Diego,"Flights were on time, decent price, and with friendly service. Plus, I love that it was a nonstop flight"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Amuzing flight attendant!,Our flight attendant was so entertaining he even put a white knuckle flyer like me at ease. When youre laughing you can't be too nervous!
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Plenty of Flights Throughout the Day,"I take this flight about six times a year.  It is typically on-time or near on-time.  Both airports seem prone to weather issues, though I'd say I have had more weather delays in Dallas than Atlanta.  I prefer Love Field to DFW in Dallas and ATL is the only game in town for Atlanta.  Be prepared for a lot of fellow travelers as these flights are usually packed.  Get smart by familiarizing yourself with the boarding process employed by Southwest.  Personally, I almost always check my bags because it's free and it's easier."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Wonderful Airlines,"Southwest is a great airline because they are affordable, super friendly, and I love the way they board the plane- in order in which you checked in.  Each person is assigned a number upon check-in (can be done 24 hours in advance) and you line up and board the plane in the order, selecting your seat as you board.  The flight attendants have been friendly on every flight I've been on.  They have free in-flight movies and entertainment (on your personal device), but make sure you have the southwest app installed on your personal device in order to use this feature and bring your headphones so you don't bother others.  The flight was on time and smooth.  I enjoyed flying over the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam on this flight path.  The only complaint (in hopes that Southwest reads this) is that the pretzels are pretty bland and need more salt.  But, they are free, so I shouldn't complain.  I bring my own snacks."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,southwest airlines,Always friendly and willing to help. No charge for luggage which is a great bonus!!  East to navigate and offers a direct flight to denver
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Bags fly free!,Southwest Airlines is always a good airline.  We were fortunate that our two connecting flights (one to Sacramento and one from Sacramento) were not full so we had a little breathing room.  Good bang for your buck.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flight to Ft Myers Southwest Florida International Airport With My Final Destination Of Captiva Island,"The service from Indianapolis to Ft Myers and back to Indianapolis could not have been better. From the baggage being checked right where I was left for the flight to Ft Myers to the service in flight and the baggage pickup both going and coming, everything was handling in a very timely and professional manner. Southwest is the only airline I will use if they offer service to my destination."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight,Like always Southwest was awesome to fly. The flight attendants are always interesting and fun. The flight left early and was smooth all the way.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Round trip from OKC to Las Vegas,"My wife had flown Southwest before but this was my first time. I was impressed with the boarding procedure. We always do things as far in advance as possible so we had the A boarding passes. Along with a very reasonable fare and a direct flight. The flight was good, the flight attendants were good except for how they failed to handle a passenger seated one row ahead of us on the aisle who refused to put away her laptop on take off and again upon landing.  Her tray table and laptop in her lap the entire flight. It was as if the rules all the rest of us followed did not apply to her. My airline pilot son-in-law told us later she should have been removed from the plane but in this particular case, nothing was done. People who think they are entitled just piss us off."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Routinely on Time!,"Southwest is consistently on time with their departures  and if late, the passengers are informed.  Love the free 2 checked luggage and the no change fees.  Have not used any other airline in years."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Storms made us go the long way around,"Got to Louisville airport in plenty of time.  Wife has a boot on due to a broken leg.  Airport personnel were quick to get he in a wheelchair so that she wouldn't have to walk to the gate at the end of the concourse.  We also got to pre-board.  First flight went to Houston and storms in AR and LA caused us to be routed around them and the fight was 40 minutes late in Hobby.  Arrived at gate 21 and plane to Dallas was in gate 5 -a long way at Hobby.  Managed to make the connection, pre-boarded again and arrived safe and sound in Dallas.  All of the Southwest people were great.  On both legs the pilots managed to land the planes in such a way that they were able to use them again."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Losing faith in southwest,"I have flown many times with SW and lately it’s like the quality and consistency of the flight has gone downhill. I was flying back from Omaha, arrived at the airport at noon for my 7pm flight, sat around until 5 when they announced My flight was canceled, reason they stated to us was weather, sunny skies above us and sunny skies in Dallas. When I looked for a new flight there was nothing until noon the next day, and they don’t work with other airlines to make arrangements for a different flight like some other airlines do. Ended up renting a car and driving home 13 hours to get to a very important appointment."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Smooth and comfortable flight,"This has been the easiest flight I have ever taken it was very inexpensive.  the flight attendants were amazing and very accommodating with our little guy they never asked for us to give up the seat in order to keep the baby happy they were also constantly bringing snacks for the baby thank you so much. I only wish the Southwest travel to Europe and other countries, I will fly with them anytime."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Who am I sitting with?,"For years Southwest is number one with our family travels for staff friendliness, seat comfort, plane cleanliness and on time or better arrival. But, the airline believes that open seating is a great idea. On two flights in a week my family did not fly together. Leaving from Orlando they had a special boarding for families. What? Most of the plane was made up of this classification. I want to sit with my family. If pricing is the same I most likely fly Delta or American."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Smooth flight,"Southwest flight was one of the least expensive flights I have taken, and I travel a lot, 42 countries and counting, yet this flight so comfortable, caring, accommodating, flexible and pleasant. I only wish they had flights to Europe because I would use Southwest in a heart beat. If you’re traveling with children, you get to go first and the flight attendant was really nice and didn’t asked us to give up the seat we took for the baby, instead she brought snacks for our little guy. Thank you."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Non eventful flight, arrived on time","Was able to check a bag.  Check was easy and efficient.  Flight operated on time, which was important as I was meeting someone at the airport coming in from a different city.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  I upgraded for early check-in and recommend it.  Glad I don't drink, $8 for a beer is outrageous, but people must pay it.  It is great not being nickel and dime-ed for every amenity."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,PERFECT,"I do not like the fact that you cannot choose your seats ahead of time (I recently flew SWA with my young daughter and had to pay extra to ensure we sat together), but that wasn't an issue on this particular flight where I flew alone.  In any event, both legs of the flight were seamless.  Flights boarded EXACTLY on time, were uneventful, and landed on time.  Can't ask for more."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great service and price,"Typical great service and free 2 bag check.  Attendants were friendly and courteous.  We had a couple of soft drinks each and two snacks each.  No extra charge for either.  Ride was very smooth and less turbulence than usual, both directions, when crossing the Rocky Mtns.  Made for a boring flight in that regard which is always great."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Friendly and fast,The crew was friendly and attentive on this early morning flight. We started flying Southwest when we moved to Phoenix several years ago and have yet to be disappointed. The boarding process is quick and efficient and the planes are always clean and comfortable. This experience was no different.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellant,Excellant timing to get back home. It has many flight timings that i can choose from.I can always count on them for not delaying the flights. They are prompt and good service.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Poor service,"From the TSA gate greeter through customer relations the team was very much useless in resolving problems and in a couple of cases not able to perform their respective jobs. I was shocked , such poor service was coming from the airline with a heart. I remember when Southwest was different and the service was better. The customer used to come first, not anymore. If you have the need to have flexible flights pay attention to the fine print, it does cost substantial money."
n/a,50,"Fast, friendly, and 2 chck in luggages",The staffs were very friensly and helpful. The airplane was cold when onboarding and the staff explained it to the passengers. The flight was not delayed and arrived on time. 2 check in luggages is t e best part of southwest. It lets you have less carry on and more leg room.  I do not like the cookie much though. Also would be better to know the list of free beverage.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,It is what it is,"We used Southwest for our internal flight from San Fran to Vegas and what a pleasant experience it was. Check in at San Fran was uber quick and the service agent was amazing.​We didn't quite understand the lining up process when we first seen it in the departure lounge, but after asking some frequent flyers, we were soon on the same page. There was four in our party and we were told that we might not sit together as the seats are on a first come first served basis. This wasn't really a problem as the flight was only just over an hour long.​​The plane seemed to fill from the front to back, meaning the plane was empty at the rear when we got on, which was perfect. ​​Southwest offers a drinks service which to my surprise was free (soft drink only) and they even throw in a bag of pretzels. You don't get that on Ryanair!​​All in all, given the excellent customer service, the flight itself and the plane comfort, this was a really enjoyable flight and would defiantly use again."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Keep coming back for the great service,"Traveled with a friend to Orlando round trip last month. Inbound flight wasn't full (40-50 empty seats), but outbound was full. Plane was clean both ways, and inbound flight was 15 minutes early arrival. Outbound flight was on time. Service from both ground and plane crews were excellent.Prices aren't always the lowest, but I'll gladly pay more to fly them. It's a no frills major airline with great customer service. And TSA PreCheck helps immensely, especially when flying out of major airports like Orlando International."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Adventure for someone who has not flown with SW,"We were early for our flight so we grabbed a bite before the wait for our plane.  (Southwest only serves drinks, pretzels & chips).  I had been told on the phone that the gate rep would help with early boarding.  As soon as the rep came to the desk I asked her for assistance with early boarding.  She sent me to the ticket attendant who sent me back saying the rep had to reissue the ticket.  Finally got her to do that.  Everything else went well.  Flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early.  Coming back was a cinch.  Arrived on time."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Quick flight,The only thing that I didn't like about this trip was the attendants went row by row and cleaned  every row after passengers were let off. It was definitely a hold up on deplaning. It was definitely an inconvenience for me because I had no carry-on bags and I had people waiting on me.
Date of travel: November 2018,50,"Great service, friendly team and comfortable flying!","We must begin with the caveat that Southwest no longer flies into Mexico (with, perhaps, the exception of Cancun). So, for those seeking travel between Mexico and the US, sadly, Southwest is no longer an option. We would have given Southwest a five-plus star rating (in our review, of course); however, this decision by the corporation to snub Mexico really rubbed us the wrong way. Bad call, Mr. CEO!That said, from the customer service representatives to the website, check-in and gate staff to the flight crews, the people who work for and with Southwest deserve ten stars, in our view! We have flown Southwest as often as possible, over the past twenty years, and will continue to seek them out when not traveling to/from Mexico.We really favor the spontaneous inflight ""entertainment,"" as the flight crews sing, dance and kid their way through any trip, no matter the duration or destination. So many other carriers' crews act tired, disinterested (as if just going through the motions), or angry (yes...angry!). But, never Southwest. Everyone finds time for a bon mot, to flash a smile, to bring an extra snack... all this, and the flights are on time, comfortable and economical. No frills, yes. But, the customer service, excellent piloting and comfortable and spacious seating more than make up for being short on extras.Thank you, Southwest! Keep up the great service!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"On Time, Polite, and Easy Travel","Have not been on SW for ages. Now that they are in our local airport, it was refreshing to come back to them. No frills. No seat selection is a huge negative. I do not understand that.No hidden charges. No extra bag fees. Everyone we encountered going and returning were all very nice.One flight was on time. The other three landed slightly ahead of schedule.This is the first airplane trip we have taken that I can remember, where everything went well."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Smooth Sailing,"Our LIT-DCA flight went very smoothly.  We had some bad weather and a very good pilot!  The DCA-LIT flight had some mechanical problems which made us have to sit on the tarmack for an hour but once the mechanics were 100% sure than the plane was sound, we began our discent.  We did make the connecting flight with 7 minutes to spare.  Very pleased with Southwest!  We have never had any luggage problems and the onboard service has always been good."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Easy as can be...,"Took a flight on Southwest from Baltimore to Chicago Midway earlier this month.  Flight was a typical Southwest flight.   I had paid for the Early Bird check-in so I was in seating group A.   Finding a row of seats for myself and the two others joining me on this trip was not a problem.  Ended up around row 17-18 on a Boeing, basically just past the wings and middle exit row.Flight was efficient and quick.  No frills, definitely not first class but their fares are near impossible to beat!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Routine air travel,"Just another routine air travel experience with Southwest.  Flights left on time, with no issues.  The flight crew coming out of Las Vegas was very polite and helpful as we had high winds and a lot of turbulence.  Flight crew provided updates, etc. so we felt secure and taken care of during the flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always Exceptional,"Southwest is truly the best airline there is. All of the staff are always exceptionally friendly and helpful. The planes are always clean, the seats are comfortable, and the pretzels are delicious. You can sit wherever you feel like, as long as you check in exactly 24 hours before your flight departs, and get in one of the first boarding groups. Fares are always extremely reasonably priced. They usually get us to where we are going early, and if there is ever any delay of any kind, the offer their sincerest apologies to you. You get to check two free bags per person, so pack as much as you want!The flight from Columbus to Orlando is consistently just under two hours. It usually leaves from and arrives at the same few gates at both airports, which makes navigating both easier. Southwest also allows you to track the flight with their free wifi on your phone, so you can see where you are exactly, what speed the plane is flying at, what altitude you are at, how many miles you have traveled, how many more you have to go, etc-- it's a wonderful feature. The flight itself is usually pretty smooth and easy, barring any inclement weather-- only turns a couple of times when leaving and arriving at both airports. I could honestly go on and on about how much my family and I love Southwest-- they are truly the best, and we try to not fly with any other airline as much as we can!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Gets the job done.,"We jumped on the chance to get a free companion pass towards 2 non stop tickets to Maui. If you know Southwest, they are pretty much a “no frills” deal. An overall nice experience, but if money allows and it’s a special occasion go first class on Hawaiian or United, etc. It is a 5 hour flight, after all ;) Otherwise... I recommend!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Las Vegas Business trip,"I do not usually fly Southwest so was unaware that the bulkhead row in the front of the plane does not include a tray for the seat. I was planning on getting some work done on the 5 hour flight from Tampa to Las Vegas but that was impossible on the flight. The service was okay, they did provide a snack selection several times during the flight. I only booked this flight as they are the only airline with a nonstop between Tampa and Las Vegas but the nonstop convenience did not compensate for the lack of amenities . Probably will not book this flight again."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Flight,We were traveling with another couple and we had no delays and we landed on timeThis is great customer service they is why I always fly Southwest
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Continued good scheduling and timeliness,"Southwest continues to provide great servicer at a reasonable price.  This flight was from Indy to Fort Lauderdale and then on to Aruba.  The flights were on time and there was just enough time to allow us a little relaxation before catching the connection.  The flight attendants were professional, personable and courteous."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Pleasantly surprised,"I was a little apprehensive about flying SW Airlines with their “Wanna Get Away” rate and not having an assigned seat.  I was prepared for the worst, but actually had a very pleasant experience on both flights!  The airline was organized and on time.  On the way to Las Vegas I was in the “C” boarding section and did have to sit in a middle seat, but I expected that.  On the way home, I was in the “B” section and sat in the front row, middle seat, and I felt like there was more than adequate room.  I also love that you can take a bag and a carry on at no extra charge!Overall, the staff was friendly, the flight was on time and there was no issue with seating!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,2019 Trip to Aruba,Great flight. On time both going and return. Staff was friendly and helpful. The flight from FLL to Aruba was 3 hours but went by quickly.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,"Re-routing nightmare, both ways","We were supposed to go from Orlando to Houston to Salt Lake City.  Instead, we were routed. From Orlando to Buffalo, then to Chicago Midway, Houston then Salt Lake City.On the way back we were routed from Salt Lake City to Burbank CA (1.5 hrs in opposite direction) to somewhere else, then to Houston and on to Orlando.  The airline said it is because one type of aircraft (737?) is grounded and they are attempting to accommodate travelers.  The holidays will be horrific."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,On Time,"I hate to fly, but this flight was almost relaxing.  We left 15 minutes late, but arrived 5 minutes early.  Friendly pilot and flight attendants.  I always check with Southwest first when I have to travel."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Timely and a friendly crew.,"If there’s a problem, it’s that there are so few non-stop flights, often at the worst of times. But that said, Southwest is our go-to airline. The crew is friendly and barring the unforeseen problem, they run on time."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Drama-Free Flight,"Southwest flights are uniformly hassle-free, with smooth and courteous baggage check  and boarding plans. My only complaint was the cramped quarters in this 767 and a seat belt that I almost could not fasten (had no trouble on the flight TO Chicago). Otherwise, fine all around."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Good flights, nonstop","The flights were on time and crew was fairly friendly. Not much turbulence and we get free WiFi and movies, so makes the 4 plus hour flight more bearable and entertaining. Would have liked some more snack options. All carbs and peanuts. I know it’s easy, but I cannot have wheat or peanuts. Same problem on all airlines."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Performed Wedding Ceremony in Flight!!!,"Best flight attendants ever! Kept our drinks full for our entire wedding party. We were all headed down to Cancun for our wedding, and they made crowns for us out of pretzels and a veil out of a trash bag. They even made us get up front and say our vows for everyone. At the end of the flight they held a lottery for anyone that wanted to put a $1 in the bag with their seat number. Best flight I've ever had. Thanks Isla, Jennifer and Don."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Comfort, Prompt Professional Service, on time flights, not cheap but reasonably priced.",Comfort and service with smiles; but must take 1-stop flights sometimes. Non-stop not always available. My favorite airline when non-stop service is available for my trip. I have flown them for decades and remain an admirer of their business model and its people. They are the best in the business. They used to be among the lowest cost airlines in USA but in recent times they are mid-range priced and cost more than no-frills no services airlines like Spirit and Allegiant.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best Overall Airline,I overall love Southwest especially comparing them to other airlines.  Overall the staff way better than any other United States airline. Friendly and energetic.  I love that economy  is the only way they fly and how you can pay an extra $20 to board early to get a more chosen seat.. I also like how I can change flights without a fee and no baggage fees.  Customer service is superior to all United states airlines.  I have only encountered one bad apple at Southwest and he was at Dallas Love field and worked at the outside baggage check in.
n/a,40,friendly and affordable,"our pilot on the way up was great. our trip had 0 delays. southwest does have tight seatimg. our pilot on way back, as well as his staff was funny. I did suffer an ear ache and clogged ears for awhile after we landed back home from our flight back. they always have fresh snacks."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"delayed flight, nice flight attendants","Fight was delayed about 40 minutes.  Equipment: Boeing 737-700, older, average cleanliness Boarding: normal, orderly boarding Service: flight attendants were friendly and provided good service"
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Energetic crew. Soiled interior. Hot plane.,"Plane: 737-800. Some of the seats were showing signs of wear and tear with loose threads hanging off.  Boarding: orderly boarding in the usual SW manner. Had a decent position in the A group.  Service: Flight attendants were Temperature: The on-board temperature was too warm, and the air vents were not providing adequate ventilation. Rather uncomfortable flight in business attire. If I had been wearing shorts and flip-flops, the temperature would have been fine. But as it stands, it was uncomfortable.  Interior cleanliness: below average. Much dirt/stains on the ceiling. The air vents were all ringed with grime and dirt. The ceiling was stained. Seat backs/tray tables were dirty. Simply dirty. I’ve been on flights in many third world countries with far cleaner interiors. As an aside, my round trip ticket was over $900 from Austin to San Diego. So why can’t SW clean its airplanes?"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,short hop with no drink service,"Boarding: orderly boarding in the usual SW manner For some unknown reason, we didn’t have drink service on this very short flight. Weather was the stated reason but the flight was smooth as silk with zero turbulence. I think the crew was tired and needed a break on this flight.  Flight was not full and there were plenty of open middle seats.  Interior was cleaner than usual for a SW flight- no trash on floor."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Flight delay and dirty plane,"Had a 3 hour delay departing which was weather related due to storms where the plane had originated in the morning. I hate flight #166 because it’s always crowded and the plane is generally filthy. This flight was no different. The plane was absolutely dirty.  Flight attendants were exhausted but still worked hard. I must say SW flight attendants are generally gems, and on this flight they provided very good service. And they gave me a free drink on this flight! So kudos to SW."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Cleaner than average plane and on-time,"Orderly boarding, nothing out of the ordinary  Plane: newer 737-800, much cleaner than most SW planes Service: Good flight attendants. Offered second round of drinks and snacks.  Overall a good flight. Departed and arrived on time."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Good flight,Flight was on time and no issues. I was able to get the one exit row with two seats for myself and my wife.  Didn't have to share a seat with a third person.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,LOVE SOUTHWEST CREW ❤️❤️❤️,Shoutout to the wonderful Kia for finding my Kindle on one aircraft & swiftly (like 30 mins later) returning it to me on the next one. I’ve done 5 Southwest flights on my recent USA & Mexican jaunts and I cannot tell you how brilliant they are! Also big thanks to Justine (Seychelles girl) who moved mountains to accomodate my chocolate cravings on the Puerto Vallarta to Oakland flight Thurs 17 Oct 2019. Justine is also a Liverpool FC fan so she’s a corker too ❤️❤️❤️
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Good flight!,Southwest does a great job getting their flights to leave on time. Flight crew was great! Arrived in Orlando a little earlier than was expected. That’s always a good thing!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Fly Mke to ban. 1.5 hrs going and 1hr and 3 mins on return. Yes they have much humor. Only served pretzels.,Every thing was great. They do have humor. Only served pretzels. All on time. Really fast talking guy on safety instructions but then you have heard all this before
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Flight was good--paid for early bird boarding!,Not having assigned seats is a bit daunting to me-but I paid for early bird boarding and was in the A class for seating.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Trip,Trip to a vacation in Alabama. Great flight. Good connection. They always have the best deals and flights.Crew is always amazing.Thanks to SWA!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Smooth Flight,"My recent flight to Orlando was wonderful! Even though it was at the crack of dawn 😩😩 the flight was smooth and easy. Now with the updated app, I was able to watch Little & Detective Pikachu to enjoy the flight. The flight attendants are always nice as well. This is why I’ll continue to use southwest, they haven’t let me down yet 🤗😁"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Las Vegas flight was great,Great airline. No checked baggage fee. On time. Wish they offered nonstop flights from RSW to LAS. We stopped in Chicago with only an hour layover. Worked out perfect both ways. Flights were on time. Crew was pleasant and accommodating. Great flight as expected. Non stop would be great. Hopefully soon. Would fly again with Southwest. Fun experience. No worries.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Always try to fly Southwest,"We try to fly Southwest when we can. Nice customer service, always. Almost always on time and I like their ticket change policy. Things come up! I am disappointed that they have increased the price for the early bird option."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Wedding for Family,"The overall flight was not a bad one. It was at full capacity and was delayed. When I got to Atlanta for my connection, the next flight was there waiting for me and the rest of the people who needed to board the plane for our final destination. Not having to wait for hours or getting rerouted to another flight made my travel a good one. I had family members coming in that day as well and I needed to be there on time or close to my original arrival time so I could get picked up and not have to wait in the airport for hours until the next family member showed up at the airport with a vehicle."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good Flights,"The flights were great overall, the staff on all the flights were wonderful and polite and courteous.  The only negative is when flying with your spouse or anyone because of the way seating is you don't always get to sit together and that happened with my husband and I on both of our return flights, we got separated and it would have been nice to enjoy the 2 hour flight together.  We knew going in this was a possibility, but we thought since we did the 24 hour check in we would have a better chance to sit together but not the case.  Not saying we wouldn't fly Southwest again, just something to think about when flying with your spouse or family."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Damaged Luggage,"Employees were seen throwing bags onto the conveyor belt at the baggage check in at Boston Logan airport including my two pieces.  Upon arriving in Nashville, I noticed one of the wheels was broken wheeling it out of BNA.  I called 5 days later to report it since I  like most people are busy and have lots to do in their lives.  I was told by an agent in baggage at SW in BNA that I have 4 hours to report the damage after landing.  First, my flight landed at 10:45pm and by the time I got home I went to bed to get up for work the following morning.  My wife did not unpack her suitcase the next day, she did approximately 1.5 days after arriving back home.  Besides the broken wheel, there were several broken plastic pieces within the interior of the suitcase.  Basically I was out of luck I was told.  If I had called within 4 hours, that would have been 2:45am which I'm sure nobody would have picked up if I called.  I'm certain I would have been screwed no matter what.  Worst customer service.  I have many choices when flying and I will be sure that I don't fly SW again(this was my first time with this airline).  I will be flying Delta from here on out as I have never had any problems with their service.  In addition to this, the seats were uncomfortable which hurt my lower back for a good day after flying to Boston and back to Nashville.  There is no leg room especially for a guy like me who is 6'3"".  I didn't like there weren't assigned seating as I was one of the last to board and almost had to sit with somebody else besides my wife. The flight attendants I encountered were pleasant - that was the only positive experience with SW."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,flight was on time and no problems,checked in on my phone downloaded my boarding pass very easy to do  picked the seat I like any where on the plane  left on time and landed early
Date of travel: September 2019,50,No unwanted surprises.,Checking bags is a breeze - I appreciate 2 bags fly free. Friendly staff everywhere and boarding is quick and orderly. I wouldn't chose to fly with any other airline.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Florida flight,"I was traveling with a handicapped relative.  Southwest did a wonderful job getting us to the plane through security and to the gate.  Upon arrival, we had the same great service.  The fight attendants were very pleasant and helpful."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Direct flight would be perfect if it was later,The flight going to las vegas and coming home was great the only wish would be mid morning to early afternoon flight would be perfect. I been using southwest for at least 10 years and I dont have anything bad to say about southwest airlines except cheaper flights because my first round trip flight vegas to buffalo was 177 dollars round trip and last flight was close to 500 dollars round trip.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent customer service ,"Southwest allows two bags to be checked free and they also offer amazing fare prices! They always go above and beyond to provide excellent customer service.On our most recent flight, the captain, John, went through the plane introducing himself and co-pilot, Will. He proceeded to ask how everybody was doing. Just an example how friendly and appreciative Southwest Airlines. Highly recommended airline!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Flight,I love flying Southwest when I can. I can say I have never had a problem with them directly. My flight to Mexico was on time and without any problems.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Southwest to San Juan, Puerto Rico!!!!!",I want to thank the crew from Flight 428 going from MDW to SJU on 10.10.19.  Their service was exceptional however Brian went over the top.  Brian made sure to interact with everyone in an upbeat positive manner. Just by looking around and seeing other passengers you can tell they were happy with the service.  Hope I see Brian again on a future flight.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,We Like Southwest for Travel In California!,"Southwest is always great from the Bay Area airports to the Southern California airports.  They are fast, efficient and not expensive.  Bags fly free and the employees are always polite and humorous.  Congrats to Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Orlando Southwest experience,The security experience was not good.  Southwest has its own security section and it's really something else.  Both my sister and I and a young man in front of us had to have our carryon bags hand checked after going thru the machine.  This was happening in the line we were in but other lines were moving quite fast.  I think the person who kept pulling carryon out to hand check was new and being to cautious.  I guess that's good but very time consuming.  All in all we had gotten there with time to spare so we didn't miss our flights.  If you're late you might have been left behind.  Always give yourself time for long lines.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great staff!!,The flight I was on from Buffalo to Baltimore was a sold out flight complete with several families with young children. The crew was wonderful and helped everyone find a spot for their carry one and kept it all organized. There was no fussing or no major issues. A very pleasant flight!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,The Only Choice,"In the past 10+ years I have only flown an airline other than Southwest once. Only because I was meeting friends for a cruise out of Miami. The ease of booking a flight, the transparent fares - you know exactly what you are paying, none of the nonsense with separate baggage fees, seat selection, etc. - is what I want. And on a rare occasion when I had to change my flight it could not have been easier. As others have noted I also get the early bird check in every time. Sorry the price has gone up but it won't stop me from purchasing. I hope when the issues with the 737 jets are resolved that they will begin offering non stop service to Las Vegas. I am happiest when I only have to take one flight to my destination. Lastly my flights are also on time and sometimes early. Keep up the good work."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight,Staff at southwest is always friendly and do an amazing job.  I always try to fly southwest if possible.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Very good airline to fly,On time flights. Decent amount of leg room and comfortable seats. Good price and great customer service. Best is that 2 bags fly free.
n/a,50,Always the best deal,We always end up flying with southwest because they always have the best deal the fact each person is allowed 2 checked bags and a carry on is very impressive no extra charge! Their prices cant ne beat not when you add on the extra charges for bags on other airlines!
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Southwest to Dallas,What a Quick and easy way to Dallas. The airline gate was close to the exit and rental car shuttles. I always use Southwest for that main reason.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Stl couple going to Atlanta,Flight was very good took off a couple of minutes late due to the fact it was a full plane but no problem we actually got to Atlanta earlier than scheduled crew was excellent and landing was perfect
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Airline with excellent customer service!,"Love Southwest! Great flight and great customer service! Love the early bird option, I always get this when flying on long flights so I can sit where I am more comfortable."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,RT Washington DC nonstop Return was 1 stop at Midway Chicago No Problems,Found a great Price on SW. Flew non-stop there and one stop at Midway Chicago on return flight. Flights were on time with no delays. Midway is much better to fly through than O'Hare. I would choose that route again.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Very nice trip,"We have flown Southwest over the years and have had very good experiences. For this reason, if there is an option to fly SWA between destinations, this is the first airline we choose."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,RM Live,"As always, Southwest is our number one choice for flying.  Great prices, on time service and very friendly staff!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,I wish Southwest flew out of my airport,"Other than a little learning curve on their app, my experience was all positive.  From the free bag fee to the way they board without seat assignments makes things easier.  I have recently flown american and I can tell you that I had more room in the southwest plane and the flight attendants were more pleasant. If I had an opportunity to fly southwest more I would, the closest place I can catch one is 3 hours away."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Awesome airline  In the business,All i can just say this airlines i by far the best overall which i really love it when you don't have to pay for luggage like every other airline does  which is a ripoff so I'll never fly any other Airline but Southwest customer service is first Class hands down
n/a,40,Delayed again,"Well I had high hopes for the return trip, but upon reaching the airport found out the flight was delayed 10 minutes. Not too bad, but 10 went 20 and then 30. With a gate change and delay boarding the 30 turned into an hour by the time we departed. There was no explanation to why they were running late. The flight itself was smooth and  inflight service was fine with entertainment to pass the time."
n/a,40,Good Flight Good Service,"I generally avoid SW as the boarding process is generally onerous, and many non frequent flyers make a frequent flyer shake their heads.I paid for the special boarding privedlege, on top of my ticket. Boarding went very smooth in the A boarding group. Since my trip involved business stay downtown St. Louis, followed by work on my sons home, I had two suitcases. I almost never check baggage, but SW's 2 free checked bag saved the day on this trip. On arrival in STL my baggage was ready by the time I got to the baggage area..Great!SW having there own terminal in ST.Louis helps moving in and out of the airport.Return trip was much delayed leaving St. Louis, SW blamed it on Atlanta air traffic control..truth was we took off on a rush hour flight 45 minutes late, and 40 empty seats...any frequent flyer can tell you we were being held at the gate, because of late flights were needed to fill the aircraft..DUH!Still a overall good round trip. I was pleased overall."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best airline,Because I'm disabled it's hard for me to travel. I'd almost given up I'm trying because I've had bad experiences with several other airlines. I'm an independent person and like to travel but when you're made to feel uncomfortable you don't want to do it. Southwest change that! Now I travel whenever I can! Because of the care of Southwest employees and staff I no longer worry about traveling by myself. I don't feel like I'm alone because the staff makes me feel like they're the right there with me through everything. Thank you South West
Date of travel: October 2019,50,DENVER,"The flight was on time, crew was excellent. Very comfortable flight, boarding was orderly and on time. Plenty of help at check in."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Great flight,"This flight was very good. The flight attendants were very kind and helpful and the pilot was, absolutely, hilarious. We laughed so hard when we landed in KC! I flew from KC to Nashville after that and I was impressed with our pilots ability to keep our plane even with all of the wind we were experiencing! Some of the people had some issues keeping their food down when we were landing there, but have no fear.....I passed out gum when we landed! Lol. All in all I loved flying Southwest. 😃"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Nonstop flight,"Nonstop flight, very uneventful. Smooth flight. Crew was very helpful, professional and polite. Highly recommend."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Our trip to Atlanta,Our flight on Southwest flight to Atlanta was great. An on time departure and arrival. Service was good
Date of travel: October 2019,40,NICE TRIP FOR YOUR BUCK,"Non stop flight is the best. If you travel frequently, non stop is the way to go. Best buy for your money hands down. Flights are usually on time. Would recommend to everyone!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight as usual,"Usual great Southwest value - free bag, snack and beverage and funny flight attendants. no entertainment but no problem."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Flying sw,Both flights were on time my only issue with Southwest is n lack of being able to have a seat.  They should  switch to having assailed seats.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always outstanding,Southwest is always my airline of choice. Their customer service is outstanding and no one can beat their pricing. I left an iPad in the pocket on the plane and the baggage staff were extremely helpful for me to get it back.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best on-time service and no baggage fees,Love to fly Southwest whenever I can.  Wish they had more direct flights between Punta Cana and Houston!
Date of travel: October 2019,40,On Time,This was a great flight.  I flew from Detroit to Baltimore where I stayed on the plane.  We left Baltimore and landed our final destination in Windsor Locks Connecticut.  I would recommend this flight.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,smooth sailing,"Smooth flight, with about the perfect time to watch one of those free SW movies and get a bit of shuteye. Excited for the SW new flight opening up to Cozumel!"
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Very late Departure time,"This flight was very, very late in departing Houston, almost 40 minutes late. Seems it arrived from the Caribbean and there was a hold up in paperwork.  Never heard of such, but that is what we were told.  My question is if it came in from out of the country, why was it not at the international terminal, instead of one of the domestic gates. And we were of course late arriving in Memphis, our destination, after a long, long day of travel from the West Coast."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Departed On Time & Arrived On Time,"Flight departed on time and arrived on time, that is all I ask of an airline.  At least Southwest will give you all the snacks you want and soft drinks.We always pay for Priority Boarding as this will allow you more seat choices.  About a three hour flight.  Not too bad."
n/a,50,flight 33 great flight,"We had a great flight with special recognition of Elaine the SW flight attendant. Her announcements, speaking voice and enthusiasm was terrific. She was very friendly and attentive. It was evident she loved her job and the company!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great 50th Wedding Anniversary Flight,We went on a cruise and when the crew found out we were on our 50th Wedding Anniversay trip they were above and beyond helping us celebrate.  They were very clever and made us a toilet roll cake with candles and big ole red lips from a pretzel pak bag.  It was almost like a party and it was great!!!   We went to and from New Oreans for our cruise that was a given to us by our children and both flights were wonderful for the the airport and on the plane.  Thanks for making it so wonderfu!!!!
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Seattle to Phoenix nonstop,I was not TSA precheck. The line for security was at least 300 people. If you are flying out of this airport be sure and get to the airport at least 2 hours in advance. Southwest is a good airline. They offer to check you in for a few. This gives allows you to be in the A group for boarding and better seat selection.This fee is offset by no baggage fee for 2 bags feee. This check in process makes for worry free traveling.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,The Best Airline,"I fly from Reno to Phoenix every three weeks for cancer treatments. I have been on approximately 90 flights with Southwest over the past 1 1/2 years and am an A-Lister. I enjoy the humor the flight staff uses to ease the drugery to flying, it still does not make the over crowded seats any better but what are you going to do. I fly Southwest anywhere I go, especially many trips to Mexico. Southwest is my airline."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Another good flight on Southwet,"Our flight was a little late in taking off due to it being full, but we ended up landing early  The flight was a little bumpy in places, but the crew handled it well.  The fare was very reasonable.   This is our favorite airline for going to Florida from NH.  Would be nice to have more seat room, but the fare does help off set the comfort, and it only took 3 hours."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest did not disappoint.,"Southwest was great! Easy check-in, on-time, quick boarding, clean, and snacks. Leg room was bad but I believe it’s that way on most airlines in economy seating."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Returning to STL from SAN,Once again-I was on a crowed plane-Not a single empty seat. Our hostess was gracious and efficient: not qualities in abundance these days; especially when travelling!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Excellent hostesses on  two completely filled flights,"Pleasant experience on a crowded, hours long flight. Our hostess was gracious and super efficient. Qualities not in abundance want supply these days."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Reliable,"We choose to fly Southwest whenever we travel, especially to the Orlando area.  Service is dependable and timely.   Staff and crew are friendly and professional.   It is no stress traveling!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent flight,"Our flight had a one hour layover in Denver.  From the time that we checked in in Ontario to the time we left in Atlanta, the staff and service were excellent.  The attendants at the counter to check in our luggage were very friendly and welcoming.  The flight attendants were attentive and caring.  The flight was very pleasant with no surprises.  We arrived early, rested a bit in Denver, and boarded with no rush for Atlanta.  I so appreciate the care and attentiveness of all the staff."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Boston to Boise on time despite storm,"My two flights segments were both on time, In fact early arrivals despite stormy weather in Boston.  Two bags flew free."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Not Attentive,"A bit stressful on recent return from Laguardia.  There was a gate change (it happens), but we it was not announced.  No text message. Our boarding passes printed an hour or so before boarding showed the origional gate.  We wait in the AMEX lounge, so if there waas an announcement in the boarding area, we wouldn't hear it. I paid extra for Early Bird boarding. We arrived at the origional gate on time. We only were notified of the change when our names were call, after all were on board except a few of us.  We weren't the only ones to miss the change.  Be careful since the lack of frills and reservations on this airline requires vigilence.  I might add there were no pretzels served on this 21/2 hour flight, but they are usually satle anyway. BYO."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Girls trip,Believe it or not...the flight was on time.  This is not the usual case when flying these days.  I do not travel with anything that has to go in the overhead storage anymore so my case fit easily under the seat.  Love the two free bags.  I had purchase wine in Napa and was able to check that as my second suitcase.  I had already purchased an appropriate shipping box in Napa for $6 so it was economical to bring the wine home with me.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,"Love Service , Staff","This airline still rates very high with me due to the super friendly & funny pilots, stewards, check in personnel and the flexible rules if you have to cancel that allows for a credit on future flights. It is a small inconvenience to not have an actual seat assignment, but they board by groups based on check in time, etc and it seems , for the most par, to work out. They have competitive fares and always an airline I look at when considering a trip."
Date of travel: September 2019,20,Coldest Flight I've ever Been on in 45 Years of Traveling,"Although retired now, I flew extensively during my business career.  I am prone to be warm more often than cold, and typically like having the temperature somewhat cool....but this was ridiculous.  On a flight to sunny southern California where the temperature was 100 degrees, all the passengers were putting on sweatshirts, hoodies, and any clothes they could find.  My wife's hands and feet literally turned blue.  The stewardess claimed the center area of a 737 aircraft is always colder than the remainder of the plane.  I never heard that before.  In addition, the snack and beverage service was spotty and inconsistent.  I would be hesitant to fly Southwest again on a long haul flight no matter what the price."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,"Early bird check in, checked out","After we have booked several flights with SW and have always purchase early bird, we’ve noticed that our boarding gets pushed further behind. Now we are in B boarding. That’s not early bird. It’s a scam to get even more money out of us."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Gotta LOVE SouthWest !!!,Had 4 flights....round-trip from Tampa to Albuquerque.  Each flight on-time OR early.Great crews.....bags free of course and no delays etc.  IF you can adjust to their boarding/seating process....WHY fly anyone else ?
Date of travel: October 2019,50,smooth sailing,As Always Southwest rates high in my book. Always friendly - Sometimes little crowded but the price is great.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,As always the flight from KC to Las Vegas was great!,The annual flight on Southwest from KC to Vegas was easily booked and went off without a hitch. The crew was friendly and informative and the 3 hour flight felt like half that. I highly recommend SW airlines.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,THE BEST AIRLINE,"I LOVE Southwest!  I just wish their service could have continued here in Bloomington, IL - because I have to drive to Chicago to fly on them.  But they seem to be the ONLY airline that you don’t have “add on” fees.  Two FREE pieces of luggage per passenger.  Easiest airline that I know where you can easily change or cancel your flight and keep the credit (if cancelling) for another time.  I highly recommend SOUTHWEST because the ease of dealing with them.  No hidden costs - you know what you’re paying w/o worrying about extras."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,southwest vacation package,"We always fly southwest. Friendly stewards, comfortable flight. First time booking through their vacation packages. Will definitely book again through the package deals"
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Flight canceled,"We recently were flying back from Indianapolis and our flight was cancelled last minute. We were scheduled to fly straight through and after cancelling our flight of 3 1/2 hours with a boarding number of A16 our new flight was 9 hours, 2 additional stops and boarding number of C52. We weren't compensated in any way. Because of the new flight I missed picking up my grandchildren which were coming to stay for a few days. I expected Southwest Airlines to give us points or some sort of compensation but we were not even given a reason for the cancellation. I was told there was nothing that could be done. From now on I will pay a few dollars more for an asigned seat on another airline."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,I always fly Southwest,We always fly Southwest.  They are friendly and we never have any trouble.  I have much more leg room than in some other airlines...I prefer a stopover than a long flight...so we usually fly from Providence to BWI and from there to wherever we are going.
n/a,40,Late again,"I don't know what it is about the route, but when I take this flight it is pretty much late most of the time.  The flight itself was great smooth hardly any turbulence. The seats look like they were recently redone and we're firm and comfortable.  Otherwise an enjoyable flight..."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"No frills, but decent","We went to PA to visit friends and to go to a family wedding. We've flown on Southwest before and I was concerned with getting stuck in a middle seat (I tend to get a bit claustrophobic), I'm tall and need legroom, and I tend to also get up a lot to stretch and use the facilities. For EXTRA money, which we paid, we got Early Bird boarding, meaning we were in the A section to board, in the larger numbers, 45-60. That was nice as we got good seats like we wanted!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Never a bad experience,"I've been flying Southwest for a couple years and I have never experienced any difficulties.  The crew is professional, pleasant, fun &  accommodating.  Usually there are passengers that can be demanding or rude & I've never seen any crew member loose their temper.  The flights are always on time and my flights have arrived early. General condition of airplane is always clean.  I like to get off last and it's nice to see not only the crew picking up but the pilots as well.  I love flying Southwest..!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Still prefer Southwest for lots of reasons,"Heading to Tucson from Greenville SC, Not an easy or direct trip for a reasonable price so opted to fly into PHX and drive.  The price was nearly $200 less and the travel time was very quick.  Generally I check a bag but this time did carryon and no hassles with overhead space.  Also didn't do early bird check in since I was the only one traveling.  Got low B numbers and sat in aisle seats for all segments.  Lots of nice snacks and attentive attendants.  Good movies and TV shows for free.  Everything was on time. I will repeat in the spring."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,LAS to RSW Required Two Stops Before Reaching Destination,"For a 2106 mile trip, anything more than a one stop-over is too much. Unfortunately non-stop flights with Southwest are becoming as rare as hens teeth. We left Las Vegas at 6:45AM and didn't arrive to Ft. Myers till 7:50PM which amounted to over a ten hour flight. Good thing we didn't have children with us...are we there yet??"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,I don't like the pick your seat at boarding policy,"I hadn't flown on this airline before so I didn't realize we would be lined up by category and no one would organize the seating! My husband and I were together and there were no direct flights so on 1/2 of them we sat apart. Couples each strategically took the window and aisle leaving the middle open, bargaining that no one would take the middle. On full flights they lost. The resulting hodgepodge was inefficient and an unnecessary hassle. As if air travel isn't stressful enough!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Full flight,"All our flights were full.  We paid for business class, so we were able to get on first.  The servers were amazing.  I got a little sick and the stewardess was right there to help without having to ask.  Flights were all on time."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Lovely,Always reliable and leave on time. Easy boarding method. Love there policy of 2 free checked bags. They still serve you a complimentary beverage and snack. Very professional staff from start to finish.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,layover was o okay!!,"we had a trip from lax to okc with a layover in Denver. we thought it would be a drag for such a long layover, but it turned out to be a  more than adequate time to get a meal and relax before our next flight. we were glad for the time and it gave us prepare for our next leg of our journey."
n/a,50,Trip to Chicago train station.,By going through Midway airport youon can get a commuter train to the train station. You can depend on Southwest to get you there on time. A little confusion on which elevator gets you to the right track but other than that great.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"ON time service, is great.","For at least 15 years now i have been flying Southwest Airlines. I am happy with their usually on time service. I use them primarily to get to California and avoid LAX. SW Flys into both into Burbank and John Wayne ( Santa Ana, CA.) its so easy I don’t mind a bit extra cost and the fact  that from home ( Minneapolis, MN. ) i have transfers in Denver or Phoenix. Give it a try."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwestern Rocks,"We have flown Southwestern several times and it has always been great service, great flight, and easy to deal with."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Always Easy and Reliable,"We live out west (CA) so Southwest goes nearly everywhere we need to go. We've also taken it back east and to the Caribbean. (Next stop Hawaii.)As long as you remember to check in 24-hrs prior to your flight, so get a decent board position, SW is almost always on time, reliable, and a comfortable flight. We use SW from almost all our domestic travel."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Packed in tight!,"Very crowded flight, I sat in tail row window. Felt confined whole flight, turbulence did not allow any movement for 3.5 hours. Entertainment went out twice, second time for last third of flight."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Always a Good Flight,"Southwest customer service is always very good! Rarely do I have a problem with this airline, and this trip again proved that Southwest is always a safe bet. You are definitely paying for good service! Well worth the price!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Vegas in a heartbeat,"I had a chance to get away for a much needed get away, took Southwest, and got a great fare, at a time that fit my wants very well and the flight was on time coming and going, and the flight crew was all helpful, as I'm a disabled person, there was no judgement, which means a lot too me, they even made the pre-flight safety talk fun, I will always try and use Southwest if at all possible."
n/a,50,Always Great Service With Southwest Airlines ,"I never fail to appreciate flying with Southwest Airlines.  They generally get you into the plane, leave mostly on time and offer friendly service on board.  I highly recommend flying Southwest Airlines whenever you can."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Trip To Newark,"I have become a fan of Southwest Airlines. They communicate well, they are efficient and in comparison to other airlines I fly, I think for domestic flights, they are the best. Competitive fares, no bag fees and their rewards program for frequent flyers is, in my opinion, the best available."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Love these fares!,"Thank you, Southwest for the FABULOUS fares!  Hawaiian Airlines airfares are out of reach fo local people. Open seating is great.  Too bad the gate assignments are such a long walk!  Not your fault. Everyone, be prepared for a hike to the gates, both departing and arriving."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Southwest Flight from Las Vegas to Atlanta (7:15am),"This was my third Southwest Flight.  Just me, I don't particularly care for their boarding process.   I prefer an assigned seat.   In flight entertainment needs improvement, I do not like having to use my cell phone to view shows and movies.  However, I guess this is how they keep cost down.  I do like that they allow free checked bags.  Overall, the flight was good and a good experience for the money..   Going forward, I will only use them for flights that are less than 2 hours."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Roundtrip to Ft Lauderdale--Great Service,"Tulsa to Ft Lauderdale via Dallas and Ft Lauderdale to Tulsa via Houston.  All four flights were on time and flight attendants were very friendly.  My only negative comment would be that the attendants waited 30 minutes to start beverage service and then had to rush as it was only a hour and a half flight. The seat belt sign was NOT on, so no apparent reason to wait."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Southwest Airline,"Going to Phoenix on Southwest was pretty nice, Staff was friendly We got all of our luggage and I had two e;derly people with me and the whell chairs were great workers helped. It was a different story flying back in No workers were there to help with wheelchairs and my brand new luggage was ruined filthy We flew 3480 Going to Phoneix and from Phoneix to Cinn. 4269 The flight was great just no help when we landed missing a case and my luggage has black stripes on it On both flights there was no wifi"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Great value, friendly service","Relatively short flight, great price of two of us. Everything went smoothly. The staff has been very friendly, both at the airport during the check in as well as the flight crew. I love the fact that you can still have two free checked bags."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,My flight to St. Louis SWA,"The customer service on SWA is always top notch! Undisputed to this day yet, however it seems the seats are getting smaller and it not me gaining weight either...LOL. I had to turn sideways to try and get comfortable. That is my only problem with SWA."
Date of travel: September 2019,20,Original booking cancelled and paid for early bird check in.  Multiple calls corresepondence and no refund,"Original flight cancelled, rerouted to a different day.  Additional expense and the early bird check in did not transfer.  Paid for and multiple correspondence, still have not received refund.  Poor customer service"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Courteous and helpful agents, comfortable seats with legroom","Flight both ways were full, but the process was efficient and timely. My husband and I fly Southwest as much as possible."
n/a,10,Uncomfortable return to Aruba,We were a family group ... from the first moment of the check-up it was Terrible ... the lady who attended us seemed not to like her job ... she attended us as if we were people asking for something ... we threw the suitcase and we stayed more than  an hour there ... I really don't know if she knows how to do her job ... then we wait and go to Fort Lauderdale ... there it was worse ... because we had children and they don't have priority with them ... really the  Southwest people are not friendly ... my first experience with this airline lets say a lot ... nothing good ... mr. that made us go to the plane was the worst of all ... the hostesses or say ... they are not kind enough to treat people ... I particularly do not travel with Southwest again ... our return to Aruba was very  Terrible.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Communication!,"Flight from RDU to BWI was rocky but not their fault. Crew was lovely... flight from BWI to PWM was actually lovely as well. The problem was through passengers, 2 of us, were informed of a gate change with literally about 10 minutes to spare...and then our information was incorrect in their system. That that plane wasn't going to PWM should have been known and communicated along with arrival info so we could all deplane and not have run a 5K to get to the right plane! Do better SWA!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Trip to Chicago,Always pleasant and keeps its clients informed flight on time excellent landingEasy checkinConsistently courteous
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Great value, and always friendly","I have flown Southwest pretty much exclusively since all the other airlines started charging bag fees. Southwest still allows 2 checked bags, 1 carry-on and a personal item all for free. All of their staff that i have interacted with has been very friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I love Southwest Airlines!,"I just love Southwest Airlines. The flight attendants truly care about their customers. That plus the fact that Southwest flights are usually on time if not early. I actually arrived early both in Columbus and back home. Their safety record is unmatched in modern aviation. The snacks were plentiful and they actually brought me extras. All in all, I do not plan to ever fly with another airline."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Rocky Mountains,The staff was very nice on check in. Flight was good and air crew were very nice even when we got delayed in landing do to wind shears at Denver airport. Same for flight back.Only issue was on flight out was 53 handicap early boarding. We could not Get two seats together until seats over the wing.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest flying to Hawaii,"I’m a loyal Southwest Airlines customer because they always put the passenger first and foremost. Our flight was running on time, but there were several passengers flying across the country and running late to make their connection to Hawaii. The captain came out to explain the situation about not leaving anyone behind on their dream vacation. Needless to say, everyone on the plane had no issue waiting on the passengers and applauded the captain and crew. So glad SW opened up the Hawaii itinerary, it’s the only way to fly - with a company who cares!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,SWA service to Hawaii is hard to beat!,"Chose SWA because they were new to Hawaii.  Fares weren’t that different, but if you can find an airline that doesn’t nickel and dime you for things like checked baggage these days you’re doing pretty well.  Of course if you’re going to Hawaii you’re going to try and pack like you’re going on vacation, regardless of what your plans are.  The free checked bag is definitely one of SWA’s strongest selling points.Couldn’t ask more from the flight itself either!  Service was on point and every need was met.  I will definitely do my best to return to the islands with SWA.  Thanks Southwest Aitlines!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Comfort,"My personal feeling, I Love Southwest Airlines. The seats are comfortable and some of the stewardess are fun. Sometimes it depends on who they are. I will and only fly Southwest"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Smooth flight,"I don’t like to fly, but, Southwest pilots and crew do a great job of making the flight enjoyable. Plus,the snacks are a treat! After every flight, the pilots stood outside the plane and greeted the passengers- a “human” touch."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always Southwest,I use to Fly Air Canada until it was suggested by a friend to try Southwest.I always buy the Early Bird so that I can always get a window seat. I am already booked to go back to Vegas in February. I just wish that they would put the early morning flight to Vegas back on and the late afternoon return to Buffalo.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flights with SW,Great and friendly staff who were concerned that I had an enjoyable experience. Seemed to go out of her way to check in on passengers. Uninterrupted internet.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,oakland to cabo,"Southwest: very inexpensive relative to  competitors to get to Cabo.However, it is a cattle call.  Full flight coming/going.  Stressed attendants.Large , very large person next to me on the way down.But it is only  3 hours in  the air, but it took a lllooonnnnggg time to getluggage off the plane at Los Cabos."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,No frills but a nice flight,"This was my first time flying Southwest, and although I'm used to another airline I frequent, I couldn't complain about the service.  There are no frills on this airline, either at the gate or on the plane, and there are no seat assignments so it's pretty much first come first to get a good seat.  But the flight attendants were friendly and courteous and the plane was fine.  I would fly this airline again as it's very economically priced for tickets plus they don't charge for checked bags."
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Great flight for bereavement reasons,"I had to fly out to New Britain to say goodbye to our brother, gone too young unexpectedly. Fukker diabetes Type 1. The fly attendants at Southwest always make me feel welcomed me, like their so happy to see me. Upon arrival, the pilot was there to say thank you for choosing SW. On short notice, they had the best price & I barely had 2️⃣ wait in between flights. Thank You Soutwest"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good budget flight,"We planned a road trip out of Nashville. I booked us nice economic seats on Southwest. For a no frills airline they do a good job. We left and arrived on time. No drama, no hassles. I picked up my rental car and was off."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Loyal to Southwest,"I have been flying multiple times a year for over 20 years now.  I stay pretty loyal to Southwest.  They provide excellent customer service when there has been a problem.  I made the tragic mistake of flying American one time, it was horrid!  Just one more confirmation that I need to stick with Southwest.  They don't charge to cancel your flight, they give you a credit, which works for me.  When you call in, you get a real person to talk to, even for customer service!  Numerous times they have given me free drinks for giving up my seat or for a flight being delayed.  Their flight attendants are always extremely friendly!  When their flights are delayed a certain amount of time, they immediately give you a voucher, no hassle about it.  They aren't the classiest and they don't provide the most bells and whistles on their planes, but they provide the best customer service and that means the most to me, so I will continue to be a loyal Southwest customer."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Layed Back,"The flight to Tampa and back to Pittsburgh was smooth and comfortable.  I was thrown off by not having assigned seating at first but I didn't mind it as long as you check in online before hand (24 hours before).  If not, you will be sitting in a middle seat.  Flight attendants were great."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,The friendliest airline in the sky,"I've flown 6 flights with Southwest this year and each time was pleasant because the staff set the tone for the flight.  The staff smile and are very accommodating.  They gave extra special attention to the parents of small children.  I never saw a scowl on their faces or rolling of the eyes. One person was telling jokes and many people on the plane laughed, including me."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,ALWAYS A HOME RUN,"Southwest is the easiest airline to get where you need to go, without being ripped off for checked bags.They are not vultures like the bigger named airlines.With Southwest, you always know what you're going to get, and they always come thru....With FLYING (pun intended) Colors!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,great flight,"Southwest is always great,   no charge for carry on , attendants are friendly and nice. the snacks good"
Date of travel: July 2019,50,chi to the big easy,"Southwest is a great airline, very reasonable pricing if you book early enough, they are great at making price adjustments if the price goes down, best of all  no baggage fees, great cabin crew."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Flight Changed Without Notifying Us,"We'd booked our round trip months in advance.  Our flight from Portland to Las Vegas went as scheduled.  When we got our tickets at the kiosk for our return flight I noticed that our flight number had changed and our arrival time had changed.  Instead of the direct flight on our original itinerary, we were now scheduled on a flight with a stop in LA.  This was done without notifying us: we would have tried to book an earlier flight if we had been notified.  We have been loyal Southwest customers for many years but over the past couple of years we have experienced an increased number of flight delays and rerouting from our original itineraries."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Vegas Couples Weekend,"Great non-stop flight, one of my favorite airline ever. I flown more flights then the normal person, they always come through."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Consistently Terrific,"My husband and I flew to San Diego from Midway. It's always a pleasure to not pay for luggage. We did pay extra, however, for earlybird seating. It costs $25 person, used to be $15. It puts you in group A 1-60. Worth it to be guaranteed a good seat. The big surprise was the beverage/snack. They came by three times offering snacks and drinks, a rarity in airline service. My only complaint is the way gate A4 at Midway is configured. It's a very narrow hallway, really unequipped for 100 plus people. And worse, no one could hear the announcements. Otherwise, no complaints."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,L.V. Trip,I always like flying with southwest airlines.  Their rates are always affordable and they always have special rates.  I have been flying southwest for several years and have never had a bad experience.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Two short hops,"Traveled from Little Rock, AR to Chicago for a concert. Southwest Airlines does not have a direct flight to Chicago from Little Rock so you fly to St. Louis, about a 37 minute flight,a slight layover then another 40-45 minutes to Midway. Nice flights, but the time is so short that the service is rushed. Not the crews fault, just a short hop for each flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,First time on Southwest,"What can you say about a flight. We got from point a to point b without incident, on time and safe. Everyone very pleasant."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always great service,Flight was smooth and very quiet.  Flight attendants were pleasant.  We always fly Southwest and have always trusted their service
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Late to take off, arrived on time","Southwest is a great airline in most cases, but the boarding and check in leaves a lot to  be desired.  You better call to check in exactly 24 hours before flight time or you may be behind a bunch of families, due to sixty people boarding first then family’s with children getting next spots, then the “B” group of sixty Nd finally the last.  Still get pretzels and beverages free."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"On time, fun, and comfortable (as air travel can be)","I fly about 25 times a year for Business on all different airlines.  Try to fly Southwest whenever possible.   They offer flexible changes, never charge for bags and I as a 6 foot 3 inch tall person I believe have an inch more leg room than Delta, United, American.  I know that it varies by Plane type, but Southwest 737 Seat Spacing works for me.      I used 5 years of frequent flyer miles to take my Wife and Daughter to VA, and Southwest Flights to and from were perfect."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Some of the most fun attendants in air travel work for Southwest Airlines!,"I fly Southwest Airlines a couple of times a year to visit family, and the flight attendants on these flights are often so gracious and fun! I always make eye contact when I hear one being humorous and I always thank them for making the flight enjoyable as I deplane. Bravo to all the Southwest teams!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always friendly staff,"The best thing about Southwest is always the customer service. I love that they allow a free checked bag. However they lack in other areas such as in-flight entertainment and snacks. I also find they have to reset the wifi a lot of the time midway through. On this flight that was under two hours, we got a pretty old plane."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Great flights to/from Denver,"Always have a good experience flying southwest. They are almost always on time, they usually do have full flights but they get us out and on our way efficiently with friendly flight attendants.  I wish they flew to Rapid City! Great job SWA staff."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Consistently good company.,"So there are plenty of things you don't get when you fly with Southwest.  A couple of those things are:  You don't get cranky, erasable employees.  You actually get professional, friendly folks.   You don't get constant delays or cancelations.  I fly with SW when I can, but I've had several flight with American Airlines and United Airlines canceled.  I applaud SW airlines and hope they can continue the culture they've been able to develop.  As air travel increases the pressure will too.  My hope is that they will remain a beacon of professionalism in the air travel industry."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,smooth flights both flights arrived early to our destinations,"Flight attendants were very friendly , both flights departed on time and arrived early.We were traveling with our elderly Mother and the attendants helped find her a seat toward s the front so she didn't have to go to far."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,"The airline stewardesses always tell jokes. Very funny. Trip was very pleasant and on time. Southwest normally flies large air crafts with a minimum of 100 people. Each flight is normally filled to capacity. This make me very comfortable. Knowing that other's enjoy flying Southwest as much as I do. Also, you get to check two bags for free! No one else does that! Only Southwest!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always the Best,"Always the Best - value, crew, staff, timeliness, and now entertainment through their app.  Got to be thefirst choice for leisure travelers for sure."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always a good flight,"If you never flew Southwest, be aware there are no frills. Seating is by when you check in, the earlier you check in the better your seat. I usually get the high A's or low B's. Not bad. There were lots of seats to pick from on this flight. But the seats are tight, not a lot of leg room either and I'm only 5 feet tall! But the prices are great, the pilots and attendants are awesome and SW is known for being on time. I'm good with that. I just wish I could get a direct flight to and from Vegas. Maybe someday."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Confusing communications,"This was a connecting flight that just kept changing its message.  There were several departure time changes, with little explanation given to passengers."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,No surprises...that's always good,"The fewer surprises on flights, the better it is and Southwest seems to keep them to a minimum.  It would help if some of the attendants stopped trying to be funny. That was OK when the line was basically a start-up, but now they wear adult outfits and should stick to business."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Jax to LAS - Great flight,"Once again, Southwest came through in flying colors. From Jax we stopped in Nashville, staying on the same plane, on then on to Vegas. The plane was very clean, flight attendants were great and we arrived early. We use Southwest anytime we have the opportunity."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Not a Welcoming Flight,"I have flown Southwest on many occasions and most are easy and sometimes entertaining thanks to the crew.  This flight was a by the book flight. By that I mean that all of the announcements were given word for word as scripted.  There was nothing personal as the commercials on TV suggest.There was no verbal greeting when I entered the plane, the beverage service was probably the slowest I can recall and it was not due to any turbulence. This LA based crew needed to lighten up and be friendly and not so distant."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flight,We had a great flight! Takeoff&’landing was good! We had 7 newlyweds on board! Everyone was upbeat & looking forward to their destination! Snacks & beverages were average. Like to fly Southwest whenever I fly. Always a good ride.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,The best way to travel,"The best domestic airline experience. I did my online check in very early and got an early check in number (Pssst... starting with A). It gets you enough time to choose your seat as you become the early puckers. The Flight was super convenient, they allow 2 check in bags FREE. I mean seriously !!! You would need your entertainment device, and you can get going. The seats have enough legroom. The flight attendants are polite and courteous."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Worst airline I've encountered,"I am a frequent flyer (weekly), but I have rarely flown on Southwest. Recently, I had purchased a roundtrip ticket on Southwest two months before the travel date. Two weeks ago, I had checked my reservation and everything was fine. However, when attempting to check in early today, my reservation was gone. The confirmation number--which I had previously confirmed was valid--is now invalid (the trip being still two weeks away). I had not canceled or changed my reservation; Southwest simply lost it. I am now in the process of filing a complaint and requesting a refund for my lost reservation. I will also have to spend a lot more to buy a ticket from another airline as the travel date s now two weeks away."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Great flight.,"Good experience, much better compared to AA. Staff is friendly and they don't let go of humor. They could surely work on getting better snack than some short bread cookies and lousy pretzels."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,In Memory of A Dear Family Member,"This month, we had to travel to the Midwest to honor an immensely well liked relative who passed away. We needed to fly from So. CA to Denver. We were fortunate to find outbound and return flights (that had no stops or connections) that were at times that worked for us and at reasonable cost. Although our return flight was delayed about a half hour, both legs went smoothly. Onboard service was very good and luggage handling was good (although the new strap for one of my suitcases was lost somewhere between check-in and arrival back at ONT). All in all, for flights of this nature (distance and reason) it is tough to beat Southwest. But we actually encountered someone on our return flight that had not flown Southwest before - hard to believe. We have and will continue to fly Southwest whenever we can."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Very Good dining!,I like the low price.  Good pilots and flight attendants.  Will use them again if I fly commercial.  I went for $400 less than flying my own personal airplane.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Good trip,"I actually paid for the business upgrade but was worried about not getting a good seat. Prior to this flight I had a bad experience with southwest flying from Orlando To Baltimore and decided to stop flying this airline. I paid the extra money to get on the airplane with the first group and did not get to board first on my return flight. When I got on the flight my wife and I sat in different seats in the middle and different rows. I didn’t think my money was spent wisely purchasing category 1. This trip was totally different, I still didn’t board first but at least my wife and I sat together on both flights.  I would rate the check in process 5 out of 5 and 4.5 for boarding."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Beware if traveling with a car seat!,"We fly a lot, especially my husband. We don’t usually fly Southwest but decided to try it since they had a direct flight. First, they put my checked bag on a different flight going to Denver so I didn’t get it until the next day. No real apologies for that. Then coming home, we waited on the plane for an hour while they “did paperwork “ before we could takeoff, the plane was so hot the entire trip we were sweating by the time we got off, the pilots did not pay attention to cabin pressure especially during landing so our ears kept popping and they broke our car seat which we had gate checked. There was a nice flight attendant who had them find the broken off part under the plane but unfortunately it was not fixable. We went to baggage claim and told them what happened, including that the piece was found under the plane and the flight attendant’s name who helped but they only cover lost items. Again, no apologies. The woman actually said “it’s just a broken piece but the car seat will still work” to which I had to tell her that the piece latches the car seat in so yes, it has lost functionality. Definitely not the friendly skies the company claims!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Phoenix to Vegas,No frills but you know that going in. The cabin crew was very friendly and made the short flight very enjoyable.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Time management,"My family and I recently took Southwest flight to Seattle, and then took bus to Vancouver.  The flight was smooth as always, and the time management is excellent. We were able to get there on time consistently.Southwest has always been one of the few favorites domestic airlines as it always tries its best to provide on time services (sometime incident happens as it did for our other flight, but it has great communication to keep everyone informed from time to time.) and staff are friendly; moreover, the flight has been smooth.Thanks!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Very friendly,It was a great flight staff very friendly. I usually fly southwest I have never had a problem with them.
n/a,50,A VERY RELIABLE AIRLINE,"I've been doing a lot of travel over the past years and have used multiple airlines for travel. My go to most often is Southwest as the flights have been the best on time and the crew very courteous. If a delay is encountered they advise you of the situation and have often made up time in the air.Least favored is United as almost every flight there was an issue of cancellation, extensive delay and crew not too outgoing. No feedback is given as to why the delay and even a pilot not have the backbone enough to not advise the passengers of a very late night cancel!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Flights on Southwest,I love flying Southwest. It's so nice not to have to worry about paying for every little thing. Luggage is still free and so are regular drinks. You even still get pretzels. Everyone was helpful and as long as you check in right at 24 hours you can pick your seats when boarding without worrying your party will be split up.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,I've got lots of baggage.,"As a photographer, I have a lot of bags. Camera bag, light case, usually I like to pack some clothes too. I've given all my business to Southwest now as they don't charge for bags unless you have over 2 to check per person."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Very outgoing, funny flight attendants","Flight was on time.  There is always one flight attendant that tries to lighten things up.Even though one flight was only 45 minutes, they still served drinks and snacks!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,San Antonio to Vegas,"We drove from Corpus to San Antonio to fly direct to Vegas. Love the San Antonio airport. Of course we love our Corpus airport, but didn't want to sit in Houston or Dallas for this trip. San Antonio has done a great job. Parking was easy, we had Clear entry - fast and nice. Would definitely do this again."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Southwest Airlines - bad news!,"Do you like people being rude to you? Do you like people throwing your belongings around? Do you like struggling while people watch and do nothing to help? If the answer to all these questions is a resounding YES! Then Southwest Airlines is for you! We were ‘greeted’ (and I use the term loosely) by a women who looked like she would rather be in a war zone than standing behind the Southwest Airlines kiosk. While I struggled to figure out the self serve kiosk she looked at me like I was from another planet (I’m not) and did absolutely nothing to help. When I failed to check in my bags correctly she quickly point out I had ‘not done it right’ but gave very little in the way of help.After checking in our bags, she threw my husbands backpack from the kiosk to the conveyor belt. Thank god there was only dirty clothes in there. After a very enthusiastic and sarcastic ‘thank you very much’ from myself I pointed in the directing I believed I needed to go to which she replied, in the most frustrated tone ‘Yesssss’ This was my experience of the first 7/10 minutes of interaction. Let’s hope the 1.5hr flight has better service. #preyforash"
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Weekend golf,"The flight to Chicago was good, a little bumpy. The flight back to pittsburgh on a sunday night was not good. The haf an electrical problem but only found that out after we were on the runway ready to take off, not fun."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Ashraf & Likha,Travel to San Francisco on 11 October to enjoy holidays. It was a comfortable journey. The schedule of flight was okay. Crews were caring. It was cost effective. I returned to LA on 14 October. I was fully satisfied with the Southwest Airlines.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Southwest continues to be a cut above,"Yes, Southwest Airlines is a discount airline...but I would argue that at this point in time so is every other airline...other airlines, (if you have a discounted ticket) charge for getting an assigned seat, baggage, if you want water (I'm not making that up).  Southwest is just a much much better discount airline in almost every aspect.  So whenever possible I fly them over all the others"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Awesome price,"Great price for round trip and a short your and 45 minutes flight, and then a quick 20 minute drive to the best sunsets ever. Great smooth take off as landing."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Nice price, excellent service","Can't complain in the least bit with this Southwest Airline flight.  Family vacation for eleven people all went smoothly.  You have to like their 'wanna get away' fares, and when coupled with two free checked bags per person, you can't beat their prices generally.  Service inflight was very good, seats were about industry standard, and if you downloaded the Southwest app before leaving, you could watch a number of movies/shows on your device.  Definitely would use Southwest again given the chance.  We even found a lower fare for the same flight that we had booked, and were given a credit towards our next flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best Value,"We often fly Southwest to Texas because of their no luggage fee policy and also their efficient quality of service. In spite of other relatives’ negative comments on their flight experiences, we have had nothing but very good results. It is by no means a luxurious airline, but their sincere efforts to satisfy customers has been evident to us. On one occasion this year after damaging one of our suitcases they replaced it with a brand new, larger suitcase of great quality with no hesitation. In addition, their staff are wonderful  in assisting me as I always require wheelchair service. This makes my experience that much quicker and less strenuous.Also, I am a large person, but their seating is still adequate for our purposes. Their flight attendants are also always good natured, often with a great sense of humor and always very accommodating. And to top it off we’ve often found great price values during promotional sales. Southwest will continue to be my first go-to airline for a  great bargain."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Never Let Me Down,"Seems like Southwest always manages to arrive ahead of schedule. On this 3-hour flight, we were about a half-hour early. Same thing on the return. Non-priority boarding positions are determined by when you check in for your flight; SW does not assign seats; my daughter and I were in the B boarding group and had no problem finding seats together and plenty of room in the overhead bins. Snacks were pretzels and Lorna Doones (shortbread), with complimentary beverages. You could purchase alcohol but not food. Flight crew was efficient and friendly. Cabin lighting was pleasantly subdued; engine noise minimal; temperature a bit cool."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Horrible “open seating” process,"I have been repeatedly frustrated by the “open seating” on Southwest. It leaves customers either fighting for seats, or paying extra fees to board early when adjoining seats are actually available. 1-If you want to sit with family members, or those you are traveling with, it is most effective to pay upgrade fees on EACH ticket to ensure being in “A” group. 2-Or you can take your chances sitting on your phone or computer at exactly 23 hours and 59 minutes from your flight time....and repeatedly click click click click to try to get  into an earlier boarding group. Sometimes this works....sometimes it does not. 3-Of course, when boarding later, the only seats available are middle seats.....rows upon rows of only middle seats available.4-Because of the “open seating” nonsense, earlier-boarding passengers “save” seats for others. I asked a Southwest attendant at the desk about this and he said it is NOT permitted to “save” seats for others.The entire “repeatedly click to check in asap 24 hours in advance” trying to click faster than anyone else and the seat-saving situation feels like we are immature children on a school bus. It is extremely frustrating and add extra complications to flying.I am following up with customer service about the seat-saving....and never flying southwest again."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Consistent Service with a Flexible Options,I always enjoy the flexibility of flying on Southwest. Always having the option of two checked bags and to cancel and change my flight with no fee brings me back to Southwest everytime!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Girlfriends flight home,"I love flying Southwest. We had a window of time for take off (after a 2 hour delay). The pilot said, ""We are going to fly this plane like we stole it."". Fasted taxi time I've ever experienced. Crew asked that the 80 or so passengers quickly board so we could take off."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Hard to Beat most of the Time,"I like flying Southwest for the most part as they can get you to most destinations in the US without much driving time to or from your final destination. No baggage fees are great which gives me leeway to purchase the overweight fee instead of lugging or checking 2 bags. The service on this flight was impeccable, polite and accommodating which I appreciated very much and have come to enjoy. I know you are expanding internationally and can't wait to see where you will take us next."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always reliable,"We always fly SouthWest: fares are lowest, no charge for bags, flights are usually on-time, staff are friendly.  What's not to like?   Well, flights are usually quite full (as was this one) but the staff keep it all quite pleasant."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Airline that tries harder,"Southwest may be the best deal out there for travel.  No upgrade fees, what they quote you is the fare.  No hidden charges, even your luggage is free.  The flight attendents try their best to make your flight fun.  The flights run on time.  I love Southwest !"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Frustrating,"If you are allergic to peanuts, they remove it from all flights.  I become extremely frustrated that this level of consideration is ignored for people who have such allergies with pets & travel with Doctor’s note...and I am not speaking of Service Animals...but the pets which can not be left at home because people have to travel with them on their laps.  I have witness disgusting incidents of urination & defecation.  Most are not in carriers but tote bags.  Some Gate Agents willing listen to my concern; however, some become annoyed when I mention my situation.  I suggest that these passengers have some other boarding arrangements.  Having to go from plane to Emergency Room is no fun,  I fly Southwest because of their Customer Service in booking & flight attendants.  Please airlines adhere The Pleas of People with Allergies."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest is my preferred airline,"Was a typical Southwest flight.  I checked in 24 hours in advance, got B-boarding passes.  We lined up and got on in our positions & found seats together all 4 flights (1 connection each way).  1 window, 1 center seat for us.  All 4 flights had a 3rd person in the 3-across row, so pretty full.  The attendants were nice and served us well.  Flights went well, some turbulence, but not much.  I used the Southwest app to watch a free movie on my phone on one of the flights.  Nice as all 4 flights were ~2 hours each."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Perfect Flight After Flight,Our flight both ways left and arrived on time. We always check two bags so no charge bags is money in our pocket. We fly Southwest every time we plan a vacation.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,it's Southwest!!!,"flying Southwest is usually a non-event. Southwest is great because your first two checked bags are free, the whole process is usually seamless and almost don't have to interact with anyone.However, on this trip my luggage was destroyed, it was not lost, it was not misplaced, it was destroyed. The term Southwest Airlines luggage service called was ""dragged"".As to be expected from Southwest they made everything good, they wrote me a check on the spot for all my destroyed clothing and articles in my bag and money for a new bag. The items that were not destroyed but need to be cleaned they paid for cleaning."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Flight,"I love the way Southwest works. Boarding is seamlessly easy. The plane was nice and enough space for me (I am heavy-set). The flight attendants were great. Also, I was very impressed the way they took drink orders then served. I will definitely use Southwest again when I have a chance."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest is awesome!!,The flight was on time and landed a little ahead of schedule.  The pilot told us we were going to run into some weather in TN and that he would do his best to get us around it and that he did..... We never felt one bit of turbulence all the way home to Dallas.  The flight crew was amazing as always on Southwest.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent First Experience ,"My criteria for airline satisfaction is essentially - start on time, end on time.This, coupled with an attractive non-stop fare on a clean aircraft where the queue was efficiently managed (despite the policy of no seating assignments), hit all the boxes for me!I don’t know why I hadn’t considered them sooner."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,MOST CUSTOMER FRIENDLY AIRLINE!,"My wife and I were on a business trip to DC Area. We use SOUTHWEST'S ""FRIENDS FLY FREE PROGRAM "" whenever we can.We find Southwest the most customer friendly and least ""RIP OFF"" airline. No penalty if you change your flight, no fee for checked luggage. Employees are very friendly.We fly them as long as it is reasonably convenient."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Love Southwest Airlines!,"We always fly SW if it’s possible.  I reAlly like being able to choose my seat...I get on, look to see where the babies are (Moms, no fault of yours if they’re unhappy) and look for people who are already reading or working on a device.  I know there are delays due to weather, and also. Cause of mechanical issues, but They're almost always on time.  The flight attendants are always pleasant.  I’m disappointed that the flights are no longer less expensive like they used to be.  That’s the reason for the 4 stars, not 5."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Flight attendants,Worst flight attendants ever were very rude and moved me from my seat when I’m a diabetic her name was Mary and very rude
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good Flight,"We flew from Pensacola on a Saturday morning.  It was nonstop.  The plane took off on time and it was a smooth flight.  It was easy doing a gate check for my walker and in Houston they had it for me within minutes of landing.  We had an in-flight emergency as the flight attendant was asking for a doctor or nurse.  A woman was having severe pain in her side.  Just before landing they asked a couple of passengers to change seats so they could get the woman off the plane quickly when we landed.  It was the fastest straightforward approach I have ever done arriving in Houston.  The attendant asked for everyone to stay seated until the paramedics came on board.  But as soon as the door opened, the woman and her daughter and the nurse walked off the plane.  I never saw any paramedics so either they were right there and took her immediately because everything was clear and we were able to get off the plane quickly.  The other passengers were all cooperating with the attendants.  I already have my flights booked for another trip with Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Decent Service,"We arrived at the airport and went to see if I had to check my walker or if I could keep it.  The lady said I could gate check it.  When I got to the gate they put tags on it and I was able to keep it until I got down the jetway to the plane.  I did a preboard and was able to get bulkhead seats for me and my husband.  When we landed in Pensacola, I had to wait a few minutes for them to bring it and it was very quick.  The flight actually left Houston a few minutes early and we arrive five minutes early.  Everyone was very nice and helpful."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,SW Flight to LA,I’m always so impressed with the quality of SW flights. It’s easy and painless. Always on toke and arrives early. Thanks SW
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent service with economical expense,"Southwest is a great, customer service oriented airline which offers very reasonable airfare. The skycap, gate personnel & actual airline staff were very courteous, professional & helpful."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Flight,"We were flying home from Mexico and the one flight attended made our day. I can't remember her name(the most senior of the flight attended) but she was awesome at her job. She was so polite, and funny, and honest. You could tell she loved what she did. I was lucky enough to get the exit seat with all the extra leg room as well. BONUS!!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,LOVE In The Sky,"As Always Southwest did not disappoint me. The On Time Departures and on time Arrivals were spot on. The in Flight entertainment is top notch ,Plenty of movies and tv to keep you entertained thru the whole flight. Beverage Service is great with soda and water and plenty of Libations for sale. This is the best US Carrier by far."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest - Friendly and Affordable,Great flight to and from.  Love their rewards program. Easy boarding.  Flights left on time and arrived as scheduled.
Date of travel: June 2019,40,Celebration Weekend,"Check-in was easy. Boarding was fine, but wish they had more room for everyone to line up in the staging area. The flight got turbulent over the mountains as usual, but the flight was fine. The crew was nice."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest is friendly and affordable,"Southwest is typically my first choice in flying.  This is an easy route but I wish they had more direct flights.  We visit Marco Island and tend to stay at a hotel so the early morning direct flight from Chicago gets us to Ft. Myers and then to Marco, too early to check it and the return flight is so late in the day we have checked out 9 hours earlier.  That being said the flight is comfortable and easy to fly.;"
Date of travel: November 2018,10,Rapid Reward Program not so Rapid,"I was all set to book a flight for my daughter for Christmas. Prices were higher than usual because of the time of the year but I had points, and the agent on the phone said even though I was slightly short of points, I could buy 3,000 for $60 to meet the requirement. I said I'll do that, let's go ahead and book, but they said I had to wait until the purchased additional points showed in my account. By the time they were there, the number needed increased. How many times would this happen before I got the ticket?  I now am out $60, it's non refundable, but I can use the points in the next 2 years...hardly helps when I wanted the flight this year.  I'm so disappointed. I did complain and they'll take my grievance to their monthly meeting. There should be someway to hold a ticket while you are waiting for the points to be credited to your account so you aren't spending money for nothing. I had to put in a false date of travel because we weren't able to travel."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Flight to Seattle,"Ou6r flight to Phoenix on our way to Seattle was to leave Tulsa at 6 I think or maybe 6:30, well it didn't leave till after 8.  We arrived finally in Seattle at 1:30 am.  I think the weather was the delay.  It was a good flight even though we had delays.  No problems!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Southwest to Mexico,"Thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience both to Cancun and then the return home. Boarding experiences were great. The two free checked bags is a definite bonus, plus one free carry on. Good legroom throughout the cabin. Flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. We will definitely try to fly with Southwest whenever possible. Also, unless your tickets are purchased as part of a package through someone else, it only costs $1 to change your flight date, etc."
n/a,40,Last flight out of San Diego is a gamble,"Southwest is great with prices, options, no baggage charges, pilots and flight crew.  Negatives include full flights almost always and people trying to put to much stuff in the overhead storage.   Twice in the last year I have taken the last flight out of San Diego to Kc and each time they have had delays leaving. This last time we had to wait for the plane to get in from Seattle. Once we got in the pilot did a great job of trying to get us here as quick as possible. We got in at 1:40 in the morning but  could not find service from Uber, Lyft or airport taxi. A kind lady renting a car gave us a ride home at 2:30 in the morning."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Over and Above,This airline flight crew is over the top when making a flight special. This was on September 28 and our flight attendant was Kelsey. It was my grand daughter's 5th birthday and her 1st flight. The pilots were very open to taking pictures with her. Kelsey and the other flight attendants made her an adorable birthday crown from pretzel packages and swizzle sticks. They presented her with an armful of cute Southwest products and had the entire flight sing Happy Birthday to her. Then Kelsey let her serve pretzels to the cabin. OMG!!!! What a fabulous experience for my grand daughter. This is not an isolated incident. We made this exact same trip last year with my other grand daughter when she turned 5 and she got the same 1st class experience. When I told friends about the trip they all said they had heard that about Southwest and how great they are.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,I love southwest never lets me down,I love southwest can always count on them to be respectful and reliable at all times never get left behind with the best airlines❤️
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Nothing Wrong with Average,Please don't get me wrong there was nothing bad about our flight to LAS. We paid for early bird boarding and were able to snag a pair of seats in the exit row. Dropping off our bag and getting boarding passes was seemless. Security at DIA took FOREVER! At least 35 minutes on a Sunday evening.Boarding was efficient. The flight was non-descipt and had the standard drink and pretzels. Folks on the flight were calm compared to other flights I've taken to Vegas.Baggage pick up time was average.Will fly with SWA again.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Always great, love the way they load in 15 minutes","Friendly staff, great pilots. Great connections. If you help they are there just ask. Allow disable to board first and families with small children after A Group"
n/a,50,The best Airlines ,"Clean fast friendly on time don't waste your time book with southwest airlines and enjoy the benefits,always the pilot and the stuff friendly and nice I highly recommend to everyone I will never go with anthor Airlines. Thanks southwest for your care."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Southwest has the worst customer experience unless you are a “higher/business” class.,They do NOT care about cheaper flight classes.  I had a flight leaving On Sunday that was totally booked.  I asked to change to a flight leaving on Saturday (the day of the flight) and they refuse to help me out! It doesn’t even make sense that they could gain a seat the next day while filling a seat on the same day but want me to pay $300 MORE dollars!  I spent hours on hold talking to “management” and no help at all other than I can complain to customer experience but that isn’t open until MONDAY! Ridiculous and I will avoid southwest like the plague going forward.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Staff was great,"My friend is in a wheelchair and the Southwest staff is so wonderful.   They help him and they are all so kind.   When their was no transporter when we arrived, the on coming pilot got him up the ramp.   All I can say is that Southwest Airlines is my choose for travel"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,EXCELLENT AIR SERVICE!,"I’m always happy to recommend Southwest Airlines!The people, the service, the on-time record and the prices!Oh. And the first bags are FREE!!! ( I *like* that word.)We have copious points and use them. And the Southwest Airlines is a ONE STOP SHOP for air, car rental and hotel - Even MORE SAVINGS...Inexpensive doesn’t mean cheap.They are all professionals ... Inside and out."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Airline to travel on!,"Southwest is by far my favorite airline. So many no-cost options and they make it so easy to connect two worlds together.  I like the prices on Southwest and being able to pack without worrying about fees.  The flight crews have been very polite and helpful and their inflight snacks are pretty good as well as decent prices for things you can purchase in flight, they also don't block the aisle with drink carts and boarding for open seating is fast and efficient!  I purchase the ""Wanna get Away"" flight for Seniors.  These flights are usually longer travel times at odd hours. I also purchase the ""Early-Bird Check In"" for the return flights.  Southwest then checks you in 36 hours in advanceThis trip was a round trip from Denver to Long Beach CA and back home again 4 nights later.  My older brother and his wife asked me to come and visit them after my long time friend and wife died of a burst aneurism.  My wife and I had booked flights on Southwest prior to her death.  Southwest credited the flights and refunded (without any question or hassle) my wife's airfare.The travel time going to Long Beach was said to be 7 hours and 5 minutes.  I was amazed at total time being only about 6 1/2 hours due to getting off the ground in good time in Denver to Burbank!  The same flight 1929 continued to Oakland with the same ""cowboy"" driving the plane. Picked up more time!  Flight 2044from Oakland to Long Beach arrived at the gate at about 6:30PM rather than the scheduled 7 PM.  For whatever reason the landing in Burbank had a slight jolt when the left landing gear touched down first.Four days later I left Long Beach on Flight 4376 to San Jose.  From San Jose to Denver on flight 1031 we had some turbulence but this was not bad compared to other flights in and out of Denver.  The flight time coming back to Denver was listed as 5 hours and 30 minutes, but we were slightly ahead of that time."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Trip to Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta,"Full Flight, but excellent trip.  Staff on both sides helpful and courteous.  Only hiccup was that the Skycap that checked me in, ended up pushing my wheelchair inside for assistance after I had sat there waiting for 15-20 minutes and no one showed up."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,First True Experience,The system is different to me and it turned out quite nice. I spent $50 round trip to get some priority for boarding which was worth it. FA's were very nice and attentive.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,My go to airline,It's all been a good experience for my wife and I. First 2 checked bags are free. You can also put a carry on bag in the overhead and a purse or laptop bag under your seat. The staff are helpful and fun most of the time. The have almost always been on time or early.
Date of travel: December 2018,40,A fun crew and you choose your own seat as you board,"This bare bones plane was still a great way to travel.  You need to be early to get a low number for boarding as you choose your seat as you board.  The crew is hard working and fun.  When you check in at the gate, you are given a number and that is the order you board in unless you need to board early due to children, disability, etc."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Love Southwest,"I always try to fly Southwest whenever possible. I know the cattle call seating can be annoying, but the benefits really outweigh that inconvenience. 1) I can change my flight with out being charged a ridiculous fee! *and had to do that for this trip 2) all Southwest planes are exactly the same, so you always know exactly what to expect. *Roomy seats. 3) 2 Free checked bags and 2 free carry on's! I mean c'mon! They are the only ones who still do this!! Right On Southwest!! Go ahead and think you are saving money on other airlines with some low price...add your bag fees and you probably will be paying more than Southwests price."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best Airline to travel!,Love this airline as they get me places with fun and courtesy! They seem to make my day when I travel with them. Just wish they flew everywhere!!! Love the free bagage check for not one but two bags!❤️💛💙
Date of travel: September 2019,50,fine,flight was on time and efficient. crew were professional and courteous. flight was smooth and uneventful
Date of travel: September 2019,50,My Las Vegas Getway,I just recently took a flight from Dallas to Las Vegas. The flight was smooth and the fly crew are so friendly. Great customer service. Looking forward to my next flight with Southwest Airlines.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Southwest - Great, LGA not so much","We fly on Southwest Airlines several times per year.  We love the 2 ""free"" bags - althought we know that nothing is free.  It is typically a competitive price, and we like it just fine.  Their in-flight free wifi is wonderful.LaGuardia Airport is kind of a mess during construction.  And there are 5 more years of construction on the drawing board.  Getting in and out of the airport was time consuming and frustration.  The terminal itself was quite nice - but we had to plan for excessive time in transit from our airport area hotel to assure that we made our filght."
n/a,50,Family reunion ,I flew out of Chicago Midway to San Diego the flight was really full but the service was really good. I booked the flight it was non stop but due to the planes that were grounded we stopped in Dallas this was my first flight that I did not get to deplane but the staff was still very nice. I love to fly Southwest because of mot having to pay for my bags.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest to Grand Cayman,Night flight from Dallas to Fort Lauderdale then onto Cayman Islands! Friendly staff and the ride was comfortable. Would recommend!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Best service of all US flagged air carriers PERIOD,"Two trips to the west this year---ATL-RNO and ATL-DEN.  First required plane changes.  Denver is non stop.  On any given day, flight schedules seem to be handled about the same by all airlines, with the difference coming down to servic0e at the gate and in the cabin.  From boarding announcement to exit the aircaraft = 1st class job by all as usual."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,San Juan Flight,Typical Southwest flight.....everything and everybody worked well.  The cost (minus not having to pay for checked in bags) can't be beat.
n/a,50,Always Great,They know how to run an airline. They get you on and off in a timely fashion. Always courteous service. Flexible with their fares and helpful if you need to make a change. My only complaint is that my known traveler number keeps disappearing from my profile making me go thru regular TSA.
Date of travel: June 2019,40,Summertime,"Comfortable ride, great customer service,prompt arrival/departure.The best perk is the hassle free option to change your flight for whatever reason.Plenty of flights so generally can pick and choose according to your needs."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Gets Me There,"Southwest is reliable, has never lost my bag, usually gets me there on time and flight attendants have a good sense of humor. My only complaint, as with all airlines, is lack of space."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,On time!,"We were boarded and in the air on time.Hit turbulence most of the way, so after getting a snack and drink, everyone including the flight attendants were seated most of the flight.Arrived a few minutes early in Orlando."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,It's Southwest,"It's Southwest Airlines, it's the fast food of airlines, and that isn't a bad thing. Check in right at 24 hours before to get a good boarding pass assignment and if you don't mind spending a few extra bucks pay the $15 (each way) to ensure you'll get a decent seat AND have room for your roller in the overhead."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Everything went smoothly,Southwest as always makes things straightforward and hassle free.   They make it pretty easy and easy to understand boarding.  Paid for early boarding and didn't have to do the 24 hour rush of getting a decent position.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Cancelled our flight while we were sleeping!!!,"Our nonstop flight at 10:50am was cancelled at 2;30am while we were sleeping. we woke up at 7am to find that I was on some flight that had a bad connection and didn't get in until the next day and my husband was on some other flight that was equally bad. We didn't have enough time to get any of the earlier flights on Southwest, and all of the better options were being taken as we talked with customer service. We had childcare responsibilities at home and needed to get there. I BOOKED THIS FLIGHT BECAUSE IT HAD PERFECT TIMING FOR US!!! We ended up booking a similar flight to our original flight through American Airlines at a cost of $1,200!!! That's what airlines in the US are allowed to do to people. If we were in the EU we could have got compensated."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Stellar flight...as always,"We just traveled from Indianapolis to Orlando via Southwest Airlines and as always I can’t recommend this airline enough.   The fact that you can have 2 bags fly free should be reason enough to choose Southwest, but the entire experience always exceeds our expectations.  Plus, the flight attendants always look so nice in their dresses.  We try to always use this airline.  Thank you Southwest!  We can’t wait for our next adventure!!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Always on time, or better","Southwest has turned into my go to for all my last minute flights, and now I incorporate it into my first choice for planning my trips. They are always on time, and deliver on their service promise. This time however, the flight was earlier than anticipated, and crew made the best of it, by giving us local recommendations upon my request. I am happy that the flight was as smooth, and with a great crew at our service. This airline is really re-committing to customer service, and delivering."
Date of travel: August 2019,10,the airline of smiles .... NOT,"SWA is fun and friendly until they're not.  tremendous hassle at the ticket counter in Rochester, NY.  SWA employees seemed to have a big chip on their shoulders.  As their own flight attendants say: ""we love you but we love your money more"".  i used to fly SWA whenever possible ..... even with their curtailed flight schedule.  I am about to book flights for me and for my office.  it won't be on Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Fun!,Southwest always tries to make air travel less of a travail and certainly succeeded on this flight. A warm smile to greet us and stretching exercises before landing made this flight memorable. It was also great to arrive early. A wonderful experience from start to finish. Early Bird checkin is a great service to allow a decent seat.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Nothing to complaint about,"I have nothing bad to say about Southwest, they are always on time, but in this case, we arrived earlier than scheduled.  Most importantly, we arrived safe!  The crew is very pleasant and friendly.  Some even have a comedy side to them. :)"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,CMH to Las Vegas,Southwest is hard to beat. Customer service is great. No hidden or extra charges...such as hidden baggage fees. Most economical no frills airline in which we fly 90% of the time.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Good flight, GREAT crew, ...other passengers?","I am disabled, and because of my disability and the meds, I have become a ""person of size"", requiring 2 seats,  had knee surgery 2 weeks prior our flight. Being first to pre-board with my care giver, we got the bulkhead, and with my ""person of size extra seat"" with a card that I placed on the middle seat,  Boarding was almost complete, with about 75% capacity, then, a woman, whom by the way, should have been considered a ""person of size"", but instead was a ""pos"", as she tried to force her over sized body in the reserved middle seat until i showed her my ""this seat is reserved for______. The flight boarded, we gave given customary bags of Dove chocolates to the crew who were very gracious for the chocolates, as they are individually wrapped and it's our way of showing appreciation for their service, one flight attendant was near in tears because they hardly hear the common courtesies of ""please"" and ""thank you"", instead they hear ""I want"". The crew was fun and gracious. I would fly them more often, if they went to more places that I like to travel to,  My main ""kudos"" for Southwest, other than their outstanding flight crews, is, they actually have non stop flights, which seems to have been tossed out the emergency door mid flight. I for one, would definitely be willing to pay a couple of hundred extra dollars to fly non stop."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Clean and On Time,"On time, pleasant flight crew and overall a bargain. Pass on the pretzels they offer and have a cocktail. It makes traveling more palatable. Enjoy!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,to New Mexico,"Flights on time.  Clean plane, nice people.  Terminal wa organized with pre-numbered seating.  No problems!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Airlines is my choice for senior with mobility issues travel,"Southwest Airlines has always assisted our mobility issues with a grace and efficiency during ticketing, curb-side luggage check with assistance to the gate departing and subsequent arrival.Have needed assistance for several flights over the past year.  There was not one problem or difficulty.Much of the credit must go to the highly professional employees at all levels of the Southwest organization.Should mention that the outstanding on-time departure for almost ever flight is a much appreciated bonus.Southwest is the best!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Dallas Girls Trip,I flew to Dallas with 3 of my friends. It was a wonderful flight with no problems. Check in and boarding went very smoothly.
Date of travel: August 2019,30,new rules do not help disabled.,"I was very disappointed that there are more restrictions on disabled boarding. I do not ask for a wheel chair, but my ankle, hip and knee are bad and I am considered totally disabled and I do have a disabled placard and license plate. Yet I was told I am not considered disabled by Southwest airlines unless they have to use one of their wheelchairs. So I have to stand in line while they let in lines of people. It is crazy that the personal of any airline would feel they could decide who is or isnt disabled enough to get boarded first. So as I stand in line with pain from my hip, ankle and knee, I am herded in like the other customers. Sometimes at a rapped pace because everyone is in a hurry."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great service ,I fly Southwest often and they always impress with their customer service. This flight was no different. The flight attendants were around the entire flight checking on the passengers to see if they needed anything. It’s always a pleasant experience flying with Southwest.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Our favorite airline ,"We travel a lot and it is easy to forget to review the airline that you travel on. In the last couple of years we have switched to Southwest Airlines and could not be more pleased. The service has been excellent both over the phone, at the airport and especially on the airplane. We appreciate that. We just took a trip and had three small grandkids with us as well as their parents. In addition my wife had tripped and was using a brace on her leg. Everyone was kind, patient and helpful. That is why we will continue to use Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Southwest, great as usual ","We were able to purchase fares from hobby to Maui for half the cost of the same route on United.  We had to stop in California but as I understand it, United flights have to stop in Honolulu so it’s a wash.Even better was being able to go out of hobby, a more convenient airport and much smaller so easier to get around. Best part was that SW had extra LUV on the flight and great spirit.  Even an art contest to keep kids occupied!  They don’t sell meals but gave out snack packs with crackers, cheese, pretzels, fruit snacks and mints.  Something extra for the long flight.Thank you, Southwest!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,AMAZING Staff,"Took the family for the (adult) kids first visit to Disneyland in August. Daughter has been wanting to go to California for years. Flight had a stop in Denver, must have been to let the business class customers off...After landing the crew was cleaning up a little and we decided to move up a little. In the process, I just made small talk with one of the members of the crew. Nothing special, just a few simple comments about the flight legs. He asked if we were staying for the third legs. I said no, getting off in LA. He continued to talk with my family, giving us advice and well wishes with our upcoming trip. Even mentioned that the flight was not going to be full so we could probably have some extra legroom. Told the rest of the crew we were heading to Disneyland and they started visiting with us. When we landed, he thanked us for choosing Southwest and to have a magical time at Disneyland. It was the start to a magical week. He could have just answered my question or simply continued with his cleaning but he didn’t. He took the time to talk with my family and in the process, started an incredible week in the greater LA-area with extra legroom on a 2 1/2 hour flight. So pleased with the service, that there was no question what airline I would a month or so later when flying to Vegas for business (and a little vacation too 😉). Thanks to southwest for how you trying your people. Excellent customer service goes A LONG WAY!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Great airline, great people. LOVE to fly SWA","Business trip on the front end, vacation on the back end. Loved everything about the trip. The attendants from Omaha to Vegas took great care of us. The flight back, we had more time in McCarran to people watch. The folks at the gate deserve WAY more credit and applause for putting up with so many “issues” brought up by passengers. It’s truly amazing how many passengers are experts there are in the flying game and absolutely terrible some people are to the airline workers there simply trying to assist each and everyone of us! I actually got up after about the third or fourth times and commended them for how well they handle the people that are down right rude, just because we were a little late boarding. Kudos to those folks on the ground for taking care of us as well as those folks do in the air. Shoutout to the crew in the air for taking care of us there too and for making up some time in the air. I will always look to fly SWA because I can see that the people absolutely care!  If anyone at SWA would like specifics from me, feel free to reach out. I can provide flight info and dates...the people make the experience enjoyable and make me want to come back again (and we just used the airline the month before to LAX with similar experiences). Thanks again for taking care of me, my family and all the folks to and from LAS!"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,NO BAGGAGE FEE,I fly with Southwest because of the baggage fee's.  The plane's are a little cramped but for the money it is excellent.  My airline of choice.
Date of travel: September 2019,30,One of the better airlines going to Disneyworld.,Really like the way Southwest works with Disneyworld to make sure your luggage is taken care of from your airport to your Disneyworld resort. Wish they didn't have to nickel and dime you just to make sure you are sitting with your family. Also wish they would do something about their stale peanuts.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Fall Trip,This was a good flight - actually got into Phoenix a little early. Check in was quick and the staff was very friendly.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Midwest Wedding Trip,Flights went well.  They were on time and really appreciate that bags fly free.  Elderly parents flew with us and Southwest allowed them to board early.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest❤,"We are frequent Southwest Airlines customers and have been for many years. When we decide to travel, we first check to see if Southwest has non stop flights there. We are always treated well by all Southwest employees over the years."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Love (Southwest Airlines) is always our first choice.,"The direct flight from Love Field to Birmingham, Alabama was everything we would want when flying. Great fares, two free bags, best available seats, on time, friendly and professional crew, and employees that seemed happy at their jobs. Also, Southwest flies to many of the easier airports to get around in, such as Dallas Love Field (instead of DFW), Midway in Chicago (instead of O'Hare), Hobby in Houston (instead of George Bush),etc. Also, they charge no fees when cancelling or changing flights. The one time our baggage did not make a flight was because bad weather messed up connections. They brought our luggage to our home in Fort Worth. We did not have to drive back to the airport. That is service!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,friendly and efficient,"Our flights to and from Albuquerque were on time, very efficient and had great friendly service.  They have a very easy and organized boarding system, other airlines should learn from them."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Pilot retires...last flight.,"SOUTHWEST AIRLINES flight out of Ontario to Phoenix, pilots last flight. Retirong pilot gets standing ovation at gate and a round of aplause as he walked down the isle shaking hands. At Phoenix, an arc of water engulfed the Aircraft.Great day, great flight."
Date of travel: November 2018,50,There is no other for me,If you can fly Southwest...DO IT!2 checked bags FREE...why wouldn't you??And they have great prices!I will only fly Southwest if it is available to me.
Date of travel: November 2018,50,Our flight,"Our flight was really good as it always is with Southwest Airlines.  In our opinion, this is the only airlines to fly.  Going to and coming from Belize, even going through customs, was a simple process.  We highly recommend Southwest for any flight in which they travel. Great airline."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Take Southwest if they go where you are going,"We flew home to Baltimore from Tampa recently after a stay in St. Pete Beach, Florida. October is a good time to fly from Baltimore to Tampa. A third of the plane was empty, so passengers were advised to sit in the window and aisle seats. It’s a short flight, so you only get a drink and pretzels. If you’re trying to get to the airport from St. Petersburg at rush hour, make sure you give yourself extra time."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Flight was  delayed again.,"This flight was delayed, however we did make our Denver connection and arrived safely in Boise.We still like SWA."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Easy, stress free, WIFI not working","Southwest always seems to deliver an easy stress free flight. Boarding is simple and fast. Flights always on time. I did purchase the WIFI and wasn't able to use it for anything I wanted to (ESPN app, Netflix, online games)"
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Delayed but offered $100 voucher per person to make up for it,"I traveled with a group of 45 people to Mexico. We were delayed once we boarded the plane due to some light coming on in the cock pit. They were so nice passing out free drinks and making sure everyone was as comfortable as possible. Then once we returned, they gave everyone a $100 voucher to make up for the delay. Southwest always has such wonderful customer service!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I love my Southwest Airlines,"Great customer service and the friendliest flight attendants in the business. Planes are generally very clean and I have never had a broken seat. Other than weather-related delays, they remain timely. When a flight is delayed or cancelled, I have been informed well beforehand. Great prices and yes, 2 bags still fly free!"
Date of travel: December 2018,40,Irate Customer Removed,"After a week in Las Vegas,I was returning Xmas Day to L.I. N.Y. A woman traveling with her husband began a tirade regarding her seat location.The flight attendant attempted to correct the problem and than left to continue her job.These passengers became disruptive again and within minutes a .Security detail removed them from the airplane.We continued on our way on time......Great Customer Service.. these pasengers continued to object and within minutes a security person came and removed them from the plane and we began takeoff...I was very impressed by this customer service...we were not delayed by these unruly passengers"
Date of travel: April 2019,50,I prefer Southwest over all other airlines.,"Southwest is no nonsense. You get what you pay for and there are no hidden fees. That is HUGE for me. They offer discounted fares and everyone is treated fairly. Even if you have a discounted fare, you  still have the opportunity to get a higher number boarding pass if you check in at the 24 hour mark."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Exceptional,"My friends and I were returning from our Grand Canyon and national parks vacation, our 80th birthdays celebration vacation. The crew joined in the celebration bringing us sparkling wine, bags of pretzels and cookies as well as a birthday card signed by the entire crew. Fellow travelers added many well wishes. It was a fun flight."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great flying.,Flying Southwest is always a great experience.  Easy on-line check in process saves standing in lines.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always friendly,"I fly Southwest 3-4 times each year. Often a child or two are with me, and th y are always friendly and helpful. The pilots and flight attendants are sure to greet them, ask about their flight, and let them know they behaved well."
n/a,40,Flight to Florida ,Our flight left on time and we actually arrived a bit early. Our only problem was that southwest changed our return flight and we ended up with a long layover in Dallas. It went smooth just made for a long day. If your a larger person like I am I suggest asking for a seatbelt extender from the flight attendant when you board. It'll make your flight much more comfortable.
Date of travel: June 2019,30,Travel Dificultiea,Southwest was less than accommodating when travel became delayed and subsequently canceled.  Gate agents were not helpful and I ended up changing travel myself on the app.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,What A Disaster,"On September 27, I begun my journey to Seattle Washington on a Southwest Airline flight. We departed Orlando at 9:30 am, and arrived in Chicago Midway airport around 10:20 am (time maybe off some). Before I even touchdown at Midway, the Southwest app stated my next flight had been cancelled. When I asked the flight attendant about the cancellation, they seem to take offense. One attendant say she would inquire about the cancellation with the captain, she never came back to followup with me. I had to ring my call bottom twice more, before the other attendant made an announcement about the connecting flight cancellation. Then we were directed to go to a terminal counter agent to get rebooked. I immediately became alarmed, because my luggage was checked on the plane. I needed my luggage because I was going on a cruise the next day, September 28th. When I got to the terminal counter, they rebook me for a flight at 8:00 pm. I would have to wait all day in the airport. I asked the agent why my fight was cancelled, and the agent stated because of weather. She stated that thunder was in the area. I stated to her, that planes were come and taking off, why was my plane cancelled. The thunder came later in the afternoon noon, and planes kept taking off; but more and more flights got canceled. 8:00 pm came a went, and my last flight was cancelled. I asked to get my luggage from Southwest, because I had booked a flight with America Airline the next morning, they refused, even when I told the agent I was taking a cruise the next day, and it was imperative that I get my luggage. She stated to me, not to worry, that my luggage would be on the first flight out the next morning, and would be waiting for me in Seattle Washington, at Southwest baggage claim. When I got to Seattle Washington, the next day, I went right to Southwest baggage claim, but I did not see my luggage, and I started to panic. When I ask them to check my claim ticket, the agent informed me, that my luggage would not arrive until 3:30 pm. Thats when reality hit; I would have to go on the Cruise with NO CLOTHES!!!! SHAME ON SOUTHWEST!!! They offered me money to buy clothes for a cruise that was departing in 90 minutes. Where did they think I would be able to go shopping at. On board check in was at 4:00 pm. Southwest took the wind out of my cruise; If I was not cruising with someone else, I would not have gone aboard. This was the worst experience of my life. This airline did not care that they destroyed my spirit in that moment😞"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Long business Trip,"As always to be expected, left on time, funny and friendly flight attendants, exceptional service in flight. I fly SWA 99% of the time. Only time not, when they don’t have service to my destination. LOVE SWA!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Crew,The whole crew were great.  They went out of their way to service our needs on a long 4 hour flight.  And they did it with a smile and friendly manner.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"On time, nice seats, but packed","First time flying into Love Field.  Must say it was a pleasure.  Nice airport close to Dallas.  Southwest flight was excellent from start to finish, even with a packed plan.  flight attendants were efficient and provided excellent service.  Would definitely take this flight again."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Good, friendly service","I do not fly often and had flown a competitor airline in March of this year.  I decided to try Southwest in October of this year as I had been very dissatisfied with the March choice.  Southwest served a snack and drink choice which was a nice touch, not having that with the previous airline.  The crew was friendly and courteous and asked several times if I needed anything.  I am glad Southwest hasn’t forgotten how to treat customers with care."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Domestic Flight,"Southwest is no longer a low cost airline.  Our flight was two hours late leaving although I received text messages advising of delay.  Unfortunately, I was already at airport.  Car rental access is not good with luggage."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight to R & R.,Southwest is always my first choice in airline travel. Like the availability of early check-in. Like the idea of not having assigned seats.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Mexican adventure,"It was a difficult trip because of the Boeing aircraft grounding. However, Southwest worked extremely hard to keep promised scheduled, which they did. The only downside was having to go to Denver to clear customs which was a nightmare."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,A good value but 'Early Bird' is a scam,"Southwest is my go-to airline because of their flexibility with rescheduling and choosing seats. However, what they don't tell you is that if you don't buy Early Bird or check in promptly, you could lose your seat (since they overbook some flights). Given that Early Bird prices have increased significantly, this is a lack of 'transfarency' on their part in that Early Bird amounts to a hidden fee needed to guarantee your seat on the plane even though you've already paid for it."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Flew to denver from columbus,Searching for a flight for my sons wedding i chose southwest. a little confusing at at first but i believe we will fly again on southwest.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Great Airline...Fun, Friendly and Efficient!",When possible I choose Southwest Airlines. Prices are great and service is dependable. Love being able to check 2 bags for free!
Date of travel: September 2019,40,On time and convenient,Efficient and friendly from check in to flight to baggage claim The boarding process works well. I wish other airlines would use it on flights within the lower 48 states.There are no frills but fast and efficient service.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"No issues, smooth flight","The flight was smooth and there were no issues.  The flight attendants were friendly.  I love that you can check 2 bags for free...no need to have a carryon to stow.  I also enjoyed the app you could download to watch movies on your phone or Ipad.  My only complaint was that when I checked in 24 hours prior, it did not have me and my husband boarding in the same section.  Luckily, I was able to snag 2 seats for us together.  It seems that the system would recognize that there are 2 people with the same confirmation number and check them both in at the same time."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Great Airline,Southwest Airlines provide good service at a great price. The flight was short and very comfortable. Checked luggage is included in the price which is great.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Friendly, fun airline",Southwest consistently provides excellent customer service and entertaining flight attendants. Plus no charge for 2 bags. Midway is a much less congested airport to fly from than O'Hare.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,These seats,"Saved some money flying down to Atlanta to rent a car to go to Tuscaloosa for some Bama football. Southwest saved me $200+ From the crazy prices going into Birmingham, but these seats were not made for a normal sized adult. The festival seating arrangement that Southwest has is insane. However you get what you pay for. The flights were on time and the staff was pleasant."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Two Bags and we're gone,"We looked at the other airlines going to Cancun and found lower fares, however, after adding a baggage charge there was little or no difference.  With Southwest we are allowed two checked bags...imagine that!!Now if all we were going to do is sit in the pool or lay around the hotel, we could have just had a carry-on, but we planned to do some SCUBA diving and there was a loose requirement to ""dress formally"" for the evening meal.  So, the extra bags came in handy. Having the bags also allowed us to return with gifts or other purchased items.Southwest would get maximum stars if their boarding and seating process had reserved seating with seat selection online.  Having to call, go online, or use the SW app to get a number to stand in line for the ""cattle call"" boarding, is not only inconvenient but borders on the ridiculous.  Also, when boarding families with children the policy is to board the ""A"" lines first and maybe even the ""B"" lines.  So, when a family of 5 (2 adults and 3 children) there were no in line seat available so people were giving up their seats to accommodate the family.  And this happened twice on this trip! Seating is a little cramped, especially for an international flight, but the seats were comfortable enough.Mmmmm...pretzels!Baggage claim was good for the whole trip, although a little confusing in Houston going through customs, picking up bags then finding the bag re-check outside and returning to security again. The flight attendants were great and attentive, if needed.Flights were pretty close to being on time as well.Except for the seating issue, I really enjoy flying Southwest."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always the friendly skies on Southwest,Whenever you are going to fly out of the country and back into the US you get a little nervous.  Southwest made our trip worry free with all the help we were given.  we had some passport scanning issues and they stepped up and helped us right away.
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Southwest Airlines,"Southwest airline is a budget carrier , kind of bare minimum but  making up for it with the great service and friendly attitude. Seats are wide enough, clean enough, schedule is convenient. I use them 6-7 times a year. All & all: recommend."
n/a,50,Perfect flights,"Flew to Vegas...them to San Jose a week later...then back to Columbus a few days after that...Southwest has the best flight attendants and pilots...never a bad experience...on time, and even ahead of schedule..."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Flight,"We fly Southwest more than any other airline. We’ve never had an issue.  Flights on time, friendly and entertaining flight attendants.  This flight was no exception.  It is worth the charge for auto check in, if you are choosy of where you like to sit.  I also enjoy the free entertainment choices on my IPAd while in flight.  Nice selection of TV and movies."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,stellar service as always,Southwest was great as always. The staff was helpful to the point of one of the pilots helping disabled passengers down the ramp. The price was a great deal and the lay overs were just enough time to get to our next gate. We will always fly SW if possible.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Late takeoff; ontime landing.,"Because of an equipment change for the incoming flight from Pensacola, the plane started loading about 20 minutes behind schedule.  We still landed on time.  Just one issue -- someone stayed in the rear lavatory for much of the time it was safe to walk about the plane.  A flight attendant should check the lavatory whenever someone is in there for more than 5 minutes or so, especially on a flight that is in the air for only about 90 minutes."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Everything clicked.,"All in all, a very smooth flight.  Left on time; arrived a few minutes early.  I give the flight attendants extra credit for beginning the flight safety drill with an annoucement that they have someone's wallet and the owner should speak up before they sell it on EBay.  That got everyone's attention, and a good laugh."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Herding cattle,"Flying Southwest is economical because you can check two bags for free. But they don't assign seats. They board you like a sheepdog herds cattle. I have a difficult time getting up and down the ramp due to a disability. I can make it, I just need extra time. Our first flight, they let a group go first THEN the wheelchair bound & us board second. I was glad to have the time to board. The folks toward the end who travel together, don't always get to sit together because others SAVE seats for their friends or family. Not fair! That shouldn't be allowed. The plane was so full (understandably) but not comfortably. Had a better experience flying home."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Nice flight,"The flight was comfortable and on time. Of course like all airlines the seating is a little cramped in economy class, but that is to be expected. Service was good, and the price was right I have no complaints"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Will fly again,"Friendly service.Clear instructions.Easy seating procedure.First two bags free.Good treatment of families with children.Inexpensive inter-island flights!Since they began service in the Islands, I've already flown four times (two trips), and plan to fly again soon.As a Hawaii local, I prefer Hawaiian Airlines when possible, but they can't beat Southwest's competitive prices right now."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"On time flights, egalitarian seating","I like flying Southwest - straightforward operation, bags fly free, democratic seating (once you get used to it) & reasonable amount of time between connecting flights in Chicago."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Flight was good but the flight attendants were not really friendly,The flight was good and went fairly fast for a three and half hour flight.  It was unfortunate that the flight attendants in the back were not very friendly and didn't serve my needs very well.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Best airline,"Anytime I’m planning on flying, the first airline I check is Southwest Airlines.  Amazing service, good on time performance and bags fly free!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,It was a good flying experience,"Maintenance of perfect Timing is the basic philosophy. The check-in, boarding the flight and the baggage handling was all a cool affair."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,August 23  Flight to Orlando,Southwest Airlines is the best airlines to fly from Connecticut to Orlando . All personnel are friendly and go above and beyond to help customers
Date of travel: August 2019,50,First time flying that long.  Wonderful,Flight attendant on way home was very entertaining  flight was smooth  went by fast this was my worst worry. Never travelled this long
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Great, Quick Painless Flight to Cabo!","Love the quick painless flight to Cabo!  So close but a whole different world.  As usual, SWA rocks!  Snacks were a little delayed, but hey, we can live without pretzels!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Southwest Seating Disappointing,"My wife and I traveled together, but the seating was so spread out that we were not sitting next to each other. Had to sit in different rows. Airline had a football team flying to Phoenix and they were scattered all over the plane. Made the flight very unpleasent."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Southwest airlines is a decent flight experience,"OK - here is what i like about using Southwest and what i don't! 1) Lovefield airport is an exceptionally convenient location to fly to/from and that makes a huge different in why I use Southwest. 2) Changing flights dates is simple to do (Albeit that it will always cost more than anticipated) at any time. 3) The staff is generally nice and in good spirits. Here is where they can improve: 1) Most planes are very old and the seats don't have much of a cushion let. 2) Bathrooms are extremely small and difficult to use. I am not sure how someone with a bit of physical challenge can even get in and out of there.3) No charging outlets. In this day and age, this should be a standard for all planes."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Excellent for shorter flights!,SW is extremely reliable.  Terrific for shorter flights.  I don't use them if the flight is any longer than 3 hours.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Perfectly Fine,"I had an ""A"" group boarding (I checked in 24 hours in advance), so I was able to snag an aisle seat near the front. The people in my row were quiet and cordial. The plane left on time, the flight was smooth, they landed on time, and there was not a big wait at baggage (a little longer than I would have liked, but not too bad). Reasonable and boring... just what you'd hope a flight to be!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,No baggage fews,"I strongly dislike paying baggage fees and if at all possible will avoid any airline that charges them. My wife does not enjoy flying and our flights (including connections) went very smoothly. We were traveling pretty lightly but checked a bag a piece anyway. No hitches all flights baggage arrived w/us with no apparent physical impact on our bags. Service was routine w/the occasional humorous safety messages that actually require more attention than the routine ""slide the catch into the buckle.., blah, blah blah. We did experience 1 delay of about 30 min. but the gate staff went through the trouble to confirm that no connecting flights were in jeopardy. A very successful trip."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,No frills but good value!,"We appreciated the two free checked bags and tolerate the nonassigned seating of Southwest. The second leg of the flight (from Phoenix to Ontario) was not as crowded so my husband and I had three seats to ourselves.  It was quite a jaunt from where we arrived in Phoenix to where we boarded again, but we made it.  I did have a security problem, but it was my own making. I was bringing back New Orleans beads and I had them in carry-on instead of checked luggage and the showed up in security and. required hand checking which slowed everything down.  Attendants were nice. The last part of flight into Ontario was a bit bumpy with a hard landing, but otherwise, things were great.  Luggage arrived promptly at the baggage claim.  All in all, everything went well."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Traveling for work...,"I frequently travel to Texas and the surrounding Region. Southwest is always my first choice. They are easy to book, no nonsense and I've yet to have a material issue regarding my travels."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,On time depart with arrival ahead of time.,"If flying out of the Dallas area, including southern Oklahoma, you can't beat Love Field in Dallas.  Parking is on-site and convenient, while much less expensive than at DFW.  The Southwest flight experience is hard to beat, from the check-in counter, gate agents, and aircrew, they really work at making flying pleasurable.  Something to keep in mind is that if you are going for a trip requiring checked baggage you can't hardly beat Southwest's pricing.  The flight cost is typically $20 higher than other airlines, but there is no charge for up to two checked bags.  AA wants $25/bag each way."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,As usual it was a great flight,"I use Southwest almost exclusively. This flight was for business. As usual everyone was very professional and their attitudes were upbeat. No complaints , ever. Thank you Southwest Airlines.PS I miss  the peanuts"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,The best crew ever and a real improvement in service,Crew is always helpful and pleasant.I noticed an improvement in departure and arrival on time with both.  I prefer to fly southwest when ever possible. I wish they would fly into Canada
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I always enjoy flying with Southwest,I recommend flying with SOuthwest. The best value in flying. The flight attendants were very nice . wanna get away fares are the best
Date of travel: September 2019,40,fun airlines,"Flow on this airline in September 2019. The fight attendants, and the pilots were very friendly. The only thing I had a problem was that the seats are not made for large people.Also being a large person I could not use the tray because there was not enough room for the tray to come down in front of me.Each row had three seats. with little leg room."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Honeymoon,My husband and I almost exclusively use Southwest Airlines. Often times they seem more expensive than others but with many airlines now going to not only paying for checked bags but also paying small fees for carry on and even charging per set it all evens out. Plus southwest almost always has a fun crew.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Putting a little fun into flying,"For the last four years, I have exlcusively flown with Southwest Airlines. I have regularly used their mobile app with great results. I have found the prices reasonable, and the entire staff to be exceptionally friendly. Their pre-flight instructions have a little humor (especially appreciated for those of us who fly regularly). Luggage has always promptly arrived. (At Logan, it was starting to get on the carousel as we arrived at the baggage claim)"
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Expected more from Southwest,"Since Southwest has just started flying to Hawaii we thought this leg of the trip would be made more special. Southwest used to be the “fun” airline. This was just a very long, cramped and dull flight. The flight attendants looked exhausted, there was no food available (just more snacks) and an offer of pineapple/orange juice. Come on Southwest!  Your flights to Vegas are always fun. Put some Southwest style into these flights as well.  Fake lei? Some food for such a long flight? Hawaiian music? And please make landing in Honolulu easier.  Arriving, deplaning outside, walking forever to get to a bus that then takes you to baggage? Exhausting!  For most people this is a bucket list trip of a lifetime, make the trip start off with a Southwest BANG!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Trip to Vegas 2019,"We love Southwest flights ... except this trip. Made reservations in April and paid for early boarding at the same time on both ends of flight. We received group A . One stop in Atlanta and on to Vegas or that's what we thought. In formed of another stop in San Antonio. I'm sure it was due to planes pulled out of service but we should have been informed. The return flight started off bad. Our early boarding was in group B. Then had to have a kicking 4 year old the whole non-stop trip!! And we mean the whole flight. Mom was oblivious to this. Will we fly Southwest again,heck yes. The staff was great."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,"Not fond of ""find your own seat""","When making reservation, I thought saving $300.00 on two tickets were worth the low cost fare on Southwest(SW).  After the fact, I don't think it was worth it.We had never flown SW.  Unfortunately I booked a flight with one stop between Atlanta and Las Vegas. For boarding we were towards the end of Group B.  Most of the good seats in the front of the plane were taken.  On the return flights, a family of four, took two sets of two seats and one set of three.  Seven seats for four people.  When I said something, the women jumped all over me.  She said she wanted to sit with her kids.  Her kids should listen to their mother, follow her and not do their own thing. We were behind them, her girls took seats in front and later moved to the back of the plane to sit with their mother.  SW needs to stop this type of behavior amongst their passengers.  The seats are large and have ample room in front of it for your legs. Seats appear to accommodate a large person.  There were no TV.The service was hit and miss.  Sometimes we got served drinks and chips while other times we were skipped as were other passengers.    On the return flight, they had issues with their plane and we were stuck in San Antonio airport for over five hours.  They should have checked their plane prior to putting us on a plane that had crack in it.  They could have had an in air crash.  They gave us a $200.00 voucher.  We would like cash since we do not want to fly SW again.  We were told they don't give you cash."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,5 stars!!!! TOP NOTCH,"Wonderful experience!!!! The reservation was easily made on short notice, incredibly affordable, the staff member checking us in was delightful, the bag didn’t cost $ to check in, and the seats/leg room was bigger than #AlaskaAirlines hands down!!! Way to go SW! You have my business for travel to/from HI for sure!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Why get off to get back on?,"On our recent trip from St. Louis to San Jose, Calif., we had to make a stop in Nashville, of all places. And even though we were to continue on the same plane, we had to get off and wait to re-board. It would be much more convenient and comfortable, especially for older travelers who have mobility issues, to be allowed to stay on the plan, or at least save our seats, so we didn't have to lug off our carry-ons and then lug them back. Generally, I prefer SWA over others. But this was an annoyance I would have rather avoided."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Favorite Airline ,"What I love about SWA is that they are always super friendly and helpful.  Oh and did I mention how hilarious they all are.  From the pilot to the flight attendants and even the workers at check in, they all crack me up.  It’s just an easy simple system that makes flying enjoyable.  Keep up the great work!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Business trip to Phoenix,"Always nice flights with Southwest. About 98% full. Not crazy about flying thru St. Louis but Midway on the way home. All the airlines should follow Southwest - boarding, luggage etc. BEST airline to fly"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Imperial Session 2019,"On August 15th I took the 0655am flight from Sacramento to Baltimore.  This was a non stop flight.  As always the service from checking in at the ticket counter, through the boarding process, and throughout the flight, was great.  we even arrived in Baltimore 20 minutes early.  I choose to fly Southwest whenever I can.  The Flight Attendants always make the flight enjoyable.  They enjoy their job.  I highly recommend Southwest if they are fling to your destination."
Date of travel: November 2018,40,Alright for the money.,Cheap tickets but same as delta. Seats worn and staff not interested that your there. Delta has nicer people and this flight made me feel like I was being move like a stick of wood from place to place. Even when serving us it was more of a process. Go for more with delta unless you don't care.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Perfect flights,"Southwest is the best for our lifestyle. Easy baggage check in and even in the early hours of the day smiles.The crew were super as usual and 1  actually sang the star spangled banner on it""s anniversary,so cool and what a voice.As always will fly again with southwest."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Stewardess Middle name JOY,"I'm telling you, she -Joy made this flight (1482 Sept 25 St. Louis to Newark) the most memorable. She had THE best personality, kind words, and great sense of humor. I do believe if you could clone her Southwest would have it made. I am so bad with names her middle name JOY isn't hard to forget.  I hoe you appreciate all she does. Thank you K.Orlando"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight change alert,"I like Southwest as it is the most affordable plus changes in itinerary are minimal.  I  was fortunate to receive a flight alert change by text and was able to get my flight rescheduled easily.  I actually got a better flight from Omaha to Tucson, my home town.  If I hadn't gotten the alert I would have shown up at the airport and found out that I could not make my connection.  I appreciate this alert.   The agent on the phone was so helpful."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,LOVE SOUTHWEST AIRLINES,This airline is our #1 choice for flying if they service the city we are going to. Love the free two bag ability and always enjoy their bantering back and forth with passengers. Other major airlines can’t compete with their quality of service and the personality of their employees. AWESOME AWESOME AIRLINE!! Oh and if you fly out of Raleigh (RDU) they have their own terminal. Keep up the great work.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Customer Friendly Airline,We have flown Southwest for over 30 years—this airline understands the term “customer service”!  If schedule issues arise they don’t leave you holding the bag—they work with customers on every front to see that we safely and comfortably reach our destination.  Thank you Southwest!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Nice flights,"No problems! On time departures and arrivals, no complaints. If you want something to eat be sure a purchase food prior to boarding. Peanuts, cookies, pretzels and something to drink.  That's it folks!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I 💜Southwest!,I love using Southwest for air travel. The 2 bags free and free flight changes are a big drawing card for me. I usually buy the early bird fare too so that my traveling companions and me  are able to get seats together. Flying out of Cleveland is very easy to do also. Southwest flights are usually on time if not early.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Why fly any other airline?,"Unless no other options exist, why fly anyone but Southwest?  Employees clearly love their jobs which shows.  The comedy routines of the gate staff and flight attendants put everyone in great spirits which translates to a delightful travel experience every time!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight,"Great flight, flight attendant very nice. Right on time on all segments. Boarding Buick and efficient"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,ON TIME,I fly SWA on this route to Ontario several times a year. Change planes in Vegas always fun. Always on time!!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Easy,They are easy to deal with.  no baggage fees. no frills. change flight and still get credit for 1 year
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Excellant,Trip went smooth.  Treated nicely.  Good crews going and coming back. Everyone encountered was very helpful.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,User Friendly Airline,"I have flown Southwest numerous times, now.  The staff is always very helpful and friendly.  I think the prices are very reasonable and affordable.  I have never had problems with delayed flights or being bumped.  I do wonder how the open seating works if you are traveling with your family, though."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Stayed over there for 3-and-a-half hours to wait for the next non-stop flight.,"When I arrived inside the Salt Lake City International Airport, after I easily checked-in at the Southwest Airlines Ticket Counter, I ate lunch at McDonald's and then it took about three-and-a-half hours to wait for the next non-stop flight from Salt Lake City to San Diego. When they were waiitng, I first call the Hostelling International location at Gaslamp Quarter in Downtown San Diego, and then they've accepted the wait list for check-in for the next three nights over there, just in time to celebrate the Labor Day weekend."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Non-stop flight from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City.,"Well, right after I got off work two hours early, I took the Torrance Transit Bus Line Number 8 heading northbound to the LAX Airport Transit Center, and then I took the LAX Shuttle Bus to the Southwest Airlines Terminal (#1), and then quickly and easily checked-in at the Southwest Airport Ticket Counter, and then went on a very smooth non-stop flight to one of my favorite destinations in the Desert Southwest: Salt Lake City, Utah."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"2 Free checked bags, no change fee! from Honolulu to The Big Island!! wow!",The best of all is that you are allowed to take 2 checked bags for free! We check our fruits and food from the Big Island to Honolulu and it arrived in perfect conditions. It seems workers love their job at this airline because all our checked items arrived perfectly fine...that doesn't happen in most airlines.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Smooth flight ... little to no turbulence,Bags fly free.  No change fees.Best of all were the smooth flights.Southwest Air is my favorite airline.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Comfortable cross country flight,"Southwest Airlines is a good moderate cost alternative. I don't mind the boarding process, or minimal food and beverage service. I love the no fee luggage, each passenger is allowed to check two 40# bags. Our flight from Denver to Cleveland was uneventful and pleasant. The time change is certainly rough, taking off in the morning, losing those hours, the length of flight and landing in the evening right before sunset."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Short bumpy ride,Nice flight with a friendly crew. They get the drink service done early so everyone can get buckled in for the bumps that the Rocky Mountains cause.
n/a,40,Flight to Orlando FL,"Southwest Airlines is a great carrier.We flew from Philadelphia international on Southwest Airlines they are a great carrier they have economy only flights pick your own seat. They have 2 free bags of checked luggage. The aircraft was clean and fresh. The flight crew was very friendly and attentive to the Passengers. Free wifi music, movies, and TV shows.They have a great on time stats and the prices for tickets were very reasonable.I will fly Southwest Airlines again."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest delivers ,Smooth flights and great crews. Major storm over DFW delayed our arrival but once it cleared  we were able to land and make our connection with ease. My only complaint is Southwest doesn’t fly to Asia.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Right on time and sooo nice!!,"We took four flights (total) for our trip to and from Seattle,  WA.  While each portion of our journey had its own highlights, it is important to note that we had pleasant, helpful staff on each flight.  The loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished pretty quickly and politely.   On one portion of our flight, we watched crew treat a mom traveling along with two little ones to some extraordinary support.  On another portion, we celebrated the 67th anniversary of a couple of fellow passengers.   All in all, it was lovely."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Empathy,I broke my toe on my vacation. Two of the flight attendants made sure to offer me more ice for my pack. And checked on me a couple of times. I thought this was great customer service.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Heather takes Control,"On Friday, the 27th of September, I had business in SoCalTraveled from Oakland to Burbank Flight 1585The flight attendant, Heather was thrown every annoying passenger behavior in the book...The woman behind me had  her large carry on at her feet.  Heather asked her to put in the overhead and the woman explained that it was Okay because she only had one bag...after reasoning with the passenger, Heather got her to move her bag.  It was a full flight and there was no overhead storage.  Heather removed her personal luggage to make room (problem solved).  The passenger next to me was on the phone - loudly, of course - and he  was asked to end the call as we were pushing off.  Heather stood there and starred him down.  Eventually, he ended his call.The woman in front of me must have purchased two seats because it was necessary.  Before the flight, she requested some sort of tea that may have a ""digestive effect"" and wasn't sure if she could fit into the lavatory.  Heather said, ""We will not be serving you that then""As the flight progressed, Heather was in full control of the cabin.  She  gave genuine smiles to everyone she regarded.Nice job, Heather !! I hope to see you on my next flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Vegas Trip,"I was able to get a direct flight. I paid no baggage fees. Flew on one of their new 737 800 planes, Much roomier."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Southwest has slid downhill,Two flights today on Southwest. Worst two flights I’ve ever experienced.A refresher course on customer service for flight attendants is strongly suggested.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,VEGAS AND UTAH VACATION,"Airport experience was great and the flights were both on time. Employees were very friendly and helpful. Our first Southwest flight and won""t be our last."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Waco, TX trip","This 3 hour flight was without incident, price was right and personnel were friendly. I will, from this date forward check with them for future flights when planning my trips."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Select Southwest,"Love being able to check a bag for free.  Flight was on time, friendly staff and clean plane made for an enjoyable flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Kim Tillman with Southwest was the BEST,"Shoutout to Kim Tillman with Southwest! After a very long day disembarking our cruise and the porter swapping out a piece of my sister’s luggage for another passenger, then waiting three hours for it to be returned and seven hours in the airport with five kids ages 2-12 she stepped in to combat the boredom before boarding our flight. She pulled out games and prizes for ours kids and a couple of others, then offered adult passengers $20 travel vouchers for the longest paper airplane flight. I think several people received one, and we appreciated the fun immensely."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,On time Easy to Change,Southwest is my go to airline. We frequently fly between Chicago and Denver and i never worry about luggage or flight changes.  They really are easy to do business with.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Treat People EQUALLY,"My suggestion: Just like everyone else, I paid for the same flight so everybody deserves to be treated equally. It doesn’t matter what nationality you are the flight attendants need to treat people with the same respect and politeness and NOT discriminate. Because I’m a woman you treated me that way. When the customer complains you have to follow procedure and not automatically take sides based on nationality. If another customer has a complaint let both sides talk not just the white American. I’m a Vietnamese woman and I believe that I was unfairly treated on this flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Another good flight on SW but dirty plane (flight 2154 from Tampa to Atlanta),"Boarding: Orderly boarding. In-flight service: Very nice flight attendant for our section. Even for such a short flight, she offered a second round of drinks.Fullness of flight: Not full, at least 25-30 open seats.Cleanliness of plane: As usual with SW’s fleet, this 737 could use a good cleaning. Some grease on the seat back and detritus on the floor. Stains on the ceiling, including some ugly dark liquid stains on the ceiling. Dirty planes are a pet peeve of mine because visible dirt indicates lack of sanitation and a breading ground for germs. See photo of ceiling stains. Would give SW five stars for this flight if the plane was cleaner. Why can’t domestic carriers in the US learn from JAL and certain other foreign carriers that actually clean their planes?"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"always on time (well, almost)","I fly SW every chance I get, they are amazingly consistent and I really love their free cancellation deal..."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Another great flight,"I love flying Southwest Airlines ,the crew is always friendly and on occasion entertaining ,this was a short flight little over an hour and the flight attendants still managed to serve beverages and snacks with time left to spare. The other best thing is the 2 free bags you can check,you never know how much you take for granted until you fly another airline and you’re paying anywhere from $25-40 dollars for one bag which we had to do on flight back from Raleigh due to southwest not having a non stop flight going back.So I have nothing but love for Southwest Airlines ,great service,great landing and 2 free bags checked,can’t ask for more."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Left on Time and arrived 25 minutes Early,"Excellent flight, the crew went out of there way to be friendly only issue we had was my wife's walker was damaged after the crew stored it upon reaching the door but we were quiclky contacted my a claims representative and they had it replaced within days"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Generally a good experience,As is typical of SWA flights this took off on time and arrived on time. They had to wait a minute or two before docking which is unusual for this airline. The seats are uncomfortable which makes a longer trip like this a bit tiring. I’m 6’2” which makes it difficult.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Vickie Fisher,I love flying Southwest. The fact that I can check my bag free is stellar. Also they have the best staff. Always helpful and pleasant. They are my #1 choice for flying.
Date of travel: June 2019,40,Timely & Very Friendly,"I've probably flown on at least 40+ flights in the last 5 years. These flights have been with at least 5 different carriers and I keep coming back to Southwest. As an economy flight provider, I find their customer service to excellent and the attendants doing their pre-flight boarding ""show"" once you're seated before you actually take off is quite humorous. I'm sure it's probably comforting to newer fliers but I have definitely laughed out loud a few times at the subtle humor they inject and it's always different. Out of about 25 flights, most arrived early, only one got canceled (incoming hurricane, and understandable), and about 2 were late do to disorderly fliers ( a bit out of Southwest's control). My latest flight into BWI, was smooth with the ususal humor, VERY friendly staff, and a flight that arrived about 10 minutes early. They're consistently VERY GOOD and will always be my first choice for economy flights."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Dependable and Friendly,"This is probably the most predictable airline I have flown. Virtually all the time, the flights depart on time and arrive early. There is no drama during boarding, the crew is helpful; they even help you find bin space for your carry-on! Did you read that, American and United. The airplanes are modern and clean. You can text for free through the app."
Date of travel: May 2019,10,Ow I know what a lamb feels like,"Southwest has made flying like cattle and doing it cheaply part of their motto. Flying like cattle remains but it’s not cheap. $600 plus for a round trip to BWI, u line up like cattle, 1-7, A B C, the veteran Southwest flyers tell u if u r in wrong line. Then the cheap people jam the overheads, got to save the baggage fee, food sucked, airplane was dirty, trip was a nightmare. Never again, realize flying is a terrible experience unless you fly first class to Europe. Southwest keep making cute commercials but your service and 3/3 seating BLOWS. U won’t ever see my wife and I again, I have two legs not 4 as your cattle car planes and service SUCK. Bon Voyage"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Another flawless flight,"Southwest continues to be our favorite airline.  The people make the biggest difference.  They are curtious, professional, and do it all with a sense of humor."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"On time, as usual!","We recently took a trip to the Florida Keys. As Southwest does not fly to Key West, as in the past, we flew into Fort Lauderdale. This is the closest location that Southwest flys into. We only fly Southwest."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Fantastic service from SWA!,"First, let me say that Southwest Airlines is my ""go-to"" airline so this review is biased. The consistent high quality customer service and outstanding hospitality keep me coming back. In addition, I appreciate the reliability of the schedule (on-time performance), the cleanliness and upkeep of the facilities and aircraft, and the spirit of teamwork exhibited by the employees across work groups."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,On Time / Efficient / Comfortable,"The flight went without a hitch.  The last few times have been disappointing because of delays, etc... This flight went well and the service was very good.  I appreciated the efficiency getting to the gates and boarding and de-boarding."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Interestng Experience,"One-way flight to Louisville. First time on SW, and found the loading process a bit unique. But, it seemed to get everyone on board, left and arrived on-time. The crew was efficient getting drinks and snacks to passengers. Likely would fly with them again."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Probably one of my favorite low-cost airline,"My round-trip ticket was cheap, of course. I love how your first two checked bags are free. I didn't have to worry about packing my face wash and other beauty products in reference to TSA standards. Not too much a fan of the first come, first serve seats. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and would recommend this airline. The flight was very comfortable for a short ride."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,A Great Airline,I am partial and biased toward Southwest Airlines. Our flight was another on time departure and arrival.  The Southwest hospitality is always present on the flights. LUV Southwest Airlines.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Do NOT go on this flight,Truly a terrible trip. The reason is the flight attendant was very abrasive and discriminated against me. She treated me very poorly and took my personal purse and handled it very careless damaging my belt. She then proceeded to ask everyone else what drink they wanted except me.
n/a,20,Filthy plane!,"Incoming aircraft arrived late.  Crew more interested in on time departure then making sure plane was fit for next flight as well as on time departure. Many seats had liquid spills in them, floors fithy with crackers, garbage etc.  Gate crew came down jetway yelling to board quick so they could make on time departure.  Not good.  Dirtiest plane I've been on and I've been on allot.  Come on Southwest, you should be better than this!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Southwest Route Changes,"Heads up to travelers in the Bay Area. Southwest is eliminating their direct flights from Oakland to Puerto Vallarta starting next year. Also, it seems there is only one flight from PVR to Oakland that leaves at 110 and goes through Denver, which makes absolutely no sense. Have loved being able to fly direct from Oakland and not sure now what airline, if any, flies direct from Oakland to Puerto Vallarta or will now need to fly from SFO on a different airline."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always Fly Southwest,I fly SW all the time for work.  And the last trip was for pleasure!  I love being able to use my points for fun times.  And SW is always great.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Outbound flight was great, return was just average","Flight to Orlando featured a 737 800 series (not the MAXX obviously) but this airplane is larger and has more headroom than the 737 700 series.  We had a great flight crew, they were attentive, fun and made the flying experience great.On the way home, we were squeezed into the 737 700 series and the flight crew was pretty much uninterested in their job it appeared.  Southwest is what it is...no food to speak of and everyone is jammed in, but a little kindness and friendliness from the crew makes a huge difference."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Excellent airlines,"Weve been traveling on southwest airlines for a couple of years, pretty much exclusively . We recently flew from Burbank CA to Pittsburgh PA via Las Vegas. Everything about the flight was good  even though the plane was virtually full. The wait time between the flights was just enough to allow us to get something to eat"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Disappointed,"So I've always been an advocate for a Southwest airlines. But oh how the times are changing. Lately I have been completely disappointed. I convinced my other half to fly with me on Southwest although he really wasn't a fan Pryor and we literally watch the baggage people throw our luggage from the plane to the baggage carrier. My luggage is bright blue so very obvious and his is a pelican case. my friend of my bag was literally ripped open when I got it back from baggage claim. also we are military I called because he was coming home from deployment and asked if they had any offers for military coming home for families to be there to support their loved one. There wasn't even a second thought any options nothing. She just said no. Way to support our troops right? The last time I flew with Southwest airlines I had called to get a cheaper flight because my mother was very sick. I explained to the gentleman exactly what was going on. When I got to the airport my ticket was nowhere to be found. I ended up having to pay $800 round trip when when I called book The ticket I could have only paid 400. I had to prove to them that I had given them money already and they credited my ticket price but that was all that they were willing to do. They also used to have the best customer service, but not anymore. I have multiple food allergies and put it in the comments on one of my tickets but they were unable to assist. I have to say I will never fly Southwest again. our troops are over there fighting for our country and yes people are still dying but they're going to act like they don't matter. Going to act like no one needs to support them when they just spent 9 months to a year in a foreign country with no one. That is my final straw."
Date of travel: September 2019,20,Late in both directions,"From PHX to SFO was 3 hours late.  SFO to PHX was 1 hour late.  No explanation. We looked at the AA and UA flights about the same time, and they were both on time."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Way up North,"As good as it gets.  Not the most roomy flights, but ON time and GREAT prices. Found this true on all four connections.  Great folks."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Be careful of Southwest partner Budget Rent-a Car,"Please, if you are flying Southwest to Denver, do NOT rent a car from Budget.  We booked an economy car through the Southwest site.  When we arrived at the Budget office, they told us it would not be suitable for the area around Breckenridge and pressured us into renting a different car.  The difference in the quoted price for the economy car and the sedan was almost $500.  $828 for four days of rental!!!  When we drove to Breckenridge we discovered that the roads were fine and that a small car would have been all we needed.  We felt totally duped. They lied to so that they could rent us a larger car. I complained at the desk and received no satisfaction.  I also wrote to Budget and have yet to hear from them.  I contacted Southwest and they sent a polite letter saying that they have no control over their partners, but they DO have control.  They can choose to un-partner with them."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Flying me where?,"I flew from New Orleans to San Francisco. I got my flight changed about a week after. The receptionist told me that “it’s only one plane.” Come to find out its one plane, but it has 2 stops, one in Las Angeles... and then they flew me to PHOENIX! I was mad. But the flight attendants were awesome. Shout out to Karen, Renee, and Jennifer flight 2475! Thank you for cheering me up!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great repeat flights Houston to Williamsburg,"This was my 3rd Southwest trip in a year from Houston Hobby to Richmond, Va with a layover in Atlanta.  This time the flights were not full.  The attendants were careful to space people out in the plane so not too much weight was in one area.  We had a bit of a delay due to some equipment that had to be replaced for the pilot, but the attendants were pleasant & upbeat.  Since I was not driving after arrival, I opted to use one of my drink coupons for an adult beverage.  The flight attendant told me to keep it for the next time.  Luggage was quick to come at the airport - no problems.  Great flights!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Nice uncrowded flight!`,"As we were traveling right before the expected impact of Hurricane Dorian a lot of people had changed their flight so we were 2 of 45 people on this plane.  Everyone had their own row with room to spare.  The crew was very friendly and relaxed, plane was clean and the flight was on time."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,1st Time on a plane as an adult!,"Well it was my 1st time on a airplane as an adult. Taking off was fun, I love to power. But I'm scared of heights & get sea-sick if I try to read when someones driving in the vehicle so. After the inital take of the plane must have a lot of turns in and out of BWI and I had to shut the window. But once in flight it was really good. I'd do it again. The drivetime was est @ 23 hrs one was so it was worth it."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Meh,"Flight was decently priced. Flight attendant (tall, curly haired blonde) lacked people skills. The entire crew was very meh and lacked energy. For such a long flight, would’ve enjoyed some hospitality. Basically had to beg for a beer, was turned away at the restroom with a laissez faire “go to the back, this ones for the captain” (which I get) but overall, not impressed. Do your job with pride, people. And maybe a smile once in a while..."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Disappointed in military support,Every Southwest flight I’ve taken in the passed offered Military to board with the families. This flight that was not considered and military was not mentioned.  I’m not upset but just disappointed since they are normally very supportive. The flight also had no WiFi so that too was a bummer.
Date of travel: April 2019,10,torture,"I hate the boarding- process, the incredibly small seats-the watered down flat soda, no leg room. I am an average sized woman-there no place to put your elbows since the seats are so small."
n/a,50,Flights,The flights both ways we're great we visited my son and daughter-in-law and both ways we're worry free and the flights were early getting to our destinations the staff were friendly and helpful to us will go Southwest again
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"southwest is very friendly, all flights were on time which is crucial to me when flying",the only negative i have is that i paid top dollar for my flight to go to Phoenix for a funeral.  Its hard enough to fly across country for such an untimely sad death and to add the hardship of a costly flight doesnt seem right
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Nice flight,"Although the flight was a little late, it was a good flight. Southwest has very nice employees. Safety is the most import service offered by airlines, & we arrived safely.I think assigned seats is a good idea. Everyone takes an isle & a window. There are too few seats together that are available."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,It was an airplane flight.,"I am not an avid commercial plane flyer. I prefer to drive wherever I need to be. I'll fly only if I am time constraint. The plane left the ground, flew over the United States and safely landed. I had no treats on board. I slept most of the way to St Louis.End of story"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,annual trip to saratoga racetrack,southwest provides the most inexpensive airline travel.first two bags are free saving about $120 round trip.connections too are good.so are r the employees.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Flight to Denver, Co",Never a problem when we fly Southwest.  We had a plane change in Chicago.  All our luggage arrived in Denver and back in Buffalo at the end of our trip.  Love Southwest!!Just wish the seats were a little wider
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"As usual for SW, on time and uneventful","Early, early flights are often cheaper, so I took the 6:15 to see my daughter and her family.  SW is the way to go.  I packed 2 suitcases so I could take my grandson ""stuff"" for his 16th birthday.  Staff is always friendly, filtered water on concourse appreciated."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Friendly staff,Don't love boarding process but it works.  Hated my seat with no window.  Good choice of free drinks.  On time...AA needs to learn how LOL
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Easy travels with my family,"It was our first flight with my whole family, our 3 year old son and 3 month old daughter. . . Scary lol. But being able to check in our bags, stroller, and two car seats meant we had less to carry on. What a blessing! We knew it wouldn't be as easy as when we were single, but with the policies Southwest has our check in and boarding was so easy. The staff was professional and did their duties. We were slightly delayed due to the previous connection but not too bad. Snacks and drinks were the same as other airlines offer. It was convenient having access to movies on our tablet and phones. The only thing I wish Southwest would install is outlets to charge mobile devices. I have flown other airlines but always appreciate the low cost and good service Southwest Airlines provides."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Average ,Take off was a little bumpy of a take off and landing. The on flight crew was okay average. The flight home had this one flight attendant (a guy) who kept everyone laughing and at ease. He really made traveling a little calmer. Most of the other crew were really dry. I’m not looking for everyone to have the same demeanor but smile and BE SINCERE. Thanks for asking
Date of travel: September 2019,40,No Frills & No Baggage Fees,"Southwest is usually my only choice. SWA offers: No baggage fee, no boarding pass needed but Early Bird seating is a must for families, handicapped or connecting flights (exit plane quickly from the front seats) friendly flight attendants that care about their customers. On time departures & arrivals."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great airline,"SW is almost always on time, and the crews are hilarious! We have flown with them dozens of times. I've never had a problem with baggage, or overhead space being available."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,I WILL NEVER BELIEVE IN THIS AIRLINE AGAIN,"I was traveling from Orlando to Seattle Washington in order to pick up a cruise ship heading to Alaska. The worst travel experience in my life took place on September 27,2019. Before I even touchdown, Southwest sent a message on their app, that my connection in Chicago Midway was canceled. Everything just got worst from there. The first excuse was weather, although my flight was early in the morning when no weather was affecting the area yet. I was rebooked twice and each time, the flights were cancelled. Once the Airlines say the word weather, the traveler is thrown under the bus, and is treated pure disrespect. No clear answers, and left to accept what the airline rebook for you, or figure out a new best way to get to your time sensitive location. On this day a watched a airline meltdown. Travelers plans were destroyed and no compensation was offered. Shame on Southwest!!! If I did not act swiftly I would not have arrived on time to get to my birthday cruise. I immediately had to book a flight with American Airlines, at O’Hare Airport, which cost me hundreds of dollars out of my budgeted trip. The icing on the cake, was the lie I was told about my luggage. I was refused the ability to get my luggage from Southwest, even thought they cancelled all most all the fights at the end of the night. They told me my luggage would be sent on the next plane out in the morning. This never happened; once I arrived on my American Airline flight, I went to Southwest baggage claim, where a received the news that my baggage would not make it in time for my cruise. They offered me $600 to go shopping, at 3:00, for a cruise I had to on, bo later then 4:00 pm. So I am on my cruise with no clothes to change in. This has really a disappointing birthday cruise, but I have tried to make the best of it. Shame on Southwest! Don’t believe those high ratings tou see about southwest airlines, I no longer do!!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Insider tip flying from LA to Bay Area,"I fly a lot from LA to the Bay Area for both business and leisure on Southwest. I tend to avoid SFO since it is known for delays (thanks to Karl the Fog) and difficulty in getting into or out of SFO up from/to San Francisco or the South Bay. When I need to be in San Francisco proper, I always fly into Oakland airport and then take BART into the city. It’s simpler, less expensive, and much quicker than SFO. Amenities in the airport aren’t fantastic, but it’s an easy airport to navigate and security lines are never an issue. And the best part, Southwest flies a late evening flight back to LA, so it makes it perfect for day trips up to SF. (Note: if I need to be in the South Bay of the Peninsula, I fly into/out of SJC - which is a fantastic airport.)"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,THE BEST FOR LESS,Had wheelchair accept all attendance was excellent. I always fly southwest once or twice a year to Las Vegas.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,What a pleasure to fly!,"What an enjoyable flight this time!  After flying other major airlines and being delayed, and frustrated, Southwest was a breath of fresh air!  Our flight was on time.  Boarding went smoothly.  We landed on time.  And it was all done with pleasant, caring, smiling attendants and employees."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Quick and easy,The flight attendants were very welcoming and the boarding and unboarding processes were quick and easy with no delay. The team was very courteous and attentive even for such a short flight.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Another great flight,On time no problems both trips to and from treated very nice. I think they could come up with better snacks though.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Good value,"The flights were on time.  We had connecting flights both ways and they were both easy to connect.  They only offer a snack on the plane and soft drinks,water and coffee for no charge so if you’re hungry, bring food.  We did not have WiFi out of Denver to Cleveland which was disappointing.  On a bad note they destroyed my suitcase but I reported it and they handled it immediately"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,the best,"the best airline to fly to puerto vallarta, you can take 2 suitcases plus a caryon at no baggage charge, as I buy a lot of stuff when i'm there I need 2 suitcases to bring it all back, the flights attendants on board are the greatest at helping you if you need something, I only fly this airline where ever I go."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Montego Bay,"Celebrated my Sisters 40th Birthday, the check in, TSA, departure,  flight and landing were all were smooth sailing. Couldn’t have asked for better, unless a drink ticket would have came with it."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Excellent Customer Service and On-time performance,"Southwest is my favorite airline and they proved themselves again on my last trip with them.  We traveled round trip from Austin to Columbus, OH.  This review is of our 2nd leg on our return to Austin from Nashville.   In addition to the normal great features of their airline (check 2 bags free, good prices, no itinerary change penalties), we watched them show the more serious, important side of the airline.  About a half hour into our flight, just after reaching cruising altitude, we had a serious incident in on our plane where a passenger sitting 2 rows ahead of me passed out.  One of the flight attendants happened to be an RN and went from friendly drink server to a type A director of the effort to make sure this lady was OK.  She cleared the aisle and moved those in her row to other seats, made sure she was breathing and began taking her BP.  She got one of the other flight attendants to hook up a direct communication with medical help on the ground and communicated the lady's status.  Fortunately, she came to and the plane proceeded to Austin uneventfully, but her quick decisive action was commendable. Once the emergency was over she made sure the passenger was comfortable, and stepped back into a provider of drinks and friendly smiles to other travelers without missing a beat.  If I ever have a health incident on a plane I'll be blessed if this flight attendant or one like her is on my flight!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,I ❤️ Southwest,"Always on time, best fares and two bags fly for free. Personal are polite and on occasion funny before take off and upon landing."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Chicago,I really don’t fly anything else but Southwest. They are the best and usually always running on time. I will say our flight back to Orlando was postponed and they immediately got us on an earlier flight. Thank you Southwest for being so great!!
Date of travel: September 2019,10,If you fly into Hobby from Cancun be prepared to go through security again after customs.,"Bottom line, if you are flying back into the United States from Cancun, Mexico through Houston-Hobby be prepared to not only go through customs but also to have to go back through airport security all over again. It is a terrible set-up that I have never seen before. I do not know if it’s because that’s just the way Hobby is constructed, if it’s Southwest, or due to the flight origin of Cancun, but my family who flew on American Airlines through Dallas didn’t have to go through that ordeal. I will not fly international on Southwest, at least not through Hobby, in the future. Which is sad because before this experience I liked Hobby."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Terrible service aboard Flight 307,"The more I fly Southwest the more I’m convinced something has changed in their corporate culture. The flight attendants in this flight were just terribly rude and slow. There was no turbulence or external factors, but drink service on a vacation flight didn’t start until almost the end, and then you were forced to finish before landing. And at that time they distributed the customs forms to be filled out, right when they also ask that you put up your tray table and put your bags away. What am I supposed to write on? If I ever go back to Cancun I will look at other options. The pilots were cool, though. I had fun chatting with them."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always the Way to Go!,"I've been flying SW for almost 20 years. If I can do it, I always use them. I'm looking forward to a trip to Hawaii."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,OK to CA,Flight and service was fine.  Really like the two checked bags free.  All went as expected on all flights to and from Sacramento.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Favorite Airline,"Flight left on time, landed on time.  We had a layover in Denver for less than an hour.  Both flights had wonderful flight attendants.  Service was good.  Burbank is a small airport - no jet-ways.  By exiting on stairs or ramp, we were off the plane in record time. Luggage arrived together and we were on our way.  We always fly Southwest - it's predictable and we are always met by such friendly folks at every part of our flying process.  I took advantage of the free Southwest WiFi to watch 2 movies on my iPad.  I've never done that, but found it easy and enjoyed both movies."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Music City,Great flight and great service.  Non stop to Nashville from Raleigh is very convenient.My only complaint is that the plane is always completetly full.  Good for Southwest!
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Oakland to Newark,"We initially booked non-stop flights for our vacation from Oakland to Newark.  About a month later we received an email from SWA stating they had rescheduled our flights which now required a layover and plane change in Chicago (Midway) for both directions of our trip.  .  And, we noticed they had forgotten to transfer the early bird check in we had already paid for.  In addition, the WIFI flat out didn't work on one flight and kept dropping on another.Usually SWA is better than this, hope its not a sign of things to come."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always a fun ride with Southwest!,I always enjoy flying with Southwest.  Service is always good and the flight crew go out of their way to make the flight enjoyable and humorous without compromising safety.  This flight was no exception.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Vacation flight to New York,"Flight was fine, as was the service. However, the 31/2 hour lay over in Chicago was too long. At least the Chicago airport was clean and good food."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Goes to HAWAII!,"When Southwest opened up flights to Maui this past spring, I was super excited. Not only is Southwest my favorite airline to travel, but they were now heading to paradise. :) The crew on board from Austin to Dallas; Dallas to San Jose, Ca; San Jose to Kahului and back were all amazing. Each crew member on every flight were so generous, professional and overall so welcoming. I wish that Southwest would start flying intercontinental so that I could enjoy them for all my travel needs!"
n/a,50,A little R&R ,My wife and I with another couple made a trip to Pompano Beach for a week. We took Southwest Airlines. The service was great and the staff was on a roll. Very funny. The flights were on time and the luggage we there fast also.We love flying Southwest.
Date of travel: December 2018,20,Wheelchair & Handicapped,Wheelchairs And handicapped are put against a wall and waiting to board first but a lot of times people will walk up just in time for boarding and they are let on first they are not disabled and the handicapped are still waiting  after being there for hours and I feel that's not right. I believe I'm not only one that feels that way. Please can you or someone please check into this I've gone through this with Southwest airlines more than three occasions and I'm in a wheelchair cause I can't walk  nor stand long. Please help
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest is the BEST,"When traveling I always look for SWA flights first.  No other airline gives the flexibility with no extra charges.  Staff is friendly, courteous and appreciative. Over the last ten years I have only flown with one other airline, twice. I fly once or twice per year."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Tampa to Richmond ,"I love Southwest. Our flight was late because they had a mechanical issue and had to switch planes in Nashville. NBD, things happen. They still got us on quickly and we were less than an hour late getting to Richmond. You can never go wrong with the price, two free checked bags and all the leg room. I got an entire aisle to myself. Don’t forget to download the southwest app before getting on the flight so you can enjoy the WiFi."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight,"Our original returning flight was a connecting flight going from San Francisco to Denver to Kansas City.  We got an email from Southwest a few weeks prior to travel that they had changed the flight from San Francisco to Vegas to KC.  We were very happy with the change as I think the airport in Vegas is not as crowded and congested as Denver.  We were very happy overall with our experience.  On our return trip home we were in a new plane with more leg room, making that very nice."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,crowded,"Just a typical low budget flight, attendant was  ok but never smiled seemed like she rather be somewhere else. Everything else was fine."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Trump National Doral Miami,we love the southwest even some people makes a joke of not having swat we have found to be not an issues in all the years we have been flying we only has to seal separately twice we go all the way in back and land at same time as front seat by the time we get to restrooms most of the time no hassell. oh buy the way we changed from after lunch flight to late evening flight no penalty and it was little less on cost i can't complain we do miss peanuts
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flying Southwest Airlines,I use Southwest Airlines as much as possible.  I flew American Airlines 2 months before this flight and paid for extra legroom.  Southwest is more comfortable than the so-called extra legroom of American Airlines.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Review of Southwest flight from STL to NY.,"SW flight took off and landed near on time both to and from NY.  The return trip was rough enough in the air that a drink service was not provided.  I struggle to be able to see a difference in a Southwest flight and others that are more expensive.  We don't pay for luggage, get points in their program, and receive similar performance.  If you book early enough, you generally receive ""fly away"" discount pricing.  We do choose to pay $25 for priority seating, but that is still cheaper than others charge for one checked bag of luggage."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Who would not like to fly southwest?,"Whenever I have a choice I ALWAYS fly Southwest. They 'get 'em on and get 'em off' better than any other airline. It's no frills and NO BAGGAGE FEES. Most of the time their fare is considerably less than another other airline if you are able to purchase in advance and take advantage of their promotions.  If you MUST have a window or isle you can pay a little extra for a priority boarding  spot. It's still less money than most others.  A small thing, but I noticed when I went to pick up my bag in Jacksonville that every bag was placed on the belt with the handle facing out for an easy grab...a nice touch.  Other arilines could learn a lot from Southwest, alas they are too stupid to try."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Awesome!,"They were very nice. The flight felt like only 30 minutes. Awesome service! Thank you for a great, wonderful, kind service!"
Date of travel: September 2019,10,The flying experience from hell,"I hate writing negative reviews because they never make me feel better, but I decided to leave one because these flights (round trip Seattle to Chicago) were so brutal - I think the story needs to be told.On the way there: we had a scheduled flight for 5:45PM. at 5:45 on Friday we were informed that there were weather issues in Chicago and we’d get an update at 7. At 7, we were told that the flight had been canceled. Everyone rushed up to get something rebooked. We had a wedding the next day at 3, so we were desperate to make something work. We were told we could fly to Oakland, CA, spend the night and then fly out the next morning, so that’s what we did. Southwest employees kept repeating that they “can’t control the weather” so they wouldn’t cover the expenses. Like the non refundable hotel we had booked in Chicago or the second hotel we had to get in Oakland. Keep in mind also that most other airlines were still flying to chicago, but whatever maybe the weather was really bad, we had no way of knowing. Coming back is where it gets really bad: tried to check into our 8:30 am flight the night before and got an error saying we should check in at the airport. We didn’t think much of it, we thought maybe it had to do with the flight change. We got to the airport, stood in a long line to talk to someone, and were informed that the flight had been canceled due to “weather” again. This time we were in Chicago and could clearly see how it looked outside - no rain, no thunder, no lightning. No other airlines had canceled. We had also not been informed about this change over email or anything nor had we been rebooked for another flight when the cancelation happened, so there were no other flights for us. We were told to wait til the next morning, fly standby on one of the already packed flights, or spend the rest of the day in layovers. Again, they “can’t control the weather” nor did they take ownership for us not being rebooked earlier. We figured out later that our reservation had been deleted by whoever rebooked us the first time, which is just user error - no “weather” issues there. But they didn’t tell us this of course; gotta blame things on external factors if they want to get away with not paying for our $500+ in extra expenses we’ve had to pay. I ended up having to buy another ticket with a different airline at a different airport for that day to get back to Seattle - which cost a fortune. My travel partner took the 1 spot on the 8+ hour journey traveling cross country with multiple layovers to get back to Seattle. Truly a nightmare. Never again Southwest."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,VERY HAPPY,I have flown on a few airlines and this trip was really good. They have open seating..that means you can sit in an empty seat not already claimed by another passenger.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"As always, perfect service","Nothing new to add, but another perfect SW experience. Keep up the job job, luv this airline ... pun intend"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Pittsburgh to Tampa,"Love this airline and it has become my first choice to fly! Friendly staff and comfortable plane seating (I'm 6'2""). Efficient and on time!"
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Expensive,I got my dates mixed and got to the airport a day early. I was already there so I asked to change to a flight for that day. $410! I did it because I was already there and so ready to go home but it wiped me out! I understand a fee to switch days but $410 is absurd!! I will be checking other airlines for flights next time!!
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Pre book your boarding 24 hrs before and you should have a good experience,As long as you pre book your boarding section everything is very seamless with Southwest. Free bags included and good service. Flight left on time and arrived early which is always a plus. We’ve flown with them several times now and would happily recommend using them.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"On time, great staff!","I love Southwest - no surprises, left late due to air traffic control problems, and made up time into Houston, arriving early. The lead flight attendant was hysterical - a cool New Yorker who urged us to listen to his safety lecture because he didn't want to do any paperwork if we got hurt. He is awesome, made me laught and pay attention."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Good flight,"Boarding started on time and flight landed early in Vegas and return flight to Spokane as well, only thing I'd could be cheaper"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Par-Excellent',"Full service check in was absolutely amazing, kind, efficient & respectful.  Southwest has to be the best airline for travel with any kind of gun stuff.  Hunters should take note that this is the airline of choice if you travel with guns. They are respectful, diligent, courteous, kind & efficient.  They make the 2nd Amendment live."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Above and beyond greeting by check in personnel,"I was greeted warmly by check in personnel at the gate.  Specific instructions given which resulted in boarding without issues, seat selection I wanted and a smooth flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Worst Experience I’ve had With an Airline This Far! Stay Away!,"This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with. Flew from Baltimore to Chicago Midway with my final destination being Memphis. Got to Chicago and was notified that because of a storm, (which is understandable, no one can control the weather) our flight would be delayed from 7pm to 740. From 740 to 1000pm. Finally 1000pm to 1100pm when they notified us the flight was canceled and all 175 individuals needed to be rebooked. The rebooking process was horrible. There were only 2 individuals working to rebook. Then it became only 1. I waited 2 hours just to rebook. They gave me a flight to Orlando that would ultimately land in Memphis that was supposed to be departing in 15 min. 15min turned to 1 hour which turned to 2. The entire time, the woman working the gate is informing us we don’t have enough flight attendants or a pilot for a SCHEDULED FLIGHT and that we were waiting for a flight to come in and we would be good to go. Finally once that plane departed and was on its way, the whole flight was cancelled. Stood in line another 2 hours to find out the next flight wouldn’t be for another 27 hours and they refused to pay for a hotel stay when I had 1 whole day and 1 whole night before my new flight. No one was allowed to retrieve their checked baggage which hadn’t even made it onto a plane yet and made it seem like it was a BOTHER to them to have to do the work to take it off. Then informed us our bags would be going on to the destination without us, whatever happens to the bag once it gets there happens, and hopefully they’ll be there when we or if we get there because many people booked return flights back home or with another airline. The customer service was awful, the people were rude, in compassionate to people who had fully booked vacations and genuinely did not care to help. They rolled their eyes and kept speaking to us as if “there was nothing else they could do.” I would never recommend this airline and I will not be flying with this airline ever again. I’ll stick with Delta."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Not enough people to handle canceled flight ,Swa kept announcing delays for 5 hours then canceled and it took another 5 hours + to get rescheduled LONG lines Swa did not handle well
Date of travel: October 2018,50,Always enjoyable and a pleasure,"I love these folks!! I haven't flown with them recently, however, all times I HAVE flown with them the crew is friendly and accommodating. They go out of their way to take off and arrive on time and they always seem to work hard to make it a pleasurable trip. Thanks guys for a great job!!"
n/a,40,Always a Pleasant Experience,"The flight was pleasant and only encountered a slight delay, of which we were notified.   The all male, bronzed, amicable, flight crew was a pleasant surprise, and we hope to  have this encounter again.  Keep up the good work Southwest!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Love Southwest,"Its the only airline that allows 2 checked bags - no charge.   The employees at all levels are kind, considerate and friendly, and occasionally great fun too!  When I can choose, I choose SW!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Smooth flying,Recently I flew to Las Vegas for my sons wedding there was at least 22 of us on the same flight for the wedding it was a good experience the flight attendants were awesome they made two announcements giving blessings on my son and my future daughter n law it was great there are pros and cons using this airline because of the fact it has no assigned seats but I loved the fact it was a direct flight and they seat you accordingly with the 24 hour check in
Date of travel: September 2019,50,The best,"Southwest is our go to flight. Just love it. No issue of economy, basic economy. Each flight you can check in 2 bags for free. No issue with carry on bags. The best flight out there for practicality and flexibility. They are most of the times cheaper as well. 10/10 always look for southwest before booking ur flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Trip to the “Big Apple” New York,We traveled to NYC via Southwest Airlines. Our departure and arrival times were on time.  The Southwest staff were friendly and attentive to the needs of the passengers.   Awesome flight with exceptionally smooth take-offs and landings.  I highly recommend Southwest Airlines. Outstanding customer service!!!!!
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Destroying luggage,"We (My wife and I ) were flying 15-09 from san Diego to san Francisco.On arrival her bag (Rimowa Classic L) was completely destroyed (See photo attached) + 2 polos,Then started a long discussion what to do ( first they wanted to wtap the bag. second option repair - look at the picture). At the end they gave us another nylon bag.then came the discussion about the price of the bag.The representative who was clearly not used to Rimowa bags, took the wrong bag from the Rimowa website and threw in 20$ (?) per polo.As we were under timepressure (flight to Europe was waiting) we accepted a check (I even think that they were so slow in order to create the time pressure(.I consulted my bank (I did not cash in the check). Cashing will cost money.Total difference between what was offered en reality is 250-300$. On arrival in Europe In sent all the info (pictures, pricetag of the bag in Europe, price of the bag in the US. cost of cashing in the check).Today I got an answer from SouthWest . They are giving me politely the big middlefinger (the trust on the fact that the difference is not big enough to start a court case).Shame on them.If somebody knows a solution I would be glad to hear"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Quick and easy,First time on Southwest Airlines. Boarding was fast and easy. Nice to have free bags for a change. Got bags quickly too.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,LUV Southwest,"I will always love SW for no bag fees, pleasant employees and mostly reliable service.  There were no hiccups on this recent flight from Denver to Albany via Baltimore.  BWI is a great airport for a layover, so enjoyed crab cakes and wine before departing for Albany."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"On time, comfortable floght","Great flight to Denver. On time, comfortable seats, friendly service. Free checked bags is a plus. SW is consistent all around."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight Not Full!!,Flew roundtrip from Phoenix to Charleston.  There wasn't a direct/nonstop flight so we had to fly thru Houston and change planes then on the return flew through Dallas and changed planes.  The flights were pretty good.  They weren't full so we didn't have anyone in the middle seats and since we are both fluffy that was great!  Because of my husband's disabilities we were allowed to preboard and were able to get bulkhead seats that have lots of legroom.  Flight Attendants were very friendly as was everyone in the ground crews.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,"I love flying Southwest due to the low cost and direct flights, especially when traveling with a child"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"On-time, no bag fees","We fly SWA on nearly all domestic flights, partly because they are the main carrier out of BWI but also they have great prices and no BS with the bag fees and other charges. They don't have reserved seats so that can be an issue on long flights unless you pay extra to get ahead in the line. But the flights are usually on time as this one was and the staff are usually friendly and even fun."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I FLY SWA,SWA makes it easy to fly!  Their seats are comfortable with plenty of legroom.The flight attendants are friendly and attentive and the best perks come withthe Southwest credit card!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight simple upgraded seating at gate too,My last flight was to Las Vegas and back and the flights were on time great staff and they make everything easy. On the way back I asked 'at the gate' if I could up grade my seating to the front and for $50 I did so with choice in the first six rows at the window. Getting off the plane late at night and wanting to get to my car quickly it was worth it plus I won $200 extra sitting in the terminal waiting on my flight ;)
Date of travel: May 2019,30,sardine can,"If you care not to be so close to strangers, maybe get kicked from behind from another passenger you should try another airline. This airlines packs you in tight.  However, they will let families with children board after the A group boards.  This is to help families stay seated together that is nice."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,"Flight was on time. No delays. Many complain about Southwest because there are are no seat assignments. We were fortunate on our roundtrip with Southwest to be able to sit together . New feature! Leg room!! My husband is 6'3 and he was very comfortable. However , the trade off is very cramped bathrooms. Wow, u believable. But I would rather have the leg room than make a 360 turn in the bathroom. Another plus with Southwest , free 2 bags to check in.  Attendants are friendly and make the wait time less boring with their games."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best airline,Love flying southwest. They make it easy and pleasant to fly.  My bags always arrive. Flights are on time.  These people just know how to take care of their customers.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Another great flight!,I have always preferred SWA whenever I can but unfortunately they do not go to all the places I travel. Ilove this airlines with the lively crew!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Low fare, no fees","This was my first time flying with Southwest. They checked my bag for free. The flight left a few minutes early and my return flight was 20 minutes early. I am impressed. My flight was booked by my company but if I can choose, I will use Southwest in the future."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Overall best flight experiences,"Ease of check in, no baggage fees or extra add on fees.  Not always a fan of the advertising of ""sales"".   Don't seem to be actually the LOW fares stated in the ads.  Our attendents, one in particular, on our leg from DC to Kansas CIty was particuarly attentive and kind to the children traveling with us.  He was based with a crew from Houston."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Southwest Airlines to San Diego,I recently booked a flight from Tulsa Oklahoma to San Diego California for a week long trip. No problems with carry on items and first checked bags are free anyway. 😊 I had multiple choices of flights from Tulsa to my destination. I found a flight that was not too early in the morning so I was not rushed (10:45 am) and arrived at 1:30 pm Pacific time.  Plenty of time to sight see the first day. I had an easy flight to Dallas and then to San Diego. I used my Southwest app to access the Onboard WiFi and watched a movie for free on the leg part of San Diego. Standard items of service of a free non alcoholic drink and pretzels. Price was as usual economical and if you like getting from point A to point B Southwest Airlines is the way to go!!!! I returned home with no problems from Los Angeles back to Tulsa on Southwest. Planning on flying to Florida on Southwest before end of year.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Smooth flight both ways, on time too!","We always fly Southwest when we can. Needed 2 flights to get to Jacksonville and back. Going and coming home went very well, left on time and arrived on time, maybe a few minutes early. Clean planes, regular snacks, like the Ritz & cheese crackers the best!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Favorite Flight,"During my travels the flight and the connection were fine, staff was professional, cheerful and helpful. TSA was a little disturbing, but that is apparently their job.  I will definitely fly with them again."
n/a,50,Excellent airline ,"My husband and I traveled round trip from Corpus Christi, Texas to Nashville, TN. We were very pleased with the service and professionalism of the crew both in the air and on the ground. I will definitely travel Southwest Airlines in the future."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Is Fantastic - But Its a long flight so be sure to pay the extra $25 for early boarding!,"It's Southwest Airlines. That's really all i need to say. They are the best. I must admit i was a bit tentative about flying on a long 6+ hour flight with a stopover but everything was on-time and great. Previously, we always flew American Airlines flights to Maui - particulary the overnight red-eye that inevitably was almost always cancelled or delayed for hours and hours. The Southwest crew was friendly and made it an enjoyable flight. Even the stopover was ok - we didn't have to run like maniacs to the next gate. Would i want to be in a middle seat for 6 hours? No. So the extra $25 for early boarding is an absolute must on this long a flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Is A Great Airline!,"Great Airline: Friendly, Fun, Professional Service! - They make flying a fun experience while still professionally & efficiently performing their required responsibilities."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,In Good Hands,"We frequently fly and Southwest is our ‘go to’ airline. We fly Southwest because they are efficient, cost effective and have great flight routes. As frequent fliers we also utilize their credit card as a way to maximize our travel dollars. We often earn additional trips in this way.  We recently took advantage of one of Southwest sales to fly to Boise on a $49 fare. We planned a once in a lifetime trip to the Canadian Rockies because we got such a great travel deal.  We have many choices available and we always choose Southwest if we are able."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Consistent may count more.....,"Gary Kelly runs a great airline but he is falling into the trap of the other U.S. airlines.....yes, I am the one with the tape measure checking to see how many inches the seats have moved together since the last flight - ALOT!!  He probably has never used one of the bathrooms either - some very tall or very large people just do not fit.  BUT.....no baggage fees goes a long way, no change fees, etc.  Don't fall off the 'customer's first' wagon Mr. Kelly....."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,MAc Flight,"Very bumpy flight but the pilot warned us that he had it,  that he expected it,  and that he would get us above it as soon as possible.  Wind prevails in Denver and in Chicago!  Full flight!  Still great prices,  great seats,  and no surprizes.  Have flown SW out of Denver several times and its always a good flight with terrific crew members."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,No issues,Smooth flight with absolutely no issues.  Every thing was on time and service was timely and adequate.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight to Philadelphia,Live Southwest. Seats are roomy. Have never had an issue. Staff treats every passenger like they are special and are all friendly and helpful. Will be going to Texas in early summer. Airline? Southwest for sure.
Date of travel: February 2019,50,My Favorite Airline!,"My husband were returning home from a Panama Cruise and after the plane left the gate there was a possibility of an electrical problem detected. The plane had to return to the gate and we had to disembark. We were put on another plane in less than 2 hours, and we received an e-mail giving us each $100 credit the next day. I fly Southwest anytime it’s available because they are the most user friendly!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,St.  Pete Florida Aug @019,"Plane was on time.Service and staff were great.The flight was smooth and the landing was great.Plane was clean, restroom was clean. Good experience."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Thanks SW!  For bags flying free...Don't know why you're the only one that can do that!,"Big kudos to SW, who provides the bags fly free.  There's nothing worse than being nickeled -and-dimed by other airlines.  Also, a big SHOUT OUT to ""Susan C."" in New Orleans whose customer service was outstanding on assisting me with a flight change."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Discrimination,I was kicked off my connecting flight  because I had the smell of alcohol on my breath. When I just got off a flight with them where I had a drink. So obviously i had alcohol on my breath. They stated I had trouble keeping my voice volume down. I dont want to play the African American card but I felt so embarrassed and discriminated against. The passengers and I were already talking amongst ourselves when they escorted me off. Making passengers from the previous flight curious because I had been so nice and friendly on the last flight. I was not rude did not argue. But had to book an additional flight with another airline who had no problem with me or the smell of my breath. Southwest refused to book me till the next day and would not refund my flight. I've never had this problem with any flight and did not know drinking was not allowed. Needless I will no longer fly southwest nor my family nor my company which we use often. I'd rather pay a higher price then to be made a spectacle. I'd give them a negative rating if I could
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Another Pleasant Flight On Southwest,"The flight boarded on time and arrived on time in Denver.  The flight attendants were friendly, professional and efficient.  The aircraft was clean and comfortable.The second leg of the flight departed on time to Portland.Baggage was unloaded promptly and we were soon on our way home."
Date of travel: October 2018,50,Enjoyed our Experience with Southwest,"We flew with Southwest in May 2018 to Orlando, Fl. and back home for Disney trip. I did all the research and booking myself online. The booking was very easy on the Southwest web site and the price was of tickets was very reasonable. They kept me informed and with all the information I needed. The check in was easy and smooth both going and coming along with boarding. We really enjoyed our flight and all personnel were polite and courteous. I would fly with Southwest again and would recommend Southwest to others. I know it shows that we flew with Southwest in Oct. 2018 but is all the later I had to choose from. We flew May 2018."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best Flights,I purchased the early bird check in which I just love because SouthWest always has a full flight the crew was fabulous the flight was amazing not one bump and my second flight to my destination (Atlanta) was just a good as was the trip back.  NO complaints and I did not wait one minute to get my luggage and the curb check in is just the best!  They have the best customer service of any airlines...
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Flights will not be refunded,"I had booked a flight in October and then decided to cancel the flight due to it was a very expensive flight.  After waiting for my refund to arrive I decided to contact Southwest.  To my dismay they quickly let me know that they DO NOT refund flights.  Be aware we have had lost luggage, late flights, delayed time and time again.  If we did not have to use Southwest I would NEVER fly with them again."
Date of travel: September 2019,20,Not For Seniors,"We had no choice of any other airline for our trip. We chose business select tickets for max. flexibility.  We were not given A boarding pass for our connecting fight and had to go back through security to ask to have it printed.  We were given thewrong concourse for our connecting flight.  Four wheelchaircustomers were pushed to the wrong concourse before the announcement was made as to the change.  I have difficulty walking due to multiple back surgeries,  we had just made it to the gate to then find out that they were making the change.We understand there is limited seating space but had no other choice.  Check in is ridiculous.  We were helped at a kiosk by SW staff and handed 6 boarding pass cards in a stack and then given the long flight ID tags to put around the handles for the bags.  The only thing Southwest did was put the bags on the conveyor."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always above and beyond...,"I have yet to have a bad experience on Southwest Airlines.  Extremely rarely is there ever a delay.  The attendants are prompt and cordial.  Even the pilots try a crack at humor!  Once when my home airport shut-down, because of a psycho nutcase, Southwest did everything they could to get me to LA as soon as possible. (The re-route through Las Vegas, two hours late, allowed me to pick up an extra $80 winnings at the slot machine!!  You rock Southwest!!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Great - until you have to wait for your luggage to arrive,What I appreciate about SWA is they take your drink order from you directly - Non of those d*** drink carts smashing into ones shoulders of blocking the aisle for those that suddenly realize they must visit the lavatory NOW. Seriously that is a plus.  The minus is they seem to always take a long time to get your bags to you - versus Alaska Air.ALSO - Logging in 24 hours before your flight to get your seat satus can be a pain - but then you know when you will be boarding and you can pick your seat from what is available.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Southwest from Baltimore,"I love Southwest! No hassles free baggage, friendly not snotty F/A’s.My recent flight with 7 students was uneventful which is the desired state for travel. I suggest that if you’re doing group travel, try to purchase your tickets individually so you can take advantage of paid early seating. That is my only complaint. We pay more for group tickets than online prices and it sucks that my students are the last to Board and have to sit in the last rows for a coast to coast flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight and very helpful,"My wife is mobility challenged.  The flight crew asked how they could assist.  They made sure that we, and especially my wife, had as comfortable a trip as possible.  We traveled with our own wheelchair - it was ready for us when we deplaned.  This was my first flight in 26 years and I was definitely glad it was with Southwest!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Another great Southwest experience,I prefer to fly Southwest over any other airline. Always a great flight and exceptional customer service.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,We spent our 40th Anniversary on SWA,"This probably isn't fair because someone told SWA that we were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary flying coast to coast on Southwest. They made a big fuss over us and made us feel very special in only the way Southwest can. So, it was a GREAT flight and we really enjoyed it. Every leg was on time and we even arrived a couple of minutes early."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,I Long For the Days of Direct Flights.,"I love Southwest. Seems like this plane was new, a bit more room. Love watching Chopped on my laptop. Flight attendants were funny and kind, as usual. All was smooth. The only bummer is a six hour day for a 3 hour flight...but it is what it is. ❤️"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Short, easy flight","As always a little humor is thrown in by the airline crew to relieve the tension of flying. Cheap, quick (22 minutes)service between Oahu and Maui."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,They are Ready when you Are Ready,"Smooth and quiet was our trip, although we did have some noisy neighbors. It was a lunchtime flight but no one was too busy or rushed to answer questions or offer assistance. We enjoyed the flight with plenty of room, even in the middle seat."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Comfortable Flight,We had a early 7am flight out of Bradley International Airport.  We were able to get exit row seats which I like because of the extra legroom.  The service attendants were excellent as usual with the coffee etc.  The flight was smooth for the extent of 3 hours as usual.  Wi Fi was good on this trip.  Southwest is usually the only airline we use.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Very smooth non stop flight!,I highly recommend this airline!  They usually depart on time and arrive early or on time.  It was a very smooth flight.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Vacation to Floriday,Have always had good experience flying with Southwest Airlines.   Like the Southwest Credit Card to gain points toward a flight.    Just booked a one way flight for my husband using my points.    It only cost me like 5.60 for the taxes.    That is what I love about having this credit card and Southwest lets you check in two bags for free.    That is a money saver as well.    We continue to fly Southwest Airlines whenever possible.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,The Usual,Soutwest is the best for great economical travel with some drinks. Clean and updated plan and nice personal made the flieght pleasant.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Our plane had a broken radar, but the flight captain made our safety priority #1","We typically fly Southwest nowadays.   They usually have the most plentiful flights and cheaper rate.  We were leaving our vacation from cancun and we noticed they were not announcing a gate for our plane.  We were mildly concerned.  Then they announced the gate and we saw a flight delay.  They kept saying 10 more min.  10 more min. 10 more min.  But thankfully the Captain came out to the group of people.  He said the weather radar went down and he could not fly to Baltimore because of storms that way.  he said he could follow the coast to Houston Tx, so we were going there instead.  As you can imagine everyone freaked out.  Worried about whether the plane was safe and some folks were catching connections in Baltimore.  At first they said they were going to put everyone on a plane in Houston and it only had 33 seats, there were many more folks than that and everyone was worried.  No one knew what to do.  The pilot was calm and we were glad he explained everything in detail and answered questions.  Pretty big of him w/an upset crowd.  I mean things happen.  I'm glad they took our safety first.  I know everyone was unhappy.  No one knew what to do so I think pretty much everyone boarded the flight instead of being stranded in the Cancun airport late at night.  In the end they were able to bring in an emergency plane for all of us in Houston.  We didn't get into Baltimore till 1:30 am instead of 9:30 pm.  They gave us each a small credit. I feel bad for the folks going on to Boston.  Not sure what they did.  BWI was pretty dead at 1:30 am.  But,  I figure it can always be worse right?  I even asked for a free beer and got that.  :) .  We got home safe.   We thought they handled things well and we will still fly Southwest."
n/a,50,I LUV Southwest!,"Southwest is the best airline ever. Unfortunately,  they don't fly everywhere I want to go but, they can get you close! You probably will be renting a vehicle anyways,  at least that's my take..... SouthWest has been my airline of choice the last 5ish years. It's easy to book. Easy to change flights. If there is a cheaper flight, they'll give you credit towards a future flight. The snacks are great. I even recieved a free beer last year on a flight from Chicago to Pittsburgh,  I had a free beer ticket but the stewardess never took it! Free beer for me! Haha!I highly recommend flying SouthWest as you premier airliner!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,early morning flight with a good flight crew flight 4894,"Boarding: orderly SW boarding, no surprises Our flight was not fully booked, about 25 open seats. So it was a good flight. Being A-List, I was able to secure my favorite seat in an emergency exit. Flight attendants were all attentive, even early on a Saturday morning. That’s why I fly Southwest whenever possible! The cleanliness of this older 737 could have been better. Noticed stains on the ceiling and food/drink stains on the seat trays. In flight wifi didn’t work. So could not send WhatsApp messages. Demerits for SW not having its wifi up and running."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Consistently Consistent,"This is a nonstop to the Big Easy from Vegas, as always the Southwest gate agents were magicians at crowd control - a personal touch was clear in all the announcements and the inflight crew was professional and handled the full load with poise. Even with a medical emergency on-board they kept control of the situation throughout. I fly these guys often, and they always manage the process well. Perhaps not the melodrama of the ""big"" name airlines, but always consistent and never downside surprises - ""no surprises"" is how I like my travel experience."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Not A Fan Of Self Check In!,"We arrived at the Manchester Airport with lots of time to spare for our flight. I was not impressed with the self-check in.  We still had to take our luggage to a person to get it on the flight.  So, I am not sure where the savings comes in here since they had to have people explaining how to work the self-check-in. Even though the pilot forewarned us that we might have some wind turbulence on take-off and landing, we had a very smooth and enjoyable flight. The flight was not full, so we had the center seat empty. We were so surprised that our luggage was up first and we were on our way home in no time."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,First time flying Southwest...won't be the last!,"This was my first time flying Southwest Airlines.  It was wonderful!  From the moment I went to check in, they were helpful and friendly.  There was a little more leg room than when I fly other airlines.  I absolutely love that you can take 2 checked bags for no additional cost (because that really adds up on other airlines when you get charged both ways).  I wasn't sure how it would work with no assigned seats but the check-in online ahead and waiting in line in numerical order was fine for me.  I got a window seat which is what I prefer.  I will definately fly with them again!"
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Rude airline attendant,"9/24 Flight -Lovefield to SAT 7PM 44 flight.I have flown Southwest Airlines for many, many years, mutilple times in the last four years and I have never been served like this:  The male flight attendant took the drink order from the guy on my right, then skipped me, then took the drink order from the guy on my left.  I was surprised as was the guy sitting on my left!! When it came time to serve, he served the guy on the right , then the left and then me.  I have NEVER had this happen before. What happened to ladies first!  Heck I was expecting that, but at least don't skip over me.  I have my suspicions as to why...So much for that friendly airline I used to know!!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,consistently good service,Southwest is certainly consistent and you'll always know what you'll get.  Pretty much on time and excellent cabin experience.
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Great onboard service but...one total disregard,"We had serious weather delays and the gate staff and cabin crew did a great job both keeping us informed and entertained... on the other hand the the baggage handles left the luggage in the pouring rain partially uncovered for hours.  Despite the baggage handlers often walking by the carts, they never bothered to cover the cart with the tarp.  Our luggage was protected with a trash bag, but still was drenched!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Using Southwest Airline Miles,"I signed up for the Southwest credit card for the miles. I’m happy that I was able to fly 2 people, round trip, for about 20-25,000 miles and about  $22.00. We might not have traveled if we did not have this benefit. I would encourage others to look into this benefit as it reduces excuses for not going somewhere!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Great experience,This was our first flight on southwest and was skeptical of the seating assignments. We purchased the early check in option and it worked great. We had our choice of excellent seats on each of our flights. We will definitely fly southwest again!!!
Date of travel: September 2019,30,"Flew from Chicago MDW to Dallas LUV, then Dallas LUV to El Paso ELP on SWA","First leg from MDW to LUV was 30 minutes late, but the crew worked hard to get us out a bit earlier. Arrived at LUV and the second flight was delayed, but since no SWA personnel were present at the gate we were never sure as when we would take off to ELP. Just before we took off someone came and directed us, very unnerving.  Arrived in ELP late but with our luggage."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,We love Southwest!,"Always excellent service, no bag fees, and fun flight attendants, make Southwest our go to domestically."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Aweful Customer Service,"I had to miss the first leg of my trip due to a family emergency, and I was already in the area I was flying to. They cancelled the whole round trip, so the flight back as well. When I asked them to reinstate the return flight they told me I had to buy another ticket for the seat on the same flight they already charged me for. ARE you kidding me??? I talked to 3 different people and each one was rude and didn't care one bit they were about to charge me again for something I already paid for. Worst customer service I ever had, I will never fly them again. I asked for a supervisor to be refused by two people, then the third told me one will call me back in 24-48 hours. You can't make this stuff up, worst customer service I ever encountered."
Date of travel: June 2019,40,Check in early and still end up with a middle seat.,Southwest was on time and the service was very good.  Even though we checked in early the lousy way Southwest does boarding we had to both sit in center seats.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Decent short flight,It was a decent short flight about 1 1/2 hours from start to finish . I love the fact that they offer free luggage but they do boost the price a Little bit. The biggest problem is how no one chooses seating .everyone piles on a sits separately  and as you walk by and try and find a seat there’s no openings . It’s just frustrating
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest is My Favorite Airline,"I love flying Southwest! Their employees are very friendly. I love the fact that you get a boarding position and everyone lines up in order. Open seating is great, but for the three of us flying together, the only seats together were the last row. Those seats do not recline. But, the flight attendant had leftover soft drinks in an open can so he gave us extra.  I appreciated that! Be careful with connection times.....we were supposed to have a two hour layover in Houston Hobby, but due to our flight leaving late, we only had 45 minutes. It was long enough for us to use the rest room and grab a sandwich for the next leg of our trip. Southwest is my go to airline!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Always efficient, no-nonsense flying","Southwest is our choice for easy, no-nonsense air travel. Bags fly FREE, and with a Southwest VISA rewards card, we fly free too !!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Pretty good experience flying with South West,"I was traveling with my 4 year old alone, it was a pretty good experiencePros:-Staff at the check-in counter was friendly and helpful, I forgot my stroller at the check-in counter and they kept it there for me until I realized that i had left it at the counter-Checked in your car seat/stroller for free, also you get to check in 2 languages-On time, the check-in languages was loaded to the carousel really fast-Friendly Staff-Priority boarding if you are traveling with a kid 6 years old and under"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,ROUND TRIP WITH SOUTHWEST AIRLINES -- NOT BAD,"I haven't really flown Southwest Airlines, much but after looking for reasonable fair rate for this trip, Southwest won out.  It takes some getting used to having to 'pick a seat' when you get on the plane and a bit intimidating.  But I made it to St. Louis and back to Reno without issue.  Service was great, especially the sky captains (I think that's what they're called--who take your suitcases outside the airport--both in Reno and St. Louis.  A great convenience for me.  Although Southwest has nothing to do with the TSA people, leaving St. Louis wasn't pleasant with I was searched for the first time in my life--how embarassing!  But the staff of Southwest I came in contact made me feel welcomed and ready to serve."
n/a,40,Better snacks please,"Southwest is my second favorite airline. My two favorite things about Southwest are the no change fee and two bags included. If you want to have inflight entertainment, just download the app on your device prior to the trip. I just wish the seats were more comfortable and that the snacks were better. Also, a better boarding system. I do not like feeling like I am on a battlefield."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Simply the best,Southwest is by far my favorite airline because the flights are on time and the flight attendants are frequently humorous and really enjoy their job. Plus Southwest fares are usually much lower than other airlines and two bags of luggage is free and there’s usually plenty of overhead space for carry on bag.  They also don’t charge to make a change in flight arrangements.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Much cheaper to fly a family on Southwest,"Flying most of the way across the country in July with a family of four was promising to be an expensive endeavor, but then I stumbled across a Southwest sale and found nonstop flights IAD-DEN for much less than anything else we saw. We could check bags for free, including a carseat that was well cared for. With a 5 year old, we could board between groups A and B, so I didn't need to stress about checking in exactly 24 hours in advance while on vacation or shelling out extra for A group boarding. We never had trouble getting seats together, and the kids were thrilled that Southwest includes hot chocolate on their beverage menu.Only issue was that our carseat came out at oversized baggage at Denver airport, and it was really unclear where it was since there were two oversize bag areas. Also Denver airport's security line was crazy long -- thank goodness for TSA Precheck!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Only way to fly,"With 2 free checked bags and free carry on, friendliest staff, on time was a bonus!! I only fly with Southwest unless they don't service that area (very very rarely)."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Even when we're late getting a gate the flight was still on schedule.,"Southwest Airlines is the best buy for Chicago residents.  Their flights use Midway Airport which is more accessible than O'Hare, closer to downtown Chicago and less traffic.  My wife and I have never experienced any major delays (except due to weather) with SW, and the airline is good in sending out delay notices."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,STRAIGHT FLIGHT,Easy flight.  Recommend check in as soon as you can ; may get the A or B section.  Download Southwest App before hand.. was able to watch a movie on inflight wi-fi
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Airline,We have been flying Southwest for many years.  Their customer service is great and usually their flights are on time or earlier than scheduled.  We like their open seating policy and being able to check in 2 bags and carry on 2 bags without any baggage fees.  Also their get-away fares are very good.  Highly recommend.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight,"Southwest airlines is always where I go first to book. Not only they have reasonable prices, where you can check 2 bags for free. The stewards are always pleasant and helpful. The flights are 75% of the time are on time or early. Would rather pick my seats at time of booking, but it works the way they do it.Very satisfied customer."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Wife Vegas B Day Flight,We always fly the company plane (Southwest). THe service is awalys on the spot.  The only issue is that the Las Vegas outside baggage check in needs to stay open later.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Indy Flight,Southwest attendants were professional and efficient. Flights were on time. Planes were clean. Snacks were tasty and appropraite.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Houston - Denver,This was a very easy early morning flight from Houston Hobby to Denver.  The in-flight movie worked out well and had not jumpy interruptions like you see on United flights. I will continue to fly Southwest when the need arises.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,DUBAI TOUR,"Very friendly cabin crew.Flights were on schedule no delays inspite of bad weather,Inflight  entertainment need updating also look at the possibilities of some better snacks ."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Very nice employees!,We bought 'Wanna Get Away' tickets just a few days before & still got a great deal. My friends & I fly for another airline & go stand by. When we saw our planes filling up we got worried we would be stuck in Vegas & needed to get back to LA. The agents were so nice & helpful explaining how you line up & don't have an assigned seat. They let you check 2 bags for free & still bring on a carry on bag. The flight attendants were really friendly & helped us find room for our big shopping bags.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest SJC to MDW,It has to be the best flight. It left on time and avoided turbulence. The flight attendants were friendly and offered snacks a couple of times and the way they take your refreshment orders first instead of rolling the cart is really smart. Always love Southwest air.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,"In these crowded times, it helps to have efficient service","We had to fly to San Antonio twice in the same month.  It helped to know that even if the flight was full, the crews efficiency would get us there and back in the best time.  We arrived on time or ahead of time each leg."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Old reliable,Nothing that people haven't already know about SWA.  Old reliable.  More efficient cattle call boarding.  Funny flight attendants.  Great price.  Always fly SWA when able.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight - remember to check in 24 hours prior to flight,"Remember to check in 24 hours prior to your flight to get end ""A"" section seating or beginning ""B"" section or you could end up with a middle seat."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always love Southwest!,"Southwest Airlines is always my first choice! Everyone from ticketing to the flight attendants to customer service is always courteous, professional and friendly. Entertainment is not difficult to navigate and there's always a wide array of movies to watch for free."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Parents Trip,"We were on time, which is vital when you have a connection and a lot of that was due to the communication given by the crew. They repeatedly stated the flight was totally full and every seat needed to be taken. If you saw an open seat or overhead space don't pass it up. The short duration of the first leg, and a bit of turbulence didn't allow for beverage distribution but they apologized and again communicated it early. Great crew."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,HATE FLYING,I fly to Vegas at least 4 times a year. The flights are always full. I try to sit on the aisle so I don't have a panic attack. I am not a good flyer. I check my watch 100 times until the 3 hours are up. Then do it all over again on the way back.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Amy and Fletch,These flight attendants made my birthday weekend! Thank you for continuing to offer great service with a personality :))
Date of travel: September 2019,40,good experience,"Always appreciate the free bags, makes a difference; able to take our golf clubs on vacation.   Great value.   4 star related to delays both connection for departure to return,"
Date of travel: September 2019,20,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Booked a flight a few hours ago, cost went down so I called them back.  The lady informed me that she gave me a credit and will send me an e-mail.  Something told me to get out of bed and check the e-mail.  So glad I did.  Without my PERMISSION the  Southwest lady DECIDED she was going to CHANGE MY FLIGHT which departs 3 hours ealier.  Had to call Southwest again to have it changed back.  Be very careful when you speak to someone about your flight.  You never know if it's going to be changed.THIS IS THE 3RD PROBLEM I'VE HAD WITH SOUTHWEST IN A MONTH.  NOT SURE IF I WOULD TRUST THEM AGAIN."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Service,"Crew was friendly, the flight was no-stop and arrived on-time.  They didn't lose my bags and the plane was crowded but still comfortable for a 3hr flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Typical no event Southwest flight.,"The flight loaded quickly (nearly full), left on time and landed in Dallas smoothly a little early.  What more can you ask for?"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Outstanding,Absolutely great.  Friendly folks greeting at the counter and on the aircraft.  Love this airline and it is quite nice to see a familiar face in the cockpit from time to time.  Thanks C$
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Trip from Seattle,"Great flight, clean plane and very friendly staff! The seats were comfortable and good leg room. We loved the fact that it had free WiFi"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,It was really perfect!!,"It was an absolutely lovely trip to Vegas and back. We had a layover in Baltimore (both going and coming back) and “southwest” never missed a beat!! We were on time and we had early landings on two different stops!! Like I said on the Southwest site, the only improvement I could suggest is better snacks😂!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Superb service ,"Love flying Southwest for so many reasons. Reasonable fares, no baggage fees for first 2 checked bags, and just plain superb service all around. Flights on time, boarding efficient and organized, comfortable and clean airplanes. Strong work, Southwest!  Highly recommended!"
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Tried and true,"Always look at Southwest first....not only for the airline miles, but the cost is usually less than others"
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Another Successful Trip,"Direct flights from Tampa to Los Angeles, on time, smooth sailing and another pleasant experience.  Baggage handling, check-in and boarding were all efficient and effortless."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Loyalty pays off,"As always I fly Southwest every time I can and I feel very sad when I have to chose another airline. The planes are newer, the crew is usually very nice and the prices are fair...transparent like they say. I got these tickets for points and that was very big plus too...keep the good work Southwest!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Islip NY to Charlotte NC,"Easy flight ...yes must make a connection in BWI . One hour in air ,one hour in airport and one hour in flight. Quick 3.5 - 4 hrs better than 16 hour car ride"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Pleasant Flight!,We really like to fly Southwest.  Everyone on their staff is so friendly and upbeat. The pilot and flight crew are always so amusing.  They put you right at ease.  Our flight was uneventful.  We left and arrived on time - does it get much better than this?  Thanks for a great flight!
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Safe with Southwest,"Our flight to Ft Lauderdale was very organized, timely, and uneventful ( which is a very GOOD thing). The service from the stewardesses was excellent and our flight was smooth and safe. We rarely fly with Southwest because lately we have been flying to Bonaire every year to go scuba diving and Southwest does not offer a flight there. I really wish they would!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Very Smooth Flight with Top Notch Service!,We have flown with Southwest many times to Las Vegas. It's always pleasant. Everyone that works for the airlines does a great job!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Way-to-G0!,"I always fly SWA to visit relatives in the San Francisco area. The Oakland airport in the East Bay is less congested than SFO (both planes & people), has a transit link (free) to the BART, and usually arrives on time or early. The lining up for departure is predictable and orderly. The crew is friendly and the pilot gives timely updates about take-off, weather, views en route, and waiting for a gate upon landing early.  Well done in reducing the stress of air travel!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Business, history and zen",Our flight back was comedic with a touch of class. The flight crew was outstanding. Almost like watching a vaudeville routine. However we also received the same outstanding service. The pilot was near perfect with the landing and also had a touch of comedic class. Thank you SW for a great trip back home to TIA.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Viva Las Vegas!,I would like to thank Southwest for making my wifes first flight pleasant and memorable.  Thank you for friendliness and professionalism. God bless!
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Very good experience this time,I had a very bad experience with Southwest Airlines many of years ago so I just did not want to fly them again. I found a really good deal on non-stop round trip tickets from Austin to Denver so I decided to try them again. I had a very good experience this time. The flight back and forth was on time and the staff was very friendly. Maybe I will try them again.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Smooth flight with friendly service,"Took a direct flight from Oakland to Baltimore (5 hours and 5 minutes) and took a shuttle to Washington DC for a visit. Southwest Airlines was very organized. It was extra nice to have my bag checked in free and lots of free snacks on board even though there were no meals served. The snacks weren't fancy but were tasty with Ritz cracker sandwiches filled with tasty cheese, pretzels, and shortbread cookies.  The leg room on my flight seemed more spacious than other airlines I have used too. For the price, convenience, and no-gliche travel, I will definitely continue using SWA when they fly to the areas I go to."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,My absolute favorite airline,"I love southwest....the boarding system is great because you can select the seat when you enter the aircraft.  That said, Southwest has got to enforce the lining up of passengers in numerical order.  My last two flights I was in my proper boarding space and people wanted to get in front of me when they had numbers that should have followed mine.    The guy said ""Who cares, we are all going to the same place"".  Then when I boarded and was going to enter the aisle to sit in the window seat a passenger said ""I am holding that for my sister""....Not Allowed!  I always fly SouthWest because I like the way they do business, but this should be addressed."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Smoothest landing ever!,"I was traveling with my elderly mother, and the service and assistance were excellent! We experienced the smoothest landing we've ever had. And then the pilot himself came out to wheel my mom up the ramp when the flight was done. We were so impressed!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Empty seats,There was a lot of empty and the crew made sure every family could sit together. Crew was nice and kept offering extra drinks and snack. Check in at the desk was fast and the guy giving us the tickets gave us a reserved seat ticket for long flight. The only negative is not with southwest but the security at Albany. Once again they are slow and miserable employee's.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,simply southwest,"I like Southwest Airlines because it makes flying easy.  Arrive early to get help with kiosk for boarding pass, easy luggage check-in, departs on time,easy customer service, arrives on time, adding on new locations, affordable,no change fees and baggege (2) fly free....what more can you ask for"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Above The Clouds,"This was a very pleasant flight departing and returning from Midway Airport Chicago, to Little Rock and back that was on time, the entire crew were very friendly and informative. I look forward flying Southwest Airlines soon, because they're "" Above The Clouds (rest)"" Thank you for excellent service!Mr. Andre  Evans Chicago"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Love Southwest,"Always great rates and great service with Southwest.  Landing in Raleigh was a little rough, but all in all a good flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Below Expectations,"I have logged 37 flights in 2019 on SWA, I have earned A-list status for 3 years in a row. It’s really nothing special, you get nothing for it, they don’t even thank you for earning that status. This year at least 50% of the flights were delayed by at a minimum of 15 minutes and few exceeded 4 hours. We also had one canceled about 2 hours prior to take off, then we had to fight with SWA for a few hours to find another flight. Then we had at least 2 of them were delayed for mechanical issues and we had to switch planes. My joke with my wife is when will on-time change to delayed. The customer service is more of someone snapping at you for asking a question, or they act like their so busy and you are just bothering them. Basically the consumer is made to feel like the SWA employees are just doing you a favor, it’s really a strange feeling. My assumption is they have had to hire low quality employees due to the growth they have experienced, which will eventually damage long standing relationships."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest easy,The flight was an easy event with onetime connections.  The staff was always helpful.  The customs line upon landing was really long but moved surprisingly quick.There were plenty of options for travelers inside and outside the airport.  The area was clean and safe.  I would travel with my family to this destination and use this same airline.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,NO REFUND OR TRAVEL CREDIT for a $176 flight I NEVER got on. Don't book with Southwest.,I was trying to fly to Orange County to meet my mom who is about to start radiation for breast cancer. I was in a panic when I found out the Alaska flight I was supposed to take was oversold. The gate agent told me to return in case people don't show up but to see if there was another airline I could take. I made the mistake of walking over to the Southwest gates. The Southwest gate agent I talked to booked me a flight and assured me that I would have no trouble cancelling my flight if people ended up not showing up for my original flight with Alaska. Almost two hours later I walked back to the Alaska gate to find out three people didn't show up for the flight and that they were no longer overbooked. The woman printed me out a new ticket a seating assignment and they had me immediately board. I called Southwest the next morning and the person I spoke to gave me the number to call the Customer Relations Department in Dallas to get a refund. This department is only open Monday-Friday during business hours Central time. I called this number and spoke to a woman named Tiana who told me I would NOT get a refund and receive NO travel credit towards another flight. I never got on this flight and Tiana told me that in order to receive a refund I was supposed to cancel my flight 10 minutes before it took off...I told her I was on a plane during the boarding of the Southwest flight! How was I supposed to cancel my flight when I was on a plane??? Also what happened to what the Southwest gate agent assured me. Why wouldn't she have told me that I needed to call 10 minutes before the flight? I'm a full time student and nanny. I'm putting myself through school and I do not have $176 to throw away. I can't believe this happened. I explained my circumstances and Tiana didn't show an ounce of understanding or even attempt to resolve this beyond standard customer service cues. Southwest's new branding is pushing their 'heart' and customer service but I have experienced nothing but being let down and disappointed by this airline. I will never book again with Southwest and discourage my family and friends from using this airline.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Money Saver,"Paid extra for a ""A"" boarding pass. Saved a seat for wife that came under the ""B"" pass. Short stop in Dallas at Love field. Did not get off plane. There was 25 of us that went on to DC and were able to go forward to a closer seat. Landed in Wash DC at a smaller terminal away from the larger main terminal. Got a uber ride in less than 1 minute."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great (and humorous) flight,"The flight attendant who was making announcements, made humorous comments at various times during the flight.  Kept most of us laughing.  Service at terminal and on board is friendly and courteous.  Smooth, easy flight.  Southwest is my airline of choice if it is flying where I am going."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Friendly and Smooth,Can't beat SWA.  No bag fees allows us to travel with camping gear.  Always friendly and mostly on time.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Excellent flight, great cabin crew",We were able to get 2 seats at $49 one-way from Denver to Dulles.  This made a trip to see our son in Pennsylvania very affordable especially as SW does not charge a baggage fee.  We did not do the Early Bird check-in but we did check-in exactly 24 hours before the flight getting us a B22 and B23 boarding pass.  The plane had about 40 empty seats and we both got an adjacent aisle seat.  The cabin crew were exceptionally funny...especially for a 6:50 am departure.  Plane left on time and arrived about 20 minutes early.  The bags came out incredibly fast and were waiting for us in the baggage claim area when we got there.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,A Real Celebration!,"All of our flights were amazing! The trip was to celebrate my Mom, myself, and my husband's birthdays. His 9/6 and mine and mom's 9/7. Flight attendants announced Mom's 95th over the PA. One of the attendants was 75 yrs old and fell in love with my mom! On our flight out the desk clerk attendant came on board and sang! Staff is amazing, creative, and really enjoy what they do!Absolutely love Southwest! The only way to fly!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always professional,"I wish there were direct flights from Buffalo to Austin but if one has to leave Buffalo at 5:50am to make good connection, Southwest is the way to go. Personnel are friendly and efficient. Flight attendants are quick to get coffee to passengers. Definitely my airline of choice."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,As it should be,Flights were from Omaha through Chicago to Orlando.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Boarding process was well managers.  Seats more comfortable than other airlines.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Great flights ON TIME/EARLY ON RETURN,"Happy with Southwest, other than the cattle call for seats, it takes way to long.A B C lines why not just give me seat."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Fun trip to Cabo,Great trip!  Everything was on time.  Nothing unexpected - which is perfect.  Coming back into San Diego was amazing.  We were in and out of Customs in under ten minutes.  What a wonderful airport!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great U.S. Carrier,"Southwest consistently offers a good flight experience. The top perk is free baggage, especially if you are traveling with children and have several bags that need to be checked."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Family reunion,Southwest airline dies not have 1st class so seats are a little tight but staff is friendly and arrived on time.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Friendliest Airline in the sky,"As always, an excellent flight, great cabin crew.  SW always make my flight experience like I was a member of the family. Have flown SW for many years and only ever had one less than satisfying experience but when brought to the airlines attention it was taken care of in a fast, and great manner.One of the few airlines that do not charge for your carry on or a checked bag and has very attractive prices on flights.  Other airlines should set up and take notice."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flying Southwest Airlines,All airlines have their ups and downs. We did pay extra to sit in A section and to me it was worth the money. The flight attendants did a great job in making a boring job more fun for the passengers. We arrived home 30 minutes early so thank you to the pilot.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Above average Economy airline - Straight Pricing - in flight entertainment,"Economy airline = Economy Flight. I had some work to get doen while enroute, but their in flight Wifi wouldn't connect to my tablet. I Fly pretty regularly with different airlines and have never experienced this issue.  I wasnt able to get my work done as I had planned. BUT...I do LOVE the in flight entertainment options for movie and live TV. This is now expected for Middle range or higher end flights, but was a very pleasant suprise for an economy flight.  I also really appreciate that the price you see when you book is the final price, bo additional cost for seat selection, baggage fees, or any nonsense. I really appreciate the striaght forward pricing."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Colorado Getaway,"Southwest delivered as promised, with the exception of a mysterious 20 minute delay it was as pleasant as flying can be.  The crew was fun and professional. I am not a fan of the boarding process and not assigning seats but it is expected on this airline.  The free bags and flexible change policies make it worth the chaos.  Southwest serves my family well."
n/a,50,Excellent flight,"Quick, expedient service without all of the extra fees tacked on like all of the other airlines. Flown this route many times and have had only minor issues with baggage (conveyor busted a zipper off one of my bags, east fix). In flight service is always friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Seattle,"Flew southwest from Oakland to Seattle, it's been a long time since I last flew out of Oakland airport. The Oakland airport has improved greatly and you can take Bart to the airport. The flight wasn't that long and good service from southwest, nice and easy."
Date of travel: September 2019,20,What's the WORST thing about flying Southwest?,"Yes, you're correct! Obviously it's the ""no assigned"" seats, AKA ""cattle call"", boarding policy.  Better than it used to be; I remember when it was a mad rush, people pushing and shoving to get on first.  Now they have Boarding Groups and those large groups are broken down further into groups of 5.  So it's a little better.  Still, this only works when the passengers actually get into line in the assigned order.  And because the gate personnel hardly ever actually check the boarding pass to ensure that passenger belongs in that group, cheating is rampant.  So the best thing to do was pay the $25 to get Early Bird.  That used to put you in the A group, so at least you got a decent seat.  But now they are putting Business Select, and Rapid Rewards A list passengers, and Anytime Fare passengers, and God knows who else, into the A group, so the Early Bird option is now buying you A59 or even putting you in the B group.  Better to just skip the Early Bird, and call in 24 hours before your flight to reserve your group.  Lastly, Southwest - if you are going to offer the option to have your agent call a passenger back rather than make them wait on hold (a wonderful policy!), maybe when you call them back you could really have an agent ready to speak to them instead of putting them on hold for a couple more minutes?"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Thing Southwest is a good experience,Flying Southwest is always a good experience. Once you get the hang of paying for early check in then the seating is not a worry. Line up next to your number and boarding is a non issue. Two checked bags fly free!!!!What a deal!!!!!!
n/a,50,Quick Flight to the Beach,Southwest Airlines International flights out of Hobby Airport. This was my first try with this. I booked a direct flight to Cancun and back. Best deal I found around. The direct flight is the way to go if you csn. It's like 2 hours. Customs quick and easy. Down load the digital entry app to pass the line. Or even better (well getting it now) Global entry around $100.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Easy to fly with Southwest,"Easy to check in, good flight.  Everything went well with no problems.  Inflight entertainment was good."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Bumpiest landing ever,"In general, I don't like flying Southwest because I dislike the ""cattle call"" feel of boarding without assigned seats.  I always get very stressed worrying that my husband won't get an aisle seat (mandatory for him) or we won't be able to sit together.  I think they've got a scam going on because you can pay more money and get an ""A"" boarding.  Well, we fly Southwest because it's less money, why not just pay more and get an assigned seat on a better airline?  Our landing was AWFUL!  Very bumpy and the brakes were slammed on so hard everyone was jolted forward and panicked!  (And no TV's made it even worse)"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,SW is always the best!,"Southwest has always been good to us. Very few times we've had trouble they have gone above and beyond to make it up. There are factors while flying beyond their control with weather, etc., but they always try to make it right. The best tips for flying Southwest is to remember to check in 24 hours in advance. Set an alarm and do it on the exact minute to get best boarding position. Then be at the gate 30 minutes prior to departure as that is when boarding begins. Southwest does not have assigned seating so this is the best way to insure you have the seat you want and sit with your party. Or, pay the extra fee for priority boarding, but it's really not necessary."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Convenient Flying,"Flying direct from Milwaukee to NYC was quick and easy, and Southwest definitely had the best last minute pricing. I had not flow Southwest before but would definitely fly with them again."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Friendly and Entertaining,"Took a flight with a companion from LAS to SFO to get onto another flight later that night. My friend and I were separated for the duration of the flight, but it was bearable. Good humour from the flight attendant. Would definitely fly again."
n/a,50,Love southwest ,"2 free bags and great customer service is why I'm a repeat customer.  Never issues with flights and usually can find nonstop flights cheap. My family flys southwest unless it's in a package where I cant choose. These days companies rip you off by charging for luggage, not southwest! Looking forward to my next voyage."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,We fly the friendly skies,We always  fly Southwest all their employees are always so attentive and helpful.  Especially since I can't walk far and need a wheelchair to help me get on and off the plane.  They make sure i'm boarded with the first group of individuals needing help and have a chair and a walker waiting on the end of my flight.  In Orlando that was getting me and my family to the Disney Magical Express.  Can't say enough about Southwest and their employees.
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Lack of customer service,"Being an A-List Preferred Southwest Airlines tier holder on and off for 10 years, I find it much to my dismay that I am writing a disappointing review. Unfortunately a family emergency occurred and during this time there are many matters to account for. Booking travels to assist in times as these can be an overbearing issue during a time of mourning. Prior to this I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with Southwest Airlines therefore I felt comfortable contacting a representative to ask a few questions about my flight benefits and options. Upon calling I received nothing short of brusque assistance. Although I was unsure of a few of the policies, I am certain that customer service should always be top priority. Specifically quoting the representative in saying, “No, we don’t offer any bereavement flight discounts. People ask all the time....”.  In turn I asked if there was any options (being I had just bought a The flight the week prior). Bluntly I was told “ [No] Yup you do [just have to pay for it]”.  This “assistance” was none at all in the least— especially to someone who does fly so frequently with Southwest Airlines. As stated I understand that there are policies in place for the company but there is no excuse for snarky and crude customer service. I am extremely dissatisfied with the outcome of the situation but more specifically with the customer service, or lack thereof, I received as an A-List Preferred tier holder. This occurrence  will be taken into consideration for future (personal and business) flight decisions."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Great Service,Love these guys. You can take 2 bags with you and a carry on. You still get snacks and drinks and they don't nickel and dime you to death. The flight attendants are sometimes funny too
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Love Southwest!,This was my second time to fly Southwest. I love how quick and easy it is to board. The inflight entertainment selections are decent but much better than some other airlines. Our flight crew to New Orleans were awesome and kept us laughing. Our crew back was not very friendly. I prefer Southwest over American any day!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,One of the best airlines.,I always fly Southwest Airlines.  I am disabled and they transport me in a wheelchair from curb to plane.  2 bags fly free and if you change your flight there is no charge and you can use the credit for up to a year.  The plane took off on time and we were there I believe ahead of schedule.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest makes for easy flying!,"Easy flying, you know where you stand with Southwest.  Usually lots of flights to chose from.  The folks there are friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Awesome Flight,Best Service and always on time. I always fly Southwest and would recommend to others to fly this airline.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Easy and quick,"Our airline of choice is Southwest because of baggage charges and cabin upgrade costs. Maybe not the best but good for the price. This was standard fare for Southwest, easy boarding and a comfortable flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Getting away!,"I have flown with Southwest in the past, this time I brought my wife and so wanting to sit together I purchased the Early Bird package. Come to find out Southwest reserves A1-15 or 20 for business class and individuals with special needs. Spending the $100.00 to guarantee  boarding first or close to first we still found ourselves with A53 and A54 which will put two sitting together on the wings or behind them. Just visiting with individuals in line found out some were given a lower number to board sooner and bought tickets  LONG after we purchased our flights. I would not recommend purchasing the Early Bird package as it is not worth it. Other then that the flight crew were very cordial and the flights were on time! The Boeing 737 800 was VERY comfortable."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest is the BEST!,"I always fly southwest!! We were scheduled to leave right when Hurricane Dorian had Orlando in its path. Many days prior to the trip, Southwest gave us the opportunity to change our flights for free. Their website was having issues so I called and surprisingly got right through and was assisted no questions asked. The whole thing took maybe 10 minutes and we were set to leave a day earlier! Twice this year I went to Las Vegas and flew Southwest. They make it so easy to fly from Orlando to Vegas non-stop. It’s a long flight, but the attendants gave out several rounds of beverages and snacks and were incredibly attentive. The fact your bags fly free is a huge plus for over packers like myself. I’ve never had anything less than perfect service from Southwest!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"On time, very pleasant cheerful flight attendants",Sometimes the flight attendants have a rough time. These were spectacularly cheerful and made everything seem joyful- even the slightly bumpy ride with the seat belt on the whole time. The bright comments made a big difference. Kudos!
Date of travel: April 2019,50,My go-to airline,"Rarely an issue, theses people have your back.  Always easy on and off.  Baggage always seems to be accommodated."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Crsrvaca,I hate the seating instructions they need to go back to assigned seating this first come first serve really seemed to confuse people especially when it was time to stand in line in your correct sequence
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Southwest was very helpful assisting my handicapped wife getting on and off the plane.,"The seats are a bit snug for a 265 lb. person, but the fare was reasonable for a nonstop flight. The flight crew were all very helpful and polite."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,A great airline,"We chose Southwest because that is our go to airline.  Why?  Because we can always change our flight even at the last minute.  And sure enough, that happened on this trip.  We had to change our plans three times.  Interestingly enough, the final selection saved us dollars that we were able to bank.  We knew that we had to make a connection, but we felt it was worth it because of the option to reschedule flights without a penalty."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Late again,I checked in early as usual and took advantage of fewer people in the airport so that I could get to the gate sooner.  The flight was again late with no reason given. Just give me a reason!!
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Easy no stress flight to Albuquerque,"Round trip flight from Manchester NH to Albuquerque.We always try to fly Southwest- better prices and better flight times. I do wish they had direct flights, but Baltimore is an easy hub to navigate."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Excellent experience,No issues with service or our flight. We were in group A and were able to get exit row seats.  Flight was quick and we actually arrived 30 minutes early.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,The flight was on time and the crew was extremely friendy.,The plain arrived at the destination and returned back on time.  The crew was extremely friendly and helpful with questions asked about my destination.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Airline of Choice,We try to fly Southwest whenever possible.  We had slight delay going to Cincinnati but no real issues. Soutwest is always our first choice.  Usually they have routes to the destinations we are looking for and their prices are competitive.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Dallas Fort Worth trip,I would definitely fly Southwest anyplace they fly. The price was quite reasonable and accommodations were great. Looking forward to my next flight.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Denver to OC,"The flight to Orange County was uneventful, meaning it went smoothly. Good service and smooth flight."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,vegas trip,good flight. don't waste your money on early bird check in. I did and was very disappointed in my boarding number. I asked at the gate the lady told me just do it yourself
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Hawaii on Southwest Airlines - Not Enough Superlatives!,"A few years ago I was hesitant to fly SWA. As an A-List Preferred customer, I suppose I could be called a convert. So when SWA announced they would start service from OAK and SJC to Hawaii, I had to find out for myself. Flying from Nashville (BNA) through OAK, SWA offered the same consistent level of service to PHOG and PHNL that one would expect. Excellent flight and service for the price, and no-charge for luggage (max 2 items ea). What's not to like??Note: SWA is new at Honolulu airport and the gates are at the very end of terminal G. Wear your walking shoes as the distance from TSA security to the gates is about one half mile."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Comfortable fight,"Our Southwest flight was very pleasant for the most part. We arrived at the gate to discover that our flight had been delayed by almost an hour. The airline was apologetic and explained why the flight had been delayed. Once boarding began it was quick and easy. I slept through the majority of the flight. Due to the first flights late departure and subsequent late arrival, we boarded our second flight only minute before they shut the gate for departure. Due to this fact my boyfriend and I were not able to sit together. While I would have preferred to sit next to him I met a lovely woman and had a nice conversation. Landing in Orlando was a bit difficult due to weather but the flight attendants and the pilot got us through. Overall it was a very pleasant experience. I would definitely choose to fly south west again though I would bring my own snacks."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Good as usual,"I have been flying Southwest for at least 40 years and have always liked their service. I know what I'm getting and they never disappoint me. They have always been on time and I have never had a flight cancelled.  Their fares are great if you book far enough in advance. Like most airlines, the flights are usually full, but I use their advanced check-in to get an early boarding group and sit towards the read so I am not stuck in the middle seat."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I love this airline so much I made a trip advisor account to review it,"I'm a broke college student and I had booked a flight to go see my boyfriend. I should have checked the dates before hand, but I didn't, and it turned out to be the weekend of sorority rush which I had to be at! I immediately panicked that I had just lost the chance to see my boyfriend AND 300 SOME DOLLARS. However, Southwest is a real one and has the most navigate-able website and I was easily able to just switch my flight to the next weekend WITH NO CHANGE FEES. All I had to do was pay the difference in flight prices. Truly a homie. I love Southwest - they don't nickel and dime you (two free checked bags AND cheap flights?!), they make everything easy, and they account for mistakes. SHOUT OUT SOUTHWEST - I LOVE YOU. I've got a whole life ahead of me and will most likely never fly another airline! The flights are nice too, but like costumer service is really where they shine."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,everything was fine,"no issues, flights left on time. When I reserve seat positions exactly 24 hours before the scheduled departure, I still receive a C section boarding. Annoying you need to pay extra to get A or B boarding."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Well pleased with Southwest Airlines,Price was very competitive. Airline staff was friendly and helpful. Flights were on time! Flight attendants were upbeat and fun.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Love Southwest.,"we always take Southwest, rates are reasonable, bags fly free, up to 2 bags, I think. Flight crews are  nice, friendly,"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Easy, free flight changes really helped while trying to escape hurricane Dorian.","While stuck in Orlando with the airport closed, the fact that flight cancellations or changes are always free allowed for many options departing from different airports. I booked a number of alternatives and was able to choose the best option without worry of penalty. Cancellations were just kept as future credit which will surely be used in the near future. Although some airlines temporarily allowed free changes for this situation, the fact that it is standard policy with Southwest eliminated the worry of whether I qualified for the exemption or if i would be surprised after the fact with extra charges."
Date of travel: August 2019,20,orlando to rhode island,pilot introduced himself as Brad Pitt and told everyone we were flying to some tropical island. When landing in Rhode Island the plane slammed down when landing. This was probably the worst landing i have ever had. Scary!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flying Southwest Airlines,First time to fly and would recommend this airline. I have only flew Southwest and like it a lot and not even considering any other airline. Planning on taking vacation to Florida and going to fly my familySouthwest.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Always love the service,Southwest is a great airline.  They know how to comfortably service their customers.  The staff are real and approachable and do their jobs professionally.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,trip to virginia,Usually on time.  I just wish they would not allow passengers to put those heavy suitcases above my head.  One guy hit me.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,WOW!  GREAT customer service!,I am so grateful to Southwest and their customer service when I had to cancel on the last minute due to a medical issue.  I had booked with Southwest because I like all their baggage free policies and the flight experiences we've had in the past.  And of course I love their change/cancellation policies.  I just hadn't expected the level of caring and help they gave me.  I'm so thankful.
n/a,50,Couple trip to the beach,"We love to fly Southwest because you can bring 2 checked bags as well as a carry-on and a personal item. You can pay extra and get auto check in or you can just check in any time 24 hours or less before your flight. Our flight down to Tampa was not crowded, but full of talkative folks! The stewards/stewardesses we friendly and efficient. The flight was smooth and we hit very little turbulance. Love Southwest!"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Budget and worth it,"Standing in line and getting the best available seat is a bit rough. By the time we got on the plane there was a solid line of middle row seats available. It wasn't a big deal, but it would be nice to sit together even when we are the last to board.The two checked bags and two carry-ons is definitely nice."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Smooth Skies as always,"What more can be said about Southwest? They are comfortable and accommodating. Their bag policy is great and they are transparent. No hidden fees. Be sure that you check in on time, especially if you are traveling with someone. So that you can sit next to each other since there are no assigned seats."
Date of travel: August 2019,30,"Reservations allowed seat selection for all 4 flights, but they weren't  honored","Very disappointed that the online booking requested me to select the seats for our family of 4, but we didn't get the seats we selected.  In fact, we all had to sit separately on all 4 flights, and I had children with one who'd never flown before.  We hit a lot of turbulence on both flights there, but I understand that's out of their control. One of the flight attendants was curt with me for asking the beverage choices, which was pretty rude.  Other than that, a typical flight.  Everything was on time!"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,"Once you get used to the Southwest way of doing business, they provide a nice flight.","A few years ago, I got really turned off by Southwest Airlines when I traveled with my father, who was not in good health. It was a nightmare.  I was inexperienced about Southwest and the folks at the gate were not nice about helping me.  However, since that time I have traveled alone or with my husband and used Southwest because they were going to my destination and had the best flights for my purpose. Once you get used to their system, and figure out how to work with it, it is fine. Once on the plane, the flight attendants are cordial and professional. For my most recent trip, I paid extra to be automatically checked in and got a good place in line for boarding. The free checked bags benefit is nice, but you have to balance that with the cost, schedules, and seat assignment issues with other airlines. I will fly Southwest again if their scheduled flights fit my plans best."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Gotta Luv Burbank,"Burbank is not surprisingly the best ranked airpoirt in LA and the US. It is just so user friendly; meaning you can get through security with a minimum of hassle (never more than ten minutes and usually less than five). It also has a happy knack of having flights depart on time. You just have to be aware of the curfew that limits departure times (and some arrivals). I am so glad that Southwest has so many flights out of Burbank. The direct flight to Denver (and return) is so easy. We have rarely had a late departure and always arrive at DIA on or ahead of time. The flight attendants are always great, but the best thing is that you get where you want to go, when you need to be there with a minimum of fuss."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,A Great Flight,"My wife and I returned from a wedding last month and this was one of the best flights I’ve had in 2-3 years.  The flight was short of capacity and the flight attendants were really helpful.  There was a lot of grief returning a “discount” car rental so I wasn’t in a great mood.  The flight was relaxing and I got enough rest for the 45 minutes drive home from BWI.  This flight reminded me that we don’t have to have crowded, miserable flights all the time.  Maybe the bad flights (that cost just as much as good ones) will become the exception rather than the rule."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,We luv Southwest!,"We have both been flying other airlines recently and have had forgotten how great Southwest was. Efficient, friendly and reasonable."
Date of travel: April 2019,40,Southwest customer,"Southwest is my go to airline.  Highly recommend always trying to book six months out or as soon as flights become available.Flight crew friendly, plane was clean.  Islip airport small but easy to navigate."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Fun Flight!,The flight attendants were pleasant and one particular lady had a Great sense of humor. Comic relief on the flight had everyone laughing!!!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Good Prices/Free Luggage ,"Southwest is one of my favorite airlines. They offer many flights, the prices are better than most airlines and bags are free. The staff are friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,The only airline I fly.,"Southwest is my airline of choice.  They go everywhere I want to go.  Their fares are better than any other airline available to me, especially when you consider they don't nickel & dime you on bogus baggage and change fees - there are none.  Yes, it's open seating but that has never been a problem.  The flight attendants are always very good to excellent and often provide some spur of the moment entertainment."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great as always!,"As always, the flight attendants are friendly and helpful. I love how they make you feel at ease with their sense of humor. Our flight wasn't full, so people were able to stretch out. Our departure and arrival were both smooth and uneventful which was great since we flew into Nassau right before Hurricane Dorian hit Abaco in the Bahamas."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Good flight arrived early,Flight was good.  Arrived 10 minutes early.  Best landing ever!  Lol  I even told the Captain that when I was leaving the plane.
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Pleasure flying Southwest,"Great, uneventful round trip flight. Although, upgrades were paid for, Southwest cheerfully refunded as flights were changed due to grounding of Max 737 and we lost so much time we had to cancel a prescheduled side trip to Wyoming."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Love this airline,"This no-frills airline delivers lots of bang for the buck.  Though the flight was a bit delayed in taking off, there were no problems.  I love their app, and I much prefer purchasing their early bird check in to paying for a bag on other airlines!  Thanks, SWA, keep up the good works."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,2019 Tip to California,Seats were very tight and no leg room. Love the fact that you get 2 free checked bags as who doesn't have luggage when traveling on vacation for a week. FLight attendants going and coming back home were friendly. Our pilot landed smoothly which is always a plus for me.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flying experience,"First time flying Southwest was a pleasurable experience.  When I approached each departure airport, check in was easy and completed with checking in the luggage was no more than 10 minutes. Approaching the gate area, was kept informed of each moment in changing of flight information.  Boarding process was so expeditious and each flight was departed on time.  In cabin snacks and refreshments were available with no limits."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always My Favorite,"My family has flown Southwest my whole life and it will always be my favorite airline. This flight was for our Girls Wine Weekend with my mom and sister-in-law.  The service was awesome (as always) and the flights were on time!  We were also in the mid-to-late ""B"" boarding group and had no problems sitting together."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Exceeds your expectations,Southwest wins top customer reviews for a reason. They are the friendliest and most efficient airline operating in the states. They treat their customers with respect and do not nickel and dime you for every service. Bags fly free! In my experience they are the fastest out of the gate and definitely the fastest getting your bags out to you. All other airlines really should use SW as an example of how to treat customers.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Pleasant Fly,"We love Southwest Airline.  Reason #1:  Flight attendants are so friendly, unique, and lay-back that brings us relaxing and sometimes makes us laughter.  Reason #2:  check in luggages are normally free up to two I believe.  (no hidden/additional costs when you book the tickets.)  Reason #3: the airfare fees are unbeatable compare to major airlines.  On the top of that, it has a lot of variety of routings, and connections to resort cities, which I really like about Southwest Airlines."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best domestic airline,"Way better than what first imagined. Free check in baggage up to 2 pieces, nice aircraft, able to watch tv shows on board(using own mobile phone)."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Chicago trip,"Southwest Airlines never disappoints, they are friendly and helpful.  This was a full flight, which means I was sitting in a middle seat, I was able to find a place for my bag a few rows back from my seat.  When we landed my bag was passed up to me for a smooth exit.  Air travel is not easy but I always feel that the southwest staff is there to help with anything along the way."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,On Time and Friendly,"Flight was on time.  Didn't check luggage, so was off the plane and in the car quickly.  Has there ever been a bad crew on a Southwest flight?  Always nice..."
Date of travel: August 2019,30,"Many pros, but still quite a few cons","Considering the generally poor reputation of the airline industry, it is appropriate to say that Southwest offers some of the most customer friendly policies of any of the major U.S. carriers.  Although price used to be a Southwest strong suit, depending on the market you are traveling out of, their prices are no longer as competitive and sometimes exceed the other majors.  Also, Southwest's open-seating policy can be very disconcerting for those who like to know that they have a specific seat of their choosing prior to boarding the aircraft.  This is further complicated by two abuses perpetrated by many customers, about which Southwest does not appear to be taking any actions.  The first is the so-called ""miracle flights"" (a term a first heard from a Southwest flight attendant) whereby large numbers of individuals pre-board the aircraft in wheelchairs only to be ""healed"" in-flight so that they can scoot out of the plane as soon as the forward door is opened.  The second is the ever growing practice among certain customers to purchase one ""Early Bird"" ticket in order to board early and then save numerous seats in the forward rows for the remainder of their traveling party.  Both of these abuses are efforts to avoid the potential of getting a ""bad"" seat, while avoiding the charges associated with purchasing the products that grant early boarding (i.e. Early Bird and Business Select).  Making matters worse is the fact that Southwest does not address these abuses head-on and the additional fact that Southwest continues to raise the price of Early Bird boarding, thus incentivizing more individuals to behave in a manner so as to avoid the financial burden while still ensuring a premium seating location.  I witnessed both of these practices in full swing on my recent Southwest flight.  However, at this time, although I have moved some of my travel business to other airlines, I remain a regular Southwest customer as their flight schedules continue to meet my needs."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Direct to Paradise,This was an easy direct flight to get to absolute paradise in Puerto Rico. Why even spend 11+hrs to go to Hawaii when you can go to PR. It was beautiful.
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Good job!,I was late for my plain. They put me on next flight NO CHARGE! Thanks to all for being understanding.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,great,"Great smooth flight.  Staff were courteous, friendly and helpful.  I would fly Southwest Airlines again."
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Quick trip,Flight was ok. SW is efficient and a less stressful than some of the other airlines. DIA WAS A ZOO. DULLES A LITTLE BETTER.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Sometime weather just messes with Everything!,"As we all know weather can mess with all good intentions. I must let you know SWA became a frustrating kabocha. Missing any connection is a BIG hassell. So I must let you know with all the miscommunication and misdirections, and three gate changes. My husband in a wheelchair and I running behind what a sight. The connection sat and waited for us all, as the last flight home to NH.The best was they saved his front seat as if he was a first boarder. SWA you rule, even with no first class we are all first class."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Southwest Airlines is the Best Airlines!!,"Southwest Airlines is the best Airlines!  They have awesome prices not to mention 2 free bags, a carry-on and 1 personal item! How can you beat that!  You don't get to pick your seat, they put you in A-B-C categories but it really doesn't matter where you sit, does it?  My husband, son and I always have a great seat!  We were in category B on our return flight and ended up in row 1.  They give you a complementary drink and snack.  The flight attendants are super nice and extremely accommodating.  When we fly Southwest, the majority of the time we arrive earlier than expected.  We never have a problem with lost luggage or extra fees. Remember to check in 24 hours prior to your flight to get a good category which will allow you to choose a better seat when you get to the airport if you desire, on our flight to Nashville we were in Category A and we ended up in Row 7.  The plane was new and looked like a spaceship inside it was really cool.  If you've never experienced Southwest you should, you'll never go back to another airline.  The wanna getaway price on southwest is the best!  Good Luck!"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Love Southwest,"From the time I got there until I landed, everything went well.  The staff was very nice, the flight was on time.  No extra money for luggage and even got a free drink.  Will definitely fly Southwest again."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest is the Best!,"Have never had a bad experience with this airline. They always put families first and communicate well with their passengers. Never have to worry about extra fees, just simply the easiest way to fly! Love these guys and gals!"
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Love Southwest Airlines,"We always try to fly Southwest Airlines if we can. We have never had a problem with them. That being said, there was a long delay on our return flight out of Burbank, because of a door malfunction issue. But I’d rather be delayed than to have an issue happen while in flight. Some people were put on other flights. We didn’t have a connecting flight that we would miss, so we waited. We also were delayed a few minutes getting off the airplane at Nashville because of lightning in the area. Of course, I want their ground crews safe as well as us onboard, so I was okay with that. I would recommend Southwest Airlines to all of my friends & family. I also would recommend flying into Burbank, California rather than LAX if you are going to that area. It is a smaller airport. The rental car area is within walking distance. (No shuttle for 45 minutes to rental car, like in LAX). It was easy to navigate the airport when coming or going! 😍"
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Best option when traveling with luggage,"Great prices, several flights from Portland to Reno. We were on a flight via San Jose to Portland, and it was very comfortable, and a very smooth flight. Great service on the flight, even though the pretzels they give are disappointing. Southwest is always our first option when travelling with luggage. We love flying Southwest!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Nice Smooth Flight,"The flight from Oakland to Honolulu was probably one of the smoothest that I've ever been on. The seat belt sign was off the entire time except for take off and landing.  The wifi was even working, which was great.  The flight attendants gave out snack boxes rather than individual packages, which are only done on flights to and from Hawaii."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Forever ... My Go-To Airline!!!,"First, they call passengers of families with children, second, they board those passengers needing assistance, and then finally, they remaining passengers are called to board the plane in sections A, B, and C; however, it’s always opening seating; first come, first served.  I always go straight to the back and sit in an aisle seat.  Checking 2 pieces of luggage is always free - it’s their standard practice.  And their staff is always friendly, helpful, and funny.  I remember when they just had service on the west coast, now they’re all over the U.S. AND I look forward to them growing to be an international airline, then I’ll never take any other airline!"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,reno roundtrip,fast flight ...planes always full and can't sit with my wife sometimes. all in all it was a quick flight
Date of travel: July 2019,50,"On time, good service, and a great price.","Friendly service and arriving on time we had zero hassle getting in or out of either airport. If you are looking to fly on a budget and/or you don't mind not having assigned seating, Southwest is the best airline going. If you upgrade to priority boarding you can make sure you board fairly early and get a good seat."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Flying to Honolulu was a cold experience!,"First I must say I love Southwest airlines.  This airlines provides great value and great baggage handling, and three out of my last four flights were OK, but my flight to Honolulu was very cold, and I mean temperature as well as flight attendants.  I was totally uncomfortable in jeans and a top. People up and down the aisles were huddled in hoodies, jackets and anything else they could find out of their carry-ons. I didn't have that kind of clothing with me - I was flying to Hawaii! When I asked the attendant if they had a blanket they responded with a curt NO! During this daytime flight I felt as if we were in the attendants' way - there was no Aloha at all!  My travelling companion's hands were so cold they were shaking and went numb, and yes we had closed our air vents. People should be prepared to wear extra clothes and take jackets or blankets, and maybe flak jackets."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Very Good and Bags Fly Free,Always on time. Friendly service. Comfortable seats. Fair prices plus bags fly free. I've always had good luck with this airline.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,AS GOOD AS IT GETS,"Once you know how the system works it is easy to get a decent seat without having to pay the upgrade fee. Usually on time, planes are reasonable clean and the flight attendants are mostly very friendly. 2 bags free and if you fly often with SWA they mail you drink coupons. Prices are reasonable and free snacks / soft drinks."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Early Bird flight,I paid the extra amount to get on the plane early.  All flights to and from San Antonio and BWI were full.  I wanted an aisle seat for a 4 hour flight.
Date of travel: February 2019,50,Good flight where ever you go.,Flight was good. Attendants were nice. Was able to read or watch a movie on laptop. Was a peaceful flight.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Seattle,"No problems on time excellent , great service excellent staff. Did not encounter one single problem on round trip, have pictures but don’t know how to post."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Great Flight,"We always fly Southwest when going to New Orleans....love their non-stop flights. Great price, friendly service, on time flights. Will definitely will fly Southwest again."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great to receive that value!,Once again Southwest comes thru! easy to board... Happy workers greet you...A pleasure to fly! Never fear Southwest is here!
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Vegas Flight,"Flight attendants were pleasant and efficient, however one male attendant was a little snarly.  Unusual to have an attendant with an unfriendly attitude on Southwest.  Luckily he was stationed at the front of the plane..."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great economy airline,"We've flown Southwest for several years now and compared to the other major airlines, their service is definitely the best in my opinion. I normally don't write airline reviews due to my long legs not doing well in economy seating, but due to the excellent service including 4 free mixed drinks on this flight I had to give them a thumbs up!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Extraordinary Service,"I had made a mistake in booking our return flight. My husband tried to check us in and found the mistake. When he called Southwest, the customer service representative made the correction, changed our fight and did not charge us any additional fees. Wonderful and thank you very much. Home safe and sound."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always good to fly Southwest,Great price. Friendly people. Great landing; which is all you can expect from a pilot. Good drink and snack selection.
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Only airline with FREE checked bags,"Southwest can be pricey on a lot of their flights, but NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING beats their baggage policy! This flight was good. Plane was on time. Plane was clean. Everything went well. The only thing that I didn't like was the check in process on the return flight."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Great Flight,"We flew to Minneapolis for our son's college graduation. There were not a lot of flights that flew straight through. Southwest had a great early check in online. We picked our seats as we boarded the plane. You could pick any open seat and if you did early bird check in, you were one of the first to pick a seat!  It was a smooth process to board the plane. It was a short flight but they still offered a snack and drink. Our flight was on time leaving Atlanta and early on the return flight.  It was a good flight and I would definitely fly Southwest again!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Every Southwest flight is the same. You are blessed if you get A boarding,This time I got to C boarding  on the always full flight from Chicago to Phoenix nonstop. Both me and my wife were sitting apart in middle seats. As long as you download the Southwest Wi-Fi app before you board you get free movies. Whatever you do don’t forget to download the app or else you’ll have to pay eight dollars for the Wi-Fi to download the app to get the free movies which now cost eight dollars LOL.
Date of travel: September 2019,30,A National Lampoon Flight,"Quite the adventurous, (National Lampoon like), trip to glorious Nashville TN to attend a nephew’s wedding. Southwest Airlines was considerate enough to inform us via a text that our flight was canceled with 90 minutes notice prior to departure - their timing was impeccable to coincide when the Uber driver pulled up on our driveway! No explanation why the flight was cancelled and the SWA app wasn’t working to reschedule flights. Needed to work with Hertz and Hilton about adjusting reservations. Hertz could only cancel the reservation. The adventure continued for our return trip - TSA PreCheck code missing on our return boarding passes."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great flight,"This flight was delayed for 45 minutes or so, the communication from the airline to passengers was great. Flying with Southwest was great"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Great flight crew,Flew from Cancun home to Las Vegas with a layover in Denver. The flight crew from Cancun to Denver was amazing Denver to Las Vegas not so much not friendly I felt like I was flying on a different airline! We were in row 1 I got up to use the rest room went right back to my seat then the flight attendent (I dont remember his name) came to me seat and told me I was hanging around the galley and I cant do that I had no clue what he was talking about this entire crew was not up to par with what we have become used to when flying with SWA. We must have been on old planes there was no seatback screens
Date of travel: April 2019,40,flight,South west was fine I paid the extra to get first seating. The flight was ontime and everyone was courteous.No frills but ok.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Southwest airlines is the best!,"I only fly Southwest airlines! Can't beat the value, 2 bags checked for free, and the friendliest staff."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight - on time,This was a great flight.  We flew non-stop.  The flight heading out was 10 minutes delayed but we still landed on time.  Coming back there were no delays and it was a very pleasant experience.  It seems like the seats on Southwest have a bit more room these days.  The flight staff was great.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Another great gliht,"I’m my opinion, Southwest is by far the best US airline. Always early or on time, and great staff. United and American should just shut down."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Long Walk,"Location of gates are extremely difficult to get to.  Fortunately we checked in our baggage and are in reasonably good shape.  At both airports, it appeared that we were loading at the farthest gate possible from the check in desk."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great Time,Great service from check in until landing.  Flight staff were amazing and pleasant.  No complaints from me.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always a pleasure flying with Southwest,"Although computer problems caused us to change planes with an unscheduled stop, the Southwest team kept us apprised throughout the process and attempted to make the delay as painless as possible with their first priority our safety, I absolutely appreciated that and will continue to fly Southwest in the future."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Great Experience,"Great experience, flying is always cramped.  But it a LOT better than Spirit airlines.  Could use more leg space."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Trip to Seattle,"Check in was easy and the people were  friendly, and flight left on time and arrived fifteen minutes early. The flight attendents  made the trip enjoyable by providing excellent service and talking with the passangers."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"On time, turbulent free, service great.","We fly almost exclusively Southwest.  We fly on points. My wife is my companion and she fly""s for nothing.  ."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,South West was excellent from booking to arriving at my destination,"Southwest is the most  accommodating Air Line ever. We were leaving Florida  because of the hurricane.  I booked one ticket  leaving from Palm Beach and went back to get another and it was sold out.  I call Southwest and the person I spoke to  tried every way she could to get me 2 tickets she asked ""is Orlando too far for you to go"" I said no so she cancelled the one ticket that I had booked in Palm Beach and booked the 2 of us on a non stop to New Orleans."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Long time SWA customer,"You love SWA or you don’t - - - Ben flying since late 1990’s - solid planes, great ground crews, great air crews - -  so the boarding process is a little strange, it works."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,I will always fly Southwest!,"I travel 4-6 times a year and flying Southwest is always my first choice.  Flights are reasonable, service is exceptional, 2 bags free and most importantly, safe.  Kudos."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Always a great experience,"Southwest is our airline of choice.  No nonsense rules or upcharges and the best customer service of any ailine we have experienced.  We have flown many airlines and unfortunately have found fault with customer service lacking on all but Southwest.  I always feel appreciated on Southwest.  While other airlines can be polite if everything runs smoothly, no other airlines bends over backward to try to please like Southwest does.  A first impression might feel a little hoaky because flight attendants joke around and sometimes even sing on the speaker, but it is all part of the experience to be personable rather than all business.  I also have had excellent luck with the no seat assignment policy by purchasing ""early bird"" for a nominal fee at booking to be in the earliest group to board.  And the loyalty program at southwest is second to none as far as ease of use, lowest point cost of use, easiest ability to earn points with partners, and the availability of a companion flying free for a year by earning enough points over the year (that you do not even have to use for the privilege!)"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Best flight attendents,"We had the best flight attendents on the way to Phoenix.  They were friendly and outgoing and interacted with the guests.  My headset broke nd the stewardess actually go her headset out of her suitcase and gave me hers.  I know it was a cheaper pair but that wasn't the point, it was very nice of her to give them to me.  Flight was very smooth also."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Experience exceeded my expectations,"Now days I loath flying - ridiculous fees, crowded flights, little service - BUT - Southwest was great.  The boarding process is efficient, and less frustrating than competitors.  The flight crew was great, friendly, and efficient.  The flight was on-time.  It was one of the best flights I've had in a long time."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Best Airline,"The best airline around, no extra fees like others. Service is always very nice and now going to Hawaii. Hopefully will go to more international destinations soon!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,The Best,"When all other airlines were cancelling flights from Punta Cana because of Hurricane Dorian, SW kept a close eye on the storm and kept us informed and did not cancel our flight. We were able to get home on our scheduled time."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Trip to FL,"Excellent Service, flight was on-time, love the ""Bags fly Free"" policy! I also love that flight changes don't cost extreme amounts of money if necessary. I fly Southwest whenever possible"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Trip to Reno and Lake Tahoe,Our flight was excellent to Reno and back to Chicago. We spent time in Reno and Lake Tahoe. We spent family time on excursions and dinners together and also spent time in Harrah's Casino in both places Reno and Lake Tahoe. Some family members also went to San Diego for a few days before meeting up with us.Great time together.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Southwest Airlines - best in air,"Southwest Airlines is the only airline we have flown out west for 4 straight years.The 2 carry on bags are a big plus and the fares are the most reasonable.The staff on the plane are always helpful and courteous and go out of their way so you have a good flight.The pilots land smoothly and I feel safe on their aircraft.There are seldom delays, in fact only one in 4 years and they held the connection so we could make it."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always great on SW,"Efficient, friendly service as always! Southwest is always on time, great service. Love flying Southwest!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"In a World full of ""No"" A plane full of ""Yes""","This airline and its staff has not yet managed to disappoint and that is Huge!!! I traveled a week prior to this trip using United and then this trip with Southwest was a breath of fresh air.The staff always greets you with genuine warmth and never say no if you ask for an extra snack or cup of water unlike other airlines where they say you can only have one after you paying almost $1000 for the ticket. These little things matter but even if the situation arises where tact is involved, the flight attendants show professionalism and tact without raising the tension levels.On my return trip from Denver to Houston, a lady with an injured foot had occupied the exit row and tried to block an empty seat when another female passenger tried to sit there. Her unfriendly attitude was her undoing as when the flight attendant realized that she was guarding her foot, she was asked to move form the exit row. She kept giving a hard time to the attendant and initially refused to move but he stayed calm, polite and firm and eventually had her move without any threats or raising the alarm or his voice. Kudos to the attendant whose name is Josh. he had a beard and the flight #494. Hats off to him for resolving the matter without any escalation or delays causing problems for the rest of us."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Wonderful as always!,I fly Southwest Airlines whenever I can! Their flights are usually on time and often a bit early arriving. The service is always friendly and helpful and they seem to genuinely appreciate my business. I like the ability to change my flight without penalty  and also to check two bags for free if I feel the need to take lots of stuff on my journey. Luv Southwest Airlines!
Date of travel: October 2018,50,Trip to Tucson,"The flight was on time, boarding was a breeze and the Flight Crew were courteous, helpful and friendly."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,On Time,As with most Southwest flights our flights were on time and that a major factor when I book our trips
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Flight,Flight was right on time for departure  for leaving and return flight. Crew was very attentive to your needs
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Favorite airline,This is the best airline for me hands down! I’ve had some wonderful experiences with them and each and every flight was comfortable. Every time I call them they’re always pleasant and willing to help! Will continue flying with them for as long as possible!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,GET UP AND GO,Personnel were ready with a smile to check my baggage and me in. I love the 2 checked bags fly free. And it's an interesting but workable seat choosing method. The Flight Attendants actually smile while serving the limited choices of beverages and snacks.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Just long enough,"It was a nice two hour flight. The plane was only half full so everyone had their own row. Just one of those ""once in a blue moon"" flights when a passenger can move around."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great Flight,We flew to Nashville with a layover in San Diego.  All went well.  The staff was friendly & a smooth flight.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,On time,"Flight was as expected. Booked route with plane change in Houston, will book a direct flight next time."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,The best way to go!,"Economical, fast, efficient, value, and great  service both on the ground and in the air.This is the way to go if you are heading to Cancun.I fly non-stop and have never had an issue in the years that I have flown them."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Just a usual Southwest Flight,This was a usually good Southwest Flight.  It was on time.  Seating is by simple order.  Plenty of overhead bin space.  Free wifi on board to access live television and music. Flight attendants were full of good cheer and banter.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,What flying should be,Southwest always comes through.  Was flying from Costa Rica and had an enjoyable experience with the Love airline.  Flight attendants were great and show great excitement for their positions.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Always Dependable and Safe, Sometimes Fun","Great non-stop. Took off exactly on time, arrived a few minutes early. Professional cabin crew. Maybe the best emergency row briefing I've ever heard. The flight attendant was professional, firm, experienced, and he was a pleasure to talk to. Not a lot of banter from the cockpit; which is what I prefer. Not interested in a travelogue when flying. Great flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest is South Best!,"Huge fan of SWA! They are my carrier of choice. Yes- I may live and travel where Southwest has good availability, but I travel for work and am required to travel other airlines that are cramped and not even close to as friendly in the skies. I appreciate the service and the value!!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Early Bird Costs,"This has nothing to do with the flight itself, it has to do with their ""Early Bird Placement and Costs"". SWA has recently upped their Early Bird costs ($25) and are now assigning ""B"" positions with such. Nt only are you not guaranteed an ""A"" position, you get to board after all the children and families, which board after the A's and before the B's. If you're not going to get an A position, why would one pay an extra $25 to board after any choice seats are gone. Very misleading on SWA's part. SWA used to be a deal, but other airlines are getting close to their costs. Just saying."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Got handicapped assistance entire way,I did not realize I could get such great assistances because I use a cane. I even boarded first and my husband with me. Not only did I not need to walk all over but with assistance we did not have to figure out where to go. My ONLY complaint with the airlines is that they did not have blankets available (maybe no airlines does these days) because cabin very cold. I wish I had thought to take a jacket on board even though it was hot outside!  Other than that it was a great flight with all employees being very courteous and everything on time! Not only was it the cheapest flight but the only airlines I saw that was not going to charge us for our luggage!  Will go to Southwest First next time I need to fly! Thanks Southwest Airlines!!!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Flawless Flight,Our original flight on Frontier was cancelled because of mechanical difficulties.   Quickly booked flight with SW...from booking to flying was completely flawless.   We would definitely fly SW again.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Our Trip to Tennessee,"My wife and I enjoyed our flight from Las Vegas to Memphis Tennessee.  The flight left on schedule without any problems.  If you have a Southwest frequent flyer number, you'll be able to watch TV programs as well as movies for NO CHARGE.  No matter how many times or as little times you fly, sign up to be a frequent flyer customer.  It's worth it."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Pretty dependable,"I’ve flown SWA for years,and rarely have anything worthy of a complaint. They aren’t (the crews) as funny, friendly and entertaining as they were once known for, and I miss that."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,LOVE THEM,"One of your best airlines, Allows  2 BAGS, carry on, get early seating, legroom if you book right fares are reasonable, can cancel and get a year's credit for another flight."
Date of travel: April 2019,10,"Unreliable, Unprofessional, Will Not Fly with them Again","I used to be very happy with Southwest's service, but lately it's been terrible. We had a flight booked with them for the end of March and were notified by text 5 days in advance that the flight was cancelled. When we called their customer service line, we sat on hold for 40 minutes before being disconnected. We called back, checked the automated system for flight status, and it said the flight was still schedule to depart on time so we thought it might just be a glitch. When we had time to call back later that evening (we'd spent the day at a family funeral, BTW), we again sat on hold for about an hour before speaking to 3 different people, none of whom were remotely helpful or even sympathetic in getting us a new flight. Oh, and while we were on hold, we were searching online for other flight options, and our original flight was still showing as available to book through Kayak and Hotwire despite the Southwest agents confirming it had been cancelled due to the Boeing 8 groundings. The ""supervisor"" I was eventually escalated to was the snarkiest person I have ever had to deal with, openly mocking me, and refused to let me speak to someone else. We eventually got a refund, I complained to the company about the way the supervisor handled the call, and they offered a mid-value voucher toward our next flight. Honestly, I would not have booked with them again had it not been for the voucher, so I guess it was a smart move on their part, but now I'm regretting it. I just learned that they've changed my next flights for December due to ongoing issues with the Boeing 8 groundings. The new flight times involved much longer layovers and did not work with our itinerary so I had to call to get them to change the flight again. Once again, the agent was unpleasant and borderline rude. When I asked if the flights were at risk of being changed again between now and December she said yes. I understand that things come up and flights sometimes need to be cancelled or rescheduled, but to have 3 out of 4 flights we booked this year cancelled is excessive. When I spend hundreds of dollars to book a flight, I would prefer to feel secure that I will be able to get where I need to go when I need to, and Southwest has lost all of my remaining confidence. I will not be flying with them again."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Solid flight. Good Price.,Flew with a family of 5. Economy flight so I knew what to expect. Free bags is a huge plus. Make sure you check in exactly 24 hours before your flight‼️ Your seats are not reserved.  You're seated with a group. Best price I found. Don't expect luxury and you'll be happy. Nice and professional crew.  Bring head phones. Watch movies on their free app while you fly.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Delay, but well informed",We recently were headed to Milwaukee from Denver on a direct flight. Our plane was slightly delayed arriving from Las Vegas. We were boarded quickly and left the gate on time. Before takeoff the pilot informed us that there was a storm heading for Milwaukee and we might be rerouted or delayed in the air. Sure enough as we approached the storm was directly over Milwaukee. The pilot informed us that we would be circling south western Wisconsin until it cleared as it was moving pretty fast. We circled for about 20 minutes and then were informed that we were headed in to land. After landing only 30 minutes late the storms hit the city again. Our pilot got us in between the waves of storms safely and kept us well informed. Thanks SouthWest. See you soon.
Date of travel: June 2019,40,GREAT STAFF,"This appears to be an economy airline, when it comes to staff .. and despite one lady doing everything, it was a winner. The top lockers for carry-on is a lot smaller which created a slight problem for me, but hey .. we managed"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Consistently good airline,"I have taken 4 round trip flights in the last 7 months on Southwest Airlines. On only one occasion did they have a delay in taking off, but made up for most of that time during the flight, arriving only a few minutes later than originally scheduled. Ever other flight has taken off on time and arrived earlier than scheduled. The plane has always been clean and the flight crews friendly.Some may not the no reserved seats, I pay the $20-$25 each way to ensure I am in the A group, so I always get the type of seat I want.They allow 2 checked bags at no additional cost, rare in the industry now."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,#SWG (SWGreed),"My flight from Indy got in to Baltimore early (PVD my final destination). I happen to hear a public  announcement that aSW flight heading to PVD was boarding ( my confirmed flight wasn't departing fo a couple more hours). I though great let me see if theres room on this flight ...there was plenty! excited I went to the customer service center where I assumed I might have to pay a $25/$50 fee to change my flight (even though I think is a little riduclous I was ready to pay....Well it wasn't $25, or $50 or $100 it was over $200 to simply walk on to a half empty flight with my only bag in hand. This message was delivered from an obnoxious, tired employee who just wanted to go home. Susan went on to tell me that I had originally chosen a discounted dare flight and was ineligible...I had simply picked an avg flight for an avg cost that was no less or more than any of their competitors .....Absolutley disgusted !"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Smooth and steady!,"For years and years I have flown Southwest frequently and cannot remember a single disappointing flight.  Service, pricing and staff have been excellent!"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Convenience and low cost,I visit relatives in Maryland a few times a year.  Southwest has several nonstop flights from Grand Rapids to Baltimore. The flight is about 90 minutes and the cost is reasonable.  You can check bags for free tooo.  I love it.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Ease of check in,"The only airline I travel is Southwest. I do self check and it is much quicker than expected. The self service kiosks are easy to understand and there are staff to help if you need it. You can check up to 2 bags free, you can’t get any better!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Hotel and flight were great.,"We used a park and Fly, stayed at the Double Tree motel the night before the flight next morning, can not say enough good things about the hotel or the staff. Would highly recommend this place.  The limo the next morning to the airport was great and the driver was super nice.   The flight was great as was the staff.  Over the years we have used Southwest many times and never had a complaint"
Date of travel: July 2019,50,My favorite,"I'll be honest, Southwest is my favorite airline. I travel for a living and have flown all the domestic airlines in the US. I'll never complain about business class but my personal favorite airline is SouthWest. The experience is consistent, the staff are fun to interact with and who can complain about 2 bags checked free. When I look for flights, I check with SouthWest first."
Date of travel: September 2019,20,Not impressed ,The flight itself was good but I wouldn’t recommend flying Southwest because I don’t like not having pre assigned seats. It feels like a mad rush to get on the plane in hopes to be able to sit next to your family members. I felt like without the pre assigned seats it brought the worst out of people as they would cut in line or leave a seat in between them and their travel companion knowing that nobody would want to sit in between them.
Date of travel: October 2018,50,vacation,free upgrades are always a fun way to start a vacation! Zipping thru the express lane was a breeze.  wait times were low and just everything worked perfect.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Great Airline,"Great airline and with bags included, it can be a better deal than other airlines. However, that is not always true. The people of Southwest though, are awesome, and that makes it a better experience. I fly them when it makes sense and always check pricing there before booking."
Date of travel: May 2019,20,When the rain comes,"B. The flight was o.k. But it was raining and they left our bags on the runway while attendants ran for shelter, everything in the bag was soaked. We complained but nothing was done."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,"""Glad It Was A Short Flight (s)""","As always, the Southwest crew was great.  Everyone was pleasant and ""entertaining""...I love the casualness of the Southwest environment,  I paid extra for early boarding so I could get an aisle seat, hoping for a tad more leg room....silly me....I haven't flown since a flight to Salt Lake two years ago.  When I go to Colorado on vacation, it's usually a family trip and we drive.  I traveled alone this year and was surprised at the total lack of leg room. It seems to have gotten worse. Once you get settled in your seat, there is no way to change your body position.  Glad this was not a long flight. Even with an aisle seat, it was very uncomfortable.    On the return flight, my adult Son was with me and this poor 6 ft 3 in guy really couldn't move and I gave him my aisle seat.  Talk about feeling like ""sardines in a can""!!  I guess that's what you can expect in today's aviation world.  I'm so glad that my years of business travel are no more.  However, kudos to the Southwest crews on both flights.  They don't have much room to do their job either."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,On time airline,"Left on time and arrived on time. Pleasant employees on the ground and in the air. They serve Community Coffee,a plus in my book."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Except for a last minute change the flight was good.,We were to a straight thru flight from JAX to Dulles with no plane change in Atlanta. We were told not to leave the plane when we arrived in Atlanta. At the last minute the plane was changed and even the Flight attentants didn't know what was going on. This change would not have been so bad if we had been informed when we left Jacksonville.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,They get you there and back....,"What can you say about Southwest.....This was a vacation trip to the Oregon coast and there are not many options into Portland. It was a long day for us coming and going with time change (only 2 hours but we were up 22 hours both ways due to the drive we had to the coast from Portland). All that being said, everything went smoothly with a small glitch that resulted in flight being delayed due to a flight attendant not showing up on time (what??). Anyway, Southwest got us there and got us home."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Excellent!,"I recently took a direct flight from Austin, TX to Denver, CO on Southwest Airlines. I have been flying Southwest for years and have enjoyed my experience. If you are new to this airline then you need to know that you don't choose a certain seat when you book. Instead, Southwest issues boarding passes with groups listed (A, B, and C). Group A goes first by numerical order then Group B then Group C. To get in Group A, you will need to buy an ""early bird"" boarding pass. The early bird pass costs between $15-$25 each way. This allows you get get on the plane early to choose your seat. One of the major advantages of Southwest is that the airline allows 2 free checked bags. I have found Southwest crew to be very friendly and helpful. Departures are typically on time."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Easy Flight,"We were able to get the seats we wanted although we didn't pay for the priority seating. It was a smooth, easy and quick flight and it had plenty of space to accommodate our luggage."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,On time flight !,"For the first time I can remember, we were boarded and left the gate 4 minutes early ! What a pleasure to have an ""on time"" flight for a change. We landed about 10 minutes early as well. The flight attendants were pleasant and helpful. All in all a pleasant experience. I recommend SW Airlines highly.  The ticket price was great so that added to my happiness with this flight."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Another fun flight,With nature in charge we had fun with wind and rain and sleet.All were in a happy mood because the stuards and stuardess and pilot were in a jovial mood.  They teased us and we teased them back.  The landing was a rough one due to the strong winds...............upon landing there was hoots and clapping all around. Yehaw!!
Date of travel: September 2019,30,SW Cancelled Us!,"Got a middle of the night call (two hours before our wake-up time): ""your flight has been cancelled,"" period, no reason. We HAD a direct flight (Denver to Baltimore). So we had to re-book and schlep from Denver to Salt Lake, then to Baltimore, after being up half the night. Flight was okay, but packed like sardines. Outgoing direct flight (BWI to Denver) was fine, on time, but with a ditzy flight attendant chit-chatting to buddies right next to me, blocking the aisle for over 45 minutes. I guess you get what you pay for?"
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Wonderful flying experience!,"Great service and very nice and affordable flight!  Enjoy Southwest - my new favorite airline!  This was not my first time flying Southwest but I try to chose them because so far I have never been delayed, they are extremely helpful and the flights are comfortable!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,On time. Nonstop,Boarding and in-flight experience is good. On-line check-in assures good seat selection. Overhead bins accommodate normal-size carry on luggage. Free checked baggage is a plus.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,PERFECT !!!,"if all the flights were like this one !!!The check in of our suitcase was fast, we registered them on the automatic kioskThen we put them on the carousel, no weight control.We pass through the security check and went to the boarding gate.Even if boarding started a little bit in late, we left on time.When we start the boarding there is no allocated seats, we can seat where we want, it makes the boarding more fast.Take off, we have some bretzels and a free drinks during the flight.We arrived in advance on the schedule time. and we wait only few minutes to have our luggage.All was perfect !!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Day trip,South West has some really to prices that makes it affordable to go on a day trip to another island.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,"Like a well oiled machine, Southwest makes flying smoooth.","Not having seat selection, I dreaded the boarding number and long line-up,  I was wrong to worry. Everything is handled so well, everybody was polite in line and we got to sit anywhere we pleased once we boarded.  All agents and flight attendants were extremely pleasant, one even wishing us a good trip, and telling us to ""be kind to each other."" Hey, that works!The seats were more comfortable than any plane I have flown in years,"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"On time with excellent service, plenty of water and no charge snacks","I flew from MCO to San Jose. The seats were comfortable, service was good, departure was ontime, and the price was reasonable."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Smooth and on time.,Southwest is always outstanding. The flight crews are a notch above the rest. Pleasant and fun loving. They make flights fun. Example. today the pilot came on and said we would probably arrive early. 'cuz he was gonna fly like he stole it and land like he owned it
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Another smooth Southwest experience,"As always, another pleasant Southwest experience. Gate person was pleasant, flight attendants were pleasant and informative. I tend to fly Southwest a lot because I often take my golf clubs, and Southwest is the only airline where they fly free."
n/a,50,My leg hurts,My wife and I and friends visited as Vegas for the 2019 senior nationals judo championship.  Which I competed in. The results were not what I expected.  I ended up tearing my MCL AND ACL.  That being said our trip back was concerning due to the injury and how uncomfortable and the amount of pain I was in. Havig purchased crutches in Las Vegas for the trip back to boise idaho I was given chick access through TSA and front row seating with leg room by the southwest staff. It was nice to see that my injury did not go unnoticed by the southwest crew. They made the trip back home quite comfortable.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Comfortable,Southwest is the only airline to fly   Luggage goes for free and you get to pick your seats. I love it
Date of travel: September 2019,50,great flight,"don’t normally like to fly,but this flight was so smooth no problems take off was great and they even had time to have a drink service!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Old Kings Highway,Traveling up Old Kimgs Highway from Chatham to Boston was a pleasent trip. Had the pleasure to meet numerous antique dealers and buy some treasures to have shipped back to Florida.  It gave us the opportunity to meet several dealers for contacts to share the finds with us. Planning on buying some finds from these dealers. Planning our next trip.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Southwest took ne where I needed 2 go.,I wasn't sure where I wanted 2 go but I wanted 2 take a plane trip so Southwest Airlines offered this as it's least expensive destination 4 the time I wanted 2 fly.  The outgoing flight was jammed packed but the incoming flight was somewhat spooky at first and the reason being there was only 28 persons on the plane because everyone was afraid 2 come 2 Florida because of the threat of Hurricane Dorian but long story short I actually liked it especially being at night.
Date of travel: February 2019,50,Can't go wrong,"Very efficient, flawless travel.  Comfortable flight.  Southwest seems to have it all figured out as how to be efficient."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Love Southwest Airlines and direct flights!,Enjoy flying on Southwest.. usually pay for priority boarding as I am picky about where I sit.. uneventful flight just as I like it.  Watched a movie on my iPad through their onboard serve both coming and going... love that it makes the time go quickly!
Date of travel: August 2019,40,short flight,takeoff and landings were smooth.  no particular complaints with flight or service.  did appreciate curb baggage check-in and not having to put out extra money for luggage.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Still Good,On time - friendly - boarding process fast and smooth and magically a full plane of people can all get their carry ons on board (unlike Delta ever can).
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Still the Best for Working Class People,"This is sill the best bet for Working Class People.I walked straight to the customer service desk for check in, no problems.     Even though I had to change planes I did not have to walk far to get to my connecting flight.   In fact it was  just steps away.  The airline staff was nice.  The plane was clean and comfortable.  I saw the pilot. The ride was smooth.    Not much on Food and Beverage but as long as I get there safe I can bring my own Food."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Rarely Disappoints,Southwest is always my first choice of airlines if they fly the route I need. No baggage fees is great and I appreciate the light-hearted entertainment that many of the flight attendants provide. Have had a couple of disappointments recently with cancelled or delayed flights but given the 737 max issue I'm willing to give them a pass.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Best Airline,This is a very good airline - nice planes and very good service on board and one of the main attractions for me was the fact that one could take two pieces of luggage (FREE) as well as a carry one - pretty amazing!
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Air,locally in the USA  i'll fly Southwest If all possible even taken a few bumps and were paid very handsomely
Date of travel: July 2019,50,On time airlines,what a great airline to fly lots of choices in times of arrivals and departures. The booking boarding very simple to use. The staff is always super friendly.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Uneventful! Just the way I like it.,Typical Southwest flight. Efficient speedy loading and unloading. Paid for Express boarding but there were so many people ahead of me in wheelchairs it was hardly worth it. Funny thing is most of them walked off the plane unassisted. Not Southwests fault. Just shows to what lengths someone people will go to cheat the system.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Airlines deliver on it’s promise,"I traveled from SFO to ONT last week and was again, impressed with Southwest’s efficient, prompt and economical travel.  They were the most cost-effective flight and while there’s no frills, they do fly efficiently and get you to where you’re going with an industry-standard level of comfort."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight!,"I flew to Atlanta from Chicago and back to Chicago through a plane change in Indianapolis to work at the Ace Hardware trade show at the Georgia Convention Center the beginning of September. Both flights were on time and everything went smoothly. You can always count on Southwest for reliable,friendly, and comfortable flying.You can also check up to 2 bags free."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Only Decent Airline!,As usual flying Southwest was comfortable and convenient.  I have about decided that I'll only fly to destinations that Southwest serves.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Great airlines , Love Southwest",We flew SW for a wedding to Denver and we love the fact they have direct flights for a little over 2 hours from our location.  They are adding more direct flights so be sure to check SouthWest for service to your locations.  They are always such a good value that helps people get from one location to another making it easier on the pocket book.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Convenient and reliable,On time.  Like free luggage.  No problems.  Staff was friendly.  Plane was not too crowded and we had storage because paid for early checkin.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Long flight,"While I generally am very satisfied with Southwest airlines this flight did not quite meet my expectations. It was a long flight - almost 4 hours - and there were only two working bathrooms. In addition to that one of the flight attendants was acting like a gestapo and making everyone go to the rear of the plane and not use the bathroom in the front of the plane. So we had to stand there in the kitchen where the other flight attendants were working to wait for the only working bathroom to become available.  Needless to say, it was not in good shape. The trash was overflowing and the floor was wet. Not a great experience."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Good flight but not a fan of seat selection,"Southwest is a great airline to fly with.  My own issue is I do not like not knowing which seat is mine and if I can sit next to my husband or not.  Of course you can pay extra to board first but, otherwise when you board in group B or C everyone has taken the isle or window seats leaving very little for a couple to choose from.  Employees are great, plane was clean and when weather issues arose (on flight home) they kept us well informed.  In our case the recent hurricane impacted our travel and Southwest let us change our return flight without any additional fees.  A plus in anyone's book."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,My son came home for a couple of doctor’s appointments,"My son is a graduate student in Florida. He had booked a flight for a Thursday afternoon to come home for a couple of doctors appointments. He had two scheduled for Friday morning starting at 8:00a.m.  Well his flight was delayed until midnight because of storms on the East Coast... After the plane was boarded, you guessed it, the flight was canceled. Southwest rebooked on a flight for Friday afternoon, that would make him miss his Appointments. I called SW customer service and explained how this is the only break he has and must make the medical appointments. So, the kind agent found a morning flight, and the doctor’s office squeezed my son in for late afternoon appointments. Southwest also changes his return flight for later, without a fee, so that he could rest before going back to school."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,great trip,"Comfortable, friendly and fast service!! The flight staff was very accommodating and helpful with all of my needs."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Let’s Go to Hawaii!!,"Southwest’s new routes to Hawaii are easy and a great bargain. The service is cheery and excellent. Eat a good breakfast before boarding, enjoy the complimentary snack pack enroute, and arrive ready for a delightful lunch near a Honolulu beach!! Pay the extra money for “early “bird” boarding, though. The flights are generally full, and at the low prices, many families fly them. Since families and active military board before the B group, it can feel like getting last pick for seats with a B or C assignment !"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"""Me Time""","Due to a multicar accident on the expressway, I arrived at the airport late as can be. Yes, I too missed my early flight to Las Vegas. When I got to the counter, the SWA associate already knew my story. I wasn't the only one who was left behind. She immediately worked her ""Magic"" on the computer, was done in no time flat! I was put on the next flight, which was leaving in 30 minutes. Arrived at the gate with minutes to spare. Not only did I maintain my ""A"" boarding pass, I was not charged extra for my inconveniences. SWA still #1 in my books!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Fan,"I always fly Southwest when I can.  It's good value, I have many points and love the Companion Pass program where my wife flies free.Southwest can be a bit of a cattle car experience but overall, it's a great airline."
Date of travel: December 2018,50,Excellent Flight Experience,"When possible I always travel Southwest airlines.  I have for years, found it to be the best flights, best customer service on the ground and in the air.  I have never heard or experienced a cross word during any flight I have taken."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,"Great flight,!","Great flight, no issues.  All on time with good customer service. I fly southwest when I can.  Went to visit my son."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Consistently good across the board,"It was a Good flight. It was on time, service was good, pilot had nice landing and take off. I would always recommend Southwest."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,The Times They are a Changing,"We have been Delta only loyalists for many years. That all changed when out son gifted us Southwest miles. We feel appreciated! Crew and comfort are both A1. We have many miles, and a couple of free flights to use up on Delta, then may make the switch entirely.Review by justbreathe19"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Weekend getaway to see a football game,We booked this package through Southwest Vacations and from the moment we checked in on line the day before our trip until the time we retrieved our bag in Detroit everything was perfect. The hotel and rental car were excellent and the flight was amazing. The service in the airport and on board was wonderful and we had a vacation that was absolutely perfect. We can’t wait to book our next trip with Southwest!
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Transfarency says it all,"I love Southwest Airlines. I normally fly out of PHL( Philly) and use it to go to most of my destinations. The flights  are generally on time and leave without a hitch. I especially like the "" bags fly free "" thing they have going on, although I usually have only carry one. They also have a policy of being able to switch flights or dates, due to unforseen circumstances, without being punished (exorbitant change fee)..BIG PLUS"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,SOUTHWEST BY FAR THE BEST,"I flew from Louisville, Ky. to Las Vegas non stop round trip, departed Aug 10th came back Aug. 18th. In between my trip to Vegas I flew to San Francisco on Aug 14th then back to Vegas on August 18th to catch my flight back to Louisville. It was all non stops flights 4 fights total. Now how lucky was I to get these flights non stop! By far the best vacation I have had and YES Southwest made it even better! Non stop flights are Great! and so is the friendly and great customer service of the Southwest Attendants and Pilots! I always fly Southwest and I always will! Thank You Southwest for by Far Being The Best!!"
Date of travel: July 2019,50,FLIGHT TO LAS VEGAS,Very smooth flight both takeoff and landing excellent service very friendly it was nonstop which make for a good flight
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Less Hassle than local choices,"Flying from central Missouri, I have a choice of Columbia COU which is a 15 minute drive and free parking, or drive to St. Louis (2 hrs + $7/day parking).I tried this time to fly United out of COU, but their website is clunky, every time you turn around they want more money for checked bags, and they only have 1 or 2 flights per day going East with a change in Chicago. Southwest had many more choices from St. Louis and I could also choose between landing in Boston or Manchester N.H.  In the end Southwest had it all: price, convenience, and schedule choices. We got a non-stop both ways."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Southwest flights,"Traveling with Southwest is the best, not only the flight attendance are very nice and welcoming, but I love how they do business. I like the fact that is the only airline that allows you to take two luggage without paying and that you can make a reservation with points and change it at any time without fees. You can also change a reservation that was paid with dollars, but you have to use it within a year, also with no fees. I also love how the run sales all the time. I do all my traveling with this airline."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Flight,"Check in is so easy at Southwest.  I usually buy early bird so that my husband can sit together.  However on this trip since it was a short flight, I didn't.  We were in ""B"" and had a seat together. The flight attendant were very friendly.  Promptly served a snack and a beverage.  The one thing I like about Southwest is that you don't have to pay for seats or luggage.  The price was right for this trip as well."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,weekend getaway,"The trip was nice just the wheather from New Orleans to Tampa was rough, the fly attendents can not serve anything during fly.  The fly back from Tampa to New Orleans was good and the fly arrived on time as usual."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,We Love Southwest!,We always fly Southwest -- especially when taking a cruise because of the luggage! We don't have to worry about packing for a cruise -- I am a chronic over- packer!!!
Date of travel: February 2019,40,On time and easy check in.,I fly southwest often and the service is great for an economy flight. Buffalo airport from curb to gate in 8 minutes.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Love the airline but not this flight,I was lucky enough to have a middle seat in row#1 or so I thought... Man in the aisle seat was quite large and not only took the arm rest but rested his elbow on me the entire trip...He should've had both seats but whatever...So we order drinks and I basically watched as the attendant gives drinks to one side of the plain while I watch my drink warm up... I've never been on a flight where they didn't go from side to side serving... WTH??? But the worst was she never came around to collect the trash until we were starting to land even though she could see me carrying a crushed can in my hand. She appeared to be packing a cooler for her overnight stay... Other than the flight was good...
Date of travel: September 2019,50,The ONLY airline,"The crew & pilots are always cheerful, helpful and often very funny.  I have a Southwest credit card and with my points my husband & I flew round trip from Florida to New York for less than a dinner for two.  I have been on other airlines, however Southwest is consistently better and more helpful if there a weather event AND you change your flight with no penalty on the difference in fair cost.  You cannot beat them.  I have been using them for five years and avoid other airlines if possible."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Airlines,"We flew as a family with 3 small children 2 of whom are 5 month old twins.  We got great service at the full service counter which you have to go to when traveling with infants that you must hold on your lap.  We boarded after the ""A"" group with families traveling with small children.   Since we had 3 adults traveling with 3 small kids they usually only let 2 adults on but they let us all board together.   On our return, we had a connection in Nashville that was going to be 45 minutes late due to an aircraft procedural check.  I immediately went to the counter and asked for another option and we were put on a non-stop flight back home which actually got us home 90 minutes earlier.   We had great service from every employee coming and going and had a great experience.  The only issue that we had is that the wifi did not work on the return flight.  They apologized for the inconvenience."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Overall great quick flight!,"This quick trip from Sacramento to Las Vegas was great. A quick board, ascend, quick drink, descend and land. The stewards were great. The seat were comfy and had no issue. The only thing that could maybe be a tiny bit better is the handling of suitcases. For the most part I think they do a great job. But I did witness at check in after I checked my luggage in, the clerk threw my suitcase like I was her enemy. Lol but I totally understand carrying peoples suitcase all day long is quite tiring. So overall great flight through and through."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,You can't go wrong with Southwest Airlines,"I always fly Southwest. They always leave on time, arrive early and provide good service. And you can take 2 carry-ons. They don't have first class, second class, etc. Just one and they don't assign seats. You can pick your own seat. I've never had any problem with them and think everyone should give them a try."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Excellent,"Great customer service. We have flown with Southwest airlines multiple times, and each time the people have been kind and the fight goes well."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Second Time on Southwest Airlines with my Newborn,"Traveling with a newborn in a car can be difficult, but traveling on an airplane is on another level! I first travelled with my baby boy when he was 10 weeks old. In July he was 5 months, both times flying international. He was very active and was just finding the power of his voice at the time. He wasn't interested in staying in his car seat but everyone sitting around me and the flight attendant was wonderful and helpful. Several people including SWA staff helped out with my car seat, stroller, bags and my baby. Not long into the flight my son threw up; it very messy and required a wardrobe change, then because that wasn't enough, about 30 minutes later he decided that going potty (number 2 - yikes!) was a good idea...(that poor guy next to me) took the smell on like a real trooper! Have you ever changed a diaper when sitting on a full row? It's not easy. The flight attendant in the rear of the plane gave me two plastic bags; one for his dirty clothes and the other for his dirty diaper. Then I needed to use the restroom...UGH! The flight attendant gladly entertained my baby. I wish I knew her name to give her a shout out, and to all the passengers that helped me boarding and deplaning with a stroller, car seat, diaper bag and my small personal item in Nashville, Ft. Lauderdale and Turks and Caicos. Thanks y'all!!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Direct flight,I was impressed. First of all it’s the ONLY airline that does a direct flight from podunk USA Oklahoma to Las Vegas .
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Room to spare,First time in a long time that I was on a Sourhwest flight that was little over half full  Nice to have an empty seat between my wife and I. Leg room was better than on a recent international flight on another carrier. Staff was friendly and relaxed. Everything was on time. Luggage was quick to arrive. Good flight in every way.

Date of travel: August 2019,50,"Trip to Kansas, Arkansas & Missouri to visit relatives.","The flights to and back from Kansas City went very well, even with a 1 hour layover in Denver, CO going & another layover of 2 hours at San Diego on the return flight.  The flight attendants did a good job of caring for needs of passengers; even though flights round trip were all seats taken.All in all, I would suggest using Southwest Airlines for traveling in general.  :-)"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Exceeded Expectations,"I rarely fly Southwest Airlines and I seldom fly for short distances.  However, this flight experience made travel so easy and convenient that I will be rethinking my travel plans to short-distance destinations in the future.  Check-in was fast and easy, the flights were on time and the staff was exceptionally friendly.  I especially liked the ability to board the plane and sit where ever I wanted.  The entire boarding process was more effecient and quicker than I've experienced with other airlines."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Count on Southwest,No airline except Southwest seems to suit us when we travel.  It's such stress saver to know you can check more than one bag if everything doesn't fit into one.  To be able to pay $12.50 for the peace of mind to board the plane with a good selection of seats is a great option and one that we always pay up for.  The staff on a Southwest flight is a happy group of people who joke around and make the passengers glad to be aboard. Other airlines just don't stack up to Southwest for us.
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Rude Passenger Crushed Hat In Overhead Bin,"My husband and I were coming home from our 35th anniversary trip to Scottsdale, AZ. We were the first ones on the plane and chose the bulk head because my husband is 6'6"". I had bought a special hat on our trip. I had carried it on in a shopping bag to keep it from being smashed. Of course sitting in bulkhead, it had to go up in the overhead bin.  The sterwardness announced that there would be 60 empty seats so everyone could all spread out in the plane. A young man asked my husband if the window seat was taken. He began to toss his luggage on top of my shopping bag as my husband said ""please don't do that as you're going to smash her hat"". The young man ignored my husband and threw his luggage on top of my shopping bag. By the time my husband was able to get up and move the suitcase to another bin my hat was smashed. The young man (kid) never apologized or said a word back when my husband told him that he smashed my hat. I was not able to reshape my hat. With 60 empty seats and that many empty overhead bins, he had to chose ours. People are so inconsiderate..."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Airlines leave earlier than the scheduled departure?,"Was left behind on Southwest flight 3688 service from Denver to Kansas City on Sunday, Sept 8th. Knowing that the Denver airport is a busy place, we got up early and checked out of our hotel and headed to rental car returns. 2-1/2 hours before scheduled departure time. It was one of those days that just kept getting worse as each minute passed. from the time we got to the rental agency, everything seemed to take longer than usual. Loading the shuttle to the terminal. getting to the terminal seemed like we were in slow motion. Once we got to the terminal, getting to the security check point was a challenge. Once there it was like the pictures you see of all of the immigrants trying to enter the U.S. at Ellis Island. Lined up passengers everywhere. The TSA staff were getting everyone through. In what seemed to be an eternity, we finally made it to the assigned gate and the plane was gone.   The SWA gate agent explained that they close the doors to the aircraft 10 minutes prior to scheduled departure time and can leave once the doors are closed. She booked us as stand by on the next flight out. Only to be left again as this flight was overbooked. The other SWA gate agents we spoke with for later flights were rude and condescending when asked about a refund. One told me I'd be lucky to get a voucher. SWA wouldn't guarantee me that they could get us on a flight at all day. At that point I decided to rent a car and drive back to KC. My son had classes on Monday morning I didn't want him to miss out waiting to see if we could get a flight or not.       I haven't flown on SWA for quite a while as it seems the low fairs they advertise never applies to the flights I am looking for. The fares are as high The big airlines.We had no issues on our outbound flight. But with how things transpired on the return flight, I will have a real hard time looking to SWA to book flights,"

We are most happy with the service and look forward to upcoming flights between oakland and Burbank  and Burbank back to Pittsburgh .Not only are the flight attendants good  even when full  the customer service over the phone couldn't be nicer."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Quick day trip to Burbank,"Our flight took off on time from Sacramento and arrived on time at the Burbank airport.  Later that same day, our flight took off on time from Burbank and arrived a few minutes early at Sacramento International.  The flight crew for both flights was very friendly and helpful and made the flight both relaxing and enjoyable."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Another Great Southwest Airlines RT,"I’m a late-comer to Southwest Airlines. My first flight with them in late March 2019, and only four flights so far. My goodness, there’s a world of difference between them and other airlines! Yeah, not a huge fan of their boarding process, but as long as you check in exactly 24HRs prior, you’re OK. The 2 free bags policy is amazing. Unfortunately, I have to fly United in October -only because Southwest doesn’t fly to my destination -and they are awful, and nickel-and-dime you for everything, like all the majors do. Southwest is a major that actually appreciates it’s customers. Can’t recommend Southwest enough -great flights & friendly staff."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great airline,Both flights on time.  All good in every aspect from service on the plane to the service on the ground.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,SD 2 Chitown Southwest,It was an easy check-in although I thought it was strange that SD closes the Ski Cab early during the week.  Security and check-in was a breeze in both SD and Chicago.  They were very strict in both locations on the baggage weight.  I was 2 lbs over on one bag and they made me move my stuff between bags.  My wife and I had an empty seat between us going both directions.  The flight was smooth in both direction although we did encounter a bit of turbulence on the flight back but the captain was able to move to a better cruising altitude and flight path.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Reunion trip,"SW does a pretty good job, nice new plane, and friendly crew. But will never be as quite as classy as Alaska, my favorite way to fly in the US.The cattle car boarding at SW and minimal cabin service is the biggest negative on my book!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Cleveland to Portland,"Great flight out of Cleveland. 3 hour layover in Las Vegas. That connection is not the greatest because the gate seating area has been taken up with slot machines. There were people standing for a long time. When it came time to line up to board, the lines of people were on top of the people still seated waiting to be called to line up. Just a crowded area due to space being eaten up by slot machines and there was definitely the casino noise from all those machines."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Russ & Vicki,"Awesome flight..4 hours... smooth as silk...Only Airlines we will fly!Watched TV and had snacks and soft drinks, coffee, water..."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Good flight,"Flights weren't fully booked. Good value compared to cheaper airlines and no luggage fees which to me is very important. Flights, both to and from on time. I don't like the boarding process due to getting in line and watching people get in line based on boarding number and seeing trying to figure out where they are in line and seeing people actually cheat the process but its livable. Employees and inflights are always cheerful. I had nonstop flights and plenty to choose from which is always a plus. Busy trip so I slept on my flights and not bothered by staff for soda and snack which was awesome. I'm sure I can find cheaper flights. but the service by Southwest is worth it to me to pay a little extra."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,They are so organized and friendly,You can tell that Southwest has a system for everything and so everyone knows their job and therefore all the passengers know that smoothness is the regular order of business.

The staff greeted me and assisted me with any needs I may have had.   The flight was flawless, the only exception was ..I think their snacks can be a little more creative."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Experience on flight,"Southwest flight round trip from Oakland to Raleigh was on time with good connections.  The airplane was clean, the staff helpful, friendly and competent.  Of course there is no baggage fee and the fare was cheaper than other airlines."

Date of travel: September 2019,10,Unreliable Southwest Airlines,"Southwest earned this “terrible” rating by cancelling flights on all three Denver-to-Chicago roundtrips I booked this year. Cancellations happen, I get that. But by the third time, I already had an uneasy feeling they would do it again.My Sept. 4 flight from Denver to Chicago Midway was canceled, they said, because of Hurricane Dorian, some 2,000 miles away. That’s possible, I guess. It was the only Southwest flight to Chicago cancelled that day, and it appeared that same scheduled flight did make it on from Chicago to cities on the East Coast. It’s worth noting that The Denver Post had just reported that only 17 flights to or from DIA and the Florida-South Carolina region were affected at that time by the hurricane, which had been downgraded to a Category 2.I might have let all that go had I not had a miserable experience from Midway to Denver in May, when my afternoon flight was delayed indefinitely, with no word on when it would actually leave. As my time at the airport approached 8 hours, I rebooked for a morning flight the next day and checked into a hotel. Morning came, and I was greeted by a text saying THAT flight was canceled and they’d send me to Cleveland on a 5:50 a.m. flight the NEXT day, and then to Denver. I went straight to the airport and miraculously got the last seat on a nonstop afternoon flight. At one point during that 24-hour ordeal, I heard someone who seemed to know about such things remark, “Southwest is getting greedy again.” A flight in January involved a legitimate last-minute cancellation because of weather, I think.I voiced my reliability concerns to Southwest, at the counter and with customer service over the phone, and suggested they’re losing customers because of it. I was told it is true Southwest “proactively cancels” more flights than other airlines, partly for safety reasons, partly because they fly lower than other airlines and into potentially disruptive weather, which I didn’t fully understand, and partly because their fleet of Boeing 737 MAX 8 Aircraft is temporarily grounded.“Bags Fly Free” and “No Change Fees” attract a lot of travelers to Southwest. But there’s no point if they can’t get you to where you’re supposed to go. Flying’s a hassle to begin with. Southwest caused major disruptions to my travel plans three times. They were once my go-to airline. Now, they’re a last resort. I canceled my trip and got a refund, and now I’m cancelling Southwest."

Date of travel: August 2019,50,SWA GOOD FLIGHT,Nice flight on August 20. We did have a little turbulence but it was Handled well by the pilot. Flight stayed on schedule.  On the return Southwest flight  August 28  from New Orleans to Phoenix. Trying to land in Phoenix was really bad weather which caused our flight to have to circle we arrived a little late due to weather. Our next flight was postponed  because of bad weather instead of landing in SMF at 10:45 we arrived at 12:00. Pilot handled the bad weather very good glad to make it back safely.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,My first pick everytime!,"They have the whole package.  Great service, no charge for first two suitcases, dependable airline, cheaper priced airfares and friendly wonderful staff from the time you enter the check in area, your flight crew and  last but not least, the baggage pick up.  Everyone you see and don't see that take care of you and your belongings!  Thank you to all of you."

Date of travel: September 2019,50,Our Getaway to Washington State,"Our two-leg flight to Seattle went very smoothly. Both legs (we went first to Baltimore/Washington) left on time & arrived early. With Hurricane Dorian coming up the coast, we worried about both weather & if planes would be in place with cancellations in the southeast. The reason for the 9 was that the BWI to Seattle was a long flight & it would have been nice to have a meal. Also, I wish SW would assign seats & do away with their present system of loading the plane."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,TSA premapproved,"Customers are encouraged to use devices for boarding passes. Southwest,and maybe no other airline has the ability to put TSA approved on an electronic device. I had to get of the TSA line, go upstairs, and get a printed boarding pass. Where is the advanced technology?"

Date of travel: August 2019,40,"Outbound was really disappointing, but the return was really good!","Yes, it was a late day flight 8:30 PM, but this was the worst cabin crew I have experienced flying Southwest, the crew was surly, all of them! they took the drink orders with an attitude, the system is bad with no cart but we were near the front and it still took forever! They were generally unhelpful and the announcements were lacking.However on our return trip we had a delightful crew even if it was 6:35 PM!"

Date of travel: June 2019,50,No hidden fees,"I have family in Indiana and have flown there many times on several different airlines. This was by far the best experience I have had. Everything was handled efficiently from check in to boarding. I had a brief layover in Maryland.  I have some mobility issues. They were helpful in getting me to my connecting flight. You also get two free bags flying on Southwest. A real savings. And it's not much, but a beverage and a bag of pretzels are a nice touch and help pass the time. I am pretty sure all of my vacations will be booked on Southwest."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Flight to las vegas,"Generally fly southwest to take advantage of their non stop routes. Research rates for best options. Usually choose a preferred seating option to end up in the A group. Have accumulated several thousand frequent flyer miles. Easy to make reservations this way also.

Date of travel: April 2019,50,The only way to fly,I have flown several flights from Harlingen to Phoenix & Ft. Lauderdale.nNever had a bad flight. Stewardesses have always been polite . Most all flights are on time.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Perfect flight and service,"The personnel was very kind and helpful.  I needed a wheelchair but had not made a reservation for it.  It was not a problem and the agent secured one right away and ordered one for me when I landed.  Our wait in line was fairly short- 15 min.  We were able to get through TSA quickly.  Boarding started 30 min. before flight which made it  more relaxing.  The boarding was very well organized.  In flight, the staff was again, very friendly, helpful and accommodating with our young grandchildren.  We arrived on time, actually a little before, and had a vety smooth landing."
Date of travel: August 2019,30,"Not Impressed, No Improvement","I was traveling with my family (4) during 'low season' to Mexico. Our 9:00 a.m. flight was late to board. The announcements were poor, hard to understand & they are not overly organized as to WHERE to line up. The pilot made up time in the air & the stewardesses were helpful- even serving me an ""extra"" bloody mary, because I had to do all the 'entry paperwork.' One luggage wheel was damaged also. Did receive good service & $200 voucher."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Great for the Price,Southwest is my airline of choice for great value.  This flight did not disappoint.  Unfortunately Southwest keeps reducing the amount of direct flights out and returning to Detroit so I am going to have to find a different airline.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,No Frills Flying,"Round Trip.  The price was right and the baggage fees great--Zero!!  To Seattle we got our boarding passes at home Online. The cruise ship company (HAL) took care of the return, which was wonderful.  We set our luggage outside out cabin and saw it in Nashville!!!

Date of travel: March 2019,50,SOUTHWEST AIRLINES IS THE WAY TO GO! NO “HIDDEN” BAGGAGE FEES! A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT OVER ALL!,"Southwest Airlines initially has a higher ticket price than some other airlines ; however here’s the catch. These other airlines charge $40-60 extra PER Bag EACH way you travel. So at minimum 1 ex bag is $80 plus tax , which is prob your difference in the ticket price anyway. So you’re better off sticking with Southwest. They are larger , roomier planes, and they are always clean. The people who work for the airlines were extremely accommodating for our trip when we needed help with a family member in a wheelchair to and from the gate. Very pleasant, and didn’t act as though it was a bother to help .  Southwest also flys out of almost ANY airport and ANY city. They’ve recently expanded their routes as well! I say stick with Southwest !"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Old Faithful,"Flying can be one of the most stressful experiences, especially when flying with children.  Flying Southwest makes the flying experience a lot more manageable.  First off, the free checked bags are HUGE.  No one else does that anymore and the fact that they still have it is such a big plus.  Secondly, as long as you're good about checking in at the time you're allowed, you should be able to get a high priority.  Also when flying with children, they allow families to fly right after group A, which is such a big help.  Lastly, they may not always be the cheapest, but I feel like you get good value for what you pay for.  There's something to be said for paying for something that is reliable, dependable, and can consistent.  Southwest may not have the best snack/food selection (which airline does nowadays?) but makes up for it with the family friendly experience and free checked bags."
Date of travel: June 2019,40,flying,"southwest was very helpful I like the airlines,an they have some good things going on. We fly to charleston, sc, Denver,  a lot.They might want to add more nonstop flights to charleston. Doesn't matter when we fly there always full. cramped, can't move,But I think all airlines are like that now ,just me venting. I would fly at midnight if I had more room. And I'll still use Southwest, I just don't like felling like a bunch of cattle being herded in to a cattle car."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,On Time and a smooth flight,"Six adults and four children ages 3,4,5and 6 traveling together had no problems. There were no assigned seats but when we boarded we were able to sit together 3 and 1 ahead of 3 and 3. There were snacks and beverages served and alcohol was available. Flight time was on schedule departing Newark and arriving in Orlando."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,my favorite airline is becoming one of my least travelled.,"i love the good humor, honest service, and unassigned seating.  however, the routes are becoming most inconvenient and sparse.  hey SWA, please give us more flights ..... especially please consider direct flights .... and we'll fly with you much more."

Date of travel: May 2019,50,Such an easy flight,"Southwest makes it so easy to check in early and boarding is so easy in Milwaukee. You know your boarding group, you line up when called, you board. Easy Peasy! We always have the option to purchase early boarding but honestly, it’s never hard to find overhead storage and seats together. We have never been in the final group so maybe it may not be as easy for them. This flight was quick, comfortable and quiet. We find this very typical of all our trips on Southwest."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,They do the little things really well,"I love Southwest.  Their fares are the best out of the 4 major airlines.  They don't hit you with a checked bag fee like all the others.  With their free app, you get in-flight wifi for free.  Also with the app you can watch new release movies.  I watched Picahoo and my wife watched John Wick 3.  Their stir sticks are made out of biodegradable plastic and their employees have helped me many times with stand-by flights, a free drinks, etc."

Date of travel: June 2019,50,Summer fun,No issues.  Always ontime and very friendly staff. This airline allows my small dog to travel with me. The only down side I see is I have to pay a fee for her and she stays in her carrier under the seat the entire flight.  She counts as my carry on. If she counts as a carry on there should be no fee.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,On time flight!,"Great flight....on time....luggage came in reasonable amount of time!Flight attendants were friendly, service was great!"

Date of travel: April 2019,50,Very Fast!,"It wasn't a full flight so we actually left earlier than expected. The flight from Columbus, OH to Las Vegas is usually about 3 hours and 45 minutes; however, we made in 3 hours and 20 minutes. This has been my quickest flight ever."
Date of travel: February 2019,10,OMG LONG DELAYS!!!!!!,"It was suppose to be 7.5 hr flight with my service dog.It turned out to be more like 14 hours or so. We were taken off our flight during a layover and was told ""4"" different times this was our flight and taken off Again or not board at all!!!!!ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! My poor devoted dog , I thought she was going to die. It was hot and they made us RUN the entire airport ""4"" times trying to board another.A ""R E A L NIGHTMARE""- REALLY! That was last February and said it was an unusual event...Then my friend flew 3 weeks ago with Almost the same EXACT Experience!SO NOT SO UNUSUAL! I think SW should do MORE For their devoted flyers that use them. $100 credit just DOES NOT CUT iT!I had to remind them that my service dog went through this With me!So, WE received a $300 credit...STILL NOT ENOUGH! My dog had an accident while running around because that airport had only ""1"" dog relief station! It IS Degrading for a fully trained service dog to do that. She was just Not herself!I was Actually frightened for her with that and the Extraordinary LONG delay we had to endure!"
Date of travel: December 2018,50,Flight to Reno,"I flew for the first time in a long time by myself to visit my kids around mid-December last year. I was able to get a relatively decent price on the flight from Vegas to Reno, even though there is no real competition to keep prices low on a short regional trip like that. The gals at the the podium that announce your flight were very organized and just kept repeating the quicker and more efficient we get this done the quicker the flight can be on it's way. Everyone was cooperative and found seats right away and because of everyone's cooperation our flight left earlier than expected. The flight attendants got everyone settled in and once in the air got started right away with drink and snack service. I always find the attendants on this flight to be very pleasant and accommodating. The flight was uneventful and we arrived early, which is always appreciated. My return flight back to Las Vegas on a Saturday afternoon did not have many passengers on it ( it was actually less than half full), so the flight attendant kept encouraging people to spread out and take a whole row if you would like because there was plenty of room. I have to say that even though there were not that many of us they still made us feel like we were the most important people in the world and I appreciated that. They could have phoned it in, but still made it a very pleasurable flight."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,On time,"Overall a good experience. Flight attendants were friendly, flight was on time both ways. Snacks were appropriate for the flight time."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Normal for airlines.,I prefer to fly Southwest.  I have never been stranded or delayed due to flight schedules.  We have been on other airlines.  We avoid them and will pay a slightly higher fee to fly Southwest.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Affordable and comfortable,"Cheap tickets, 2 free bags, on time departing and arriving, and no bumps.  I have never had a bad flight with Southwest.  I think this is my fifth.  If you are on line to check in as the 24 hr. clock begins you will get good seats, 3 together is not a problem, and you don't need to spend the extra money for the 36 hour ahead check in.  Only negative is that they don't sell food.  Only snacks. Need to bring your own."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Pleasant trip,"We traveled in Southwest flight 869 from PHL to SFO via DEN for a short stay of 50 minutes on 05/08/19. The Airlines offers free Check in luggage 2nos of 50 lbs each & a cabin luggage of standard size. In flight it also offers complimentary snacks corn chips, cookies, Tea/ Coffee & Hot chocolate, Apple/ Orange/ Pineapple juices.Water & Lime & Energy drinks. The service & hospitality of stewards are excellent.The seating leg space is sufficient to relax.The flight landed at Denver in time & the passengers meant for SFO are requested to seat in the flight itself & they can change their seat to their convenience.The flight with different flight crew members took of in 45mins & reached SFO well within 2hrs.It is a very pleasant journey for us."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Unbelievable Pilots and  ground crew,Rick Balckburn was our pilot. I am disabled and he helped those in wheel chairs personally onto his flight. I am 65 years old and have never seen this before. What an amazing job. They are an excellent airlines with great customer service
Date of travel: August 2019,50,The Best Airline 4 real people,I travel with heavy luggage and carry on packs. Bags fly free with Southwest as it doesn't with other airlines. You cannot beat the price and if you do add in the extra cost s. You can tell when employees love their positions  because the customer YOU are # 1 to them. Believe me sometimes I bring 48pounds bowling balls bags and most checkin staff are not overjoyed to see them but Most do their job like troopers and pleasantly move me on. There  are staff on flight services who should be on Comedy Central or AGT with communications and arrival verbals. Point being SW is the only way I fly.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Generate boarding pass then fight for your seat once on the plane aka saving seats,"Flight left on time. Crew members were friendly, I would have given Southwest Airlines a 5 star ratings, but, something has got to be done about people saving seats.  On the way to Mexico, there was an Airline attendant, that told a passenger to move over and let a person looking for a seat sit down.  I wished she was on every Southwest Airlines flight that I travel.  I like to ride in the middle seat, but, there is always someone saving 2 seats by putting their bags in the middle and aisle seat for someone in the bathroom(?!!??). I get motion sickness, and, I have found that sitting in the front of the plane eases my symptoms.  People will lie to your face and become very confrontational if you ask them to move their stuff. Southwest is open seating.  This is a plea for Southwest Airlines to announce over and over that saving seats are not allowed.  If you are on the plane before their Mom or husband, then, you should be able to sit in the first available seat.  I know that Southwest Airlines is aware of this problem, but, choose to look the other way on most flights and let the passengers deal with this mess. The best solution is allow passengers to select seats when tickets are purchased. With the problem of saving seats, selecting seats at the time of purchase would eliminate this issue and cause for a pleasant flight for all. Southwest Airlines please consider allowing passengers to select their seats upon purchase. Your current seating system is not working."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,The best airlines,"This is a customer friendly air lines ,no hidden fees, cancelation no charge .This is the only airlines I will fly with...and they do tell so good jokes in flights !"
Date of travel: October 2018,10,Dale Phillips,Arrived at airport got in line at gate received text saying flight was delayed- but the plane was in the gate. The Dallas flight in next gate had their plane broken- they diverted our plane to Dallas an made us wait 3-hours including the flight crew.  Then gave us s $100 dollar voucher.  Well that ruined my evening plans in Houston.  The southwest captain was furious as well- said they had never done that before.   I no longer trust southwest an would advise to travel them with care.  This flight was actually August of 2018.  I assumed it would cost them more for the Dallas flight to be delayed than the Houston flight.  But as a paying customer the flight I paid fir could have an would have been on time.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Another good flight with Southwest,We left Montego Bay Jamaica a little ahead of our 11.30 flight to Ft. Lauderdale. The flight was only about 3/4 full so there was empty seats. The connection to Jacksonville was also partially full and arrived early also. Always enjoy this airline do to scheduling and pricing. Recommend!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Good trtp,"Since we had to be in the Albany area prior to going to the New York City area, we chose to fly into Albany to avoid any of the New York airports, all of which are horrible these days.  Flew from Denver to Baltimore and then connecting flight to Albany.  Albany airport is small, not busy and easy to navigate.  Both flights on time.  Some open seats and my wife and I were fortunate to have an empty seat between us.  Usual good in  flight service from Southwest flight attendants."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Love Southwest!!!!,When I fly I fly Southwest! They are usually on time and always friendly! This last flight was delayed and I was going to miss my connecting flight but while we were enroute Southwest changed my flight to the next flight! I didn’t have to go to any service desk to arrange another flight. Love Southwest!!! I really like how you can connect with iMessage too and watch live tv and free movies!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight experience,"Unbelievable crew, very professional and courteous and entertaining:).  Flight was on time to depart and early to arrive.  Smooth the entire way."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,"Quick, budget friendly couples trip.","I'm a frequent flyer and I choose SW for my family travel. Southwest has a unique program and perks that can't be beat, namely the Companion Pass (cp). The companion pass is good for two calendar years when you earn it and is good for any and every flight you take during that period. That means every time you fly, someone else can fly free (plus $5.60 one way domestic; varies for international). My wife and I decided to ditch the kids for a few days before school started back up and go to LA for some beach time. We used the CP to save over $350 on airfair for her ticket. Can't beat that! The flight out was on time, smooth, and faster than expected. Had a layover (of course) in Chicago, didn't have to go a mile for the next gate, which was nice for once. Returning, we had an engine go out as we pushed back from the gate. We couldn't get off the plane and it was super hot! We sat for just over an hour until it was fixed. The wifi also didn't work...that REALLY made it suck! That's the only issue I've ever had with them though, so I'll get over it. I'll stick to SWA as long as they stay cost effective, friendly, and get me where I'm going safely."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great service,"Due to the late arrival of an earlier flight, we missed our connecting flight with Southwest.  The check-in staff at Southwest could not have been more helpful & booked us on the next available flight at no charge.  They were also very helpful with a flight change from New York to LAX on our return flight.  I've flown with Southwest before & that experience is the reason I made them my 1st choice with these flights."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Top class,"I flew connections today. Southwest never disappoints. Great service, always on time. Wish I could fly them all the time!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Never a problem with Southwest!,"We have traveled Southwest exclusively for the past 10 years.  We have never once experienced a problem, been frightened or treated less than perfectly.  This airline is top notch...No complaints here."
Date of travel: October 2018,50,Pleasant Experience,"Employees were helpful and professional. We used the ""wanna get away"" offer which was the least expensive, even better than a senior discount. Flights were on time."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great flight as always :),As usual my flight was great and had zero problems boarding. I look forward to flying with Southwest again.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Great Flight,Great comfortable flight.No deals.Leg room was tight. Would have paid extra if the option for more leg room was availabe.
Date of travel: October 2018,50,"First of Many Flights, comfortable:","I have never flown before , but the airline that was choosen by my daughter was very efficent and the customer service was excellent. I was amaze. that I was acually flying on a plane.  It was a smooth and pleasant flight. If I ever fly again it will be with Southwest. The best first experience that I have ever had of anything.  Thank you."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Long flight. Needs more food options,"This is a great flight if you are flying to NOLA from the Bay Area.  It is actually one of the few nonstop flights, and is probably the best price.  However, make sure to take food with you on the flight, because you only get pretzels, Fritos, or shortbread cookies. It would be nice if Southwest had more food options for some of their longer flights. That being said, Southwest is still the best flight to take and the free checked bags is an added bonus."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great flight.  Boarding was easy even though I was B1,"This was a direct flight that was a special rate.  The flight was smooth and on-time.  Boarding was easy and smooth also.  I was able to get a window seat even though I was B1.  Checking the bag at the curb is the best way to go.  By the time I de-planed, I only had to wait maybe 10 minutes for the luggage to arrive.  It is a short flight so all you get is drink (soda, etc) and 8 little hard pretzels :-)."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Smooth ride,Our flight to Maui was a smooth evening flight...my husband and I had a row (Aisle 8)  to ourselves..it was not a full flight.  We had a snack pack to munch on and drinks.  The pilot captain kept us updated on weather in Maui.  The flight attendant was very helpful...I liked his Hawaiian Kukui lei with seashells.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,"Reliable, Friendly No Frills Flight","Southwest provides an excellent, reliable, friendly, no frills flight.  As usual flight was on time.  Boarding appears to be chaotic at first, but is actually quite as efficient as possible."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Outstanding Customer Care,"Travel on Southwest Airlines with two parents needing assistance was a breeze thanks to Southwest’s caring and nurturing service.  We had 6 bags to check and needed to return a rental car.  The attendant checking us in made it easy and ensured that someone was available to help me push my parents to the gate.  Once on the flight, the attendants were kind and helpful.  Plus we landed on time! Thank you, Southwest Airlines."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Well oil operation and nice,"We had a great experience flying for a long weekend wedding trip.  Our biggest concern after enjoying a good flight and wedding was getting home before Hurricane Dorian hit Florida.  We changed our return flight before we departed Tampa.  We changed it again while in Los Angeles as more info came in about the hurricane.  Southwest was great about making it easy to get on basically flight we needed with no extra charges.  The flights were always on time or early and the crew on board was great.  Of course being able to take baggage for free is wonderful.  The planes were comfortable, clean, and in good functioning shape.  Price our our flights were basically competitive with the best fares I tracked over the months."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,The last no-hassle carrier left,"I’d almost forgotten what it was like to drive up, check luggage (!) at the curb and then get free soft drinks and tiny snack on the plane. I have miles on American but I swear next time I go to Dallas I’m only going on Southwest."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Simply the best,With no change or bag fees Southwest is simply the best. I just wish they would give us the opportunity to pick actual seats instead of boarding groups.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,no problems  free snacks and beverages,pick your seat. attendants where friendly and helpful. lots of free snacks flight was on time. no problems
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Had to Share My Seat with the Person in the Middle Seat!,"I had a mid-B boarding position.  The first seat that I attempted to get was I believe being saved for a person behind me in line.  A purse was left on the seat, and when I asked if it was open, I was told by a woman in a room that I had passed that it was occupied.  I really should have taken that seat as saving a seat is supposedly not allowed.  I proceeded further back and found a large guy in the window seat but both the middle and aisle were empty.  There was stuff on the middle seat which I now realize was his way of saving it for his significant other.  When she arrived after I took the aisle seat, it quickly became apparent that it was going to be a tight squeeze fitting her in the seat.  Consequently, part of her upper body spilled over into my seat.  It was a constant battle for the hour flight to claim my seat space.  Yes, I had the aisle  seat but it is a little uncomfortable bending your body at an angle for an hour.  Also when the beverage cart or passengers go by, you have to move out of the way.  If you are large and traveling as a couple, you really need to book an extra seat and not expect the unfortunate passenger next to you to give up part of their seat."
Date of travel: February 2019,50,Love this airline!,"I sit in bulkhead,  due to my disability.  Open seating gives me a guarantee l can!  Everyone is so nice.."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Still as good as ever.,Best low cost flight in the USA. Fun to fly with flight attendants that are friendly and helpful. No cost for luggage is the best. We will fly them again. Only negative is they don’t fly out of our local airport. We have to go to Philadelphia or Baltimore.
Date of travel: May 2019,40,The only commercial airline to Midland,"Flight too and from Midland are expensive. Don't believe the ads about cheap airline travel. They don't apply to Midland, TX. Security isn't bad for a small regional airport. Traveled business class to be one of the first ones to board. You still are taking a chance on getting a seat with room. Sometimes it works other times not so much."
Date of travel: April 2019,40,Nice flit,It worked out great for us check in wasn't bad the lines were not long try to go early if you can because it seems to go more smoothly if your not rushing around . The flight was great we did not have any delays or hit any turbulence during the flight we had plenty of leg room and the flight attendants were very nice they even had a bus there waiting to shuttle us to our hotel at Disney world I would fly with them again.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Love Southwest!,"Flew round-trip from Tampa to San Antonio to visit Bandera, Texas for the weekend. Fun weekend - Tampa Airport is one of the best in the country."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight 6004 BWI to SAN,"The flight left BWI right on time, arrived 10 minutes early in San Diego.  We made a quick bathroom stop and walked to the baggage as our luggage was arriving. Perfect timing all around."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Long weekend in Boston,"We flew to Boston over the Labor Day Weekend and both of our flights were on time. We had no trouble at either airport, and people had told us Logan would be slow getting into and out of. However, we had no problems. Southwest always does a great job of getting us to our destination safe, and on time."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Quick and Easy,"Low fares and fast flight. Absolutely will watch for another sale soon ! So close to the beach, will never drive again."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Flying experience,Great easy flight. Staff was very professional and overall great. Checkin is easy.Flight was on time.
Date of travel: September 2019,20,Not recommeded,My flight was at 11:35 AM and I arrived 2 hours early as expected only to find out that the airplane had mechanical issues and it was still in Chicago. So it was delayed by 4 hours and all they gave was a $100 voucher. My time is worth a lot more than that!! It was a business trip so I'm lucky my training didn't start until the next day. I won't be flying Southwest again anytime soon.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Love Southwest Airlines,"Southwest airlines is my favorite airline.  They offer you free luggage, free carry on, you can change your flight without penalty (just pay the difference or book within a year), the staff is nice, in our particular flight the stewart went over safety features and told us if we could figure out and name the 7 movie lines he told us during the safety features he would buy that person a drink. Very clever way to get everyones attention."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,I love flying Southwest.,"NEVER fly through Midway!! Worst airport anywhere. I wish Southwest would use their power to make some changes. All restaurants and bars are a rip off. They do not post prices on drinks. We paid $22 for a glass of wine . We got stuck there over night, most horrible night possible. I have flown all my life all over the US and I realize airport food and drinks are expensive but this was deceiving."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Newark,"Roundtrip flight was wonderful.  However, the service at Newark airport was terrible.  Took a long time to get checked in at the ticket counter, took almost as long to get through TSA, then even longer to get through the screening even though there were 3 separate lines to go through."
Date of travel: August 2019,20,Not happy...,Not happy after arriving at airport to find my direct flight to St. Louis was cancelled. They made up an excuse as to why it was cancelled but I'm sure the real reason was the flight wasn't full. I can't remember Southwest ever doing this to one of my trips.  I should have flown Alaska Airlines.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,CLE to Las Vegas,"Overall good experience with Southwest Airlines. We travel quite a bit but don’t use Southwest a lot. I have not had any bad experiences but the line can be crowded at times. Every facet of the trip was good, easy booking with a direct flight home; decent boarding number and good seats ( not in the back near the bathrooms); staff was excellent  .Service and snacks were good as well."
Date of travel: November 2018,40,Direct flights,"Always used nonstop flight to Atlanta on Southwest . Earned reward points reducing costs. However, when booking for the upcoming holidays found it difficult to book a nonstop flight. We then learnt Southwest will no longer be providing non stop flights to atlanta, so we booked with Delta a nonstop flight and will end up losing our earned reward points with Southwest. But that's how important a nonstop is to us!! Maybe able to give our points to a family member who doesn't mind connecting flights."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Hassle Free,"I always enjoy flying Southwest, it's never a hassle and is consistently seamless. Our flight was on time and we enjoyed the free in flight movies. Flight crew were polite and helpful as usual. Nothing but great things to say about Southwest. I recommend choosing Southwest every chance you get. You will be glad you did."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flawless Flight,"We've been on many many flights with many many airlines,  and gotta say our recent experience with Southwest airlines rates a perfect 10, even though we didn't book a non-stop flight...EVERYTHING was perfect including ""on time"" plane changes, super friendly plane staff, and FREE undercarriage luggage...Definitely hoping to fly with them again...THANK-YOU Southwest Airlines..."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Short flight to Portland,I really like Southwest though I have not traveled with them frequently.  Respectful to passengers and welcoming.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always excellent service on Southwest Airlines!,"My husband flys weekly for business on Southwest Airlines and because he flys so often I get a pass to fly for free with him whenever I can. Needless to say, we fly a lot! We have never had a bad experience, yes, once in a GREAT WHILE we’re delayed or something but they always go above and beyond to make us informed and comfortable. That goes for everyone on our flight, not just for us frequent flyers! The flight attendants are always so wonderful, nice and helpful! We once booked a flight with American to Hawaii (before Southwest flew there) and we were ONE MINUTE late checking our bags in (one hour before departure) because we stopped to help two women with 6 kids lugging everything and everyone up an escalator and American did not care! They made us book another flight for $900. EACH. We complained to CEO and again nothing! Southwest would have gotten our bags on without ruining our vacation, because that is what Southwest is, a company that values your life and wants you to be happy, other airlines just want your money and don’t care about you!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,great handling by SWA,With over 100 school age children on a camping trip in California I thought it would be horrible but the flight attendants were ready and kept everything tin order. You never even knew they were there. Thank you Southwest Airlines employees
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great services!,I can simply say that I loved to fly with them! Great staff.P.S. free snacks and drinks even if you are flying just one hour :)
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest is the Best: Still Easy After All These Years,"Years ago, before A, B, and C boarding, I fell in love with Southwest for all the reasons they are successful today. And speaking of today, they continue to make travel easy and accessible to all. There was, however, a glitch. Lining up for A, B, and C was getting complicated. People saying ""I'm A42, you're A41, but it doesn't really matter"" and they basically ""cut"" the line. Well, this most recent trip I went from FL to CA, CA to RI, NY to FL. At the gate for each flight the gate agents made a point of saying ""don't be shy about asking your neighbor for their number and moving to your place"" or some version of it. It made the whole thing easy. I know it sounds little, but it's big. And for SW to recognize it needed to retrain its customers in this friendly, loving way is brilliant. I choose SW whenever I can. ENJOY!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,"Curbside check-in was fast, I had ordered a wheelchair and was given a wheelchair assistant that took me to the gate. He came back when boarding and took me to the plane. All Southwest personal were very polite and helpful. There was a wheelchair and assistant waiting when I got off the plane in New York and helped me get my luggage and stayed with me until I got into a car."
Date of travel: August 2019,30,SW-Air,"SW has good service; if only seats can be a bit more spacious.  Huge perk about this airline is 2 free baggage under 50 lbs.  Since my husband went on his beer-run at Russian-River (Windsor), those 2 free baggages per person really helped."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,"ON time, clean , and good flight",Always enjoy Southwest but hate the boarding process so I end up up-grading my seats to get on first or near first .  Flights have always been clean and I enjoy the people that work for them .
Date of travel: September 2019,50,LUV Southwest,As always the Southwest crew was pleasantly attentive and we had a great flight. What was really special was seeing the refueling guy run up the jetway to get a wheelchair for an elderly woman and then wheel her up to the gate area. These folks take customer care seriously.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Good flight,"Brand new plane, more room, clean, shiny.Attendants, warm, friendly, pleasant. Great serviceWe were going to a celebration of life event for my brother. So we were somber, but they were sweet.  Short trip, but even the pilot was friendly as we boarded he was leaving the plane and we told him he had to stay. He chuckled and said he had to check the tires first. Plane was not full so we had middle seat room. Yeah."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great trip via Southwest Airlines,Ground staff very efficient.  Easy boarding process.  Flight was not overbooked nor was it full so we were right on time.  Steward/ Stewardesses fun yet provided great service.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great Flight  and service to and from Jamaica. Non stop,The flight to and from Jamaica was Great. The service at the airport from Southwest associates was excellent at BWI and Montego Bay. I was impressed with the flight attendants helping customers. I recommend Southwest Airlines. The best thing it was a nonstop flight.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,rare empty seat,Thank god for the hurricane.  Haven't see that many empty seats on a plane in a long time.  Felt good especially since they've all made the seats smaller.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Excellent from check-in to return.  We are in our 80s and they did everything right,"We used wheelchairs and they took care of everything, even lifted our carry-on.  Seats were comfortable and the flight was smooth and enjoyable."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,SW is my first choice,"I always try to fly SW and have never had any problems...as opposed to late and canceled on other airlines.  It left a little late because of weather, but it made it up and SW kept me updated by text.  Arrived on time with no problems at all.  Flight was not too long and direct flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Airline trip,"As always a great flight, Southwest always provides friendly super serviceThey also have a nice rewards program"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Simply...the best!,"After some pretty pathetic experiences on AA, the airline where the customer is always wrong, I switched to Southwest, got a credit card from Southwest and have been happily flying all over...and charging all to my SW c. card...too bad they don't fly to the rest of the world..............Thanks Southwest!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Excellent Service,"I want to share my experience with Southwest Airlines; at the gate, at the baggage register area, the employee was so nice, with a smile and very respectful. The flight was so pleasant and the flight attendants are the best. Thanks for an excellent experience. A+"
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Change in Flight schedules make sit impossible to reach the destination in 1 day,Southwest used to have flights that connected through Denver to enable us to get to Belize in one day. Now we have to fly to Houston one evening and wait to get on a Belize flight the next day. Same thing in reverse coming home. We lose a day of diving during our acation time and also have to pay for 2 extra nights in a hotel in Houston. So not happy.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,They are a very friendly Airline,We took a trip to Disney with our grandson.  This was his first flight and he was not sure if he would like being up so high.  It turned out he loved it.  He even sat by the window.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,I LOVE Southwest Airlines,I love flying Southwest.  It is easy to book and/or change flights.  The staff is always pleasant and often funny. but always ready to help.  I try to fly only Southwest!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,multiple flights to and from California,"Friendly staff, easy boarding and comfortable trip. No problems with layover, connections or services available at the airports-Southwest terminal.Seats are no tighter than all of the airlines and baggage was delivered quickly. Easiest airline to travel with."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,"After you make your reservation, keep checking the fare","I fly quite frequently to the beautiful Northwest on Southwest.  I have found that the fare may have changed just days or weeks before your scheduled flight. If the fare is lower, go online to ""Change"" your flight.  Choose the same date and flight as your ""new"" flight.  The money you save can be credited to a future flight but YOU must keep track of the original confirmation number or it disappears!This is just one of many great things about Southwest Airlines."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,First time on Southwest ,This was my first time to fly Southwest.  American is my go to airline but this was business.  Enjoyed my trip.  Will fly Southwest again.

Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great experience,"On time, comfortable flight. The crew was great!  Fun and friendly and took time to stop and interact with passengers. A nice experience."
Date of travel: May 2019,30,self,"I selected an early morning direct flight to Los Angeles in order to attend our ceremony in the evening time and also to get away from evening rush our traffic. We were already on the road to the air port, and I receive a text message - your flight is canceled. The weather was all clear and no reason was given why the flight was canceled. We still went to the air port and get different flight with extra stops. At St. Louis our flight was delayed for another 50 minutes, because they have to load the cargo. What they have been doing until all passenger boarded?Later I had another connection from Oak land to Ontario, CA - the flight was delayed for another 1 hr and 20 minutes. By the time when we reach to our destination our total air line traveling time was 16 hours and 45 minutes.On the way back, we were returning from Las Vegas - after all passenger boarded, flight captain announce after 15 minutes, there are storm on the way, so we are waiting for authorization for different route, but we still will make it to Chicago before scheduled time. It took almost an hour to pull the coach off the gate and by the time when we arrive the flight was 40 minutes late. I don't know if it really save our travel time by changing the route and again if that was the case, why they didn't try earlier for different route.Also it was not only our flights were late, I was listening and watching on the monitor, so many South West air line flight were posted delayed.Over all I was not that much impress with South West airlines services."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,They make flying so easy,I love that I never have to check luggage (2 bags free). Getting to check in the day before your flight makes boarding a breeze. I also love the fact that you don't have assigned seats. The staff is always very helpful and professional while being nice. My only negative would be they count a purse as one of your bags :(
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Glad I chose Southwest,"I chose Southwest because it was a non-stop flight & I hate connections. Plus, the price was good. I love that they have senior fares & 2 free checked bags since it's difficult for me to reach the overhead bins. The gentlemen who checked my baggage outside were very helpful & the inflight beverage & snacks were also good! I'll be going to Denver again next May & will choose Southwest again!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Quick trip to LA,Needed a quick & cheap flight to LA in order to go on a cruise from LA  to Vancouver.Driving down to Buffalo is seamless since you are required to get to Pearson so early in order to check luggage & go through security..... Southwest Airlines offers 2 FREE checked bags with every flight... and honestly it only takes maximum 10 minutes to go through security in Buffalo... even with the CND - USA exchange rates... 2 people can fly return with 2 free bags each for just over $ 550. US$$With less hassle!! Check out other cheap airlines... JetBlue & American Airlines
Date of travel: August 2019,50,The Great Colorado and New Mexico Adventure,"Nice flight. On time. Checked in exactly an hour before and still got a B12 and B54 seats on outbound and inbound flights. I wish there was a better system,"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Family visit,"Every three months my husband and I fly up to Albany NY and back to Orlando Florida.  We visit my two sisters one who lives in the Albany area then we drive to Syracuse to visit my other sister.We wouldn’t think of flying any other airline but SouthWest Airlines.  Southwest is usually always on time,  crew is usually pleasant, courteous and helpful.  Their pilots are experienced in flying in all kinds of weather.  They still have some direct flights to several locations .  As far as I am concerned Southwest is the very best!!They even gave my husband and I a bottle of Champagne when we flew to Vegas to Renew our vows!"
Date of travel: August 2019,30,New Orleans,From Dallas Love we boarded on time but sat on the plane on the runway for almost an hour.  I was very disappointed and late arriving to New Orleans.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Best way to fly!,"Staff is always so friendly.  Passengers seem friendlier, too.  Love being able to take 2 bags free.  It is also easy and free to change plans if needed."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,New back plane entry option,This was a nice ride to and from Long Beach airport. Southwest has the new option to board from the back of the plane and this changes the boarding game. If you have are at the tail end of A group to board and you have slow people in front of you then those in B group may have a better opportunity to beat you to better seats. You’ve been warned! This goes for the other boarding groups as well.
Date of travel: November 2018,50,Always perfect,"My oldest daughter lives in Florida so we fly quite frequently and always get great service no matter who is flying, just me, or the whole family.  Sorry to say last time I went it was to attend my late son in law's funeral.  I travelled with my daughter, granddaughter and great grandson who was only 7 months at the time and we got great service, priority boarding since we had a baby and I was in a wheel chair.  A very sad trip but the flight was a good one."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,"Up, Up, and Away","Left about 8 minutes late and arrived 10 minutes early.  The flight from Milwaukee to Phoenix was comfortable, easy check in both to and from and the flight crew was outstanding, they made us feel comfortable and appreciated.  We will always use SouthWest for our air travel. The biggest thing was the price was right."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always Easy and Dependable,"We booked Southwest on non-stop flights from our home airport to Orlando. On Friday morning we were on a flight with only 74 people out of 180 seats and on Sunday morning the following week we were on a flight of 55 people out of 180 seats. We did not purchase Early Bird but got A boarding both times.My favorite things about Southwest are the 2 FREE checked bags, free snacks and drinks on the plane, free in-flight TV, and friendly flight attendants. If you get one of the newer planes the headrests are adjustable so you can form them around your head while you sleep."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Stress free flight,"Was worth the little extra m9ney to fly out of Manchester instead of hasseling with Boston traffic. Hartford is always an option but their fares have risen too much. Annoying that the choice of times of flight has lessened though. Getting harder and harder to flnd flights that dont take you wya out of your way or worse, 7 hours to fly. Still I like flying Southwest. Quick, easy flight this time."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Excellent experience,"All my flights were on time time,  we received excellent service on the flight, it was an entertaining crew"
Date of travel: September 2019,20,Disappointed,"May I start this review with ...Southwest Airlines is my go to airline. I have always chose them whenever possible. In my experience they have been the most reliable, timely, and friendly. I'd also like to mention that I hold some responsibility in our disappointment and write this review with suggestion for the airline. On Labor day weekend we traveled with two other couples to San Antonio with a connecting flight in Houston. Somehow, I booked the wrong connection and was instead on a flight that left 3 hours later, arriving in San Antonio at 10:00 P.M. As soon as I realized what I'd done, I checked in with a Southwest representative to see if seats were available on the earlier flight, and if we could switch. I was told the flight was only half full, however, we would be charged $900 to change the flight. This charge far exceeded our original purchase and seemed excessive since we had 200 miles remaining in our journey. Coupled with Southwest Airlines mantra of no change fees! I reached out to Southwest online and explained the circumstances but was told I had purchased a discounted fare and the no fee rule did not apply. From a customer point of view and as I saw my friends shove off from the gate on a plane with many open seats, Southwest Airline missed an opportunity to exceed in service by helping to solve a problem cause by an honest mistake. Instead, I received a message from Austin online saying ""sorry we can't help but thank you for reaching out"".  Simply, it seemed to be very easy to get us on the earlier flight since there were many seats available, and an opportunity to exceed our expectations was missed."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Quick Get away,It was a great non-stop flight to Cancun.  Flight was full but you couldn't tell from the excellence service that the flight attendants provided.  We will only fly Southwest!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Got to witness The Honor Flight war veterans deplaning at my gate!,"Southwest is always on time and always gives service with a smile!! Pilot welcomed me aboard, they wished me well on leaving and offered drinks and refills!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Den-BNA,"On time, smooth flight, good wifi and entertainment. Typical Southwest experience.Good cabin service."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Southwest Then vs. Now (still best of the worst),"I fly primarily Southwest. I started this with the company I worked for in the 80's. I used to rate them higher than I do now, but for economy flights, I still prefer them. Like all of the airlines, they have struggled this Summer of 2019. Struggled to provide enough flights, flight times that are reasonably attractive, fares that are good.  They also have trouble staying on time and are delayed more than they used too. They are now more likely to tease potential customers with a good rate, but provide it only once a day at a horrible hour (so common in the industry).  This summer I feel fortunate that both of my flights to the Midwest were on time, including connectors.  The free bags and other perks are a plus. Flight attendants are generally good natured...but seem less jolly and energetic than they were in the 1990-2010 era. Now it sometimes seems forced. I definitely recommend paying extra for early bird boarding to assure good seating options. SO Southwest...still best of the worst in this era of economy airline companies in my opinion."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Friendy ontime service,"Friendly service. Easy online booking. Flight arrived on time. My wife needed extra assistance, very accomodating."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,"Friendly, helpful and efficient service. Get on and go, on time. Best fair prices without the maze of pricing."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Mr,"On time and attentive attendants. Flew to Columbus Ohio first, continued to Fort Myers on the same plane, and was able to get an Exit Row seat with no seat in front of me. Great extended leg room!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great Rates,I love flying Southwest. They truly take care of their customers and try to make sure everything is flying smoothly.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Music City to the Heartland of America!,"From BNA (Nashville) to OMA (Omaha) and back again. Excellent flights and service from check-in to baggage claims. I love Southwest Airlines; a class act all the way! Wonderful staff; very friendly and professional. Both airports were great, most especially Nashville. This was 2 weeks before this became a direct flight in June, so should be even better now."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,On time. Attentive Flight Attendants,On time. No drama. Appreciate the helpful pleasant staff. No frills especially useful for short flights! Thank you!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flying experience,Their super friendly staff made the whole experience enjoyable!  They were on time and  very efficient.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Affordable Flying,"Although the seating is tight, it is worth it to fly on Southwest Airlines. No fee for first bag (huge savings), pleasant staff, ability to check in 24 hours before which gives you the opportunity to have better seat choices."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Where's My Itinerary?,"24 hours prior to departure I was trying to do the preboard check-in.  It kept coming up with an error, please contact the airline when you arrive at the airport.   So, when I get to the airline to get my boarding pass they don't have my reservation!  They asked when I booked my flight, I said I believe in July.  I was kind of concern when 3 other agents came over to help my guy out.  Did you make any changed to your reservation he asked?  Well, actually you guys did!  First, you canceled my flight due to the Hurricane.  Then after several agents and four hours, I got switched into flying into Tampa out of Midway.  I was thankful because I had a conference I was attending.  Who cares if I had to spend the extra money and had to drive like 2 hours out of my way.  I was going to make it.  So what seems to be the problem?  Well, we don't have your reservation!  Um~ what?  Now,  I'm getting mad.  As a former travel agent, I know how things work and it wasn't supposed to be like this.  I'm with 4 other people, I have to catch my flight and now I don't have a spot you have to be kidding me.  I call one of my other friends over because she was having the same issue and she said they had to call a supervisor.  So the agent finally gets on the phone and after about 10-15 minutes I finally get my reservation.  I'm so mad.  I ask for a manager, and they say I don't have time to talk to one because I might not make my plane.  He tells me to write to the company.  So, here I am writing a review on Trip Advisor and I'm going to be writing the company.  I should also say that I am physical disable and it says so in my record yet I was never offered any services.  Am I a little upset? ABSOLUTELY..........."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Excellent service, on time.","Excellent service on Southwest, as usual. Everything on time, pleasant staff, smooth connections. It was nice that the plane was not packed so we could all spread out a bit."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Easy flight and usually extra seats with room to spread out,"I like this later flight out of BWI.  I only go through BWI 1-2 times per year, so take my notes with that in mind.  This is my preferred time of day to depart BWI.  Not too much airport traffic, rental car shuttles are running pretty quickly this time of day, and this is the 3rd  time I've had an entire row to myself on this last flight of the night to STL.  Don't bother paying the upcharge for Business Select or early bird for this flight time."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,My favorite airline,I always fly southwest because they are fun and not snobby like some of the others.  Free baggage is huge and if you plan ahead you can get great fares.   Plus free movies and tv on the longer flights.  They are the only airline I fly!
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Economical Airline,"Staff is nice, price is right, drinks are good, and 2 bags are free. Wish they would fly to more destinations and not have the fights so full. Overall Southwest is just fine."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Pleasant flight and great customer service,"The flight was everything you could ask for. Uneventful, on time, efficient check in through the kiosk, free baggage check and great customer service!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,2019 Mainland trip,Southwest just began service between Maui and San Diego and it's great! Didn't have a lot of amenities (I traveled economy) but price was right and no charge for checked baggage. $70 savings right off the bat! Highly recommend Southwest.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,"Efficient, friendly","Friendly, efficient staff.  The flight going to Reno had stewards with great senses of humor which always makes a flight more pleasurable .The flight home encountered bad weather, but the pilot did an excellent  job flying around it."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Aloha Hawaii,"My husband and I traveled from Hartford, CT to Honolulu, HI, and then from Maui, HI back to Hartford, CT via Southwest Airlines exclusively.  Southwest is a budget airlines, so of course there are no frills.  Snacks across mainland US consisted of pretzels, soft drinks, juices, coffee, and tea.  However, we had enough stops to have time to grab meals in various airports across the country .  On the 4 and a half hour flight across the Pacific, in addition to the above we were given a small container of cheddar cheese dip and a larger bag of crackers.  The service throughout was good and the flights arrived on time in every leg of the journey.  One word of advice however is toTAKD ADVANTAGE OF THE FREE SHUTTLE TO BAGGAGE CLAIM at the airport in Honolulu.  Southwest lands at a terminal that is the furtherest away from the baggage claim area.  Most of the walk to the baggage claim area is sheltered, but not air-conditioned and it is a very long walk.  Likewise, on the return flight, after checking in and clearing security take the shuttle to the Southwest departure gates.  There are some shops and places to eat there.  For the service that you receive and the two free checked bags you cannot beat the price offered by Southwest when traveling to Hawaii.  Aloha!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Good flight, friendly crew, on time","I feel the way they board the flight was easy and organized.  I do not really care about an assigned seat, if I check in the same time as my friend, we typically sit together.   It is nice you do not have to pay to check bags.  My bags came off right away when we landed - both ways - which was nice!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Easy flight,First time flying Southwest. Was an enjoyable expierence. Flight crew was very friendly pilots very informative on flight details
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Flight to Spokane W,"Plane was on time coming in, clean, had friendly personnel. and left on time.  We try to fly Southwest when we can."

Date of travel: July 2019,40,Family Fun in Austin,"Great flight , departed early in the morning and arrived in Austin by mid-morning Basically had the whole day to enjoy with family ."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Always great,I love that you check in 24h ahead and no assigned seats. Pilot flew very well smooth landing.  The waiting in line to board plane is a bit crammed but attendants work fairly fast.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,I Love Southwest Airlines,"I wish other airlines would get the message.  I am personally disgusted by other airlines gouging travelers for every little thing...soon they're going to charge you excess if you wear shoes!  It's shameful and ridiculous and everyone should boycott flying until this practice STOPS!  Southwest - two bags: NO CHARGEChange your flight any time, small charge.Always good Customer Service.  Always willing to accommodate the traveler.  I am a business traveler and while I could afford to fly other airlines, I'm so disgusted by their practices that I fly Southwest whenever I am able."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Excellent as always,"This was first leg of two flights to get to Dallas from Denver. Southwest efficient, as always. This flight was remarkable due to the very entertaining and efficient flight attendants. Boarding on Labor Day weekend, the cabin was lit in red, white and blue - very festive and patriotic. When announcements made the attendant had us laughing with very tasteful and appropriate lines, and when we were taking off, he played the song ""I believe I can Fly""! Fun flight!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great experience,Great service. Seats were more roomy than other airlines. Had to change itinerary due to hurricane and they did so twice without any problems or costs. Friendly service.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Golden Wings,"Sourhwest Arlins is an excellent airline to fly. First off, if you use the app, the process is very simple to navigate. Boarding passes are issued when you respond to the app 24 hours before flight. When entering aircraft, seats are not assigned, it is first board first serve! Staff is friendly and very helpful!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,How can you go wrong with free bags!,"Whoever gets upset with free bag check, free in-flight movies? No complaints at all, from the moment of departure to arrival."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Weather caused delays but Airline was truthful and upfront,"Our initial flight out of Fort Lauderdale was delayed, but the captain came out and talked with us and explained why the delay was happening and what they were doing to fix it.  My connecting flight was held for a few minutes to allow me to make my connection. It was very hectic as I only had about 20 minutes to get from one gate to the other, but the second flight was also SW so they were happy to allow the five of us from the late flight to board and help us find seats.  Southwest has always been upfront and truthful about what causes delays, no matter if it's their fault or something else. Unlike other airlines I've been on when they blame the weather and then later you find out there was no weather."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Southwest rocks,"Service is easy, great rewards, excellent attention to allergies. Friendly flight attendants, on time or early."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Customer Service,I make the trip weekly and Southwest has been the best if you don't want delays.  I have tried them all and Southwest has been spot on for being on time and taking care of the customer.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great flight home on SW!,"Had to switch flights at the last minute and fly home to HOU from ATL on 8/29, instead of 8/30. Was able to get a window seat, even though I was boarding position C19. Southwest always makes it easy to check your bags, board the plane, deplane and pick up your checked bags. I rate them ahead of the other big airlines in this regard, and will continue to fly with them as much as I can."
Date of travel: April 2019,40,5 hour delay,"I had never been delayed on an inter island flight for 5 hours before, so first response was total disappointment, first was told 3 hours maybe a free dinner, then was informed it would 5 hours. I then realized I’m waiting for a flight from the west coast to get me to Kona.....WHAT! Then trying to think things through and weigh in my options, we were offered $100 voucher for a $38 flight. Then the ground crew did their best to entertain about 50 passengers with games and SW swagg, bag tags, sun shades, lots cool stuff. There was some confusion at Kona gates but with only a week in town, any speed bumps were smoothed over by our return home."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Smooth flyong,Flew out at 6AM central time. Arrived in Phoenix 7:30AM mountain time. Perfect straight flight. The flight times gave us all day for touring the area instead of losing a day. Southwest knows how to do it!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Heading back to the US,SWA was as good as ever. This is my favorite airline to fly. It’s definitely the most bang for your dollar.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,vacation experience,"pleasant flight, polite, efficient crew beverage service was okay but didn't care for the pretzels they provided - don't go well with tea or coffee!check-in was fast, accommodating personnelbaggage claim easy"
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Southwest Fan,I love having two bags fly free. I also have a Chase Southwest credit card which I use for everything! If I use points to fly it only costs me $12 to fly around trip. The planes are compact and usually pretty full but I love getting where I'm going economically. If you want luxury go elsewhere and pay a lot more.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Comfort in the friendly skies,The staff was very welcoming and professional .  Check in was quick and easy.  We paid a little extra to board in the A boarding  group line.  It paid off for us we sat in a roomy exit isle .  What we liked the best was the service from the flight attendants.  Upon exiting the plane the pilot's were there to greet us with an inviting and genuine smile .  Love paying NO extra fees for luggage!!
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Great economy flight.,"I was allowed to board early and that was helpful for me.  Departed the gate late, but landed in Atlanta and still made our connecting flight.  Cabin was clean and staff very courteous offering extra cup of coffee on the early morning flight."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great service as usual,"Slight delay, but staff were friendly and helpful, in-flight free movies were great. I have rarely been delayed on Southwest flights.  It appeared that the second leg of this flight number had a major delay two stops before us and based on that Google told it the flight was delayed. Not true.  Glad we checked with the airline. Southwest must have put another plane in the air to keep their subsequent flights on schedule.That's putting your customers first!"
Date of travel: October 2018,50,Ms Roseann,Great flight Great service no turbulence Pilots well skilled Very pleasant experience We had no issues Our seats were comfortable We had drinks and snacks as usual. The flight attendants were very accommodating. Could not have asked for anything better. We had clear skies landed on time. Our bags were very well handled
Date of travel: May 2019,50,No Frills but No Drama (Now That's a Good Deal),"Like the title implies, just because Southwest offers some of the best deals for flying around the U.S and beyond, they don't skimp on service and dependability. I have flown throughout the U.S. with Southwest for some time now, using them for business conferences and educational events, as well for my ""bucket list"" personal challenge of attending a MLB game in every stadium (28 down and 2 to go) and have never been disappointed. That is why they are my first choice of airlines whenever I find myself planning another trip.The reference to this particular trip is the last time I used Southwest and based on my previous experiences, they continue to live up to the high quality I have come to enjoy."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,A very reliable way to trravel,"I travel several times a year throughout the U.S. and have found  Southwest to be the most reliable.  In today's world of transportation choices, flying has become the most convenient and cost effective; based upon the idea of saving time; flying vs. driving.  thanks Southwest for continue to serve us and I hear you now go to my hometown, Honolulu;  will be taking my next trip there with you."
Date of travel: June 2019,40,"On time, as usual",We have flown Southwest for years and have never had a problem.  Flights leave on time and arrive on schedule.  Flight attendants are pleasant and professional.
Date of travel: June 2019,40,"My favorite US airline, until recent non-stop flight schedule changes","I have been very happy with Southwest over other economy airlines.  However, they have elected to discontinue non-stop service to Phoenix which is my most frequent destination and I am very disappointed.  Also, I could not find reasonable non-stop departure flights to Las Vegas and the return to PIT is a red-eye that I refuse to fly, one and done.    Also, several passengers are reserving seats for friends and family that didn't pay the extra pre-boarding fees and this is totally unfair to those that paid these fees!   That's the whole purpose of early boarding!   Come on Southwest, stick up for your paying passengers!   Formerly my favorite US airline and sadly declining quickly."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Flying for a cruise,We flew to Seattle the plane was small took two planes to get there on time but felt like cattle being forced in small seats flight attendants nice accommodating On the way from Seattle plane 737 much nicer and more room and on time flight attendants nice
Date of travel: August 2019,50,I love Southwest,This flight went off like clockwork.  Love that Southwest is always on time and usually arrives early at destination.  Love their bags fly free policy.  Only thing I wish is that they could start using the Max? airplanes again because they were more comfortable.  I will always try to fly Southwest if they are available.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Flight to Aruba,"i always fly Southwest unless it is some place they don't do too. They are almost always on time, the service on board is great, baggage is free up to 2 pieces and you can book direct on their website."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Southwest=great service,"I love to fly with Southwest! Friendly crew even with a 6 am flight! We were running late due to a car accident that shut down the highway so we were rushing to get to the plane but we made it. Later found out, they would have held the plane for us. Another great reason to fly Southwest!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great prices and free bags,Love Southwest for their affordability and free bags. They are great to redeem rewards on. Lots of flight time choices.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Fly southwest.,Highly recommend Southwest Airlines. Seats are roomy and comfortable. Attendants always friendly and helpful.Love their boarding procedure. I would prefer not to fly with other airline se my experience with other have not been good.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,"Reliable, Low Cost, and direct flights  What's not to like?",Flew to STL for a business trip.  Flights were convenient and on time.  I believe it was direct each way which is a plus.  I like the free messaging on the flight as well as the use of the live TV service.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Always a pleasure flying Southwest,Enjoy flying Southwest whenever possible.   Very reliable airlines.  Expensive to request early check in on Tampa/Providence roundtrip - cost was $25 per person per flight or $100 (too steep).
Date of travel: June 2019,40,Great Price,"convenient flight to hobby airport, value for money, overall experience was awesome. will be flying with them to Houston henceforth."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Love the customer service,I love flying with Southwest. I’m a frequent flyer with them. Their customer service is wonderful. I missed check in for my original flight and the representative placed me on the next available flight with seats.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Southhas been my favorite airline for decadeswest Airlines,"I mostly have flown Southwest between the Boston area and Houston Texas in recent years. Can't beat the free baggage check and return of points or dollars if you change your plans. As with other airlines, the seats are smaller and the food is largely gone. But it shows that Southwest treats their employees well and the employees treat the passengers well."
Date of travel: July 2019,10,Scary with young children,"Our family was in boarding group C, the last group to board.  My grandchildren, ages 13, 11, and 8, were part of our group.  My son, being extremely honest, would not board because his children did not meet the ages announced for family boarding.  Therefore upon boarding, we were faced with single-seat availability.  My daughter-in-law stood her ground and would not sit until she could be seated with her 8-year-old son. Thank goodness! It did take several minutes for a person to volunteer to move seats.  Our 11-year-old granddaughter, with tears in her eyes, had to sit in a single seat by a window - the other 2 seats in her row were occupied by 2 young adults that ""were madly in love.""  I asked a person in my row to switch with her - window seat for window seat- but the answer was ""No, I'm comfortable here!""  After we were in the air and personal devices could be used, the young adult couple opened their laptop and proceeded to watch a movie that was not appropriate for young children.  I motioned to my granddaughter to try and go to sleep.  I had chosen a seat next to a young mother with an infant.  She struggled through the entire flight and I was happy to assist and reassure her that her daughter's fussiness did not bother me.  Our flight had been delayed - weather issue. Our flight was safe and comfortable. But, families should not be separated no matter the age!   Our grandchildren fly once or twice a year at most.  They were very rattled at being separated from their parents.  The 13-year-old was comfortable so maybe that is the age to use when boarding families."
Date of travel: February 2019,50,Very reliable airline!,"Whenever my husband and family travel to Orlando, we always use Southwest Airlines.  They are always on time, 2 pieces of luggage are free, they serve snacks and offer comparable prices for rental cars.  As well, they have a loyalty program and we have collected enough points for a free flight!  What’s not to like!"
Date of travel: July 2019,40,"Raleigh,NC to Ft Lauderdale,FL Round trip","Almost 10 flights per day to FLL from RDU. There are usually 2 options for non-stop. Flights are cheap if purchased more than 2 weeks in advance($80-$90 each way). Typical southwest, no frills, open seating. They have reverted to using older jets since the grounding of 737s. The older planes are, well-old....They smell old, the seats are old, the lavatories are worn out, and mostly no wifi options. Waiting for the newer planes to return"
Date of travel: February 2019,40,Freebies are good but paying for extras not so much.,"I love the idea of two free checked bags and one carry on but when I purchase the early bird boarding perk for $25 one way for my wife and I and then see people paying for one early bird and the “hold” a seat for another person who has a C group boarding pass and there’s no challenge from the flight attendants, that’s a problem with me. Or someone claiming they need special assistance and board first along with other family members, you know they scam the system. So no more early bird for us."
Date of travel: April 2019,40,Cheap flight,"Found a cheaper flight for my vacation on Southwest.  Some of the other airlines were charging up to twice as much, so it was a great bargain."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,The flight was great I'm just not a fan of the seat assignment based on check in time,"The flight was great I'm just not a fan of the seat assignment based on check in time. I was traveling with my family and they do let families board between A and B but there were 14 of us.  Other than that I would certainly fly with them again. I love the fact they allow 2 free checked bags. The pilot was amazing with my 3 children after we landed, even let them sit in the cock pit."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"An easy trip, even with changing planes. Clean, courteous, and on time!!!","Planes were on time, was able to get good aisle seat, luggage wait wasn't long, Return flight came in 10 minutes early. I had early boarding (medical) really made both flights easy."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flights,Had a great flights specially the second flight from Atlanta to Las Vegas so smooth and the landing by far the best landing that I experience in my whole life.The best kudos to the pilots and entire staff.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Spring break,Easy non stop flight. Lots of choices as to departures and returns. Easy airport to go through in Fort Meyers. Plenty of room in seats.

Date of travel: July 2019,50,SOUTHWEST IS THE BEST!!!,"Plane left on time, smooth take off and landing. Flight attendants were great. HAd my free drink coupons got two free drinks. Also don't forget the free luggage. Got there a few minutes early."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,You gotta love this airline,"It's become a difficult thing, flying to another part of the country, but if I have to do it, I will be using SW for the foreseeable future. The experience of the employees, plus the courtesy I experienced, made for a very satisfactory experience. Highly recommend this airline."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Southwest is the best!,I love Southwest!  They have the best prices and travel times.  They beat all of the other airlines with reasonable prices.  Southwest is my first option for flights!
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Download the APP!,"Crew was friendly and one of the team members could have been a comedian!I wasnt aware you could get free WIFI, Imessage and inflight entertainment if you download the app.Well worth it since Im worse than a 12 year old on trips!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great flight to catch a cruise,"Great flight! Airport is easy to access, easy to find the Airlines section. Non-stop flight to Fort Lauderdale! Upon arriving, the cruise line has a check in line near the baggage pick up. Very convenient. Catch a bus(shuttle) to port then you only need to leaver your bags with the porter and head to security line, no waiting cause you checked in at the airport. Now you are on the ship and ready to sail"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Incredible Service,"If you are expecting to be pampered, I would consider taking another carrier, BUT for the price, these people do an excellent job. Flight crews are always efficient and leave on time. They warn of any impending ""bumps"" but usually do their best to avoid the worst. Catering crew is fun and always ready to give you the best service. I even tried to tip them and it was flatly refused. Hope they keep up the nice work and it is appreciated!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Family member in accident.,Everyone ar Southwest was really kind to us. People do need to know that flying business class is best due to open seating. It's worth the extra few dollars to get on the plane in the earky grouping as I want to sit next to my loved one.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flawless,Like clockwork from checkin to landing and beyond. Not even one bump of turbulence and a smooth landing. Bags came off quickly and in great shape.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Flight with family,It was a very nice flight from beginning to end. Went  on early morning flight. seating was good traveled with two elderly people. Had great assistance getting them on and off the plane. All of the staff were very friendly and accommodating.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Excellent.,I travelled for business and my flight was on time .I always fly southwest when possible as I think they are the best.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,I Don’t Mind Southwest,"Southwest airliners is a no frills airline. They don’t charge you extra for bags and I really like that.  They give you enough of water and or drinks to get you from point A to B.  If you need to get on early, they charge you extra👎We had a flight from Phoenix to Hartford with an exceptionally long 3 hr. lay over in Midway, Chicago, Illinois. Weather or mechanical issues was not an issue. It’s their booking schedule.  That lay over was definitely 1-1.5 hrs. too long and it basically consumed our whole day with travel.  Do I think the other airlines would have done a better job?  No, not really. They would have just charged us extra for our bags and possibly a seat.  This is the way it is and it’s not going to get better. Airline travel isn’t fun."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Colorado Trip,This was the first flight my husband and I have flown on with Southwest. We had gotten the companion pass for this year making the flights really affordable since you are only paying for one person. Overall great experience and we love that they have free checked bags. We also love that they leave out of Hobby in Houston which is significantly less crowded than Bush. The only downfall I feel like is you have to check in right when check in opens up or pay a fee to preboard but overall that's very minimal. We booked two more flights this year with southwest and we are looking forward to it!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Southwest Airlines,"I just fly from Midway Chicago Airport (MDW) to Fort Lauderdale International Airport (FLL) direct with Southwest Airlines, everything get right from check in to baggage claim."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Favorite Airline,Once again - Southwest doesn't disappoint.  They are our favorite airline and will always look for a flight on this airline first.  Typically if they don't fly there - we don't go.  They have the best flight attendants and employees.  Everyone is always so friendly and willing to do anything.  Thank you for the great service.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Southwest never disappoints me,"I am never disappointed flying Southwest.  They have great attendants, very clean, on time and reasonable in price.  I just wish they flew into Syracuse.  Hint, hint."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Sanibel Island Fort Myers Florida,"Great!! On time, clean and comfortable. Great pricing!! Attendants were pleasant and informative. Definitely would use again."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Friendly crew, outstanding customer serivce","Southwest never fails to meet my expectations. Their customer service is second to none, with friendly staff, on time service, and outstanding communication"
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Best Flights Ever,"Was the Best Flights I have ever had. Always have flown with Southwest Always will nomatter what. Staff amazing, Pilots OUTSTANDING. Plane extremely clean. Service amazing even when we had some bumpy patches. Pilots and crew always kept us informed."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Quick and uneventful - the best kid of flight,"Flight to Jacksonville took off early, landed early and had no issues.  Always great service from Southwest."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best Service,"Always great service!  I love free bags!  Michael, our stewardperson, was quite funny on our return leg.  Southwest is our first choice in airline service."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight,Simple and easy flight. Service was good. Everything on time. No problem whatsoever.  It seems to be a good airline. Bags are included in ticket
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Poor Communication about unavoidable delay or cancellation,"Upon our fliglht's arrival at Love Field from SJC, we could not find the next leg of our flight on any Departure board, nor was there any mention of it on the website, although we had our boarding passes.  It was as if it were in the twilight zone. Our luggage did not arrive, and we were told it would be waiting for us in Austin later. We had to rent a car (at our expense) and drive to Austin at night, on the Friday of a holiday weekend, and only then learned that our flight, like many others, had been cancelled due to a weather event earlier in the day. But why was there no info?  The departure boards showed early afternoon flights that had been delayed or cancelled, but even at 5:20 pm there was no reference to our flight, which was scheduled for 6:20 pm. We had to drive to the airport the next day to return the rent car and pick up our luggage.  No apology, no explanation, nothing from Southwest  Not up to their reputation for excellent customer service."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"On time, ahead of schedule arrival, and pleasant flight attendants",Always packed flight and sometimes bumpy but this flight was smooth and time went fast with WiFi.  Special note about the flight attendants.  They were both quite efficient and very personable.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Flight to the coast,"Have flown with Southwest many times, the staff are great. Have never had a bad experience traveling with them."
Date of travel: April 2019,40,What's happening Southwest?,"I used to enjoy flying Southwest but the last few flights on my return trip home (Las Vegas is my home airport) my flights have been cancelled. Gate crew especially in Georgia were very rude - I was concerned on how they were going to get me to Vegas without long delays. Two planes later I landed in Phoenix only to find out another 5 hour layover meaning I had to rearrange my rental car in Vegas (I live 2 hours from Vegas) and now I had to get a room in Vegas since I would not arrive until 11pm - the crew member helping me said :well then you have to get a room there is nothing we can do""  - I got stuck paying $159.00 for a room. I understand these things happen but Southwest should pay for my room. Fortunately, my mom was watching my son so I didn't have to make arrangements for him or pay for a sitter."
n/a,50,Southwest Does it Again,"Took a flight to go on a cruise and needed to get a plus 1 as I'm a large man and need the room.The service people from the counter were helpful, the flight attendants were pleasant and nice. The flight was smooth from start to finish.I personally like Southwest because of the plus1 and you get 2 bags free."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Always a great experience when I fly Southwest Airlines,"I can truly say that I've never had an unpleasant experience flying on Southwest. It starts with purchasing tickets. There's none of this BS Extra Super Duper Economy seating, or whatever the other airlines are calling it, where you have to pay extra for EVERYTHING. You get to check 2 bags at no additional charge, which is really handy when we're traveling to one of my daughter's softball tournaments and can't carry on her softball equipment. Leg room is pretty much the same as the other airlines (unless you get the exit row). The planes are always as clean or cleaner than those of other airlines. And as an extra added bonus on this trip, we were able to avoid Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, which is a nightmare.  Additionally all of the Southwest staff and crew are friendly, patient and helpful. The culture of this company is amazing. I don't know why more airlines don't try to emulate them."
Date of travel: December 2018,40,Good price! Reliable! Nice staff! Free Checked Luggage!,"Southwest airlines is almost always the best deal out there! We have flown them for years and find the service to be reliable and the staff helpful! It is great that they let you check 2 bags for free! They fly direct into more destinations than they used to. We have enjoyed flying Southwest. It is also nice that they let those of us with disabilities, and those with young kids board first. The only issue I have had that with increased numbers of people flying who have disabilities or young kids, the ability to get a front seat if you need one to stretch out your legs, it is almost impossible."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Summer trip to CA mountain Lake,"Flight was comfortable, on time with one layover each direction, very nice and arrived on time both ways all bags accounted for and the mobile app is great to watch a movie or live TV as it was long flight."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Airline,The airline continues to deliver excellent customer service. Flight attendants were great and the landing was smooth as it could be. Thanks to the pilot and co-pilot for getting us there safely!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Professional,"No nonsense! No hidden fees! Everything  up front.Totally professional and friendly. Flying for a vacation, and this was a good way to start it."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Southwest is the only way to fly,"Honestly, I haven’t been on a trip since May 2018 flying on Southwest Airlines from Chicago to Nola but it’s always a pleasure and the only way to fly when you like to bring multiple items. I love the fact that with SW you can have luggage without paying a ridiculous fee. I always weigh my luggage on a regular digital scale before going to the airport for check-in. I try to approximate the weight around 47-48lbs just in case my scale is off and fortunately its been correct. When I travel you would think I’m going to be out of town for a month. I bring one carry-on & two check- in bags both weighing from 35 to 48 lbs a piece and there’s no worries about paying an extra fee. I always add the early bird option which is an extra fee; I guess it evens out instead of paying for heavier luggage. I can get on the plane faster to choose my seat since there isn’t assigned seating. I always make sure my destinations are coordinated with Southwest so I can always have my luggage and not have worry about fees. The SW team are always friendly I usually luck up on a pilot that have a beautiful sense of humor with kind flight attendants. If there are any plus size passengers and you need just a little more belt to latch in place they have belt extenders....you can ask your flight attendant. They offer water & soda with a snack with each flight. If you want something stronger you’ll have to pay an additional fee. All my friends fly Southwest. One of my friends took a vacation for 7 day cruise July 2019 leaving from Chicago to Miami. She only uses SW for the reasonable airfare as well as myself.... It’s the only way to fly!!!"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Visiting friends & Family,"I always fly Southwest.Don't usually have a problem. If there are changes they send you a text & let you know if your plane is going to be late, changed or whatever. This last flight was great, My husband can't walk far, So we had a wheelchair from check in at curb, to baggage claim, out to curb to be picked  up. It was great."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Fast, easy, reasonably priced","Southwest Airlines is my ""go to"" airlines.  So many numerous flights to choose from, reasonably priced fares, simple check - in and boarding. Crew is pleasant and efficient."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Once again SW has made me happy,Great short flight - even had time for a cup of cranberry juice.  I love flying with SW and have never had any issues with this airlines.
