Date of travel: March 2022,30,Not the Stanadr they once were,My flight was a 2 hour delay . as the flight coming from MIA to BAQ was delayed for some unknown reason. I had planned a 3 hour lay over in Miami to give me time to get a bite to eat as Breakfast was at 7am and BAQ airport offers nothing to really eat . My second leg home was MIA to Boston I made it to the gate with 10 minutes before they started boarding so no time to grab even some water to drink. Today flying America is a roll of the dice as to what you get... either a great travel or a issues more so if MIA airport is part of the equation. This by far  the worst trip with them ...
Date of travel: January 2022,10,AA seems to enjoy trying to ruin your life,"I HATE flying on AA with a passion unknown to mankind. The ONLY reason I chose to fly from to MIA on AA recently is that it was non-stop-if either the really, really nice folks at SWA or even the marginally nice folks at Delta or UA had a non-stop on this route, I would have flown with them at up to double the fare-seriously-that is now much I hate flying on AA. I have NEVER had even an above average flight with AA & have been flying domestically & internationally since I was 20 & have no idea how many times I have flown with AA during that time but it has been at least a dozen or two times or more. That may seem hard to believe but it is 100% true. In fact, I have never met anyone who has ever in polite conversation who have said they have had an enjoyable flight with AA-it is simply an ordeal to be endured as, on average, the staff from check in counter to on board (including the pilots!) are AT BEST indifferent & IN GENERAL rude, surly, downright angry & hostile. What an impressive business model they have. Is the first question on your interview form for new employees ""Do you prefer to treat customers as ""human scum""? Seriously, I wonder.Mostly recently, an AA counter agent at MIA misinterpreted what I said to another passenger in line. This happened a day after I missed my international flight due to their errors and they would not let me on the flight even though the flight had been delayed but they wouldn't reopen the door. They treated me like a child and made me wait until the end of boarding after another alleged agent manager admonished me for something I didn't have clarity on what I did. Then, after I arrived at my destination, I learned that their staff, based on hearsay, said I made some sort of vague ""threat"" I did not make to anyone (I was talking to someone on my phone so naturally they could not hear the other side of the conversation) and I was detained at immigration at my international arrival location and illegally held beyond 48 hours in a jail cell with no ability to contact the US consulate or attorney before I learned that AA had lied-they stated it was not their decision to then have me deported-but they started the process based on false info. I mean if there was really an issue, why did they allow me to get on the flight to begin with? Naturally, AA tells you nothing-it is like out The Trial by Kafka-a complete kangaroo court.It then took me over a week, a lot of stress, and a lot of money to the right connections to get back into the country of my final destination. I have suffered both mental and physical fallout from this situation-a complete overreaction by the terrible AA staff that had no basis in any reality or danger whatsoever. Of course when one reaches out to ""contact us"" at AA for weeks you get auto-generated e-mails then naturally, nothing-no response at all. This is after AA tried to ruin my life after I had just retired."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Massive decline in all areas of service,"In short…this was originally a non-stop round trip flight from Dallas to Kona. They changed it on us, no options given. New Airbus A321 was VERY cramped, very little service and the temperature on the plane had us roasting and dripping in sweat. All the members of our party were miserable. Icing on the cake, they lost our luggage and can’t seem to find it. Initial claim was made with a clerk at a desk at baggage claim and she obviously couldn’t have cared less. We’ve spent two hours on the phone with customer service and they can’t even get DFW baggage to answer the phone. Pathetic.In Dallas we are out of luck, DFW is a massive hub and we are beholden to AA. Looking to see if we can wriggle out and switch our reward cards to Southwest and try to use them. If you have a choice, fly with someone else and save yourself the aggravation. They treat you like you’re cargo."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,The absolute worst airline,"I will never travel with this airline, even though they offered me an incentive to do so…we’re not interested!  The captain was over an hour late, we ended up loosing a good few hours from our final arrival Airport & vacation in Peurta Plata, DR. When my husband asked for aster the flight attendant gave him  a 1/4 filled cup. Because he advised of his dissatisfaction with this service he was threatened to be de boarded. The attendants were their mask under their nose but somehow still managed to demand customers to wear their masks even as we are!  On our way back from our vacation that was another drama…ended up paying over $1000 for being refused our flight to Miami because we didn’t have the negative Covid test for Canada. Even though we advised them e were staying in Miami for a couple days & would do our test there. This was a definite airline sent from Hell!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Customer service doesn't exist,The flight got changed twice and i was no longer able to do the connexion with my previous leg.I called (from France) to be reimbursed.I faced:Unacceptable delay for answering my email (6 weeks).Unacceptable resolution (i had to call several times multiple numbers to get an answer from somebody else)Unacceptable rejection to be reimbursed for the 1 hour i spend on a toll/premium number with nobody to answer my call ($20 cost)I'll do my best to never fly American again.They deserve to get bankrupted again.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Terrible customer service after canceled flights and delays,"Canceled flights, rebooked 2 days later because that was the next available time. Missed our rental car. Missed meeting family we flew across the country to see. Nobody’s cares. No recourse."
n/a,10,American Air lines,"This review has nothing to do with this beach don't use American air lines my wife always uses jet blue and has no issues , we bought tickets to go see her farther who is very sick with cancer , they said we had to be there 2 hours early I only have so many days I can be out of work these tickets cost almost 900 bucks total we showed up early liked asked and then our flight was delayed then not available  till tommorrow ...maybe ... so we  had to drive from basicly the nh border merrimac mass  to take the train into Boston bases subway ect all day wasted  our whole day  plus travel expenses we called for a refund and they said there to busy to refund us at the moment due to the high rate of refunds they are currently processing.. they don't hav time for us but they can charge us almost 900 bucks and waste our whole day we should of just rented a car and drove down warning don't fly American air lines ... they said it was maintaince issues I'm so mad planes prob arnt safe to fly or something ... idono I'm just mad  / venting ,how can u ask people to show up 2 hours early then delay them to the next day  (maybe ))"""" the staff at the air port were very nice and helpfull and it was out of there hands but the airline not so helpfull .. then they don't have time for us when it comes to processing our refund .. we could use that money for a car rental  to drive down to c my wifes sick dad but they don't hav time to proccess our refund .. wasted time and wasted money don't spent ur money with them .."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,American Airlines is absolutely horrible!!,"I was supposed to leave El Paso at 6:30 am today, 3/14. My flight was delayed at 12:00 am, 4 hours before my shuttle was supposed to pick me up for my flight. They delayed my flight to 11:55 am and I would have missed my connecting flight in Austin so I had to schedule a new flight for tomorrow 3/15. Well, that flight was just canceled so I just had to schedule a new flight for the THIRD time. My boarding passes are also showing up for my original flight and not my new flight.  My mother also had a horrible experience with AA last Wednesday, 3/9 as well. They canceled her flight at the last minute. She was supposed to land in the afternoon but since she had to get a new ticket, she didn’t arrive until very late at night. Never book with American Airlines. This has been the most infuriating experience ever and now I have to wait 2-3 hours to receive a call back from customer service. I wouldn’t be surprised if my flight gets ruined again. This trip was my first time flying with AA and I will never be flying with them again. I rate them 0/10 they are absolutely horrible!!!! I recommend flying with delta or jet blue if you don’t want to run into any issues."
Date of travel: March 2022,40,True to their word!,"Went from DCA to MCO and flight experience went very well. What was even cooler was one of the pilots took a few moments to say hi to my child who really wanted to say hi and ask a simple question. Pilot did not mind this at all. While getting to our seat was a bit slow, this is to be expected. Attendants were very friendly, restrooms very clean, and seats for us were comfortable. It was my kid's first time being on an airplane and they really enjoyed it.The only unfortunate event was our return flight. It got cancelled. The airline representative tried their best to work with us, but the options available for return flights were not doable for our family. They promised a refund since we got the travel insurance and we are being given one. Great experience overall. It went from ""Excellent"" to ""Very good"" because of the cancellation."
Date of travel: March 2022,50,Your Phoenix team was GREAT!,"I don’t know if we came in a good day or if it’s always like this, but WOW!  The American Airlines team in the Phoenix airport doesn’t play around.  Courteous, helpful, and efficient.  Great job."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,dont buy the economy ticket.,"Short term booking so had to take what was available for a 1 day business trip. Requested to cancel 7 days in advance for a voucher, partial, or donation to a charity with this ticket. Also pointed out that they can't charge taxes when I am cancelling. They keep the prepaid tax also. Bet that is illegal. I usually only fly Delta and didn't want to go to Dulles...Gonna let that seat fly empty and NEVER book American Airlines again."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Terrible experience when pregnant,"This past weekend I took a trip from Rochester New York to Connecticut and in my 28 years of flying it was the worst experience I've ever had on American Airlines. In no way do I blame the pilots- the weather was out of their control but the way everything was handled was just unbelievable.We were set to land in Charlotte NC for a layover around 8:15 AM on Friday. At around 8:10 AM we were told that we were not allowed to land in Charlotte due to extreme fog and we were diverted to Greenville SC. I completely understand that it was not safe to land in Charlotte and we were low on fuel so we could not continue to circle.But the way things were handled after was appalling to me. We ended up sitting on the tarmac in Greenville for 3 hours and 50 minutes (after an already 2 hour flight that was diverted). During this time- only one of the three bathrooms on the plane were working. We were directly discouraged from using that one working bathroom. Since we were low on fuel and not able to get into a gate to refuel the plane was not air conditioned. We sat there for almost 4 hours in uncomfortable heat on the plane. We were given ONE CUP of water each and no snacks at all.Being 4 months pregnant I not only felt unwell, dehydrated and overheated but we were given no sympathy. When asking for more possible water we were given an attitude. We also tried to tell the flight attendant that the plugs to charge our phones (since we were all trying to use our phones while sitting there for so long and had already missed our next flights). She continued to give us more attitude telling us that the plugs only worked when we were in air, which we understood, but she refused to stop long enough to listen that we were saying that even during the original flight none of them we working. She then continued to go upfront and make a very passive aggressive announcement that they only work in the air- which we were telling her that they did not work at any point.While sitting there for almost 4 hours we also were told very little. It was completely unclear if we were ever going to be able to get back to Charlotte or if we were going to have to deplane at Greenville. After being told little to nothing we were finally told after 3 hours and 50 minutes that we were returning to Charlotte. Our treatment and the actions of the flight attendants on the flight was baffling to me and extremely upsetting.I felt physically unwell and mistreated, especially being pregnant. We were given no sympathy and were given rude remarks for being upset about what had happened to us even though we spent HUNDREDS of dollars on the plane tickets. We were given no refund or compensation for the seven hours we spent on that plane when it was only supposed to be a two hour flight total.The saga continues on my way home on Sunday. While going through security I received a notification that my flight that was supposed to leave at 5:30PM was delayed until 7:40PM. This would mean already that I would miss my second flight and be stuck in PA. When I went to talk to someone at the gate they told me that my only options were to fly standby on a very late flight, with slim chance of getting on the flight, wait UNTIL TUESDAY to fly home or take the first flight but then BE STUCK IN PENNSYLVANIA.I had specifically chosen that flight so I could be home Sunday evening since as a teacher I had to work Monday and could not miss school. I immediately told them I wanted a refund and ended up having to drive over 5 hours home by myself and pay for an expensive rental car to guarantee I would get home that night. Being exhausted, frustrated, and pregnant I am extremely disappointed in American Airlines. I have never had such a bad experience. I understand that weather happens, delays happen, but the way that I was treated after spending hundreds of dollars is still shocking to me. I do not plan on flying American in the future."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Unimaginably Bad,"I hate flying American, but unfortunately where I’m from they seem to have the most flight options.  Here are my experiences from the past month:Abruptly cancelled my flight 2 hours before takeoff. They automatically rebooked me for 2 days later (yes, days, not hours).  Spent endless time on hold, finally rebooked myself online for a flight later that day.  They cancelled that flight an hour before takeoff. I booked myself on Delta and had to spend 4 hours screwing around on hold and online to apply for a refund.  Another flight 2 weeks later a similar experience.  This morning, waited in the checkin line for an hour and a half because they didn’t have enough help until I missed my flight. Got rebooked standby.  I have learned my lesson and will never fly American again, no matter how far out of the way I have to go.  Do yourself a favor and don’t book on American."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Last AA flight,"Back in 2021 I was coming back from San Diego for Christmas. All normal, Got on the plane, no delay. So why exactly am I never flying with AA again? Well because I was sat in-front of the worst family ever! I’m talking 6-9 people! And I was in front of this devil of a child. Take off goes well, Then, AHEHAHWAHHHH!!!!!!! I look through gap in between the seat to see a large baby screaming, fussing and kicking my seat. I look over to the mother and give a dirty look of disappointment and anger. Still she does nothing, The flight attendants do nothing. Let’s get to why I'm not flying the airline. See, Delta has FC, Delta Comfort+ Then that Economy stuff. I would sit in Comfort plus and avoid those “Demons” Now look, I probably sound like some snobby, spoiled kid who thinks he is above other people. But I’m not. In fact I actually try to save money! Let’s get to some more issues. I was in front economy that I was told that I was extra? Anyways so rude for them to sit up here, they could just sit in the back! This experience makes me hate young children that are on any form of transportation or anywhere for that matter! Leg room sucks, My father was 5  feet 11 and was squished in the seats. I couldn’t stretch and I my legs ached the rest of the flight."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Stranded and Sleepless,"This is the third time American Airlines has cancelled my flight within 12 hours of takeoff for no reason. When I call to reschedule they tell me that the best they can do is the next day unless I drive several hours to another airport. Their lack of concern for customers has cost me time, money, and sleep. I will never fly this airline again."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Worst customer service,I was on hold for 5-6hours to add a baby to my flight ticket. This company needs to outsource people to answer calls or something because that wait time is completely unacceptable. Upon actually talking to a rep about adding a baby to my ticket they charged my card TWICE for two other tickets. I now have to wait 7-10 business days for a refund the f-ed up. Will likely never fly with this airline again
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Double booking and bad customer service,Travel from Costa Rica to Dallas via Austin.American Airlines flight got delayed from Costa Rica to Austin because the pilot arrived late. American Airlines agent lied to us saying we will be fine making our connecting flight in Austin to Dallas inspite of us asking for alternatives if we miss the flight in Austin. We arrived 15 minutes before departure time gate closed but they didn't allow us on the flight. In total there were 13 passengers on the same enroute but American Airlines did not accommodate.  American Airlines didn't accommodate as they were double booked. They accommodated passengers and waited for passengers on the next flight. We are stuck in Austin for 26hrs.  They did not give a voucher for taxi nor flight for the inconvenience caused with their fault. Agent at Austin gate initially gave excuses for not able to give even a hotel voucher because they don't know the reason of the delay from Costa Rica to Austin. Overall we are stuck in Austin for 26 hrs due with no fault of ours.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Useless,Useless bunch of idiots. Called 3 times. Was on hold for about 3 hours each time. Nobody ever answered. Never got my issue resolved
Date of travel: March 2022,10,3 Days to go from Florida to NY,"We’re told we’d be 30 minutes late for takeoff but was almost 3 hours. Crew said they had no ride to airport. Truth we’re woke up late, party. Than cancel flights for 2 days. Finally Board airplane and wait one hour for 19 late passengers making several people sitting on aircraft late for there connecting flights. Who ever is in charge should be fired. This airline is a joke.  FAA should ground American Airlines."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,American Airlines treats its stranded passengers abysmally,"I bought a one way ticket from Havana after JetBlue cancelled my flight to Austin. The flight from Havana to Miami was delayed over two hours. When we landed only then did they find out the gate assigned us was still occupied by another aircraft. We sat on the tarmac for nearly 45mins. I missed my onward flight to Austin from  Miami although it later transpired that that flight was cancelled. I was then asked to stand in queue for 3-4 hours to be re booked on another flight (after nearly 3 hours of delay). When I complained I was told every one had the same problem so they can’t help me. Eventually i got to the ticket counter and was offered a flight 24 hours later basically meaning losing an entire day in a city i did not know with no where to sleep. I asked where I was expected to sleep and was told there were no hotels available so I could sleep on the floor or on the chairs on concourse and wait for 24 hours. This, after spending over 500USD on a one way flight. I was offered a voucher for food but was told only Subway was open at that time of the night (this after midnight) but the queue was about a mile long and it took 4 hours to get served. So all in all, 12 hours of delays, and standing in queues all caused by American Airlines who had no care whatsoever about what happened to their stranded passengers. They had staff standing round doing nothing other say sorry or suck it when in this day and age they could have handed them iPads to process stranded passengers as Emirates of Qatar Airways might have done. They could have shown more compassion and been more help in finding a sleeping place for stranded passengers but none of the American Airways staff seemed to care ; and there was no one to complain. When I wrote a letter of complaint the reply i received said they’d respond in 7-10days. The wait on their helpline was over an hourThe incompetence is amazing and the lack of regard for passengers shocking. It surprises me that Americans choose to patronise an airline with such atrocious service  and utter disregard for its paying passengers. Really shocking that Americans put up with this abysmal treatment by airlines. Clearly an opportunity in the freemarket for an alternative to do much better"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Worst airline ever!!,"Do NOT use this airline, they delayed my fly  over and over, until they cancelled several hours later. I missed my connection fly. On top of that, I was traveling with my family with 2 kids. They split it up our family next fly without consent. Every agent I spoke with was misinformed or did not help, treating us with no sympathy. Then , they could not find one of my luggage for over 2 hrs. Very disappointed!!"
Date of travel: March 2022,20,Why is AA the last major airline to restore food service - isn’t it supposed to be the market leader?,"Having traveled both Delta and UA, as well as AA, over the last few weeks, it is clearly the case that the so-called #1 does not adopt a leading position when it comes to restoring normal food and beverage service in the post-Covid era. AA sadly, is far from being a leader in this respect. Not sure whether it’s a cost-saving measure, or simply not seeing that the competition is way ahead of them. Whatever the reason, travelers ought to be made aware that the best they can do, food-wise, on AA, is a biscotti, or a bag of mini pretzels!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Awful experience,"I have had the worst experience with American Airlines this weekend trying to get back home to DC from Nashville. My flight was set to leave Saturday evening and was canceled at last minute due to “bad weather” even though it was sunny and nice out. Not to mention, I could see online that TONS of other flights, including those that departed after mine was scheduled to take off, were landing at DCA just fine. The clerk herself admitted that it did not make sense. The experience, however, only got worse…Everyone on my flight waited for hours at customer service for a resolution only to be told that we couldn’t get on another flight until TUESDAY. The airline refused to offer a hotel discount, airline credit, or refund to anyone. Even though we were now stuck in Nashville for THREE days!!! When I found out I could be put on standby at 6 am the next morning, I asked and they wouldn’t even allow me to have a lounge pass so I could wait at the airport.  I was then told the flight the next morning was overbooked by 10 people and standby was essentially pointless for me. While waiting in line at customer service, there was a gentleman in front of me who was traveling with his wife and baby. Again, the airline refused to offer him a discount for a hotel, a refund or credit. The man  (who was a black man —coincidence?I’ll let you decide.) never once raised his voice or got aggressive. He simply pleaded for the airline to do something to help him and his family. Instead the attendant got angry at him and yelled at him that he had two options “book a different airline or take the Tuesday flight. Do you want us to risk your life flying in bad weather?!” Very unprofessional. The man in front of me then frustratingly walked away and the airline called the police on him to have him arrested. Unbelievable. The flight attendant said he had been working since 4 am and was too tired for this. Thankfully, my mother was able to speak to the police and calm down the situation so that they understood the customer did nothing wrong. When it was my turn to speak with an agent, I was met with inconsiderate agents who kept saying they just wanted to walk away or tell everyone to go away because this was frustrating for them too. I agree, it was a stressful situation for everyone involved. However, it is unprofessional and extremely inconsiderate to say that to passengers who are now having to book an extra 3 night stay over the weekend in Nashville where the minimum is a couple hundred a night for a room. American Airlines is a billion dollar corporation. They could have compensated for customer troubles at least a little bit. I am absolutely appalled by the experience and customer service."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,They cost me a ton of $$$$,"I was returning from vacation and they cancelled my flight. The people I spoke to on the phone and in person were rude and basically just took the attitude ""sucks to be you."" They booked me on another flight more than 2 DAYS later. I missed an incredibly important doctor appointment. I missed work. My car spent 2 extra days in long term parking.  I was compensated for nothing. No meals. No hotel stay. Just a big middle finger after hours of waiting in line. They said they don't compensate for flights cancelled for weather. It was sunny out. There is no way the flight was cancelled for weather conditions, they just said that so they did not have to compensate anyone. I attached a picture of the ""terrible weather.""Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,The worst service in America,"After being split up from my family on delays, and being lied to about being put on standby twice I have realized their is not a worse airline in the country. to make matters even better every employee I had the displeasure of speaking too was useless and more worried about getting to the next customer then making sure I could actually get home with my family (with 3 kids). Some advice to anyone going anywhere, if you want to actually get where u want to go when u want go without being lied to DO NOT FLY AMERICAN, if you want to fly on airline that won’t split up your family like Nazis DO NOT FLY AMERICAN, and if you want to be respected like the paying customer you are DO NOT FLY AMERICAN!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Not for families,"Don't fly American if you have a family. Family of 6, not a single seat together. Super pathetic. Only way to get 2 seats together, was if we paid a ton more PER SEAT."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,I do not recommend,I dread having to book with this airline. My flights are usually delayed. The planes are cramped and uncomfortable seats. Unfortunately it’s the only airline that flies into the airport by my parents .
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Botched delays,Quite a terrible experience American air sent us from El Paso to Dallas only to not have a flight 4 us
Date of travel: March 2022,50,Excellent service by Emily,"We enjoyed a wonderful flight due to the excellent service by our flight attendant, Emily.  She is truly the kindest, most genuine, compassionate flight attendant we have had the pleasure of knowing.  She made all the difference on our lengthy flight."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,College Tour to NC,"I booked a trip for a long weekend with my son. They screwed up my reservation, lost my son’s reservation, hours on hold with customer service, had to buy another ticket to get my son to NC. Not even sure he has a reservation for our flight home. On hold with customer service for 4 hours yesterday only to be told I can only take care of it at the airport. Horrible experience!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,American Airlines Strikes Again!,"This is the 2nd time it's happened within 6 months.  First time we misses our connecting flight in ORD because we had to get off of 1 plane & board another, then sat on the new plane for 1 hour burning fuel before we could take off.  Now, we say on the tarmac for 1 hour in MCO for who knows what reason,  so we ran to try to make our connecting flight, only to be told you missed it, even though it was still at the gate. They called us by name to re-book, wouldn't you think that they would've held the plane knowing our other flight was delayed? So, we sit at ORD for 4 hours. Avoid American Airlines!!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Worst Airline,"First vacation after pandemic and going to Florida for spring break.Noticed bad weather was forecasted on day of travel.  Called airline 5 days in advance asking to fly out one day before, she continued to say no. Went to airport day of flight due to 4 hour delay and then asked to fly on another route. Manager insisted they would not change flight. Ask I was talking to manager flight was cancelled. The best they said they could do was standby for day after, I refused. Flight was changed to three days after original departure with a layover, no longer direct travel.I asked to push to another airline and they refused. American also lied that the flight was cancelled due to weather which was also a lie based on conversation when calling customer service. AA was the only airline that day to cancel flights, no operational issues with other airlines.The lack of customer service is non-existent. They lied about flight availability as there were seats when we called customer service.If we all stop flying this horrible, low quality, airline we could make an impact by eliminating them from business.American does a great job at not even operating at the minimum bar- flying customers to their destination"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,American Airlines Sucks @ss,"So, after the American flight landed 1 hour late to New Orleans we finally boarded, only to sit for another 90 minutes while the baggage handlers fiddle F’d around loading 10X as much luggage as there were passengers, there is no way every passenger had 10 suitcases, then to top it all off, we landed in O’ Hare, my connecting flight was also delayed (another American flight, imagine that) I rushed to the gate to find they cancelled my boarding pass and gave my seat to someone else, now, it generally takes quite a bit to piss me off, but American Airlines managed it, after cussing out every American Airline employee I could find, I checked my blood pressure ands it was 183/110DO NOT FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINESTHEY SUCK"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,I hate this airline,Worst ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not fly them!!!!!! Can’t ever begin to explain how bad….I’ve been on a plane for 6+ hours now to go 40 minutes in the air….Then they messed up the baggage
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Saddened by service,"Never have I have I had such a terrible time with a airline. There was a line 20 deep of people with no assigned seating. They the  had to call out to switch seats to fulfill previous reserved seating made online. They then had the singles board very last as they did not assign these seats until the very end. Truly the worst service I have ever had with a airline American, Canadian, European or otherwise. I sadly won't be flying with American Arilines again."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Flight delayed due to maintenance then missed connecting flight.,"Initial departure was supposed to be at 10:20am, but flight was delayed due to maintenance. Departed at 12:30p and arrived at phoenix airport at 2:45for a connecting flight to San Francisco that departs 2:53p. Surely, we had missed our flight. We even asked another agent for confirmation and didn’t tell us what time it was boarding or departing. Couldn’t he have buzzed the agents to notify them we were coming so we didn’t miss our flight? We go to the customer service to report we had missed our flight due to our previous flight being delayed. We are then placed on the next flight scheduled for 9:50p. Our plans for our anniversary trip are cut short due to this. The agent offered a free hotel to stay for the night, but we declined the offer since our plan wasn’t to stay in Phoenix. It’s just frustrating that our initial flight was delayed for 3 hours causing us to miss our connecting flight. To make the situation even worse, we’ve heard several other customers upset. In particular, this woman next to us speaking with another agent was complaining about how no other AA agents were being helpful at all and were rude to her. The agent wasn’t apologetic at all and had the audacity to ask, “well what time did you arrive at the airport?” The customer was complaining and saying she’ll never fly AA again. And let me add that the customer wasn’t even being rude, just voicing her frustration. We overheard the agent say something with attitude when she walked away, “Look who’s talking,” which was completely unprofessional especially because other customers were around. My wife is a customer service manager for a retail company and even said how the way it was handled by the agent was all wrong. We also heard another customer on the other side of us saying something about “how unfortunate” and walked away frustrated."
Date of travel: March 2022,20,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"To start it off.. I have a AA credit card in which I purposely use ALOT, typically I never use any other airlines other than AA.. I'm so fed up with the 2 hour wait when calling in.. the site cannot service you for everything.. yesterday I called in to book international flight and I was using points and cash.. it was a nightmare and the person that answered the phone ""RON"" which was the 3rd person I was transferred too since the other 2 couldn't help me for some reason, this guy was the RUDEST person I have ever spoke too.. I requested to speak with supervisor 5 times and the said NO and then hung up on me.. I have never been treated this poorly. I wrote an email to Corporate but of course I never heard back.. I am really thinking about getting rid of my AA Credit card and switching to United.. I think at this point it can't get any worse. I am very DISAPPOINTED WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES !!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Delayed flight in Dallas/ weather not their fault but their workers are AWFUL at helping customers,"American airline workers must hate the company as bad as I do I saw several lose their cool with customers that were not doing anything wrong. one lady picked a fight with a man in Dallas airport when all he was doing was standing waiting with his ticket on his phone. She began to yell at him what can you do my job, and tried real hard to get him to react. All he stated is I just would appreciate the communication and I have my own job than you. Others in the Houston airport treated me as if I was a huge bother. 4 sitting doing nothing and ignoring me and my questions"
Date of travel: March 2022,40,Great flight,"Considering all the pre and post flight COVID restrictions this was a great flight. AA had a smooth check in and the seats were clean and comfortable. The food was the best we have had for many a long year and a special mention must be be made to the crew - Coreen was especially friendly and always smiling. We were both very impressed and will be flying to LAX with them in September. PS a glowing review but I am not staff, lol!!!"
Date of travel: March 2022,50,Best flight Attendant!,"I recently flew home to see my parents and wanted to say that Michel is the best flight attendant. He was the flight attendant going to Colorado Springs and my flight home. Lucky me!!  His communication skills are superb.  I had to ask if the messages over the speaker were recorded.  It was him speaking live!!  I always have trouble understanding every word because the volume is too low and they talk too fast. Michel obviously takes his job very seriously and loves it. He was attentive, friendly and funny.  During my flight home he wrote me the nicest thank you card.  Love him!!!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Never again flying American,"Flying for spring break from Jacksonville Florida to Colorado with our kids. We got to airport 1 1/2 hrs early, only one person checking people in and kiosk weren’t working. Curbside also not open as is was 4:30 am. Missed our flight because we couldn't get checked in. They could reschedule us in 4 days!!! But our trip would be over!! Never, Ever Flying American Again!!! $6,000 dollars down the drain!!!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Very bad service,"I had a terrible experience with AA. my tickets were booked March 2020 but were cancelled due to COVID, as everyone knows. I could not get refund online because it shows not eligible. I was informed by travel agency that I have credits with AA. However, when I was trying to use my credit to book my trip on April 4th, I was told by the agency that AA does not allow to use the credit because AA has a policy that the credit is valid only if I travel by the end of March 2022. I and my travel agency were trying to reach out to AA to extend the credit for four more days but failed. Called AA customer service many times, no one offers help. we were told to go online to complain, but no one cares, no response at all. what a terrible service! I am very disappointed. We all know we are still in pandemic, everyone is affected by this, and AA should be flexible on credit, but instead they are giving their customers hard time. Other airlines allow to use credit by the end of 2022, But AA does not. Don't book with AA."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Downgraded with no Refund,"I find it interesting that as a customer who purchased an economy ticket for an upcoming flight has suddenly been downgraded to basic economy. Yet no one in customer service will help me, despite the code on the credit card charge showing that it’s an economy ticket. This is a very dishonest practice and I can’t believe the money spent on this airline company. Scam artists. Never again."

Date of travel: February 2022,30,Average flight with little Food,"Traveling to the Dominican Republic in early February for a bird watching trip American Airlines offered the best timing for me.  Had a red-eye going over (no real food - just some chips), and an evening flight returning to Seattle (minimal food).  The return flight was 3 hours late (in Miami)  - no explanation was given.  So, this was an average American Airlines flight..."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,FLY AMERICAN IF YOU WANT CONSTANT DELAYS,"Terrible service, constant delays. We had to wait 4 hours just to figure out the plane couldn’t be used and then had to wait another 2 hours because catering didn’t bring snacks on the plane. Didn’t get to our destination anywhere close to the time we should have arrived. I will NEVER fly American again."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Horrible company,Avoid american airlines at all cost!!!!!! Worst company to fly with! Delta has way better customer service and is all about helping their customers. American airline agent refused communicate with me after telling her I'm deaf and requires lip reading for better communication she wouldn't remove her mask or write down anything I had pull a customer to help me communicate with a agent and it was super embarrassing and upsetting. 😡 screw american airline and their customer service!!!! This company does not deserve 1 star!!!!!
Date of travel: July 2021,50,The Best Experience!!,I felt happy to say their service is one of the best I have ever meet in my life. I really enjoyed their service after boarding. I wish their success in the long.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Worst flight experience of my life,"Today, my wife and I left Fort Lauderdale to head back home. Our first America  flight was 40 minutes late, making our connection tight. We sprinted through the airport barely making it to the gate… with 12 minutes to spare before takeoff. The gate agent closed the door a few minutes early. There were 12 of us standing at the gate, still before the plane had left the gate. The agent just ignored us, wouldn’t look at us and wouldn’t help us. He then called his manager, saying we were being unreasonable and chaotic - not the case at all. My wife was crying because she just wanted to get home… the manager told her and another woman to stop crying because it won’t help you get on the flight, in fact it’d guarantee that they don’t help you. They gave us a standby voucher for a 100% full flight, tomorrow at 9am. They didn’t offer us a hotel room. We took matter into our own hands and paid $620 to book another flight to KY, where we will drive home from (another 2 hours). I’m writing this while  sitting at the gate, for that Louisville flight. We’ve been waiting 25 minutes now because someone left their laptop on their last flight and the crew is fetching it. Very cool of them to do for that man… after waiting 25 minutes, the manager who looked my crying wife in the eyes and told her to stop crying or else we wouldn’t get a standby ticket, the same one who wouldn’t open to door 1 minute to let 12 passengers on their flight, the one that told us all that no matter what, they don’t have authority or authorization to reopen the door once it’s been closed…. That guy…  is who opened the door and carried the laptop onto our plane. I am a frequent flyer, typically flying once every 1-2 weeks, minimum. I will do my absolute best to never fly American again thanks to the crew working gate C16 March 7, 2022."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Do not do it!!!,American Airlines is a horrible airline! They have horrible customer service! I called to change my flight and I got yelled at and cursed at by a “manager”! Her name was Julie but she wouldn’t give me her last name. Probably because she knew she was wrong. I literally ended that phone call in tears. I have never been treated this bad by an airline in my life.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Abandon in OKC,"The flight hasn't happen yet, scheduled for 5/28/22.  The original flight was booked in January 2022: Wichita Falls to DFW to Myrtle Beach 5/23/22.  The return was Myrtle Beach to DFW to Wichita Falls 5/28/22.  AA cancelled the 5/28/22 flight to Wichita Falls and changed the flight from DFW to Oklahoma City.  Basically leaving me stranded in Oklahoma City.  I called AA customer service, they do have an earlier flight they could have put me on but didn't.  I was successful having this changed but I have to wonder, why would AA just abandon me in OKC.  Don't tell me its a computer error, AA hires people to develop and write the programs that do this stuff.  This is the 3rd time in 2 years that AA has screwed me around.  Unfortunately they are the only ones that fly out of Wichita Falls, TX"
Date of travel: February 2022,20,"American saved our travel day after a missed connection, but their delayed luggage delivery after that was a total mess","American Airlines Flight 1397ORD-PHL	8:20 pm-11:19 pm Boeing 737-800My wife and I recently took this flight from Chicago to Philadelphia on our way home from Aspen after missing a connection in Chicago on United. United’s delay caused us to be late arriving at O’Hare, so they put us on this later flight on American instead to get home. Simply for the fact that American still had another flight available to Philadelphia that night, which enabled us to get home without spending a night in Chicago, we were very happy with American. It didn’t hurt that the plane was very empty with a nice crew and an on-time arrival. However, the experience we had in getting our delayed luggage back after that spanned for days and showed true incompetence from the airline’s baggage services team.We had arrived at O’Hare on the far end of Terminal 1 in the B Concourse where United’s flights arrive, so we had a good 20-minute walk to get to this flight, which was departing from Terminal 3 in the K Concourse where American is located at O’Hare. It was an easy enough walk, just long, and it’s highly unusual to be connecting between those terminals anyway. It would be rare to have a scheduled connection between United and American. We were surprised to find that virtually everything in the airport seemed closed or in the process of closing at that point, around 7:30 pm. It didn’t seem all that late, but you would have thought it was much later based on the airport’s concessions. We were very hungry and wanted to pick up something to eat, but really couldn’t find anything other than McDonald’s or a couple full sit-down restaurants that we didn’t have time for.When we got to the gate, we had to stop to see the gate agent, since United hadn’t given us boarding passes for this flight, and my AA app was showing the flight, but not giving the usual option to collect mobile boarding passes. The gate agent was very friendly and helpful (a nice surprise based on what we’re used to from the AA staff at Philadelphia Airport in particular), and we were ready to go. The flight boarded right on time, and since it wasn’t a full flight, the boarding process was pretty civilized and quick. We boarded in one of the last groups and had absolutely no problem finding overhead bin space.We were sitting toward the back of the plane and had a full row to ourselves, which was nice. One of the flight attendants also came around and encouraged people to spread out once the boarding door was closed, just as long as we didn’t take the paid exit row seats. The young group flight attendants on this flight just seemed very nice and professional the entire time, and I would loved to have flown on a longer flight with them as our crew.The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800, which is one of the AA aircraft that’s become very standardized over the past few years, so it was exactly what I expected from past flights. The plane was in decent condition, and standard legroom feels somewhat tight, but isn’t horrible either. I do appreciate having both full outlets and USB plugs for easy charging during the flight, and the little electronic device stand at the top of the seat comes in handy as well. Even though we had boarded very quickly and were basically ready to go at least 15 minutes before our scheduled departure time, we just sat there for a while and ultimately pushed back from the gate a couple minutes late. Our taxi to the runway also seemed a bit slow, but once we joined the line to take off, which was about 10 planes deep, we actually got in the air pretty quickly. I’ve always appreciated that O’Hare seems to be an airport that can generally handle volume and keeps things moving. Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and the time until arrival.There was beverage service early-on in the flight along with Biscoff cookies, and the flight was uneventful after that. It was smooth, with a bit of turbulence as we neared Philadelphia. We ultimately arrived at our gate in Philly about 5 minutes early, which was good. From there, we knew we were going to be in for some further headaches, as United had told us our checked luggage would not be transferred onto this flight in time and would likely make it to Philadelphia on a flight the next day. However, since American was the final carrier on our itinerary, American was going to the be the airline responsible for getting us the luggage, not United.I went straight to the baggage office at the Terminal B/C baggage claim, joining the line after 3 or 4 other people. My wife waited at the baggage carousel to confirm that our bags had not made it on this flight (they hadn’t). There were several other people on our flight who had been in the exact same situation with the missed connection from Aspen, so we all joined the line together to make our delayed baggage claims. It didn’t take too long to make it to the front. The employee who was working that night was actually pretty pleasant and seemed to want to be helpful. It took a while to explain to him what had happened, and why we were making a claim with American despite having baggage receipts from United, but he ultimately understood and confirmed that American would be the one to return the bags to us. It’s still unclear when/how United and American made the handoff of the luggage, but it happened at some point. After I submitted the claim and described our bags, the employee told me that we should expect the bags to arrive within 24 hours and that they’d be delivered directly to our house. I did also get an email from American shortly after that, which provided our case number and a link to a delayed baggage status website. At this point, I really wasn’t frustrated with American at all, since United was the airline that had messed up and American was just picking up the pieces at the end.Luckily, this had happened on our way home, so we went home that night and still had clothes and most of the toiletries we needed. We waited to see what would happen the next day.  That next afternoon, the baggage status tracker was updated to reflect that our luggage had made it to the Philadelphia Airport. A couple hours later, I received an email from the baggage delivery service company, which offered a separate tracker for the actual delivery to our home, and gave an option to pre-sign for your bags so they wouldn’t require a signature to drop them off. It gave an estimate that our bags would leave the airport by 5:30 pm that evening and arrive at our home by 11:30 pm, which sounded fine. However, the tracker never updated further to reflect our bags having left the airport, and we did not receive them that night. Early the following morning, we got another email saying that they actually had left the airport that morning, and there was a map where we could actually see where the driver was. About 45 minutes later, I got an email saying that they had been delivered. I went right outside to find them, only to find a new headache.My wife and I each had one missing suitcase, and they are matching gray and tan hard-sided suitcases. The two suitcases we received were my wife’s, and then a stranger’s soft-sided purple suitcase, nothing even remotely close to mine, not to mention the fact that it was very clearly labeled with its owner’s name and address. Since the person dropping off the luggage had already left, I didn’t know what to do to get my suitcase. I hadn’t been given a direct phone number for the American baggage office at PHL, so my only real option was to call general American Airlines customer service, and after waiting on hold for a long time, the person I spoke to was nice, but really couldn’t do much. She claimed that the baggage staff at general AA customer service has no direct contact with the airport baggage offices that coordinate the actual baggage delivery, so the best she could do was send an internal message to PHL asking them to find and deliver my bag and come back to our house to pick up the wrong one. She told me I should get a call back from the airport with more information later that morning. Beyond continuing to not have my bag or any real resolution, there was extra frustration and complication because their system was showing my baggage claim as completed now, but I was actually worse off than at the start, now having someone else’s bag and no idea if mine was still sitting at the airport or also delivered to the wrong place.    In the meantime, I called the person whose bag I did have to let them know about their luggage. They lived about an hour away from me, and I offered to either meet them halfway to give them their bag or have AA pick it up and re-deliver to them based on my phone call with customer service. They were really nice and eager to have their bag back and not in AA’s hands (which I definitely don’t blame them for!), so they actually came all the way to my house to get it later that morning. I was glad that someone was reunited with their bag, even if it wasn’t me yet!Later that afternoon, I still had not received a call about my bag and was getting increasingly irritated about the incompetence. I called AA customer service again to inquire, and was basically told the same thing as in the morning: my bag was probably still sitting at the airport and the wrong one had been loaded for delivery (but they couldn’t know for sure), and they could put in another message to the PHL baggage office. I guess the second message did finally do the trick, since I got a call from the PHL baggage office about an hour later to inquire about what my bag looked like and confirm all of my information. The staff member on the phone said she was pretty sure my bag was still sitting there at the airport, and that they’d arrange to have it re-delivered that night. This all probably would have been easier if I had just gone back to the airport to pick up our bags as soon as they made it there, but I shouldn’t have had to do that when it was the airlines’ fault our baggage didn’t make it with us in the first place. However, going forward, if I’m able, I would consider trying to intercept delayed bags by going to the airport to get them before they can get mixed up in the incompetence of the delivery service.The airport must have found my bag shortly after that, because I got another delivery email that night, saying that my bag would be leaving the airport by 5:30 pm and arriving by 11:30 pm at our house (the same email and time frames from the email the night before which hadn’t materialized as promised). However, around 6:00 pm, I got another email saying that the bag was actually out for delivery, and I watched the tracking throughout the evening as the driver went truly all over New Jersey dropping off bags. Mine did not arrive by 11:30 pm, and I woke up in the morning to find out that it had been dropped off at 3:15 am. All I cared about was that it was actually there and was the correct bag, which it finally was.Overall, our flight itself from Chicago to Philadelphia on American was very good. The flight itself was comfortable with a pleasant crew, and was our best way home after United caused us to miss a connection and didn’t have any flights of their own for us that night. American’s more robust schedule to Philadelphia was great. However, once we got home, dealing with our delayed baggage was a mess. United was the reason the bags were delayed, so I don’t blame the initial delay on American. However, once the bags were in American’s hands and became their responsibility to deliver, they took longer to get to us than they should have, including sending us a completely wrong bag, which caused me to have to spend an entire day on the phone with AA trying to figure it out. I’m glad I still got my bag back, even if it was two days later than I should have, but I’m not sure I ever would have gotten it back had I not followed up so much and made them pay attention to it. This experience would be an A for the flight itself, but an F for delayed baggage handling."

The reservations person I spoke with mentioned that the credit must be used within 1year of the previous purchase, (that was April 8) but said because my proposed reschedule was only 13 about months from that date it could probably be approved. However- she came back and said her manager refused to allow us to use the credit because most of the original funds had been paid in Dec 2019.When logging into my account on the AA site, I click the “Have travel credits?

These notices have been in my account since August 2021 and continue to be there after I talked to Reservations on March 6, 2022.NOWHERE on the AA site does it say that credits from a cancelled trip can only be reapplied once and that a second cancellation makes the funds initially paid no longer available to the passenger for new trips."
Date of travel: February 2022,30,"Pretty average flight, but rude gate agents set a negative tone","American Airlines Flight 1313PHL-DEN9:50 am-12:23 pm Airbus A321My wife and I recently took this flight from Philadelphia to Denver at the beginning of a vacation to Colorado, and it was very much a standard AA experience - not great, but not bad. Rude gate agents at PHL started things out on the wrong foot, but it was better after that. The aircraft was in decent shape and we got there early, which is pretty much a win in my book. We arrived at Philadelphia Airport about 2 hours before the flight, and the large Terminal B/C check-in area was a bit busy, but it was still easy enough to get a kiosk to self-tag and check our bags with no wait, and we were quickly on our way. We used security at Terminal C, which is for Precheck only, and it was very smooth-sailing with no wait at all. We had a couple of Admirals Club passes that were soon expiring, so we went to the Admirals Club located up the escalators and on the second floor between terminals B and C.  We had never been to this lounge in the past, and although it’s a little dated, we appreciated that it was very large with plenty of seating areas and good views of the terminals and runway. I was also happy to see that they had hot food available on the buffet, including waffles and make-your-own breakfast tacos, in addition to having a station where someone was making avocado toast to-order. They also had a variety of standard cold food options. It was a nice surprise that hot food was available based on my experiences at other airport lounges in the morning. The drink options were a little weaker, since the only things included at the bar were a very cheap house red and white wine and the absolute lowest quality liquor options. Everyone that was there, us included, was asking for typical morning drinks like mimosas, and it was annoying to be told that no sparkling wine of any type was included. Instead, we had to pay $13 for each mimosa, which wasn’t a big deal, but easily could have been complimentary and made with a basic prosecco. No one is looking for a house red wine at 8:30 in the morning.The flight started boarding a few minutes early, so by the time we got to the gate at the appointed boarding time, boarding had already begun. It was a full flight, and had the standard chaotic process that is particularly bad at many of the tight gates at PHL, including C22 where we were. When it finally got to our group (Group 5), they called us  immediately after Group 4 with no break in between, so everyone just continued boarding through the priority lane, which the gate agents were allowing. After almost all of Group 5 had boarded, the gate agents suddenly decided that Group 5 could no longer board through the priority lane and that everyone had to use the main boarding lane. Normally, this would be fine since that’s how Group 5 is supposed to board. However, they didn’t do this in an organized manner, or at the start of boarding the group like they should have. The few of us who were still lined up in the priority lane were told we couldn’t board without going to the very back of a new separate line that had now formed in the regular boarding lane. Since I was next in line, I found it totally frustrating. The gate area was extremely small, we had already waited in what had been an acceptable spot until it was arbitrarily changed, and now having to swim upstream against the crowds to get to the back of a new line was a waste of time and energy. I asked the first person in the new line if she would mind if we went in front of her for boarding since it was so crazy and we were all in the same group anyway, and she said she didn’t mind at all. I told the gate agent this and he was extremely rude. He absolutely refused to let anyone else board in the way he had started boarding our group, saying that the other passenger “didn’t have the authority to decide when and where we can board” and it just left a negative taste in my mouth because he was being totally unreasonable. Arguing with a gate agent about which side of a stanchion I’m allowed to board from is just not the best way to start a trip, especially with it being so chaotic and impossible to move around. We eventually made our way to the back of the regular line and boarded shortly thereafter.  The aircraft was an A321 in the newer configuration that’s nothing super special, but better than the old legacy-US Airways A321s that we often flew on from PHL in the past, which had no amenities at all and small overhead bins. The plane ended up having extra-large overhead bins that easily fit everyone’s carry-on bags. I also appreciated that the seats had power outlets and USB chargers, along with the newer device holders that are helpful for holding a phone or watching something on your tablet during the flight. We had also paid for Main Cabin Extra seats with extra legroom, and I was happy with our purchase. The legroom was noticeably comfortable and better than standard economy seats.We left the gate a couple minutes early, quickly took off, and generally had a smooth and uneventful flight to Denver. Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and the time until arrival.There was one beverage service early-on in the flight, which included a choice of cookies or corn nuts. There was no additional service at all, and I definitely thought there should have at least been an offer of something basic like water one more time on a 4.5-hour flight. The flight attendants instead spent a lot of time making unnecessary announcements, including a credit card pitch right in the middle of the flight, which was annoying when most people are trying to focus on a movie, reading, or sleeping. If they have to do that, it’s much better when it’s right at the beginning or end of the flight. We also didn’t love that the captain turned on the fasten seatbelt sign at the slightest hint of turbulence and would then leave it on for long periods of time. We only hit one patch of slight turbulence on an otherwise totally smooth flight, so it should have been off much more than it was.We ultimately arrived at our gate in Denver over 20 minutes early, which was great. Luggage was pretty slow to arrive at baggage claim, especially given that it takes a while to get from the gates at DEN to baggage claim. However, it wasn’t the worst experience we’ve had when it comes to baggage claim, and we were still leaving the airport earlier than expected, given the early arrival of the flight. Overall, this flight from Philadelphia to Denver was fine. It didn’t feel like anyone went out of their way to make it a great experience, and the gate agents at PHL were incredibly rude and difficult in a way that they didn’t need to be. However, I was very glad we arrived early and had an uneventful and pretty comfortable flight."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Never Been Treated So Poorly by Gate Employees,"I do my fair share of traveling.  I've encountered plenty of flight delays, missed connections, etc. & understand you normally just have to roll with the punches.  But yesterday in Charlotte with American Airlines was the worst travel experience/customer service I've ever had & I need to vent.Our group of 7 (2 others were smart/fortunate enough to be flying Delta home instead) had a connection home to Birmingham from CLT scheduled to leave around 6pm.  About 15 minutes before we were scheduled to start boarding, we received notification that our flight home was just outright cancelled (later found out due to maintenance).  And the next available flight to BHM they could put us on was at 10:20pm... THE NEXT NIGHT.So now we must wait in line at one of their Customer Service desks.  I tried calling instead, but phone wait time was 90-120 minutes (ended up getting that call back more like 3 hours later).  We ask about flights to other nearby cities... Huntsville, Montgomery or Atlanta.  There are 2 seats available to Huntsville flight about to leave just a couple gates over, so one couple is able to get onto that one, rent a car & make it home... leaving 5 of us left.The customer service lady (who was very pleasant btw) finds the rest of us a 6:11 Atlanta flight leaving shortly with plenty of room.  Problem is we are in Terminal E & that flight is in Terminal C, but she tells us if we get there by 10 minutes before (6:01), we will be good & that our boarding passes will be updated but it may take a few minutes.We literally sprint to that gate (I'm still winded) & we all get to the gate by 5:58 & the door is still open.  We're all well aware that if the door was already closed, we had no chance.  But our boarding passes on our phones haven't been updated to the correct flight yet.  There are 3 employees there that we explained our situation to; and not only were they not attempting to be helpful at all, they were just downright belligerent to all of us (there were actually 2 more people we didn't know in the same boat as us at the gate, too). Nobody is willing to even check for our names on the computer (I know they can look up passengers by their IDs) & the head power-hungry employee gets on the PA & announces ""This is the last call for all passengers on the flight to Atlanta.  I will be closing this door at the end of this announcement"" right as we were standing there and proceeds to do just that.Now I will admit, I lost my cool after that & expletives flew loudly (I could end up on someone's Youtube post); but we were not defiant or such up until that point.  We were trying to explain our situation that was American Airlines fault in the first place and not just us being late for a flight, but they wouldn't hear any of it. I can't even begin to put into words how badly we were treated at that gate.I've been on plenty of Southwest flights where we were delayed briefly while waiting on connecting passengers.  Sometimes it might be frustrating while you're on the plane, but it's good customer service.  This wasn't even requiring a flight be delayed.  This was just asking for an ounce of helpfulness, which was apparently too much to ask.So back to customer service desk we go.  There is one seat now open on a later flight to Birmingham; so we send our single flyer on her way home leaving 4 of us still at CLT.  Our only remaining flight option is another Atlanta flight leaving a couple hours later, but we'd still have to rent another car from there & didn't want to risk another cancelled or delayed flight due to ""maintenance.""So we make the decision to just rent a $450 one-way SUV & make the 5.5 hour drive home (Deep South is a pretty interesting newish Podcast btw), making it just before midnight. Just now hoping the bags make it here today at least."
Date of travel: March 2022,20,Won't fly again,"This was our first time flying with AA. We did not book this ourselves, was done through the cruise line. Our flight was 2 hours late leaving. We sat in the plane while they decided if it could fly, which is ok in wanting everything safe.  But to keep us on the plane with limited leg room etc, wasn't very thoughtful. I don't care for their boarding process either. Why can't the people in the back get on first? Then they don't have disturb everyone else. Our return flight left an hour late because one of the flight attendants was late. This time we couldn't board. Again, the boarding process needs improvement. I had a window seat, and was in one of the last boarding groups, so people had to move in order for me to get to my seat. Not enough leg room and the seats are very uncomfortable. If I have no plans to use this airline again."
Date of travel: March 2022,30,Service lacking,The aircraft was super and business seating great.  The food service was barely acceptable.  Meat was tough and I was missing salad dressing and salt and pepper.  Biggest problem was flight attendant donned earplugs after food service and was not seen again until landing
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Please Let American Airlines go Bancrupt,"Once again, AA canceled the Columbia to Chicago morning flight.  They had good weather, so this another unforced cancellation due to their incompetency. We missed a family vacation, and all the deposits related.Why does the City of Columbia continue to collaborate with these incompetents?  And why does the US government continue to give them bailouts?  If they go bankrupt, the assets will not disappear.  They will be reorganized by better management.  New ownership, new culture, better service.American Airlines is a broken culture, that should ever again be subsidized.  Please put them out of their misery.  In doing so, you will be relieving ours, as well."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Covid grounded me and American Airlines took advantage of it!,"My wife and I had to be in Naples Florida to a work convention in August or September 2021. Unfortunately due to covid we couldn’t get out of Canada. I called American Airlines and asked if I can get a refund as I booked first class. The lady said absolutely not but we will give you a credit. They neglected to tell me that it had to be used by June 24/2022. I am not sure that my wife I will have a place need to go by then. American Airlines tried everything to keep our money and not supply service. I talked to another super nice lady who told me that American Airlines was bought out by US Airways but they kept the American Airlines name as it was more popular on a Google search. This lady told me if ai reached out to customer relations that they would extend the credit until at least the end of the year. I just heard from American Airlines today and they said that they will NOT extend the date for the credit. I told them I can’t use the credit, no need to until the fall again like when flying last year. I said, give me a credit where I couldn’t fly and they said no. So they have decided to just take my money. I have flown Air Canada(many times), West Jet, Delta and I have never received such poor service and rudeness like I have with American Airlines. Knowing that US Airways bought  them out makes sense as I never had good luck with them either. Shame on you American Airlines for encouraging people to travel when they didn’t feel safe and for not showing any compassion during a global pandemic when people were not always allowed to fly, orchestrating a system to keep there money."

Date of travel: March 2022,10,Not a company that wants customers,"We are a couple. ""The system""  Just gave us 2 seats in the middle far apart and have been trying since getting my tickets (2 months ago) to buy seats together. Seats together were never available! In fact there were never seats available period! for two months!..came to airport nobody willing to help. Not a company that will see our business ever again. Btw when you fly with them transatlantic they are suddenly a great company. Shame. Why do we want seats together? To minimize our risk of exposure from other people."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,THE WORST AIRLINE COMPANY EVER !!!,"They delayed my flight three times after I arrived to the airport and not even the last provided departure time was correct, so I missed my overseas flight...had to buy a new (pricey) one, arrived home almost a day later and not to mention stress that whole trip caused me.After all that hell, they couldn’t solve my refund request for three weeks and I still haven’t got any email, I saw ‘not refunded’ status online. I’ve spent hours waiting on the line to talk to their customer service, but had no luck to get someone who would help. I’ve sent two emails after that and no reply again, after more than 10 days. So unprofessional and disappointing!"

Date of travel: March 2022,10,Mishandled Bags! Non-existent supervisors! Condescending on the Phone!,"I checked in two suitcases in Orlando, Florida, and expected to have them when I and my wife arrive in Boston, MA. I paid $60 for this service. Simply, I paid for my luggage to be delivered to me at the Boston Logan airport.This is a scenario of what happened in Boston: 1) I and my wife arrive in Boston around 3:30 pm and wait 45 minutes and do not see our luggage. 2) I go to the luggage desk of the AA and they say one of my suitcases is in Washington and the other is in Philadelphia 3) I get very upset because I have wasted 1 hour by now and I ask to speak to a supervisor--I filed a claim 4) to add insult to the injury, there are no supervisors! I waste another 10 minutes waiting for the non-existent supervisor! 5) I call the AA phone number and wait 30 minutes to receive a very offensive and rude explanation of why the service I paid for has not been done! A multi-billion dollar company's representative tells me we cannot call you every 5 minutes to tell you where your luggage is. The tone was condescending as if they were talking to a 5-year-old.6) I go to the check-in section of AA and talk to a supervisor. He tells me mishandling the luggage happens a lot. I get angry and ask why. He says other airlines do it too! If everybody is doing a wrong thing, it does not mean that your doing the same wrong thing is justified or acceptable! I and my wife are as of now 8:40 AM March 6 waiting to receive our luggage!I will file a complaint with whichever company is responsible and reasonable to listen to me. Based on my horrible and time-wasting experience, it seems the AA is not such a company!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Second time they delay their red eye from San Diego to Miami by 12 hours!,The worst airlines ever. It is the second time that we are in the airport for their 10:45 pm red eye flight to Miami  and they re scheduled for NEXT day at  11 am.  A 12 hours delay. Absurd! My husband is missing his whole day of conference tomorrow.
Date of travel: January 2022,40,Long delay on the runway…..,"Good flight but long delay sitting on the plane while waiting to take off due to a heavy rain storm passing over Miami. Although it was a long delay, almost three hours, we were able to get in the air but arriving almost three hours late into Puerto Plata. I’m thankful my driver at the airport checked the status of my flight regularly."

Date of travel: February 2022,10,WORST AIRLINE I HAVE EVER TRAVELED WITH!,"Worst Airline I have ever traveled with would not recommend  them to  anyone, Our flight was delayed  for over 3 hours and we missed our connecting flight they didn't care that we missed our connecting flight  refused to rebook us for a new connecting. Staff have mad attitude literally told us ""not their problem"".  Yet we were told that when things like that came up that we were priority to rebook on the next flight. Best they did was gave us stand by tickets for that night other than that we were told we are on our own. When it came to our return trip they cancelled our flights with only a few hours notice. Only offered to fly us out the next day or to travel to the next nearest city with an international airport that would have  the ability to fly us out on the same we were to leave. The check in ladies had mad attitude when checking in both times. One tried to force my sister to board the plane with out her infant child. When you asked any kind of question staff just could not answer politely."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Not good airline,"Worst airline not family friendly at all if you are traveling alone then it’s fine, very rude staff."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Possibly the Worst Airline in the World,"Does AA know what service is? Because it seems it doesn't have a clue. I kept getting changes to the airline schedule for 2 legs of my 3 leg trip saying my flight was delayed -- which in fact in never was. Was AA playing a mean joke on me? If I had actually read one of them before I left my condo in Freeport, I would have missed my flight. Fortunately I only read that email after I had arrived in Miami. No food was served on any of the 3 flight despite the fact that 2 were over 2 hrs each and 2 of those flights were at dinner time.  Stupid little bags of snacks were served on 2 of the flights and none at all on one of them -- that one being over 2 hrs. AND I WAS TRAVELLING BUSINESS CLASS!!!!!!!!!! The rules for storing my tiny purse differed on EACH of the 3 airplanes (2 identical) -- so totally confusing. All in all, left with a bad impression of AA, will never fly with it again."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Being an AA card holder has no Benefit,"According to Porcha, Manager in Customer Service - being an AA card holder has no benefit. Let me make my story short. Back in Nov purchased 9 flights to Orlando. Celebrating my daughter's college graduation. Come to find out, I don't have plane ticket. Found out because our flight was changed. We had paid then $402.00 and now I had to pay $630.00 - smh. I paid that last year to Hawaii. Apparently, customer service had sent an email in Nov, however, never received one.  Porcha could not admit that emails sometimes don't get delivered. Porcha did not apologize but did say, If that would have happened to her she would be upset. Porcha did state ""our customer service need to be trained better, Being a AA holder has no benefit"" So why do you promote it so much in the flight? My request was to pay what I had originally paid $402.00. Porcha told me there is nothing, I can do for you. Not even one apology. I guess this would be the last time my family flies AA."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,WORST FLIGHT EVER,"American airline screwed me over twice. Delayed the flight in Miami by an hour. Missed my connection in JFK. They automatically put me on another flight. That ended up arriving late in another city. I’m now in DC, it’s been about 24 hours since I’ve left Miami and I’m still no where near my destination. Thanks American Airlines for wasting my time having me spend money on a hotel in nyc, wasting my money on a hotel in Ohio and ultimately making me miss business. On top of that get employees that aren’t rude when you’re trying to resolve a problem with the company they work for."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,American Airlines Suck,"$1500 for a direct flight to Key West. for 3 of us.  Only my husband could check in as there was one seat left on line when the 24 hour window to check in opened.  Now we have to get there 3 hours early 4 am--and hope we score two of the seats only available to the airport.  They don't care.  I called it was like oh well, we will always get you on a later flight.  I don't want a later flight.  Spending over $10,000 and this airline just doesn't care."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Stay Away from anything American Airlines Vacation,"I used AA Vacations to rent a car at BDL the weekend of 1-28-2022, I wished I had booked directly with Avis or Enterprise. That was the weekend of the big snow storm and no flights were going into the airport. AA rebooked my flight and Hilton canceled my reservation BUT AA Vacations went ahead and charged me for my car rental. I guess I was supposed to get to the airport from LA by sled. American Airlines  cannot be trusted to properly vet companies for quality. In 2009 I used American Airlines Vacations  to book hotel rooms in Hawaii as a gift to my mother, the room specifications were not met, the rooms were uncleaned and one of the rooms had mice, yes mice!! I mainly used the car rental to save a couple of bucks on the car insurance moving forward when I book directly with the rental car company I will use their insurance or the insurance on my credit card. Because now I am out $66 because American Airlines likes to do business with dubious companies not caring about the cost to their advantage loyalty members.  I will never use American Airlines Vacations, Bottom line DO NOT TRUST ANY RECOMMENDATIONS/ PARTNERS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES.  AMERICAN AIRLINES DOES NOT HAVE THE SKILLS SET TO JUDGE COMPANIES CUSTOMER SERVICE QUALITIES. THEIR BRAND IS TARNISHED.  JUST BOOK YOURSELF. DO NOT TRUST ANY AND ALL COMPANIES AMERICAN AIRLINES MAY RECOMMEND."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Never flying with American again,Switched my flight to the complete other side of the terminals without telling me found out when I got up to board and missed the flight because this airline is run by idiots they put me on a new flight but cost me hours of my time and caused me to miss appointments
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Badly Handled Rebooking when there is weather,"There was a weather alert for our departure on January 29th.  According to American's policy, they let you rebook without penalty.  When we called to rebook the flight they charged us over $1600 to rebook.  After the fligh When we requested., all they did was send us letters saying they would be slow to respond."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,American Airlines,"Today my family and I flew American Airlines flight 3530 to Green Bay. All I can think about is how modifying the whole experience was. We were abruptly confronted by an aggressive flight attendant that our two year old needed a mask. We genuinely didn’t know she needed a mask. In front of the entire plane she yelled that she in fact needed a mask multiple times. I brought extras and we put one in her right away. After a few minutes the flight attendant was going through the cabin with a bag of masks and told me that if I had a problem I could get my things a leave, which was really confusing because we already corrected the issue and our toddler had a mask on!! A few minutes later we were kicked off the plane. Humiliated and embarrassed, I began to cry and she laughed as we left! There was another pilot sitting across from and he said he couldn’t even believe it and that this never happened before. I’m still shook and upset. I can understand rules and understand safety measures but I cannot understand how awful we were treated. I’m not asking for a refund or a reimbursement of any monetary value. But I would like a little more understanding, patience and some kindness. There was no reason for our children to witness a person of service degrade and humiliate their family in front of so many people. We were bullied and shamed over something that could have been handled rationally. I have have many flights with American Airlines what were a pleasure but I ensure that I would never recommend them again or use their services as I still feel very hurt."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Never again,We sat in Dallas on a plane for almost 5 hours waiting on 6 people. Then it took another 1.5 hours waiting to get de iced. On our way back home we had a 2 hour layover in Dallas. By the time we made it through customs and security again we missed our flight by less than two minutes. Our daughter and her boyfriend made it. She was on the phone with me telling them we were about to the gate. She was treated rudely and yelled at. They went ahead and boarded and when we got there the lady would not even look at us and rudely told us gate closed. Sent us to another area to get new tickets. We sat there and the plane we were supposed to be on was due to depart at 6:52 and we got to the gate around 6:40 and the plane did not depart until 7:22! Fortunately we were put on standby and was able to catch the next flight to Denver only 1.5 hours later. This was our first time and American Airlines definitely made it a very bad experience.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Expedia vs American Airlines,"As many people have discovered, Customer Service does not exist at Expedia. I'll never book with them again. I was unable to make a flight because of Covid and other health issues. The ticket is set to expire 3/31/22. I've been trying to get this extended due to health.  All I've managed to get is a runaround from both Expedia and American. Each company says it's the other company's policy they are following.  In one email, American pretty much told me not to bother them again !I'm out $862 and will never get it back. This rant is just to let fellow travelers know that Expedia is only interested in getting your money. They will not help you regardless of the the problem."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Poor customer service,"If a carrier says they provide customer service, expect the least from American Airlines.  Please note I’m a Million ++ flyer.  It would have been so easy for AA to provide a cart to meet four passengers connecting on an international flight.   NOTE the delay on the connection was the fault of American.  Yet, they knew there were at least four of us and they did nothing to help.   In addition we were given the wrong information saying they would provide a meal voucher for the morning breakfast.  Blah blah blah.  They did not. Why lie?  We ended up waiting in line to get the voucher and told we did not qualify.  Find a carrier that puts service into customer service"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Bad oritiations to the customer service,they made me went through is a need.

Date of travel: March 2022,10,Pre travel review,"This is a pre departure review because my trip is not until May.  In January I booked a flight from San Antonio to Honolulu.  On March 2 I received an email that American Airlines had made changes to my flight.  Instead of a minor change, such as a departure time, the change was riddled with inconveniences.  The flight departure had been moved up a day.  The flight was leaving from another airport an hour and a half away.  The layover destinations had been changed and the newly added city had an 11 hour layover.  On the return I flight, the final destination was an hour and a half away from where my trip had began.  I would have to find away to get myself, my companion, and our luggage to my car parked at the original airport.  Though I booked my trip through a third party the email said to contact American.  I contacted American and was told that they could not help me even though they were the cause of my inconvenience.  I was not happy.  I asked to speak to a supervisor.  The supervisor fed me the same garbage but said she could help me if I paid $50 per traveler.  Her name is Kathy.  This was an insult on top of the inconvenience that American had caused.  If American inconveniences it’s customer to the extreme that it was doing to us, the company should go above and beyond to satisfy the customer.  If you have policies in place that do not allow an immediate solution, the company should have some type of work around to assist the customer for the aggravation caused by American.  A $50 per traveler charge to fix American’s mistake is not a proper work around."
Date of travel: March 2022,30,First class in flight service not pleasant.,"Flight attendants more interested in their cell phones/ipads than servicing the passengers.  As we boarded our flight, got into our seats I asked that the attendant to hang 2 coats for us.  They used to just take that on without asking.  The response we received was......""well, we don't have much space here and no closet"".  I pointed to the hangers behind the last seats (all of which were empty) and finally as everyone was seated she reluctantly came and grabbed our coats without a word and hung them, not without an attitude.  Is COVID the excuse for lack of caring service?  I've been flying 1st class for over 20 years and find the service so minimal and unattentive that the only benefit on board for paying such prices was the size of the seat and space.  Morning flights don't really benefit from free beverages in my opinion.  Once the beverages and basket of chips was offered that was it for the service.  The attendant never returned to check on us or ask if there was anything we would like.  First class used to be first class......now it seems to be coach with large comfy seats and more leg room.  Such a waste and shame."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,American Airlines doesnt care,"The airlines had mechanical trouble. We missed our connection because it took three hours to find another plane. Totally unacceptable. No apologies. Lied to our face that the hotel voucher includes breakfast. It doesn’t. If you want to locate the worst hotels in Miami no problem, just find out where American Airlines puts its delayed customers. Right next to the airport runway, a holiday inn where sleeping is impossible.And they couldn’t give us a room on a high floor because American Airlines only blocks off the worst rooms. I hate being lied to and treated like dirt. YOU SPOILED MY VACATION AMERICAN AIRLINES AND YOU COULDNT CARE LESS.Oh let me add I stood for two hours at the customer service line at lax and never made it to the front, had to run to catch my 3-hour delayed flight, then spent another hour waiting on the customer service line in Miami as well. THREE HOURS IN LINE AND BEING LIED TO BY YOUR AGENT WHEN I FINALLY GOT TO THE FRONT. THANK YOU AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!!!"

Date of travel: February 2022,10,American is the airline from HELL,"I don’t even know where to begin with this huge travel fiasco I had to endure with a baby in tow. Strap in for the ride! American canceled our flights due to weather on 2/25/22. Okay, fine. We tried rebooking on the app several times, the flights kept disappearing and we get error messages. Call times were over 5 hrs. Finally get a call back from an agent THE FOLLOWING DAY. The earliest she could rebook us for was 3/1 (FOUR DAYS after our original departure). In the meantime we’ve tried rebooking other airlines, and same error message kept happening. Not to mention flights were four times the cost with 11hr or more flight times as opposed to the 5 hr flight time we originally booked. We keep calling every day between Friday and Tuesday to see if anything else had opened up - nothing. Now we’re stuck in Miami for FOUR additional days - racking up costs on hotel, meals, car rental, gas, diapers, etc.. Incident 1: We check in for our flights on the app Monday night and seats are confirmed. When we arrive at the airport two hrs early on Tuesday, the agent says we don’t have tickets. When she reviews our history, she notices the agent that rebooked us forgot to reissue our tickets. The agent puts us on standby. Incident 2: When we get to the counter at the gate and explain our situation to the agent there, she says we have to wait, so we do. We later realize that the agent starts giving away seats to customers flying solo as they become available instead of following protocol (wait until all paying customers are checked in and then go down the standby list in order - we were the top 3 on the list). We ask her why and she says because they are in a rush and need to board the plane. That they cannot afford to wait for 3 seats to open up, they must give them away asap. Although 3 seats eventually became available, because the agent failed to follow protocol, we didn’t make the flight. Incident 3: We return to the original check in agent and explain what happened. She was confused and confirmed that the staff person did not follow proper standby protocol. She rebooks us for the following day on Wednesday morning but cannot sit us together. I ask her about hotel and meal vouchers and she said she cannot do anything and for us to file a complaint. Yet another night at a hotel, missing work, school, and meal expenses.We arrive at the airport two hours early on the day of our flight so that we can speak to the agent at the counter about sitting us next to our two year old son. The agent says they cannot do anything for us and to “figure it out” when we board the plane with other passengers. We were so distraught by their refusal to help us that two passengers then volunteered to move so that we can be seated with our TWO YEAR OLD. It was only at that point that Victor (the agent at the counter who refused to help us) then proceeded to change our seats. AA doesn’t care about families. AA doesn’t care about customers. All they care about is their bottom line $$$. I am disgusted by the lack of professionalism and empathy, gross negligence, refusal to follow proper protocols, refusal to provide customers with hotel and meal vouchers when they were the ones who messed up. The financial and emotional damages they caused us were too much to bear. I will never fly American Airlines again and I hope you don’t either. I’ll"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,At their mercy,"#1 Flight was delayed at gate ""mechanical issue"".#2 Flight delayed runway traffic. Circled around.Ran to next gate for connecting flight only to be turned away by boarding agents as they closed the door in our faces. Customer service tried to help but no flights until 24 hours later, no hotel, no luggage, no toiletries, no food, and no reimbursement for any of it because it was stated mechanical issue. So my $350 flight ended up costing me roughly $600. Still cheaper then the $1000 a night hotel they gave me a discount voucher for. $1000 a night, I was so discussed I hung up before finding out what the discount was to be. Really American? most people can't afford those prices.I had to get a hotel room, with a shuttle service or spend the night like a homeless person sleeping in airport. The hotel staff says the airlines do that all the time.I was glad when I booked I bought missed connection insurance. I was able to change airline,  and was home before American tookoff from Dallas, or I might still be at the mercy of American Airlines."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Horrible customer service on needing help with my disability,"Took a cruise out of Miami, got injured on the cruise, spent 3 weeks getting medical care in Miami and got just well enough to take a flight out of Miami to New Orleans to go home. But, before I booked this flight, I called American Airlines TWICE to make sure I would get assistance in boarding the plane and having my luggage put in the bin. I had two broken vertebrae and two broken toes from the cruise ship injury.     The airport personnel did wheel me to the plane, but not to my seat. The flight attendant would not let my wheelchair on the plane. So, I had to walk to my seat with a broken back and  toes. The flight attendant would not let the airport personnel bring my luggage with me to my seat nor would she let them put my luggage in the overhead bin. She actually made them leave plane.     So, there I am, hunched over from my injuries, holding on to the backs of people’s seats to get my own. I also had a back brace on, so she could obviously see that I truly was hurt. Before, I could get to my seat, she starts yelling, in front of everyone, that I need to come get my luggage, which I couldn’t possibly pick up. I did tell her about the double assurance American gave me for assistance and she still flat out refused to help or even get someone who could help.  She actually said it wasn’t her job to assist me.    Long story short, with my luggage blocking the aisle, she finally picked up the luggage, brought it to me, but refused to help me put it in the overhead bin. Since I couldn’t lift my arms up because of my injuries, I couldn’t put it up there. Fortunately, a 13 year old saw what was going on and offered to put my luggage up, which I will be internally grateful for.     All I can say is, if this is what people with disabilities have to deal with - my heart goes out to them. Maybe, I just happened to get a jerk of a flight attendant and that doesn’t usually happen, but I will NEVER fly with American again. I just can’t take that chance."

I couldn't checking online for 2 of our 4 passengers because they didn't have seats even though when I booked them they did. Our connecting flight was showing none of us as checked in or having seats. They changed my flight back in November leaving only 55 minute layover. Plane were to board showed up late but we were told 3 times we would make the connecting. But we didn't! Plan took off 1 hour later than it should have. The only was they could accommodate us was to fly us someone in Wisconsin but not to the airport we flew out of. There are no rental cars anywhere either So they didn't care they would then leave us stranded. My advice to anyone is to never book with them EVER!!
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Miami international connection horrors - AA takes no responsibility,"Our flight from Grenada landed in Miami ahead of schedule, however we sat on the tarmac for 20 minutes breathing jet engine fumes waiting for a gate to become available. Miami Immigration and Customs where slow to process the usual evening surge - we barely made our connecting flight but not the couple we were traveling with did not despite us notifying the gate attendant that our traveling companions were coming just a few minutes behind us. It was frustrating to watch American  close the door then take 20 minutes to remove our travel companions bags which had already been loaded on the flight - It would have been 4 minutes if they waited for them to board. Insult to injury, they waited 4 hours in American's customer service counter only to find American not willing to provide any assistance, leaving the couple on their own. They had to Uber to Ft Lauderdale to get a flight to PHL/BOS, arriving home late the next day weary and several hundred dollars out of pocket as a result. Other short comings include no Apple Music on in-flight entertainment, 737 engine noise so loud you could not hear any in-flight entertainment even with volume at ear busting levels using decent noise-canceling headphones.  It seems one must pay the bucks to be in front of the wings/engines do deal with that.Overall brain-numbing experience that tainted the trip for all four of us.Oh, yes - they also pitch the Barclay's American Advantage cards on every flight including telling you first checked bags are free for you and up to four companions, they do not mention its ONLY FREE FOR DOMESTIC FLIGHTS - YOU PAY $30 extra per bag for on every leg of every international flight - This is deceptive advertising!!!  They tell you they waive the first year card fee is waived, and charge you $99 at the one-year anniversary -  if you get it, advise that you cancel this card before 11+ months.Plusses - Thank you to all the flight attendants - all were very nice!  Horrible airline though..."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,American Airlines is worse than Covid,"We purchased tickets for a trip to Ireland.  Purchase was made in September 2019 for a trip scheduled for May 2020.  The trip was cancelled due to the UK not allowing travel into the country.  I received notification that our money was save, not to worry.  Since then they have changed their company line.  I was told in September 2021 I had until March of 2022 to complete my travel.It has taken me months to get a response from the customer service which is basically we are keeping your money.How can they in good conscience keep the money of travels unable to travel due to the pandemic.  I even asked for a credit not a refund,You may get my money this time, but you will never get another dime out of me."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,"Terrible - loyal frequent flyer, but not for long","I have been a frequent flyer w AA for over 20 years and now may never fly with them again after I use all my miles.Service and overall performance have deteriorated rapidly. We just now waited hours in Miami for a delayed connecting flight, stood in multiple disorganized lines to recheck bags after flying from Belize, dealt with incredibly rude and confused staff, and finally boarded over four hours late for no apparent reason. They also gave away seats we’d selected months ago so our family of four was separated all over the plane. As soon as all passengers were on the plane and the flight was finally going to take off, there was a mechanical problem, which was initially reported to be fixed. Now the captain has said a door needs to be replaced. A door?! Not sure what happened to American Airlines, but there are a lot of choices and we will choose other carriers in future! All airlines are dealing with COVID, but my daughter and I flew Delta from Boston to Mexico and back in January/2022 and made two connections each way. Every flight on time - no problems at all, extra space in reasonably price in comfort plus seats, and screens with awesome movie selections at each seat. Somehow AA has also removed all the screens in all seats. Why? A movie would be incredibly useful at moments like this when stuck waiting for hours in a cramped seat waiting for this flight to take off! Strong recommendation - fly with someone else!"
Date of travel: February 2022,20,Bait and switch,"I must have spent at least 20 hours browsing flights, looking for the perfect schedule, shortest route, best price and amenities, etc. Finally was a toss up between AA and British Airways, both changing in Seattle, and I went with BA. However when I went to book, BA wanted extra money for a seat assignment so I ditched them and chose to book with AA instead. A month later, AA suddenly emails that my flight has been changed and they are unable to rebook. After I call customer service, it turns out the code share flight I was on to Seattle has been cancelled, and all the others are full. I'm looking at a completely different route and schedule, or I can do a full refund. Well that won't help since prices have increased considerably since I first booked  After expressing my extreme disappointment they finally put me on the same Seattle BA flight I was going to take in the first place, except now I have an extra  four hour layover, and yet I still have to pay extra to get a seat assignment with BA. Lesson learned--next time I will just suck it up and pay BA for the seat assignment in the first place. Forget AA."
Date of travel: February 2022,50,Excellent flight crew,"Although our fully booked flight was delayed about 30 minutes due to an unexpected maintenance issue, we then promptly took off, knowing to expect a strong line of storms during our flight.The flight crew alerted us and then did an outstanding job maneuvering through turbulence. We flew through nothing but dark clouds for the last 25 minutes of the appr. 50 minute flight. The turbulence felt in the cabin was tolerable and definitely not the worst we had been through.Well done Crew of flight AA5697 on 2/22/22!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE SERVICE EVER,"If I could give this airline 0 stars, I would. This is the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. I had to rebook my tickets due to the pandemic in 2021, and they gave me a voucher which seemed very nice. But when I tried to use, they came up with all these reasons I couldn’t. Even though the voucher online said it had been extended until March 31st 2022, they would not let me use it. This isn’t the first time I’ve had issues with them either. I have paid for the refundable tickets just incase something happened, and they still refused to let me refund it. I don’t understand why you can’t change a ticket even by one day (which I’ve tried before), if you’re still giving them money. As a paying customer, it’s just hard to ignore the little to no courtesy they show. I know there are rules and conditions as per usual with every airline, but they show no understanding at all. There customer service basically doesn’t exist, they can’t really help you anyway if you’ve made a mistake or an issue has arrived with your flight dates. Why fly American when you could pay a little extra, or possible cheaper (after American’s bags and refund fees), to fly Southwest. You get two free checked bags, and you can refund or change your tickets without any fees or problems. I’m just really disappointed that we’ve come to the point where businesses show no compassion towards their customers. They are just stealing our money. At least southwest still had some heart and morality."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,American is the next spirit,"I usually fly Delta because every time I fly American, I am reminded why I don’t fly American. We start with their inability to be on time effectively. No matter if it’s boarding on time or the agents showing up when they want. Everyone who works for American is bossy, like it’s your job to give them customer service when it’s their job to provide the service for you. I don’t know why it’s such a burden to be helpful and not fail at takeoff & arrivals. Tough landing too. I don’t know if their staff is just not happy or short-staffed on their knowledge and ability to perform a simple task, but it shows. The harassing of customers on the aircraft to abide by their wants and wishes, while the gate agent is nitpicks everything. Maybe if they spent less time doing their job and more time preparing for takeoff and landing, we could get to our connecting flights on time. American has to be one of the worst airlines, and I don’t need babysitting or someone trying to control my every breath in my travel experiences. I will continue to fly delta only and let all those who like this passive and gaslighting behavior continue their experience."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,A nightmare experience,"First time flying with American Airlines and NEVER will fly with them again. Our first flight was delayed so we missed our first connecting flight and also missed our second connecting flight. From there they put us in a hotel in Dallas, Texas and the next day we were supposed to fly standby on another flight. We flew to another state (Philadelphia, PA) and then they changed us to Jet Blue. We had wait until customer service arrived an hour before the flight took off to get our tickets. (We had been waiting 6 hours in the airport for customer service to show up) Turned out American Airlines never paid for the tickets. So, we missed another flight. They put us on standby again and we missed that too because it was overbooked. Finally, we tried to find a rental car, bus or train and everything was booked. The rental cars would not let us take a car one way back home. We went back into the airport and begged them to put us on a direct flight and they kept stating there was no flights until Monday. We requested to be put into a hotel for the night and they refused that too because we were now flying domestically and they aren’t required to do anything when weather messes up flights. This was no longer about the storm, they did not pay for the ticket for Jet Blue so we were stranded. Furthermore, they forced my sister to check her carry-on bag, and my bag had already been sent to Boston, so we had none of our toiletries or a change of clothes.This has been an absolutely horrible experience. There is clearly no way this airline knows how to handle things when they go haywire. Their customer service skills are horrendous and they are beyond rude. The only person to thank is Tiara at the Philly airport for her compassion and professionalism. Nancy from the customer service number who never booked the Jet Blue flight should be held accountable, Felicia RFP supervisor on the customer service number was belittling and had zero compassion for our situation, was rude and should never have been put as a supervisor. Every other person from the Oaxaca, Mexico airport to the Dallas airport and the rest of the staff at the Philadelphia airport besides Tiara should be held responsible and the customer service people representing the company. We had to wait for a call back which took at least 6-12 hours every time! All of these staff members said they had NOTHING they could do for us, no reasonable accommodations or compromises they could make on my and my sisters’ behalf. The three of us traveled together to Mexico and we’re forced to return separate. Meanwhile, my sister had three panic attacks and has two babies crying for her to return home."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,"American Airlines is horrible, will never use them again!","Booked flights to Bermuda back in September 2021, Business Class.  Celebrating my retirement in February 2022.   The night before our flight back to the US, I double checked my flight, seats, and checked in. My friend was bumped from Business Class and no longer had a seat assignment.  My seat changed from 2F to 1C.  I did not make this change.  Someone at AA decided this for me, and did not bother to let us know.I called AA, they were busy and there was a 4 hour wait to speak to someone.  I received a call back.  I was trying to explain to the very rude AA customer service rep that I booked this flight and seat assignment back in September 2021, they needed to correct this error, and put us back in our original seats.  I was told the flight was over-booked.  Out of the blue, the AA customer service rep told me she was moving me back to Economy class.  When I told her she cannot do this, she hung up on me!  Twenty minutes later, I looked up my reservation and I was no longer in Business class and did not have a seat assignment.  I called AA again and was told our flight out of Bermuda did not have Business class, so that is why we were probably moved.   This rep lied to me.  It was the same type of plane and they had Business class.  Plus, the plane was practically empty in Economy class!And I did not receive any type of refund.  They bumped us, did not let us know, and offered us a $300 voucher that has to be used within one year.  This is not right.  Shame on you American Airlines.   You have lost two long-time flyers.   ...as if you care."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Always delays and issues,"Don't stress yourself, just book a different airline.  AA represents delays and issues and will rarely provide a positive experience.  Will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,WILL NEVER BOOK WITH THIS AIRLINE AGAIN,"My family and I (10+ people) were all booked to leave Sat Feb 19 at 7 am on AA. We got to the gate and they announced a 6 hour delay because someone did not charge the emergency lights of the plane overnight. We had a connecting flight in Philly to Aruba at 9:40 am, so we could not wait 6  hours for the lights to charge. We were given a customer service number to call to rebook flights. The 3 people we spoke to were rude and very unhelpful. They would not refund our flight nor find a departing flight for the same day. We then went to the counter and found no help with them either. Seeing as no one from AA would be any help at all, we booked with a different airline. This set our vacation back a day and a half plus travel to a different airport out of state. AA still has yet to refund our first flights. I will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Would not recommend,"I do feel better about reading other comments from other customers that received the exact same classlessness treatment that I received February 17th - 20th. My flights were delayed so long that I sat in the airport for several hours just to find out that I would miss any chance of arriving in FLL the same day. Granted I was in the airport by 10am and was delayed so long that I was told no other flights would be going anywhere near my destination the same day. When I explained that not arriving at least the same day (never mind hours after I was expected) I was told by customer service “what do you want me to do about it?” I suggested connecting to another airline or even provide a rental car for me to get there the same day and was met with “we don’t do that”. Furious at this point I asked for a full refund and was told “I’ll send you a link to follow”. The link required hours of waiting to be told my refund request would be reviewed. Long story short, I took off work for no reason, barely packed enough clothes because I wanted to travel light, drove my personal vehicle 1,200+ miles for over 21 hours round trip spending an additional $300+ dollars in gas, just to be told that I am probably not going to get a refund for my return flight because I didn’t show up to the airport on Sunday(my return date). ITS BECAUSE I HAD TO DRIVE MY OWN TRUCK YOU GENIUSES!!! You will never receive a penny from me ever again! Enjoy the money you stole from me. I will make it my mission to post on every review possible for every site possible until you acknowledge what you have done. You are trash!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Never on time.,I have flown on American 4 times in the last 5 years and I have never had a flight leave on time. Have also missed connecting flights because the plane I was supposed to be on had a broken screw on a seat. I am currently returning from Mexico. First flight was late connecting flight was delayed twice. I will never fly american again
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Awful service,"I will NEVER fly American Airlines again. They lost my suitcase, never found it, and are refusing to give me any reimbursement because I don’t have receipts for the items in my suitcase. They expect me to save receipts for all items purchased over the last 5 years. They are also refusing to reimburse me for the items I had to purchase on my trip. Their messed up policy states they only reimburse you if they find your suitcase. So I walk away with nothing. I will NEVER fly with them again."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Completely unethical company taking advantage of the covid situation.,Terrible customer service.  I had to cancel my flights due to Covid and after spending hours (Waited for 2 hrs the first time then had to wait a day for them to call back then had to wait an hour for a supervisor) on the phone trying to talk to someone in order to use my travel credit they refused to apply it to my new flights and wouldn't work with me at all.  They even refused to send me an email telling me they are denying my request so I can show my credit card travel insurance. Completely unethical company taking advantage of the covid situation.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,American Airlines (AAL): Family trip FAILED!,"We booked months in advance and arrived at airport early for big St Thomas trip with Grandma, Grandpa, Granddaughter, wife and me. Apparently it’s legal for AAL to sell seats to multiple people never intending to  provide the service (transportation). It might be legal and profitable but NOT ETHICAL! NEVER fly AAL!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,American Airlines is TERRIBLE,This airline has nothing but delays and there is no good customer service or accommodations. Sometimes there is no good reason for delays and I’m really disappointed with this airline.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst trip ever,First our flight got cancelled. American airlines wouldn't book us on another airline because they said they have availability.  There availability took 2 more airports and 2 whole days to get us home. Then they lost our bag. Can't get ahold of anybody. The tracker app stopped working. This was a nightmare. I WILL NECER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN!!
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Frustrated with American Airlines - Horrible,"I had a horrendous experience with the airport in Charlotte which has almost no signage and American Airlines.  We were to go to Biloxi for my mother’s 83 birthday.  We were scheduled out of Charlotte NC for a direct flight.  We arrived at the gate an Hour and 45 minutes prior to departure.  We were delayed 5 times, sent to three different gates in 3 different parts of the terminal.  After the 5th delay and spending all day in the airport we decided to cancel.  I called my mother who was very disappointed.  We want to baggage claim to get our bag and were told it would take up to 45 minutes.  After 45 minutes we had not received our bag so we went back and were told by the attendant that they were ignoring her request and sent the bag planeside so we would not get it back.  We do not know where our bag is.  She gave me a number to call and I waited on hold for 57 minutes on two different occasions and still cannot talk to a person to see where my bag is.  We could not go yo customer service because there were only two representatives and about 25 people in line who unfortunately had similar and worse stories.  It has been such a frustrating experience and I still missed my mother’s birthday."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Connecting Flight cancelled at 10:30 PM - last flight out of Charlotte,"American decided to cancel our connecting flight out of Charlotte to Raleigh last night(2/25)  after flying us from Indianapolis to Charlotte. They first said it was delayed due to needing an flight attendant - then they cancelled the flight all together with no explanation- leaving us stranded in Charlotte. Calls to American Customer Service went to voice mail with a four hour call back option!!  No offer for hotels, no rental car offer, no bus for the 3 hour ride to Raleigh!!! We are only coming to Raleigh for the weekend and had a Saturday morning appointment which we are missing. If American can't run thier airline better than this - they need to close their doors or find people who can manage it better. Never had this happen with Delta,!!! I will NEVER fly AA again and I would urge all travelers to find other carriers. I now understand why there are un-ruly passengers - especially in situations like this!!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Horrible airline. delayed flight overnight and then another 2 hours the next day.,"if zero stars was an option i would have rather chose that. delayed flight 8 hrs and rescheduled the next morning with no pilot, how do you schedule a plane to leave with no pilot!?!? Will not be flying American again. horrible service."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Never Felt so Jerked Around,"Terrible experience with American Airlines. Flight was delayed 4.5 hours, then canceled 5 minutes before boarding with no explanation. They offered a $12 food credit in return, which was insulting."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,"Delayed flights, Cancelled flights, rude staff..","Rude staff, unorganized all around. Never been treated worse.. Awful... We tried so hard to be nice to the ticketing agent ""Kat"".... She was awful, hard to believe this person has a job at an airline.. Just awful service, rude and unprofessional."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,The worst airline,"I would never fly AA if there is another option for your destination, no matter what the cost. Absolutely terrible."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,it is the first experience of mine with this flight and my experience is very bad with them. Extremely poor service.,i have got a message my bag is delayed and will be reached soon on the next flight. Its been 5 days now and no one even contact to me regarding my baggage. i am leaving the emails continousely but there is no positive response except we apologize. what should i have to do as i have lost my bag and there is no claim has been paid to me. It's a horrible experience with them. I personally say do not take this flight.
Date of travel: February 2022,30,Ehhh?!?!?,"As teachers, scheduled personal days to plan a trip to New Orleans.  We originally scheduled a flight out of Harrisburg the Friday after work.  On Friday we get notification that our flight was delayed and then canceled.  We had to scramble to rearrange for an early Saturday morning flight.  American treated this as no big deal while we had to let the hotel and shuttle know things were shifting for reasons beyond our control.  Our experience wasn’t horrible but it wasn’t great either. While I understand flights get cancelled, I didn’t appreciate the nonchalant attitude of just go another day(they wanted us to wait another week).  That’s not how most working people operate."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Bitterly disappointed.,"I've used, the default purpose as 'both'; the truth is it was an emergency trip to see a very close relative who had fallen ill and I had just five hours to try arranging a flight out to go see them on the same day.For the privilege of £1056.56 for a bucket and spade economy seat, it took 4(yes; FOUR) days to arrive at my destination. This was the days of the snows in USA  however, the actions of the American Airlines JFK team compounded the experience which saw me sleeping largely on floors with zero American assistance and very lamentable behaviour.Despite me having secure both my Covid pass and lateral flow tests prior to leaving UK, on day three American airlines falsely claimed I didn't have one and was told that on the Friday which was wholly untrue.At LHR i was asked what was my final destination;told them, and was asked for certain paperwork which I supplied.I have been trying whilst on still on the island to secure a partial refund of the outbound leg of my trip; the poor services received at the JFK airport by the lamentable practices of American airlines staff, and despite reaching out to their customers services team was only offered a credit for another ticket;I mentioned that other than my return leg on March 2 2022, I was unlikely to be travelling in the next 12months. To which he replied that after further review I would not be getting a part refund of my outbound leg. Despite voicing my disappointment and enquiring further, the agent would not state what those considerations were resulting in American Airlines not acceding to the part refund request of the outbound leg, nor how the fact I could provide evidence I had a lateral  flow test  before I left London Heathrow (AA JFK  staff couldn't seem to understand that lateral flow and Antigen are the same) was considered as part of that decision.I just got no additional reply.I'm scheduled to return home to the UK on 2nd March and had to state that I would seek to further find other avenues; either escalated  further up the American Airlines chain, or on return to research with the appropriate regulatory bodies in the UK from where my flight originated, to see what additional recourse I might have.To all who see this post, please be wary of American Airlines, it's of particular note the JFK team are terrible --even some of the AA team ispoke to elsewhere; whom I won't say much more to protect their honest disclosures, accepted there is a cultural issue at American Airlines in Ney York... largely aloof and lacking patience and receptiveness of non US citizens. The most shocking part is that the only person who came to my aid was an information services airport worker for JFK airport***who didn't even work for American Airlines  ***and helped me have to get ANOTHER Covid test by running around In the snow unfittingly clad -  something one shouldn't have had to do when you've demonstrably proven you have the  tests already from LHR) but worse is the Customer relationship team at American who rather than seeking to help foster a better customer relationship with its traveling public, instead bedded down behind the unhelpful behaviour and narrative of the American Airlines JFK team.To all;I ask the question I  also asked the American Airlines attendant (whose name I will not disclose for reasons of civility); What good is a credit to anyone when you have no desire to travel in next twelve months (outside of my return ticket already paid for on March 2), and when the  difficult behaviour and actions of American Airlines on which the query complaint is largely predicated has not even been looked into properly let alone redressed)?A credit  rather than a partial refund of my outbound leg, is you essentially asking the public who genuinely have no immediate abilities to traveling the next twelve months to spend more money with you for poor unresolved behaviour.To make matters more disappointing, i made it clear i was not requesting a particular figure ( just instead for AA to propose a gestural partial refund). I accepted;, however woeful, AA should receive some element of consideration for the outbound service. No less, the customer assistant at American refused to even do this.I accept all airlines have days they get things sometimes wrong, but they normally do best to put it right. If even one person sees this and can relate, resulting in choosing to use someone else other than American Airlines, then it will have been worth it.American your actions, have largely sullied the one world alliance and the IAG consolidated group of which you are a related party.I truly wish I could have awarded zero on this ratingVery disappointed in American, and I'll continue to exhaust what avenues exist for a partial refund of my outbound leg.Disappointed Customer (CJ) with the following American Airlines references  Query REF1-31145463051 CUSTTRAVEL LOCATOR REF TSZXZG"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Mr,"Scheduled for 7:39 departure, delayed until noon due to a mechanical issue. Pushed off around noon and sat on runway for 40 minutes after experiencing another mechanical issue. Flight was eventually canceled.Rebooked the following day, Savanna to Dallas then Dallas to Philadelphia. Our party of three was split into two different hotels after bing told we would be together. Could not get our luggage because they could not open the aircraft storage compartment. Told that there was a hotel shuttle. There wasn’t.Hotel was a dump in the middle of nowhere. Hotel restaurant was closed and nearest place to eat was a dive bar. Ended up purchasing a sandwich at Food Lion Supermarket.Two of my last three flights on AA were delayed multiple times and then canceled.Can you spell incompetent?I called AA customer service. Their response was they rebooked me so end of story, then hung up.AA is now on my no fly list. I will not fly them again and canceled my AA AAdvantage credit card"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Avoid American Airlines At All Cost,"We typically fly multiple times throughout any given year. I tend to avoid American Airlines because, from my experience, they usually are delayed for one reason or another. However our most recent experience was the worst. We were re-booked from United to American due to weather delays in getting out of South Bend, IN. Once at O’Hare, we were delayed THREE MORE TIMES, requiring a switch of gates due to a “mechanical” issue. This issue could’ve been minor, major or non-existent. They ended up getting another plane out of the hangar (or so we were told) - why wasn’t this done hours earlier?!!!!!   Airport personnel were less than friendly, were slow to give any updates & seemed to care less about the inconveniences myself and 100+ other passengers were experiencing. It is well worth the money to avoid American Airlines whenever traveling!!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst airline to fly,"Always rude staff, flights never on time and frequently canceled. I avoid American at all costs. I will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Stranding people for no reason,"On Thursday February 24, 2022 at approximately 4:30 pm I and others arrived in Miami from Punta Cana, when we landed at Miami International Airport we received text messages stating that our connecting flight to Boston was canceled due to ""An act of God"". By canceling this particular flight American Airlines stranded a plane full of people. Making people scramble to look for housing. All in the name of ""an act of God"". All the airlines are full of crap. It didn't start to flurry in Boston until almost 2:30am, per the cameras on my house. American Airlines left an approximate 8 hours of travel open because of what?But they aren't reimbursing anyone for hotel costs. Now I know why I prefer to drive than to deal with these money sucking airplane pirates !Crutch"
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Best true first class product offering,"American and Oneworld Alliance are top notch if you're invested in the program. I recommend deal-hunting and strategizing - use the various loyalty programs to work for you. If you can get AA premium cabins and service, they're best in class as far as US carriers.Flagship First gets you into the first-class dining lounge and everything else - Flagship Lounge and Admiral's club. Service is top notch, anything from someone hanging your coat for you, to customizing your dessert and fetching you an extra pair of slippers. Flagship Business is also excellent - same basic thing without FIrst class dining.I would rate American AAdvantage an 8 out of 10 based on quality premium offerings and strong partnerships with Alaska, Jetblue, Iberia, British Airways, and more.  If you need rock-bottom fares, you might like Delta/Sky Team Alliance because you can get elite status from discount fares in the network."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Never again.,Never had a worse experience with an airline. I can understand canceling flights due to weather yet at least tell us that. One flight got delayed while the plane was SITTING at the gate. So I had to rebook with a different airline to make it to my connection. THEN after barely making the connection you had us sit on the plane for an hour or two only to tell us that the plane was broken and we couldn’t fly. You told us you were working on a repair and kept us at the airport til 3am and kept delaying. When it finally was cancelled we were put on another flight with a connection that would get us home over 16 hours later. And you had NO options for direct. Thanks for keeping me at the airport over 16 hours with lines that were miles long. And I ended up rebooking all my return flights home through different airlines just to get home. I had a better customer service experience with Spirit Air and Delta air. Disappointed. Will never fly with you again if I can help it.Attached is a photo of just one of your customer service lines at the airport. Both Spirit and Delta had gate agents readily available for questions. With American? They were nowhere to be found. And your customer service? 3+ hours on the phone or via message? Terrible!!
Date of travel: February 2022,10,I want to cry!,Thank you American Airline for being an hour late this morning and making me miss my connecting flight.I enjoy sitting in a random airport for 8 hours waiting for another flight out.Especially missing having dinner with my grandson I only have 3 days with.I want to cry:.(
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Changing airports to avoid flying with American Airlines.,"In the past year we had nothing but delays and cancelations, Well, that wouldn't be so bad if there was some kind of customer support. Having to wait 4-6 hours for a call-back, that is not acceptable. Going through OKC rather than DFW from now on to avoid American Airlines."
Date of travel: February 2022,20,Horrible experience,"Never have I ever been so disappointed with an airline.4 cancelled flights with no good reasoning, only explanation was no pilot , no flight attendant.No type of accommodation & to top it all off the ruined all my luggage. Would NOT RECOMMEND l"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN I REPEAT DO NOT FLY AMERICAN,The airline staff has no answers for any of their passengers & appears to not know what they are doing.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Thanks For Ruining an Amazing Trip Otherwise,"The AA employees at MIA have to be the rudest group of miserable gate agents that I have ever in my life encountered.  Not just one employee--ALL that I had the displeasure of dealing with.  What a disastrous end to a lovely vacation.  We arrived for our connection timely but could not deplane because we could not get to the gate which delayed us about 20 minutes.  10 people left at MIA arriving at our connection gate 10 minutes before departure and we are rudely told that our flight was full, boarding was closed and to go  to customer service rather than assisting us on getting home.  The line at customer service was 100 people long and there was 1 flight left that evening to our destination leaving in an hour.  I understand the rules, but, this airline has lost my business indefinitely.  The irony is that I insisted with my travel partner that we fly a ""decent"" airline and pay more money for the tickets rather than flying a budget line like Spirit or Frontier.  I guess the joke was on me."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,MD,"American airlines is by far the worst airline in the industry.  Constant cancelled flights no customer service.  They really don't care about their customers.  I was stuck in Dallas for two days missed a quarter of my trip at an all inclusive.  They kept rebooking only cancel my flights. They canceled a total of 4 flights. They wouldn't offer me anything for my troubles. I had a second trip and they canceled that flight. Needless to say I will never give them my business.  I even filed a complaint and have never heard back. Be warned, stay away from this airline!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Changed purchased seat with no notice for no reason,"When I purchased my flight I intentionally purchased an aisle seat for $40 in addition to the cost of the flight. Only when checking in did I learn that American changed my seat to a window seat NOT due to a change in equipment (which is understandble), but purportedly due to operational issues (according to the woman at the gate). There was a young man (mid-20's) in my seat. There was  no apparent reason that American decided that he was entitled to the seat that I had purchased. Had I been given ample notice that I would not have an aisle seat, I would have changed flights and/or airlines."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Poor customer service,"Flew out of Cabo 2/20/22 to Chicago with an hour & half layover in Dallas. Delayed in Cabo, only 25 Min. Got to Dallas and sat on the tar mat for 40 Min waiting for a gate. Everyone on the plane was freaking out because they had connecting flights. Waited a long time for luggage then got to security which was backed up. 1 unmotivated TSA worker taking his time. Everyone RUNNING to figure out where they should go, we had to recheck our luggage , gave to some worker that was taking all the luggage and putting on a conveyor belt. Not clear where it would end up because he mumbled and was rude. Again RUNNING to gate only to be met by 2 other passengers who said plane left, and PLANE LEFT EARLY.  After they held us up they left early. So..we rebooked a 5 am flight. & Slept in the airport. We were in a nasty part of the airport ( AA sect) dirty, gross bathrooms. Mexico is cleaner. Staff was all so rude and unhelpful and unapologetic at the airport.  Not even a voucher or any compensation, well only 7 -11 was open . Left at 5 am to Chicago and luggage was not on our flight ! We stayed 5 hours in Dallas and our luggage was not on the plane. Again in Chicago , rude , unhelpful, unapologetic staff. Corporate Greed again lining their pockets and have little to no regard for their customers.  I really feel  AA knew most people would not make their connecting flights and did not want to make the effort to get their customers luggage off the plane to get it  to connecting flights, so they purposely kept us on the plane. People were running trying to get to their gates, some elderly, some unable to run, some man was against the wall trying to catch his breath, people with babies. AA had no regard for their customers. PITIFUL !!!!!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Never Again!!!,"I don't know where to begin. I paid extra for non-stop and first flight was canceled (surely wasn't weather related) to be in Miami at list by 1pm on 1st day of vacation. Placed us on another plane with connecting flight and ended up in JFK for 4 1.2 hours and did not get to Miami till 2:30am. We missed a day and a half of our vacation and had to quickly find and book a hotel because we couldn't get our rental car until the next day. The cancelling and delays was not weather related (because all other airlines were taking off) or even shortage of staffs. Apparently on the last flight to Miami, a staff mysteriously got injured on the plane before we boarded. And on top of all this hassle, you guys broke our damn luggage. Worst experience and will never fly AA again. The staff was not helpful and could careless."
Date of travel: February 2022,20,Heartless and Liars,"American Airline is the worst Airline ever!! Do not travel with them even if it’s your last choice. They are not only liars but very heartless!!!! I was traveling with my mom that just had a back surgery  mom and we had to stay at Des Moines for four hours before we could depart. We were told  because of the delayed flight we will be missing the connecting flight to Atlanta, and once we get to Chicago we will get a hotel. We got here and everyone of their employees were gone, except one who told us that we could not get a hotel because the flight was delayed due to Weather but the pilot clearly said it was because of Mechanical issues. I’m requesting this recording, because I can not believe a company would lie like this just to get out of paying for something as simple has hotel. What a shame."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Executives should be first against the wall.,"So! This is the worst airline I have ever flown with in my life. I have been traveling since 6 months of age and Hooooooly Cheese on a Cracker. American Airlines will never receive my business again or anyone I can ever mention this experience to. We got a flight from San Fran to San Juan just fine, admittedly the ride was horrible, cramped, far too close together, people were not enforcing masks. Overall it was a bad flight but well... I've come to expect garbage like this from the airline industry. But the return trip, I stepped off the plane in Charlotte, happier than I've been in years after a relaxing vacation, expecting to be transferred onto my scheduled flight home. I got to the gate and we were informed after waiting there for about 20 minutes that the flight had been cancelled. They proceeded to refer us to the customer service desk and the customer service line. The customer service desk had a line of 200 people in it and was taking roughly an hour and a half according to the people at the front of the line. The customer service line on the other hand had a ""58 minute to 1 hour and 28 minute wait"". I called that line 4 separate times over the next 3 days. Never, not a single time, was that wait below 58 minutes. So we waited in the customer service desk line, for an hour and a half. They told us the next flight was tomorrow at 3pm.We had to request food vouchers (which were $12, where the heck can you get a reasonable meal for 2 people on $12) and a hotel (which admittedly wasn't that bad of a hotel). So the next day we got to the airport at 12pm. Got through security, checking our phones for updates on the flight. We got to the gate and upon asking the person manning the gate ""Hey just to confirm, our flights still on?"" we were informed, ""Oh no, that flight was cancelled, but if you got to the customer service desk you might be able to get onto the 6 O'clock flight, but you better hurry, if you don't get on that your checked bag will be going on that flight."" So we turn around to see the line for the customer service desk roughly the same size as it was the prior day about an hour and a half. I call the line again, it was an hour and a half to two hours. We get to the end of the customer service line and are told, the 6 O'clock flight is all full, we can reschedule you for 2 days from now though."" It was currently Saturday, I was intending on having a whole weekend to get back into the swing of things at home. But instead, I was being offered to return home from the diety-forsaken state of North Carolina on Monday. I began cursing the name of American Airlines with every irreverent bone in my body, but my hellish adventure was not complete.Instead I had to get my bag off of a flight leaving to San Fran without me. So I proceeded to wait in Baggage Claim for 6 hours while they 'found my bag'. I went through the baggage assistance line about 8 times and got to know the people there pretty well. They proceeded to tell me that not only does American Airlines deliberately keep themselves understaffed so they don't have to actually deal with customer complaints by weeding out those awful customers who have other stuff to do besides waste their lives dealing with this diety-forsaken company, not only do they have a policy of telling customers that their bag will be there at the minimum wait time possible, they also dont have enough people to find your bag. This company is garbage and executives for it should be tried for treason. I finally just took a different airline to get home. Turns out the rescheduled flight was cancelled too."
Date of travel: February 2022,50,excellent service,Excellent service. All the staff was very attentive. Great quality food and wine list. Special thanks to Monica!
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Horrible,"Garbage. Several customers went on the wrong flight and their luggage got lost, and because of that our flight was delayed by almost an hour."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Need new management,"Your service is appalling. The little airplane you had me on flew in 30 min late. They said they had to replace a part or carry out maintenance. They kept pushing the flight time back - every 15 min was another 15 min delay. No options on how to get to our location, no help in telling us what was going on. The staff was uninformed and rude, unhelpful and really didn't care at all whether we got to our destination or not. Except to yell at the customers who were becoming frustrated. I had to take a $450 taxi home. The plane is still sitting there. You owe me $450."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst flying experience I have EVER had,"AA are the most uncaring, rude and incompetent airline I have ever flown with. Between lost baggage complete rudeness at every opportunity and blaming everyone else for there faults! We had an overnight flight from Philadelphia to Ireland and my 15 month old son had treatment that morning. We had paid extra to sit together as a family of 3 as it can be tough keeping a baby occupied on a flight. They doubled booked our seat and I was told by the air hostess I had to move 10 rows down the plane. When I explained my situation and how it was there fault I was told that it’s not there problem that the flight was full!!! When I told them it wasn’t my fault they dismissed me and said tough. Then to loose our luggage as well as a lot of other peoples was the icing on the cake! From what I seen and the way I seen them talking to other people before and after the flight rudeness must be one of the key skills they look for in employees! Never again"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Never again!!!,"Our flight was scheduled to leave Aruba at 3:40 pm - check in at the airport at Aruba was scheduled by departure time. We arrived at 12 pm and waited in several long lines for bag check and customs in Aruba. Half way through the customs line- now around 2 pm I received an email from American stating that our flight had been delayed until 6 pm. Our connecting flight in Miami to Dallas was scheduled at 7 pm meaning we would definitely miss the connection. American rebooked us- from Aruba to Miami still but now we were not arriving in Miami until 10 pm and our connection was in FORT LAUDERDALE?! Waited in 3 hours worth of lines to rebook a connecting flight (next day) and were told when we arrived in Miami they would make arrangements for hotel accommodations. Well, we finally left Aruba at 9 pm- arrived in Miami at midnight and there were ZERO hotel rooms available in a 100 mile radius of the airport (we found out after waiting in another 3 hour line). Spent the night in the airport (with 3 small children) and all we were given was a $12 per person meal voucher and a thin blanket and paper pillow. Not even a “sorry”. I will NEVER fly American Airlines again - oh and in the last 3 hour line we waited in an American employee pushed a random lady in a wheelchair behind us and said well I can’t wait with her so you can get her right?! Excuse me???!!! I am so done with American."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,HAZZARD TO PERSONS FLYING,The staff was super friendly and helpful. pilot flew fantastic. American airlines company changed my erlier flight from a strait shot to japan at 1155 to a flight to charrlett then texas then japan made no freakin sense they also failed to tell me my flight changed. I was already checked out of my hotel and waited at airport 10 hours. The airport was slow at getting Bags off and on the plane making us late at next stop. The air vents on the plane were so disgustingly dirty and full of lint it is a SERIOUS FIRE HAZZARD 🔥!!!!!!!! American Airlines you need to evaluate the cleanliness and safety of your planes. As a fire inspector my self I have recommended you get a health and fire safety inspection.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Astounding incompetence,"I booked a flight from DC to Miami using on debit card, but a few days later I needed to cancel the flight and was told that everything was canceled successfully and that I would receive a credit for the cost of that flight. I never received email confirmation. Fast forward 10 days and suddenly they have charged me again for that flight...only they used a DIFFERENT card than the one I used to book the flight. How they got it, I do not know and can only assume it was due to the fact that I have used this card on Expedia. Now I have been on hold for well over an hour trying to get them to resolve this. Its bad enough that they messed up and did not send the credit, but it is absolutely shameful that they charged an account that I did not even have on file! That seems borderline criminal, particularly given that I have important charges coming out of that account and cannot have it short. I will NEVER use this incompetent airline ever again. Avoid them like the plague."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Awful and irresponsible,"American Airlines continues to disappoint, as does the Miami airport. Flight from Barbados arrived 100% on time, and was even acknowledged by the gate clerk who rebooked me on standby the next morning. Connection left a number of us stranded when the Miami airport was understaffed and got our luggage to us late for transfer, and couldn’t get us through the line in time. I’m sleeping in the airport tonight as AA is taking no responsibility for not holding the plane and leaving us all behind. I’ve been flying for 5 decades and this may be the most disgraceful and incompetent handling of a trip I’ve ever seen. SHAME!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Customer Service Phone Line,"I called the Customer Service line at  ( 1-850-989-0007 ), I requested for an e-ticket for a past reservation. He stated to go online and that he couldn't assist me. I then told him that I had already visit the website and was only able to get a receipt of the reservation, and that I needed the e-ticket. He then says that I can't get an e-ticket and then hangs up. I called back and he answers again, so this time I asked him for his name and he says his name is Sam..and then I told him that whoever I spoke to had rudely hung up without properly addressing how or why I am unable to get an e-ticket. He then tries to blame the phone connectivity and proceeds with a nicer tone because he realized I had called back. He then says that I can't get an old e-ticket from an old flight. American Airlines needs to educate and train their employees in how to professionally answer questions and request. I usually do not take the time to write review, but I find this experience disappointing."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Got the run around,"Due to Covid 19, I had to cancel trip for my wife and I to visit my daughter and son-in-law at Ft. Bragg. They are both in the Army. The flight was originally booked through Expedia. I tried to rebook the trip and was told by Expedia I had to contact American Airlines. After many hours on the phone on 3 separate days, and lots of emails, AA said that they had severed their relationship with Expedia and I had to talk to Expedia about rebooking. In the meantime, my daughter and husband were transferred to Europe. Neither AA or Expedia will either give me travel credit for the now useless tickets or give a refund. I am out $900."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,THIS AIRLINE IS UNRELIABLE IN REGARDS TO ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES.,"THIS AIRLINE DOES NOT PUT PASSENGERS FIRST.  FLIGHT ATTENDANTS NOT HELPFUL.  ABANDONED PASSENGERS AT THE AIRPORT.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!  Had an AA flight out of Tampa to Charlotte, NC which was 20 minutes late to take off.  Flight landed with only 15 min to get to a connecting flight.  But after running to the gate for the connecting flight, I found out that the Charlotte to Roanoke flight left 10 minutes EARLY!   There were 10 people on the Tampa flight that got abandoned at the airport.  Since the Roanoke flight was a small plane of about 50 seats, it meant they left a fifth of their passengers in the airport.  There was only one customer service agent at the Charlotte airport to help all of these people so never even talked to the agent.  Phone was on terminal hold.  So, given that I am <25 yo and can't rent a car, I ended up UBERing to Virginia.  $$$$"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Stuck on Runway,"We were stuck on the runway with the heat blasting for over 45 minutes. We were then told that many people on the plane would not make their connecting flights. Instead of assisting us, we were told to call American Airlines customer support. We tried to do this and there was over a 2 hour wait for customer support. There’s a good chance we’ll miss our vacation/cruise because the boat leaves before we’ll be able to arrive."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,AMERICAN AIRLINES HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,"My flight was on February 18th at 3:20pm. We got to the airport at 12:30pm so we could get through TSA, eat and not have to rush. 1pm comes along and we get a notification that our flight was delayed until 4pm. Then 3pm comes and they cancel the flight and tell everyone to go to the rebooking desk. There was a line of about 80-100 people and only 3 people working at the desk. 4:30 comes 1 employee leaves, 6:20 comes another employee leaves, leaving just 1 employee to take care of everyone, we tried getting managers and supervisors, the employee himself even asked his manager for help and the manager refused. NO ONE WAS HELPING!!!! I waited on the rebooking like from 3:15pm- 8:51pm for them to tell me they couldn’t do anything for me, the only flight available was for the next day at 5:30pm. They would not give us a hotel for the night or a voucher for compensation. We STOOD on a line for 5 and a half hours for the people at the desk to be NO HELP! I am shocked at the experience that I had. I will 100% never fly with American Airlines every again and would never recommend  it to anyone ever! I understand their is certain things out of anyone’s control, but how a company responds in times like this is what counts."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Disgraceful,"I just want to share that i am so disappointed in American Airlines.  I booked a nonstop flight from PHL to Ashville NC.  My 7 friends and I puroosely paid more and travelled at not the most ideal time but it was worth it to have a nonstop flight.AA arbitrarily changed our flight to a stop over in Charlotte.  We have now waited 4 hours to take the last 20 mins of our flight.  There was no offer to refund money or provide even points for the inconvenience.  You are not the only airline available and guess what, we all figured out how to survive without traveling at all.  This kind of customer service will kill your business.  It will be well deserved failure.Here is the response that I got to my Chat message.  More evidence of completely unsatisfactory customer service.  All team members are currently helping other customers. The wait time is less than 45 minutes. Would you like to wait for a team member?"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,American Airlines has pathetic non-existent customer service. NEVER AGAIN!!!,"We checked our bags. Upon arrival at our destination, bags were not there. They were left behind when we connected flights in Charlotte. Baggage guy says he will put a rush ticket on it, bags will arrive the following morning when next flight from Charlotte comes in. No word from anyone. After repeated calls for 2 days trying to find out why they are not sending our bags, we started visiting the airport in person because no one answers the phone, voicemail boxes are full, no urgency or sense of care from staff. In person staff just says they don't know why Charlotte isn't sending them. I push them to do, you know, something,  anything...... they try calling and can't get anyone in Charlotte to answer. Insanity..... I give up on going to airport again, spend 2 hours on hold (paying international rates mind you) someone actually answers. He tells me ""I see notes here, they're working on it"" and is ready to blow me off. I tell him there is a plane leaving Charlotte in an hour, please ask someone to put our bags on thst plane. After more holding he comes back to say it will be. After 5 days of our 8 day vacation, hours of wasted time thst should have been spent relaxing and enjoying ourselves ruined by this crappy airline. Then, when I get home there's a message on my voicemail thst was left by someone in Charlotte telling me if I don't come claim my bag in 5 days they are sending it to a warehouse in Dallas. What?!?! Why would ypu fo thst when the tag says it's supposed to ho to PLS and other staff members are trying to get you to send it there. My job affords me little time off, this was supposed to be a dream vacation  but was a nightmare due to AA terrible ""service"". They made it clear at every step thst no one cared about our situation and demonstrated they are completely inept and incapable of performing even the most basic functions. Absolute incompetence. AA you will never see another dime from me."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Terrible customer service,"Showed up for a 6am flight to Chicago to be told that my flight has changed and is now 5 hours longer.  When I asked why my app didn't notify me I was told ""Sir I don't control the app"" very rude customer service.when arriving at my gate I see the flight to Chicago had just left.  Would not recommend this airline."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Poor customer service,The girl at the terminal threw my luggage onto the belt with total disregard. She could have easily just placed the baggage on the belt but I guess since it was not hers she decided to throw it around and not handle it with any care at all.She reminded me of somebody who really did not like her job.AA flight 3166
Date of travel: January 2022,10,American Airlines canceling flight and rebooking on earlier flight,"American Airlines is the worst. I travel frequently and have never had a smooth experience with AA. During my most recent experience, AA cancelled my flight 4 hours before flying and rebooked my on a flight scheduled for 2 hours earlier. Why is that a good idea?! I managed to catch the flight but my coworker could not and had a nightmare getting another option. AA's cancelation/rebooking process makes no sense. Miles or no miles, I recommend Delta."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst and most Incompetent Customer Service,"They booked wrong dates speaking with reservations, called them and prices increased in the meantime so I had to pay difference, paid the difference and they double charged me for everything as I paid initially for the wrong date error they made and when called backthey charged everything again.  And this was a supervisor I was speaking with, WOW, right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing, dumb and dumber at its finest!!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,American Airlines negligent service,"American Airlines outgoing message says if your traveling within 3  your callHas priority.  I was traveling in less than 24 hours and it took American 2 hours to callMe back. They Verifly app Covid test results scanner was not working, so I could not check in. Their app would not even provide me with the terminal number.  I was taking a taxi to the airport and could not even find out which terminal without waiting for two hours.  American does not care. ButNow you know."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Don't fly American,"I was at the counter 65 minutes before flight time and the agent refused to check my luggage. He sent me to the customer service desk, but by the time I got to the front of that line it was too late to make my flight...which was the last flight of the day."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Don't waste money on 1st class,"My first advice is don't fly American, but if you have to don't waste your money on 1st class. On this early morning flight from Atlanta to Phoenix we were in our seats for an hour before any beverage was offered. The seat was larger than coach but was not as comfortable as a coach seat. The breakfast entree was a cold turkey sandwich. Oh, and the plane's wifi wasn't working."
Date of travel: February 2022,40,Overall good.,The new expanded overhead luggage bins make a lot of sense.  Seats are now ok and reasonably comfortable but could tilt back more. Food ....not great.
Date of travel: February 2022,30,Wheelchair use,Twice in February I used wheelchair service in DFW.  Twice I was left sitting and told to wait.  I waited until I needed to find a restroom then had to continue to the gate on my own.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,No Refund Despite Travel Warning from Government,"I booked a flight to Mexico City, and our group had to cancel due to a level 4 travel warning from the US government. American Airlines won’t even give a flight voucher, so I essentially threw hundreds of dollars down the drain because American won’t cooperate. Myself and my family will never support this airline again."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,New Orleans,"I booked my Trip for a weekend in New Orleans  We flew out of Fort Wayne to Charlotte  and  from there to New Orleans, once there I sat at the Bagage Claim for over an hour waiting on my Luggage. I finally went upstair to American Airlines Counter, well they could not help me, so I went back downstairs to the lost luggage counter from AA, the Rep was ver rude, told me..well your luggage stayed in Charlotte, I asked why she said she dont know, I asked when can I have it, because me Meds were in there that I need to take. She old be it be here tomorrow, I was up all night freezing because I had nothing to sleep in, went back in the morning and was able to get my luggage. The Airport is about 30 miles one way from my Hotel,  so that was an extra expense, than on our flight back from New Orleans, the Flight cam in late, left late and we missed our connected flight, the Rep at the counter was super rude, advised me that I missed my flight, I said, no your Airline was late and that's is my I missed the flight, she then try to put us on a stand by for a fully booked flight, I told her NO WAY, she than said well..there is no other flight, except to Indianapolis, which is about 90 miles from Fort Wayne, so we took that flight because my Son had to work that night, so my Husband drove  there to pick us up and back and He also had to work. More money lost....I'm going to file a complain and better be getting my money back."

Date of travel: February 2022,10,American Airlines. Worst airline ever,"Worst airlines on this planet.   Never book with this airline. They should not offer the basic economy option. If you book this and some life changing episodes occur…. Your screwed. You will eat the cost and have to rebook.  Things change in life. AA will not help you. This airline also nickel and dimes for everything.  I guess if your platinum member your good. If your a commoner like 99% of there customers your screwed.  This is the worst business policy I’ve ever seen.  This is not customer friendly at all….terrible….terrible….terrible….avoid….avoid..,avoid….."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Left stranded in a foreign country,"When it was clear that our departure airport was incorrect (Santo Domingo instead of Punta Cana), we immediately contacted American Airlines to help us change this and I was willing to pay fees to do so. They said they wouldn’t change it and wouldn’t refund it. So now we are three hours from the airport they want us to leave from in a foreign country. They should probably change their names from American Airlines to Communist Airlines. There’s nothing American about them. They also have the least amount of let room of any airline I’ve ever flown. Worst airline I’ve ever flown with."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Cancelled Flights. No Refunds.,"American cancelled flight from Fargo to Minneapolis due to cold weather despite Delta was still able to operate flights that same morning. I had to drove to Minneapolis to be able to get a flight to Dallas as American could only offer me a flight out of Fargo on Sunday (which is the day I was scheduled to return back to Fargo). I spend 2 hours and 30 minutes on hold with American trying to get rescheduled for my flight so I decided to drive to Minneapolis while on hold as that was my only option to be able to arrive in Dallas on Friday. American wont refund the FAR to MSP portion of my airfare costs for the flight that they cancelled. I contacted them and requested a refund, travel voucher or miles to make up for the cancellation and not receiving the FAR to MSP round trip portion of my airfare. They refuse to provide anything as compensation. They just state that the cancellation was due to weather conditions so they don't owe anything. I will not fly with American in the future."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst airline in the world,From start to finish these guys are clueless.  Tried to pay for an upgraded seat and the whole reservation got altered.  One example of the numerous that we encountered.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst Airline- we watched the passengers board the flight they refused to let us on,We watched the plane board the flight we were supposed to be on despite checking in an hour early. We were here an hour before our flight they gave away our seat. The manager told us we were lucky they willing to reschedule our flight for 3 hours later
Date of travel: February 2022,10,If I could give 0 stars I would,"Absolutely the worst airline. Take your chances on ANY other airline. They can’t get staff to put luggage on a plane or get staff to fly it so they cancel your flight after sitting there for 3 hours, only to book you into a hotel that you get to and they can’t accommodate because they’re booked up. 2 flights screwed up, over $200 in Uber and taxi bills to leave and get back to the airport, 4 TIMES due to their incompetence. Never again."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst airline ever,"Extremely rude employees (especially at DFW), won’t allow families with infants to board early even though that is typically considered “needing extra time” to board. Employees were so rude, I was fuming and people in the line overhearing what was going on were upset as well. Absolutely never flying American ever again."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Tried to strand us in Florida,"Do not ever use trust this airline. We booked a round trip 3 months in advance and everything was on track. We boarded our departure flight and we could see our return  flights in the app. The night before we were about to go home I went to check in on the app to find that it said I had zero reservations. I instantly called them to be told 2 months ago it had changed it to a 1 way trip. I never did that (why would I when I was going on vacation??). I told them that and asked if that happened, why didn't I get a notification? Why did it show my return flights 3 days before when I flew out? The agent also told me that my confirmation emails, ""didn't mean anything, only what's in the app counts."" He did not acknowledge that I could see my return flights the same day I departed in the app. After being told over and over by the rude agent that I must have changed it to a one way, I finally asked if I could speak to someone else. I was then told it was going to be a 30-35 minute wait and was put on hold before I could even object. I was then on hold for OVER AN HOUR having a panic attack and feeling sick to my stomach. They finally got back on and said an agent who worked there messed up and changed our booking and that the manager put us back on our appropriate flights and they were sorry for the inconvenience. While we were able to get on our flight back home the next day, this experience was one I will never forget. We will always look back on our great vacation that should have ended on a high note, but ended with out last night being the most stressful and panic inducing. Also, can't figure out  how an agent ""accidentally"" changed our flight from a round trip to a one way? And why weren't we notified? Why was I on hold for over an hour to figure this out? Was this a scam to get us to re-purchase a $500 one way tickets back home? Why are agents going into trips and randomly altering them from round trip to one way? None of it makes sense. Bottom line: do not trust this airline. Go with United or JetBlue even if it costs more."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Careless and Inconsiderate!!,"My flight was originally scheduled for Sunday Feb 6th to be in Trinidad with my siblings for my late father's birthday on Feb 8th. Three hours before I was supposed to arrive at the airport, I received a text that my flight was CANCELLED. No explanation or reasoning. About 20 minutes later I receive another text with a link to reschedule. There was NO option other than to wait TWO days and leave on the 8th instead. With my plans out the window, I settled and made it work, thinking I'd still get there at a decent time before the sun set to visit my father's grave. Then for BOTH of my flights to end up ""running behind"" and not getting to Trinidad until late evening. Never again will I make the mistake of flying with American Airlines."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,"Missing the event of a lifetime, thanks American Airlines","Special moments may only last a moment, but their impact lasts a lifetime. The birth of a child, a special graduation, or the marriage of your first born child spark a host of emotions and imprint beautiful memories for us to replay over and over. It was this that fueled my excitement as we boarded the shuttle at the Asheville Airport that warm Friday in February. I had shopped for just the right dress, pondered over the perfect gift to give my son and his beautiful soon-to-be bride. My first born child was reaching a milestone in his life that a mother cherishes. Oh and I did. Pride, love, excitement, all welled up in me as I anticipated celebrating this moment with my family. Our excitement landed us at the airport an hour and forty-five minutes before our scheduled flight. At flight check-in, the attendant told us that our flight was delayed but not to worry, we have plenty of time to make our connecting flight. We got through the security check points and settled into our chairs after checking in at the gate. We would have to wait as the attendant at the gate also shared that flight 5085 was delayed. Valentines Day weekend had everyone it seems feeling love in the air! “You should be fine to make your connecting flight as there are several delays in the system,” the flight check-in desk said. As the time ticked by and the window to catch our connecting flight from Charlotte to Las Vegas shrank, we asked again. Explaining to the attendant how very important it was for us to make this flight. “You’re not going to make that connector flight,” the gate agent said. “But not to worry, there are two flights behind that one going to Las Vegas and with these delays in the system, you're a “shoe in” to get one the next one. Just like happened here, others will miss their flights and seats will be open,” she said. “You are the first three on the standby list,” she said. “You’ll be fine.” We were not fine. We arrived at Charlotte at 3 p.m. and got to Gate C11 at 3:07 p.m. Our original flight to Las Vegas was scheduled to leave at 2:57 p.m. and when we got to the board at that gate, the board said the flight had left at 3:05 p.m. At that time I thought to myself, I wonder why they didn’t offer to hold the plane? Did they call the gate attendant here alerting them that three very excited passengers were delayed (at no fault of their own) and can make that flight if you hold it. Two minutes, And a small gesture of customer care. We, however, were not dismayed too much at this point as the agent had told us, “You’re a shoe-in for the next flight to Las Vegas. You’re the first three on the list.” The first flight came and went and we were not included. However, we heard the gate agent explain that they had oversold/overbooked the flight and asked if anyone were willing to give up their seat for a $600 voucher. There were 13 people on the standby list and we were numbers 1, 2, and 3. We waited for the second flight (having to go to a second gate) and again, we were the first on the list of about 17 on the standby list. Again, American had overbooked/oversold this flight as well (wonder what the purpose is of overselling every flight?) and asked if anyone were willing to give up their seat. In the end, they allowed standby passenger number 14 to board the flight despite the fact that we were a “shoe-in” at numbers 1,2, and 3. At that point there are no more flights available. And they actually asked us if we wanted to be on standby for the flight in the morning. I asked, “you mean the flight that you oversell, overbook?” “Spend the night in the airport?” No thank you, Having to make the call to my son was one of the most difficult things that I have had to do. Your actions as a company have had such a negative ripple effect across so many people all for the reason of getting as much money you can for every flight—overselling, misleading people telling them that there are delays all over the systems and you are a shoe-in. Unfortunately the story doesn’t end there. We went down to baggage claim. Miss Brittany Lloyd told us that one of our bags was on the plane to Las Vegas but the other two were here and it would be a minimum of 45 minutes to locate them and get them to baggage claim. We waited. We shared our situation with her. She blamed the ticket handlers and was not the lease bit concerned about our dilemma. (Mind you the sign above the door reads, “Customer Assistance Baggage”. There was no assistance. We requested to file a lost baggage claim. Ms. Lloyd said we have to call a number, “We don’t do that.” So my daughter called and stayed on hold for 25 minutes before being told that the employees at the “Customer Assistance Baggage” department need to do the baggage claim. She actually was able to get assistance from a young gentlemen working which I believe only happened because Ms. Lloyd wasn’t in the area. We waited 2 and half hours with no help or updates from the “Customer Assistance Baggage” staff. We asked Ms. Lloyd at the 2.5 hour mark how is it that she is able to determine where the bags are? Is that system reliable because is appears our bags are not here. She said that she is able to scan the the bag information. Then she blamed the system for not telling her the right thing. At no time during the 2.5 hours did Ms. Lloyd make any effort to check the status of our luggage until we had to go back and ask. She then informed us that all three of our bags were in Las Vegas. We asked to make a lost baggage claim and she told us we had to call. When we informed her that her corporate office instructed us that she, her department was responsible, she laughed and said, “They don’t know what they are doing. We can’t do that here, it’s their job.” I was left wondering what exactly is Ms. Lloyd paid to do? When we told her that her associate had filed the first claim she conceded to “update” the claim to add the other bags. I suppose that was easier work than to do a claim from scratch. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced a simultaneous convergence of anger and sadness but it’s not exactly the emotion one would want to elicit in their customer. I have never had such a debasing, incompetent, dishonest, and completely unprofessional experience with a company. This is was a second chance for your company to prove what your public relations company claims about American Airlines. The last time we flew with your company, they cancelled our flight from Charlotte to Asheville and told us, “There is nothing we can do, you’re on your own.” We were hoping you would redeem your reputation that your employees and your policies built. Your systems are broken, your customer service training is nonexistent and your policies are driving your brand—I don’t believe it’s the direction you intended."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Don't use American Airlines,Canceled our flight after 10 hrs of having us wait and refused to pay for our family to go on a different airline so we could be home on time. I lost income because of them
Date of travel: February 2022,10,The Absolute Worst,"If I could give this company 0 stars I absolutely would. Aside from one individual I talked with on the phone after being on hold for almost four hours after being booted from our flight just eight hours before we were supposed to leave, the entire experience has been complete garbage. Phone staff was unpleasant, unhelpful, and generally uncaring. Nobody could give me a straight answer about why we were booted off our flight. We were given three different answers starting with ""well the flight was overbooked and that's all the information we can give you."" After the one kind gentleman helped us get back on the flight and explore our other options, within ten minutes we were rebooted from our flight and were placed on a flight that would get us to our destination no less than 48 hours after we were supposed to have landed. Staff at this point couldn't even tell us if we cancelled our flight if we could receive a refund and was once again generally unhelpful in all regards, both in answering questions and in providing answers. This is easily the worst airline company on the planet and I hope for everyones sake that they never need to fly with this company."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Check in denied by American airlines staff due to their unawareness and obstinacy!,"Terrible experience!!!! I had booked with Etihad on a multi city trip and the return leg was from San Francisco to Abu Dhabi through New York. The San Francisco to New York flight was through their  partner airline,  American Airlines and the incompetent and uninformed check in staff of AS did not let me board saying that I needed a 6 hour rapid PCR in addition to the 48hr PCR that I had done ,despite it being clearly known on the AA website and the document that only travellers from a red listed country needed an additional rapid PCR. The US was a green listed country on the UAE website  on the day of my travel 11 February 2022. The obstinate lady at check in  refused to acknowledge the fact that I am travelling from the US I don't need a additional  hour rapid PCR test apart from the 48 hour test and denied me boarding and threw my plans in awry .To top it all Etihad refuses to reimburse my ticket fare despite the goof  up of their partner airline. Bottom line: Avoid American airlines and Etihad like the plague"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst airline EVER,They canceled my flights at 2am the day of a 5 flight and then booked me another two flights which also canceled. Once finally getting the flights correct. They messed up my return flights leaving me waiting for over 24hrs for a call back number and claimed I could not get a refund for my multi thousand dollar flight until after it’s finished. Terrible customer service. Successfully ruined 2 days of a family vacation. You are NOT why we fly. You are why we cry. They do what they do best. Ruin your vacation and every flight.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,LUGGAGE LOST FOREVER - I WANT MY LUGGAGE OR MY MONEY,"Generally speaking I'm a happy customer.  However on my last trip, Dec 27, 2021 America Airlines lost my luggage.  I know shish kabobs happen, and while I never thought that would happen to me, it did.  Yes I'm sad, but that's not why I'm mad.  American Airlines has been 100% USELESS in helping me with my luggage that they LOST.  I last saw my bag when our flight from Cabo arrived at Dallas and I picked up our bags from customs to re-check to Dulles.  We had 4 pieces of luggage.  We put all 4 pieces of luggage on the conveyor belt and upon our delayed arrival into Dulles, 2 bags arrived.  1 came the next day, and 1 has not shown up yet.  The reason I'm so angry is that the customer service for American Airlines has been HORRIBLE.  They give you the complete run around.  You’re on hold for hours, then disconnected.  I filed a claim and they assign you a person who you cannot reach.  They do not call you back and they never answer the phone.  I’m so disappointed, and mad.  Yes I want my bag, but since American Airlines, lost it, honor my claim and send me my money. Acknowledge me.  I’m a human being.  Instead they just keep you in a dark state of not knowing what is going on.  I didn’t have a problem with my flight, but this will make me NEVER fly the airline again and tell my networks to stay away.  I WANT MY BAG or MY MONEY.  All my clothes and things special to me are gone.  I trusted the airline and they failed me."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,American Airlines canceled my flight and kept my money; thieves,"American Airlines canceled my flight on October 15, 2020 due to COVID and since I am choosing not to travel they are choosing to keep my money for a service they denied and I never received. Their Policy states that if American Airlines cancels a flight they will grant a refund; but they are NOT standing by that statement. They are 100% keeping my money"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Don't do It,"Absolutely the worst airline ever!!  Use anyone except American Airlines!!  Pay extra for any other airline!!  Last two times I've used them, my flight has been canceled, or delayed by 3 or more hours!!  Absolutely cannot make any plans using them!!  I promise you after today, I will never purchase a ticket from this airline!!  No reason for the delay, no weather pending, or anything like that.  Last time I was told they could not staff the flight!!  What does that say about this company, I know, garbage management!!  If I performed this badly, I would not have a job!!  Drive yourself, you will get where you are going faster!!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,The worst,American Airlines left us stranded at the Palm Springs airport. Cancelled flight after flight and would not help us in any way such as a voucher for a hotel. With no prospect of reaching our destination we in desperation rented a car and drove to Gulfport. The worst experience of our lives and we are still exhausted from the ordeal.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Pay for another airline that cares about its customers,"This is the first bad review I have ever written in my life. Absolute disaster trip. Due to unforeseen circumstances, there was a flight delay (it happens, I understand) however AA never even got me to to me destination, causing me to miss an important wedding, then spending the next 3 days in various cities and airports just trying to get home and having to spend way more money than I had anticipated on food and necessities. I am an understanding person but the way they dealt with things afterwards is what pissed me off. THEY OFFERED ME A $12 FOOD VOUCHER. After the long painful process of trying to talk to customer service, they ended up only giving me HALF of my ticket price refunded in flight credit then told me that I should be thankful for this generosity. The only good thing about this experience was that the seats were comfy and the in flight staff were kind."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,The worst worst,Absolutely the worst airline I have ever Flown on...funny thing is there is no accountability or customer service anymore....every employee is a zombie and just doesn't give a kaka about customer service...how many times can u express the masks...no kaka we already know
Date of travel: February 2022,10,"They cost us lots of money, and we never made it to our destination for our anniversary.","Right before time to board the plane they cancelled the flight. We had to reschedule for 24 hours later. We get to the airport again delayed waiting to try to find an attendant. Finally get on the plane ready to leave and mechanical issues, couldn’t even switch planes because of the pilot backing out. The next flight we would’ve arrived another 2 days later already losing 2 days. I will never fly American Airlines, we are waiting to see if they will even refund us anything, or even credit us. Unless you want to lose out on money and a vacation I would never recommend American Airlines."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Horrible experience Never fly AA,"Horrible experience! They kept us for three days at the airport delaying, canceling at the very last moment, taking to the hotel and next day doing the same thing again. Second day the even boarded us on the plane, to de board us after few minutes and canceling the flight. Stuff rude and aggressive! My husband mask wend little down during de board moment and the flight attendant screamed at him, then she shouted to pilot ""He doesn't have a mask!!"" when he had. We were stressed enough and following all rules to get out of there safe and quick. We finally spend another thousand of dollars and bought new ticket with Frontier and got home safe and sound. Btw AA kept lying to us that there is a snow storm as a reason for cancellation, when other airlines were flying with no problems. Never ever fly with AA! Horrible line horrible people!!!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Horrid Experience - definitely a “bitterness of poor quality” experience,"Horrid experience and customer service.  We arrived at dfw and identified our next departure gate.  The gate changed and we headed to the new gate.  We arrived 15-20 minutes before departure and were told by the “peach” of an attendant that the plane had closed and would leave without us.  We pointed out that we were ticked passengers who had checked in. She was adamant that it didn’t matter. She typed a few things on the keyboard and said she was heading down the ramp to check for us. I thought, while she was gone, to snap a picture of the time lock.  At that point it was 14 minutes till… we had already tried to argue our position with the attendant and she had been gone down the ramp for a while.  We pointed this out upon her return and asked to speak to a supervisor.  She srated she was the supervisor  and wasn’t calling anyone. She also threatened to call airport se Uruguayan when I attempted to photograph her badge name/ number when she refused to give it to me.  I told her to go ahead and call and insisted she call a supervisor. A man showed up a few minutes later beginning to tout the company line about our tardiness. When he was shown proof that we were at the gate, he started talking other policy.  Apparently the flight had been oversold and when the non-seated patrons were at the gate before us, they reassigned our seats! No apology. We demanded, we’re not offered, another flight which wasn’t until the next day- routing through Phoenix and departing at 6am.  (We found out through the aa site that a direct 1040 from dfw was available just not offered). We asked for our bags and were told they would be at the carousel just outside the gate because the were then sitting on the tarmac We waited an hour at baggage claim and then went to talk to an attendant there.  She informed us our bags were routed to Phoenix! A request to have them sent to baggage claim was never initiated.  We texted the supervisor who we had talked with at the fate who assured us he was “on it”.  Another hour went by and he texted to let us know that our bags had made the international flight to Mazatlan without us! He said he would make sure that they were “held” at baggage claim for us and did text to let us know the bags had arrived safely. This person did give his name. Alexis Quiones.  And he did tell the gate attendant to give hers: Arely Gonzales. Horrid example of integrity, work ethic and customer service. No “wow” experience coming from these two   I started attempting to contact aa by phone when  we had problems at departure.  I found a way to send email and a customer service number    I did both.  The customer service email sent an autoreply that said they’d get back to us in 7-10 days.  The phone number gave a 45 min to 1:45 min wait… we were waiting on bags so I kept it on speaker.  3 hours and 14 minutes later a reservation agent took the call saying there was no way to get a hold of customer care other than the email… the 800 customer service number was for reservations only.  She was kind and understanding but adamant that there was NOTHiNG she could do to helpSo American Airlines left us in DfW for 24 hours : no apology, no hotel, no toothbrush.  Do yourself a favor and find another carrier.  Even if it’s a few dollars more, it’s cheaper than this experience.  “The bitterness of poor quality stays longer than satisfaction of price.”  If these people had been honest with us and let us know, from the start, that the flight was oversold, we would still have been upset but more understanding of the situation.  Instead, they chose to blame and gaslight until the truths came out.  And all in the name of what? Saving money on a hotel room and a tooth brush?"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,American Airlines makes flight credit impossible to use,"For weeks I tried to use $300 credit I got when I cancelled my flight from Chicago to Medellin in 2020 towards another trip to Medellin. American Airlines manipulating prices on flights and flights available to apply credit for in a way which makes using credits completely pointless. I am not sure if this legal or not but this is definitely unethical business practices. They do everything to steal our credits. Shame on you, American Airlines management. I stopped trying to use credits and I booked flight with another airline. I paid less than I would pay for American airline flight with credits applied. I hope American Airlines choke on $300 I lost."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,not the best,Calling AA for customer service is the WORST! can they afford to outsource this so they can have more staff to handle calls? waiting on hold a few times longer than 4 hours.

Date of travel: February 2022,10,Two broken planes!,"After a 2 hr delay due to mechanical issues we were put on another broken plane.  Left the gate and had to return to the gate.  Again,  no consequences or compensation for passengers, just more empty apologies."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Delayed.   AA is Always Delayed!,"Can't remember the last time an AA flight was on time.  NOT weather related,  that i would understand.

Do they in any way make it up to their paying customers?  Nope.  Empty apologies."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Flight Attendant,"I am a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. ARMY vacationing with my wife of 10 years in which we chose American Airlines as part of a luxury travel in route to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. In seats upon departing to fly at approximately 12:55pm my wife proceeded to call our three children at home for the first time being away from us for a vacation. A 9 year old boy, 4 year old boy and a 1 year old boy is what we share. Tony greeted my wife loud, aggressive and rude telling her to get off the phone now and reached over my shoulder touching her shoulder with his hand and I told him do not touch my wife. He proceeded to be hostile telling her I’m not going to tell you no more times get off that phone now or you will get off this flight. Feeling vulnerable and helpless and not wanting to ruin our vacation I was not able to utter a word in securing my wife. My wife was forced to comply with his demands feeling powerless to a man using his power to demean and publicly humiliate and embarrass someone for others to understand who is in charge. I am greatly dissatisfied with this occurrence. This was the worst flight of our lives and I plan to take court action against not only himself but the airline as well for no staff being bold enough to stand up to this man in his time of disrespect and terrible service."

Date of travel: February 2022,10,No other business in the world would be allowed to operate this way,"Flew with AA for a birthday trip to Florida. Flight to Florida was simple enough, however the return has been beyond a nightmare. Attempted to check into our return flight online 24 hrs in advance. AA had canceled our reservation with no warning or explanation but did offer us the option to purchase tickets to the flight we'd already paid to be on. What a joke!!! We joined the chat queue and callback queue. Waited for 8.5 hours for a callback. After speaking with a rep, she stated she would be transferring us to appropriate department and then hung up on us. We rejoined the callback queue and waited another 7 hours (it's now 6AM on the day we're meant to fly out). They tell us our tickets are all good and we're on! So we go to the airport and of course our tickets cannot be found at the kiosk or by the first AA rep. We were able to finally get checked in DESPITE American Airlines best efforts. I implore anyone considering flying AA to choose any other airline. I truly wish the federal government had let AA go bankrupt so no one would have to deal with this absolute nightmare we had to endure during a birthday trip."

Basically, it appears that any bad weather can bring their whole system crumbling down at this point.We waited 5 hours in line to get a flight two days later and two $12 food vouchers good only at the airport. To add to the fun, our luggage DID get on a flight and is waiting in Raleigh even as we are here in Miami.Have racked up $600 paying for hotels, Uber and food and apparently my only hope is to send a certified letter when I get home to request compensation. Their rep stressed the certified letter so I could prove they got it. That's trust in your own company, eh?One final insult... I was downgraded from paid first to get me on a flight and then had to pay $100 to actually choose my seats. I am not making this up."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Terrible customer service - will do anything I can to never travel with American Airlines again.,"American Airlines has been the most disappointing airline I’ve ever flown (this isn’t the first time, but it’s the first time it’s been bad enough to write a review). It started out with a last minute canceled flight on Sunday (2/6/22) where they thought it would be okay to re-book the flight on TUESDAY (2 days later). Unacceptable. After working with our travel agent and spending 3+ hours standing in line with American Airlines we were finally able to get a flight to the US routed to Boston with an overnight layover to CVG. Next morning we are standing in line at 2am (an hour before they open). None-the-less, their disorganization has us standing at the front of line until 4am when they finally are able to service us. At this point we are missing work etc. they have many seats open on a flight which would be ideal and their phone customer service representative has assured us it will not be an issue. Still, they cannot figure out in-person how to correct our flight which leads to another long delay with incompetent staff. We have now been traveling for over 24 hours and are extremely exhausted. Moving forward I will pay triple to fly any other airline with competent staff and consideration for their customers. I’ve never experienced service like this from another company or airline. Their inability to offer assistance and even understand that they have canceled a flight at this point is ridiculous."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Fly JetBlue save yourself the pain! Don't do it!,"After a huge group of us (50) went to Vegas and had an absolute  blast American Airlines couldn't stand it they had to screw it up!

But half were connecting  in Tampa... no snow there.  An entire day and close to 1000$ later were home. Another night in Vegas at my expense, another night of dining and an upgrade charge on a flight I paid for back In January. Oh and let's not forget my 6 hr hold time on the phone from 6 am to noon... before they prompted me a call back at 8:45 pm... HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  One excuse after another from weather   To shortstaff , to we don't have a pilot. A group of our friends spent the night in the airport in vegas . And another group os currently taking residence in the Dallas airport tonight , just trying to get within driving distance of SC so they can pay for a rental.to get home weve all missed at least an entire day of work and theyre still charging away on our cc..Not even once did they put us up  or compensate us or offer meal vouchers. In fact they just kept adding fees to all of our cc. Spare yourselves. Use Spirit, use Delta. Use jetBlue, heck find a crop duster just avoid american. I'm selling my shares and going to attempt another 6 hr hold to at least try to get compensated for my extra nights stay 255$.

We made it to Dallas but once we got to Dallas we were stuck there for days. American Airlines kept booking us for flights then canceling them last minute. We had 5 flights booked with them and every single one canceled. We are 20 year old girls and we were stuck in Dallas Texas where we’ve never been before with no money, no parents, no hotel, nothing. American Airlines gave us no money and no hotel for both nights we were told it was because there system was “shut down” and they couldn’t help us. Not to mention my luggage was sent to Nashville where we were supposed to go and as of now I don’t know how I’m getting that back because no one will help me and no one will answer the AA phone number they keep telling me to call. My bag has my laptop in it and I told a worker that and she told me to figure it out over the phone where they aren’t answering. I seriously have never experienced such bad customer service in my whole life. My friend and I just wanted to go home and American Airlines was not making that happen. Instead of flying American home we had to book a whole new flight with Alaska where we had no problems. Our parents currently are being told that they cannot be refunded for the Nashville trip where we didn’t even end up!!!!! This is actually insane and this shouldn’t ever be allowed. Never ever ever ever ever fly this airlines."
Date of travel: February 2022,30,Read small print on cancellation policy,"This review refers more to American's refund policy than the actual flight I took.  I find it an airline like most of the rest with little interest in the customer.  No better, no worse than the other major US airlines.   I do find their $60 fee for first bag excessive. Because of covid the airlines are trying to attract customer by offering lenient cancellation terms.  I want people to know that American's terms include the following as I recently had to cancel a trip due to covid.  This is what I found in my particular case, but I suggest any flyer should check their situation before booking. 1.  The cancellation fee in my situation was $200 per ticket.  This can add up if you are flying with multiple people. 2.  I had the option to change my dates at no charge, but if you booked at a higher rate, you get no refund if your follow up trip is less.3.  You can get a voucher towards future travel (as they call it) implying that you have the full fare to use as you want.  Your travel must be COMPLETED prior to the date you originally PURCHASED the tickets.  So in other words, if you purchased your Christmas. tickets early say, July and you cancel.  You have to complete our trip prior to July in order to use the voucher.  It should, be like for like, either you book within one year of your original booking date or you need to complete travel by the end date of the cancelled reservation. 4.  In addition to this restriction the small print tells you that this voucher is only good for ONE trip and only for the original passengers.  So if you had a trip to Europe scheduled for $2000 for you and your husband and you want to fly with your daughter to visit another daughter in the US.  You would need to pay for your daughter's ticket and you would lose the balance of the voucher which will probably be in excess of $1000.  I understand that the airlines are in tight straights but they can do something more to help passengers with rescheduling flights."
Date of travel: January 2022,30,Honolulu Work Trip,"Outbound flight was comfortable with attentive staff.  On the way back was a different issue a connecting flight was cancelled and the manner in which the American Airlines staff handled the re-booking was poor at best.  Overall message is if possible try to take direct flights.  That said, food was good and seats comfortable."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Never choose American Airlines!!,"American Airlines struggles with a few basic customer service principles:1. Communication - three flights cancelled in one day, all within 1-2 hours of leaving and we are given no reason and no apology 2. Terrible decision making for rebooking- after my first flight was cancelled they automatically rebooked me on a flight the next day, despite there being a number of flights listed for the same day.  Most of us don’t have the flexibility to travel a different day.3. Unwillingness to provide same level of seating - I was booked in first class in my original flight (I was really excited, the company I work for did this for me as a treat!!).  This flight was cancelled so new flight I am put in best possible seat which is extra leg room.  Flight cancelled again and despite having availability in first and economy plus will not put me in one of those seats without charging a fee.  A first class ticket had been paid for but they would not provide a comparable seat on another flight 4. Terrible wait times phone - I called the domestic number to get help with rebooking my flight after it was cancelled.  I had to wait on hold for three hours to be assisted.  5. Terrible wait times in person - the second leg to my travels was listed as on time.  During the 1.5 hour first leg of my journey the flight was cancelled.  I was then treated to standing in line for over an hour to try to get rebooked.  6. A general lack of care for the customer - at no time has a single agent apologized for the multiple delays and cancellations I incurred on one single trip!  Showing just a little bit of concern goes a really long way.  This is the first time I have travelled on American in years and will be the last!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst Airline and customer service ever,"Where do I begin. We had scheduled a Ski trip to Steamboat Springs, Co. The night before my wife and I were to leave, we received an email advising us that our flight had been canceled. No reason was given as to why the flight was canceled it was just canceled. I contacted AA via telephone and got the usual recording regarding the high call volume and to stay on the line and a representative will be with you. Four and a half hours later, a representative answered, rebooked us on a flight to Miami and then to Eagle/Vale airport for the following morning at  six am. So of course I had to cancel my rental car in Hayden, CO and book a car in Eagle which is about 60 miles to Steamboat Springs. So after about three hours sleep, we headed of to Tampa International Airport for our 6 am flight. The drive is about an hour from our home. After our arrival we were advised by a ticket agent, that our flight had been canceled due to staff shortages. We were rebooked on a flight to Miami for 8:30 pm later that night. We drove back to our home. During the day we monitored our email to see if our flight was still on schedule. The emails advised the flight was on time. So back to Tampa airport we go . After arriving we were welcomed by a long line to check our bags. There were five ticket agents helping people at first. As we moved up in line, I noticed the Agents began to dwindle in numbers. We kept noticing on the board that our flight was delayed at first by one hour then another hour delay. After approximately an hour and a half in line, I received an email showing our flight was canceled. One Lady Agent came out and advised the crowd that there were no more flights, no hotels for anyone and you were basically on your own and see you later. When people began to voice their concerns, another Lady  from AA came out and in a very rude manner advised they had been at work since 3 am and there was nothing they were going to do to help anyone and they were shutting down the ticket counter. So we booked another flight with Delta and will never fly American Airlines again. By the way, they actually had the nerve to try and credit us with a flight instead of a full refund."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Nightmare with American airlines,"The check in and bag drop at the American airlines in Punta Cana Airport is an absolute nightmare. We spent over 2 1/2 hours in line trying to drop our bags. No other counter in the Airport is this much of a disaster. Don't get me wrong, it is not the employees, it is a terrible design and system. The employees are doing the best they can under the circumstances."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst experience of my life,"We had our vacation planned and booked for nearly 9 months. Our travel agent quoted us prices from American Airlines and from Delta, and the cost savings was significant enough that we decided to book with American. We arrived at the small airport in Grand Rapids with plenty of time and stood in line for more than 30 minutes while 3 clearly incompetent agents took their sweet time with the dozens of people who were in front of us. American was the only airline that had any line this morning. By the time we finally got up to the counter, we were told curtly that it was too late to check us in and there was nothing she could do. She didn't offer any help. She didn't offer any guidance or direction. And our first international vacation in our lifetimes was basically ruined in that moment. Needless to say, after that debacle I walked up to the counter at Delta where a very friendly and empathetic agent took her time to find new flights for us. We're losing a day on our trip (thanks American), but at least we are still taking it. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with American. They're useless."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Nightmare of using flight ticket credit for my parents trip from india,I booked a trip for my parents from India to US in 2020 and due to the pandemic had to cancel the trip to use the tickets this year. I tired to book the same flight (British airways from India to USA) through the American airlines website and was shocked to learn that the flight cost 4200 USD instead of 2500 USD that was listed on the British airways website. What a crazy mark up for booking via American. I just paid for the tickets out of pocket and decided to use the credit for travel within the US. After waiting for hours on the phone to book my flights from Philly to SF - they tell me I can only use the credit if the travel originates in India and they cannot let me use it for flights in the the US. even though I am using it for the same two passengers - its unbelievable. I've basically lost 2860 USD that I will never get to use again. Definitely done being a amercan airlines advantage member - its useless. I cant believe how bad this experience has been and how many hidden rules they have in the tickets.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Would give 0 stars if possible. I have cried for days. I have spent hundreds trying to get home.,"American Airlines delayed, delayed again, delayed again, then cancelled. Flight after flight. While trying to get home on a Saturday, I had a layover in Dallas. Flight has been cancelled twice. They have now told me no flights are available until Wednesday. They said they will not be providing hotel or accommodations, probably because they can’t afford to do it with the amount of flights they cancelled. They claim it was cancelled because they couldn’t staff it. I ended up booking with another airlines because they wouldn’t help at the counter and hung up on me over 5 times! I was on hold 3.5 hours just to be hung up on. They don’t care and want to steal your money! I spent hundreds to fly Alaska to a different destination (was too expensive to go home so I will be flying to a city 3 hours away)  and they had NO ISSUES! Wow, i am flying solo and this has by far been the worst experience of my life. I have been crying non-stop and haven’t been able to sleep for 72 hours. They refused to help with hotel/food/and transportation so this “trip” has cost me a ridiculous amount. If you want to never make it to your destination and spend hundreds stuck at an airport layover for days then American is for you. Otherwise do yourself a favor and book with ANY OTHER COMPANY! I had other bad experiences as well but I don’t have time to add those, so here was the highlights!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Completely unreliable,"Cancelled my flight two days in a row, next day the plane had maintenance issues and I lost my connection. The ONLY airline with cancelled flights in Logan Airport  on both days was American. Won’t give refunds, save yourself the hassle and fly with another airline."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,AA can keep all the money they owe me from my last three trips they delayed and then canceled,"If you've flown AA in the last two years or even know anyone that has I'm sure you are well aware bc everyone has a horror story. This trip was the last straw. NEVER AGAIN! They owe me $823 in credits that I've tried to use twice over the last year. Both times I have ended up stranded in a strange city for 2 days and spending over $1,000 each trip in airport food, taxis, hotels, and lastly avis rent a car which was an addition $780 not counting the gas money bc of their $500 one way fee just to drive 14 hours to get home from where AA left me. After all of that still made it home a day and a half earlier then the next flight they could get me on. Which would have been canceled anyways I'm sure. Oh and the lost pay from work. I drove 14 hours home in shock and disbelief of the experience and how poorly AA staff treated me and everyone else they left stranded. Read all the reviews below mine bc they are true. I finally got a call back from their 800 waiting list I was put on this morning (Sunday). I was on the automated waiting list since Friday at 7:30pm. Lol if you have dealt with their 800 service you already know how poor the experience was and unbelievable how they talk to their customers. AA can keep their money they owe me, they are going to need it bc they are losing lifelong customers by the thousands daily."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst company ever.,"This is the worst airline company that I’ve ever been with, because this company needs a new management that can handle consumers exactly this company doesn’t have the right attitude towards the customers also they lose baggage my flight was delayed and was delayed three times in Detroit Michigan and then arriving to Miami losing my bags without even being considered the customer service were so rude didn’t even try to get my problems situated my wife has cancer and she supposed to get her medicine and all I get is we sorry we cannot do nothing about they said if it was an emergency for my wife to get her meds  I should call 911 for my wife cancer"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Canceled 4 times,"Absolute nightmare! Had 4 flights get canceled due to no flight attendants. They never said a reason but we assumed due to bad weather and them not making their flights which is understandable. However why keep rebooking the flights if you know they will never show up! They never communicated anything to us! When it came time to board they said all 4 times there is a slight delay and we are waiting on flight attendants then stayed quite until 30 minutes to an hour later we got an alert it was canceled. I would recommend flying southwest or delta. Delta was able to get us on a flight right away and had amazing customer service, everyone was friendly compared to American. Word of advice if your flight does get canceled on American book through another airline and don’t do what we did!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,"Consistently inconvenient, fond of delays and cancellations","I was trying to fly out to Phoenix to attend my grandmother's memorial service. Inclement weather had already pushed my flight back another day, which was understandable. The day of the new flight, despite the clear weather and sunny conditions, my flight was delayed, delayed again, then cancelled, without explanation. I decided I wanted a refund, since by that point the memorial service had already passed. There are no clear directions for how to get a refund on their site. They want a ticket number, but for some reason, I have no ticket number. They say it's on my mobile boarding pass, but I can't access my pass because the flight's been cancelled. When I try access my flight record, they offer to reschedule my flight for tomorrow. Unfortunately, the service was today, not tomorrow, and they had already failed to hold up their previous rescheduled flight. I will not be flying with American Airlines again."
Date of travel: February 2022,40,Fada_brancs,If you want to feel what a homeless bum feels like in the cold fly with American.aThey will cancel your flight without prior notice and tell you to go sleep on the benches.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,how many cancellations do you want for your flights?,"I booked 2 flights through them, and they canceled both and I had to rebook both of them they cost me several hours of work and didn't even ask if I wanted to be home sooner, they cost me over 12 hours of additional time and screwed up my work week. I wish I had booked with Spirit."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,American airline flight credit scam. This can't be legal. Is there a lawyer in the house?,"In September of 2020 I booked flight from Chicago to Medellin. I booked it on Expedia and flight was $300. I canceled my trip due to covid and got $300 credit. Now I am trying to use this credit to book another trip to Medellin, I have to do it before March 31 2022 because this is when credit will expire on Expedia. There is an option to use flight credit on Expedia website.When I use this option cost of rountrip to medellin is around $850 so after credit  I will pay around $550. This is where irony of this situation starts. If I try to book same flight on Expedia without using my credits miraculously same flight cost $550. So if I book flight using my credits I will pay same amount of money as if I bought same flight without credits. This make using credits absolutely pointless. This looks like an obvious scam to me and I can't believe that American airline doing this. Their flight credits are absolutely worthless.  You might be able to use them but you won't gain anything by doing this. I hope they will be prosecuted. This can't be legal!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Horrible service,The delayed then canceled all flight from both the outgoing trip to the return trip. Most people only get one shot out of the year to go on vacation and see their family they completely ruined this. I was supposed to arrive to Ecuador on a Saturday morning at 11:00 am I ended arriving at 1:30 am the next day. I let it slide things happen I usually let these things go but the way back was even worse they delayed our flight by 4 hours and when we finally reached Miami they canceled my flight to Tampa ! I had to get a hotel in Miami !!! Spend money on their mistakes never again
Date of travel: February 2022,10,100s of canceled flights,Over 100 canceled flights out of Miami today.   All of them American Airlines.   Nightmare for 100s of people.   Customer service is awful.  Everyone tells you something different.   Everyone we talked to said they're never flying American again and we never will either!
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Scared new person?,"Our flight from Ft. Myers to Chicago was okay, but when we got to Chicago, we were put in a cold basement in the oldest part of O'Hare and were told that our plane had mechanical issues and they had no idea when or how it would be resolved. I think the girl was new. She seemed terrified and ran away after every announcement, so there wasn't even anyone at that counter (or the other one in that basement) that you could ask for an update. Three hours later when they finally got a plane, they were in a huge hurry to load and board the plane because another was needing that gate. Unfortunately, not a single employee had the thought during the three hour delay to look around to see what people had for carry-ons. So all of a sudden, they had to tell three of us that our carry ons had to be gate checked, so we were all scrambling to figure that out (I had fragile stuff and medications that I wasn't going to put under the airplane - that was fun). No apologies, really. I know the airlines are having their struggles, also, but they need to start using their brains ahead of time and they need to up the customer service game."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,One long day of extended torture,"Had a trip planned from PHL to PHX for a long weekend.  Things seemed fine. The incoming plane arrived and we were set to board when the delays started. First 1.5 hours due to waiting for the 2nd officer.  Then another delay of 1.5 hours due to no pilot.  Not sure if the 2nd officer arrived.  Then another delay of 1.5 hours no pilot and no 2nd officer.  And then the final straw. Flight cancelled.  PHL is my home so while I was angry I had a place to sleep that night.  We looked at options for rebooking but the earliest trip would only leave us less than 48 hours in PHX.  We booked this through a travel agent.  Got everything cancelled and aIl we needed to do was get our bags and go home somewhat sad that the trip got cancelled.  Getting the bags is where the nightmare really started. I naively thought they would unload the plane and passengers would pick up their bags on a carousel.   Nope. Each passenger had to go to the baggage claim office and.ask to have their bags released.  I am sorry,  what?  No guarantee how long it would take as the American Airlines baggage personnel indicated we were not a priority.  Nice. My bag finally arrived but my husband's was still missing.  After 4 hours waiting in the baggage area we left the airport We were.supposed to be notified when the bag was ready for pickup.  Got home and was tracking the bag number and it looked like the bag was found and it was going to put on a flight to PHX the next day.  But we cancelled our our trip with our travel agent.  Clearly American didn't get that message. We drove back to the airport the next morning to file a claim and no one is in the baggage office.  Not sure why but there were a bunch of bags in a secure area and we saw my husband's bag!  Fortunately one of the bag handlers (not AA employee) retrieved it for us.  How is this a good process for the year 2022? I will NOT put another cent in American Airlines pocket.  They should be ashamed of themselves but it seems like this is normal business processes. Stay away at all costs."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Delayed both ways.,"I was delayed a little over 2 hours to Chicago which was understandable since it was due to the weather but then I was also delayed on my trip back. The trip back was delayed 1 hour and 15 minutes due to being short a flight attendant. It’s very frustrating to lose over an hour of my time for a staffing issue, but I am paying for the same service. Not only is it annoying to have to sit in an airport longer than needed but having to rearrange my plans for pickup once at the destinating airport is an added bonus. Never had this happened on other flights which have also been cheaper airlines."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,I don't fly never again with AA,"They are charging for everything, more every time for seats, baggage, etc. You pay economic as first classes, and they play with your time as they want and nothing happen. Waiting for a Gate in the middle of the airport field, and fly was delayed 2 hours. Don't let AA steal your money and treat you as nothing"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,They changed the flights then charged service feed for alternate arrangements. What a scam.,Airlines have become legalized scam artists. They change flights then charge a change fee to get the booking redone. Attempted to change online but the website not only changed the outgoing flight correctly but changed the return flight to the same day! That will cost you! This was for travel in March 2022
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Cancelled our flight less than 24 hours before,"Cancelled our flight and tried to rebook us a day later. We would have missed 3 reservations at Disney, lost our deposits and now we have to spend $350 MORE to get a flight that will get us there on time.plus since we are leaving earlier now, our Uber is more expensive. The amount of money American Airlines is costing me is outrageous."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Absolutely Awful Travel Experience,"Let me begin by saying if I could give them negative stars I would. I just had THE WORST experience of my life on an airline not once, but TWICE. On my way to Dallas this past Wednesday, I was deplaned twice for broken planes. The first one had a bad fuel pump. The second one blew a bunch of fuses. Then I wait for HOURS at the airport for a plane from Chicago. My flight was supposed to take off at 3:48 pm. It didn't take off until after 9:00 pm. I didn't arrive in Dallas until after midnight. I missed an entire first day of meetings for work because of it.THEN... the return flight back to Fort Wayne was again a mess. We were deplaned AGAIN for mechanical issues. This flight was supposed to take off at 6:40 pm. We boarded the plane at 8:30 pm then sat while they deiced this new plane for over an hour. We didn't take off until almost 10:00 pm. I was supposed to land in Fort Wayne at 10:10 pm. I didn't get there until after midnight. I will NEVER EVER EVER fly American again!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Never Flying American Airlines Again,"I’m normally not one to leave negative reviews. However, my experience with American Airlines was beyond terrible. American Airlines is the absolute worst airline, hands down. I will only be flying Delta from now on. Their mobile app glitches, they switched my seats out of nowhere, and their staff was completely rude. I checked in online and received the boarding passes only to be told I needed to use the self service kiosk to check-in, after spending over an hour having issues with the kiosk and the staff having zero clue as to what they were doing, turns out I didn’t need to use the kiosk (surprise, surprise, why else would you have an online check-in option?). We were then told that it was too late to board our flights and the next available flight was the following day. Now I’m having issues using the app to check in and selecting my seats. I was in the middle of selecting a seat when the app glitched and kicked me out. So, I tried again and suddenly all the seats were unavailable, the only ones left were ones I had to pay extra for. Whatever, so I paid extra for a seat. Then I decided to add a checked bag online, I was extremely shocked (sarcasm) when I received an error message that they were unable to add bags online at this time. I decided to give up after attempting it twice and just check the bags once I’m at the airport. However, I checked my bank account only to find out that I was charged twice for the bag fees that were unsuccessful online. It’s a never ending sh*t show with American Airlines. I will NEVER fly with them ever again."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,"Garbage airline, do not recommend.","Today’s flight (recurrent issue with AA) airport congested, ie understaffed, baggages aren’t loaded into the plane for >30 min. Pull off into a de-icing area, another 15 min. We take off 67 minutes after scheduled take-off. Land 27Minutes before my connection leaves. Make the gate to my connection with 8 min to spare, attendant says “sorry, we’re closed.” About 18 passengers miss their connection directly due to airline mismanagement of their resources, as they’ve fired so many for not being vaccinated against COVID-19 who have natural immunity from contracting the disease. This has been my experience with AA well before the pandemic. AA treats its customers as if they have to fly with them. I use AA ONLY when no other choice is available for the day/time I’m looking for a flight and 8/10 times I get the same disappointment, delays, missed/cancelled flights, often rude service at the desk. Avoid this airline if you can, there are much better options and often worth the extra fee if any (Delta, Jet Blue, etc. for North America)."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Seeking resolution,"A desk agent said flight 898 TPA-AUS on 2/4/22 was canceled due to weather.  She rebooked me to a similar flight today on 2/5/22.  The cost to me for this was $376 because she found my trips as “not eligible” for hotel voucher. Both flights today 2/5/22 were canceled also.  I'm guessing for the same reason being bad weather .  It's 50º in Austin at 2-4pm, well above freezing.  The cost I incurred for the cancelations is $376/day.  Based online flight status that's now times two days.  I called American Airlines Support line at 800-433-7300 and have been on hold for 1 hour and 34mins at the time of this message.  I’ve tried two other support lines that you have listed online, both are disconnected.  Who can I talk to about reimbursement?"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,AVOID this airline if at ALL possible,Terrible customer service.  Expect Delays and/or Cancellations of your flight(s).  As with other reviewers ... you think all is well only to discover once at the airport things are  NOT ok. To make matters worse....they are not helpful in explaining options once your flight has been delayed or cancelled.  Told I had to call Am. Airlines to find out options. On hold now for over 2 hours trying to get answers/help!  Lost an entire day of my trip.It will be worth the extra money and/or traveling to a larger airport to avoid having to fly on American Airlines.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst night of my life,"I was traveling to Manchester,  NH from JAX Florida with a layover in Charlotte. The original flight was delayed, so I was switched to a Charlotte to Boston flight. The flight was continuously delayed, not due to weather, but because they had no captain or crew. After a three hour delay they canceled the flight and rescheduled everyone for the next day. This was just before 1am. They had no hotel rooms available, and then they all went home. I spent the night sleeping on a metal bench in a bright and noisy airport. I booked the second part of my flight for the next day on Delta. Never again!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Never Again and also selling all my AA Stock Options,"I am absolutely disgusted with this airline and also Tallahassee airport for that matter.  HORRIBLE on all counts.  Let's see you cancel my flight last night due to weather and rebooked me on a 6:00 AM flight which I already found suspicious.  So I pay for taxi and a room for the night only to wake up at 3:00AM because the airport AA guy said to make sure I was here super early for the flight as it would be a wait for TSA.  LIAR!  I get here at 4:00 AM and there's not ONE person in line at security.  I sit at the gate until 10 minutes before boarding time and they decide to delay the flight this time because I quote, ""The Crew needs rest""  Are you f'ing kidding me?????  I need rest, everyone else needs rest.  That is BULL.  It gets worse.  I had to pay for a hotel room last night that I didn't have to check out till noon.  So they delayed the flight from 6:00 till 8:00 for the pitiful pansy crew to get their beauty rest but then after sitting in the airport for another hour and a half when I COULD have went back to my hotel they delay the flight again now till 10:44 AM again because the crew needs rest.  What a joke!!!!!  I then go to the AA counter and tell the agent I want to be compensated for this because this is NOT weather related today and hey are intentionally delaying my flight for the crew.  It's not my fault you hire a bunch of crew members that can't do their job and go out parting on a Friday night and then can't come to work and do their job on time the next morning.  I WILL be contacting a lawyer regarding this.  Lesson learned and I will NEVER fly AA again and will make it my life mission at least for the next several months to bad review AA every chance and every place I can."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,No respect,"Stop cheating people. You are all cheaters and liars. Cancelling connecting flights for people coming from other countries, awake from the date before traveling with small kids and persons with chronic health issues, cancelling not even for the weather, but for issues related to that awful airline, and not even offering a hotel for them. Is inhuman and nasty. I will sue them, no matter how much will cost them. That happened on 02/04/2022 on the flight AA2541 from Miami to Houston George Bush airport. There are tons of people waiting on the line late night, almost next day (11:45pm) and the offer no response. Is ridiculous. Was a connecting flight from another flight from their own airline,"
Date of travel: February 2022,20,Still Waiting to go on Our trip,Before we ventured to the airport I got an email the flight was good to go.   We live an hour and a half away.  Short story flight was cancelled.   Other airlines were still operating but sold out fast.  Due to weather???   Delta/Southwest no problem😊.   I overheared that it could have been no crew???  Did they do right by us??  Used points so we are in Syracuse in a hotel for 2 nights now working on changing all plans in Vegas which is costing due to last minute.  Very disappointed and we had to pay a day for parking.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,I’m a Executive Platinum with AA and they canceled my flight 10 mins before boarding and gave me absolutely no options!,"I’m an executive platinum with AA. My wife and I had first class tickets to LAS and they canceled our flight 10 minutes before boarding.  They gave us absolutely no alternative options.  Their app was NOT helpful and I had a 90 minute wait time contact their call center. I purchased tickets for same-day concert and had reservations at a LAS resort.  I had to eat both.  When I got on-line to get a refund, their criminal process led me to a flight credit.  If you experienced the same, please contact your State Attorney General and form a class-action-suit. I thought when Parker retired as CEO they would become more customer centric.  They rank tied for 6 out of the top 8 airlines for a well-deserved-reason.  I’M A EXECUTIVE PLATINUM AND THEY TREAT ME LIKE GARBAGE.  IF YOU’RE CONSIDERING AA, I’D COUSEL TO USE ANOTHER AIRLINE OR HITCHHIKE."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Horrible,The worst airline ever! They don’t care about anything or anyone. They play with people’s time and they canceled flights right on the spot. I wish I could said something positive but I don’t find anything.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,They can cancel when they want and you have to fly when they tell you!,"First, they changed the flight time from 8:30 AM to 6:30 AM.  Then they canceled that flight.  Put me on another that was supposed to fly out at 4:00 PM that day.  They canceled that flight.  Put us on a flight two days after we wanted to travel and did not give us a choice,  Their timing would have caused us to miss our family reunion with my 90+ year old dad who is just recovering from Covid.  Tried to get a hold of them, but could not (was on hold for nearly 3 hours).  So, I booked on another airline that got me there on time.  Tired getting a refund and they make it impossible.  They say that you cannot cancel online.  They say that you have to cancel with the booking agent (Expedia).  Expedia says that American took control of the ticket and I can only cancel with them.  Message from the customer service is that the hold time is over 4 hours.  They only let you chat if you sign up for their frequent flyer program, but the wait for a chat is over 2 hours!You cannot simply cancel someone's flights at will and then dictate the customers travel schedule.  And then, make it impossible for the customer to cancel the flight!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Horrible Nightmare,"We have been planning a long weekend getaway with our friends for months. The day finally came and we were set to travel on 02/03/2022. We left Baltimore to Miami where we had a connection flight for 3.5 hours. As we were waiting the flight got pushed 2 hours ( no big deal) another delay 2 more hours ( oh well ) then 2 more. The pilot and copilot are waiting for the rest of the crew. Then the crew show up( better late than never) . The counter person announced we are going to board( great we said) then she announced again the trip was canceled ( wow ) then no disregard we are boarding but we only gave 15 minutes ( all the passengers lined up and ready to go) wait they canceled again( they gave two lame excuses 1- a curfew that 10 minutes ago didn’t exist 2- the pilot couldn’t fly this trip due to a contract extension. Is the management of this company so incompetent??? This massive company doesn’t have backup plans and procedures? No backup crews? Nothing? I flew on so many different airlines in my life, it seems that American Airlines will be on the top of my bottom list of airlines to fly. The level of poor management and lack of customer care towards customer exceeds anything I saw on my whole life. Two days of a four days trip were wasted on this nonsense. Exhausted and drained from all this running around between terminals, hotels , taxis, I don’t even feel like being there, they have killed the vibe, and ruined this trip. Thanks American Airlines. I'll be spreading this story to everyone in my domain"
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Awesome service on the Long haul,"I went there Thailand to see family after being away for almost 2 years because of Covid-19’s restrictions. I had a good trip going there. I had to get wheelchair assistance between each flight and they were very pleasant and always asked if I needed to go to the restroom or shop. Very polite. However, on my trip back to the States from Narita to DFW on January 26th, I had the most Amazing service ever! The flight was not very full so they tried to space everyone out so they had more room. I had 2 open seats next to me that I was able to lay down and take a nap. The Stewardesses on that flight made sure everything was perfect. They checked on me and we had some good short conversations. I shake due to a brain injury and they always came by to make sure I was warm enough and to see if I needed anything to drink. I did spill a coke and told them and they helped me clean it off my tray and gave me a new blanket. They opened all my food lids for me. I mean it was Amazing. I didn’t feel as if it was a pity party, but just blessed to have these Angels on board that day. It was above and beyond all expectations. I wish I could put all their names down, but they know who they are. I hope that if you plan to travel overseas you take American Airlines and get this crew. I sure hope I will see them on my next trip back. Thank you!🙏🙏"

Date of travel: February 2022,50,DFW Staff,"My plane was late leaving Key West. I had planned a close flight, so shame on me. But when we landed I ran to my departing gate to see my plane sitting and no one to help me. Thought I was gonna be that guy who couldn't get on the plane even when it was sitting right there. Anyways, American's computer had already booked me on the flight for the next day, but America's boarding crew got me on the the flight it took 4 of them to get it done. They were GREAT!!! I can't thank them enough. They got me home before the snowstorm that hit my area the next day. Thanks American Airlines and your crew in Dallas."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,American Airlines Never Again...one bad apple spoiled everything,"The worst customer service I ever had to pay for. On my flight back to Miami I encountered one of your employees Ms. CYNTHIA. I understand and respect the fact that she was doing her job but the nasty, rude and disrespectful behavior was not called for. I tested 3 days before my flight not knowing it was 1 day. Me and my fiance payed 99 dollars each after explaining when we were leaving but no one said anything changed about the date for covid testing changing and I accept responsibility for that. However,  at the airport Ms. Cynthia clarified that and said we had to pay another 75 dollars each.  I was trying to have a cordial conversation about the requirements and my challenges with the covid testing but she kept talking over me and yelling.  I said to her ma'am I'm not arguing with you I was just trying to have a conversation with you.  She cut me off again saying  yes you are, yes you are that's why your repeating yourself.  I explained to her that I'm repeating myself because you keep talking over me, I'm not mad just try to talk.  She responded,  I don't care you won't be getting in this line today.  She was so rude,  I just walked away. My experience has definitely made this my last time booking any flights with this airline. I took 2 test to get to Barbados and once we arrived we were told it didn't say how the test was taken so we had to do another one before we could enter the country and that was fine. Upon leaving we had to take two more which cost use about 350 us dollars.  Just trying to have a light conversation with this young lady was deplorable. Never again 😒"
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Excellent experience with a few minor flaws,"Trip involved a total of four legs round trip.  All were on time except the final leg which was a few minutes late.  Service and food and beverage options needed sprucing up on the segments in and out of MLI, but things were good if not superb between DFW and FLL.  The lead flight attendant, Holly, on the FLL-DFW leg was unbelievable.  She actually attempted to make it a personalized experience, reminiscent of the days long gone. American has a number of these older attendants and it is a joy to fly with them.  I know things have been rough the last two years, but many employees continue to continue. Fortunate that we had no disgruntled passengers on any of these flights."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Awful online and phone customer service,"I had a horrible experience today with American and needed to get it out. My flight from Omaha to Dallas was delayed 3 hours and was going to cause me to miss my connecting flight from Dallas to Orlando. Needed to find a new flight, all they had available was a flight for tomorrow at 6AM. I tried to call and find out my options to rebook, and was put on hold for 3 HOURS. After 3 hours I gave up and called again. The electronic operator told me the wait time to talk to a rep would be ANOTHER 3 hours. In the mean time I tried dozens of times online and via the app to rebook my flight, and repeatedly was told the available new flight was ""no longer available"". After wasting about 4 hours and stressing for just as long, I decided to buy a flight from another airline so I could still leave today. 10 minutes after booking a direct flight to Orlando through another airline, the American app tells me my flight has been rebooked for tomorrow at 6am. I cancelled my other flight but did not get a refund and am now out an additional $300. All of this could have been avoided if they just had decent customer service and it didn't take OVER 3 HOURS to reach someone on the phone. Never going to be flying American again."

Douglas ParkerI Harry  purchased transportation from American Airlines with record locator KPRSHL and paid a total of $1,199.44 in US dollars.I also purchased Allianz Global Assistance Policy number AMR08823166993 on May 20, 2021.The outbound first leg of the trip was accomplished without any problem: PHX to MEX on January 16, 2022 (Phoenix to Mexico City).However on the return leg, Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix on 29 January 2022, there was a problem.We were required to take a Covid -19 Antigen Rapid Test on 28 January 2022. This test was conducted for both Harry and Gloria Sinsheimer at the Servicio Medico De La Bahia Puerto Vallarta Jalisco. Gloria’s test was Negative while Harry was informed his test was Positive.The Hilton hotel provided a place to isolate at an additional charge.I called American Airlines and allerted the agent that I would not be able to fly on 29 January but Gloria could. The agent conveyed that Gloria could still travel under the Confirmation Number KPRSHL. The agent also gave a new Confirmation Number WCTNPP and new ticket number 0012175881971 that I, Harry, would use when contacting American Airlines again when ready to travel.I called the same American Airlines phone number 1-800-433-7300 and requested to travel using the new confirmation and ticket numbers. I was told there was no credit, nothing that I could use to buy a return ticket. That the numbers were void since the tickets had been used.  I spent an hour failing to convice them that I did not fly a return trip on American Airlines due to Covid.I thrn asked the American airlines agent if the remainder of the ticket was used thenplease tell me “used by who and when”.  American Airlines agents would not offer any information to support their airline confirming either a negative Covid-19 test or recovery from Covid and clearance to travel and while collecting a passaenger attestation for the person who used the ticket departing from a foreign country and arriving in the United States.  The agent just keep saying the ticket was already used. The American Airlines agent supposedly spoke with others and restated the American Airlines could not/would not help me return home. That the numbers I gave them had no value and I would need to purchase another ticket at a cost of approximately $400.00 I did finally return home incurring the following costs:Flight on Volaris Airlines Puerto Vallarta to Tijuana $319.00 US dollarsShuttle $14.00 to San Diego AirportOvernight Stay at Sheraton Hotel next to San Diego AirportFlight on Southwest Airlines from San Diego to Albuerque NM.I had someone pick up my truck in Phoenix and drive the truck to Albuquerque.Total Expense incurred because American Airlines left me stranded with Covid in Puerto Vallarta is $706.64 Can American Airlines offset or help me recover any costs associate with this travelThank youHarry"
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Ugh: An Open Letter to American Airlines,"American Airlines, I understand that you want me there 2 hours prior to my flight but actually having your employees show up at that time would be helpful. We struggled through the self-check kiosk at the American Airline station and stood in line to check a bag only to discover that our self-check was a waste of time until someone showed up to ""set up the kiosks."" Of course, at this point the line was reversed so ""the first became last."" When we finally had opportunity to encounter employees, with the exception of one gentleman, we found them to be (at best) aloof, at worst disinterested, abrupt and borderline rude. This experience in conjunction with a horrendous experience with Security and TSA undid a week of R & R. I fondly recall the days when airlines weren't staffed with rejects from the DMV."

Date of travel: February 2022,10,HORRIBLE (Non Existent Customer) Service,"Didn't realize my phone had fallen to the floor apparently, so I realized at baggage claim that it had to still be on the plane. I checked my phone locator which showed it at the airport. However, the plane had left that quickly. After immediate phone calls throughout the night and morning, absolutely NO ONE was willing to try to track the phone based on the flight and plane. They simply do not have a true customer service department. Just departments that affect them making money. Nothing to help customers. It should have been simple to track the plane, but no one even tried. Their process indicates it could take up to 30 days.  Who can go without their phone that long...with no indication of what was turned in on that flight. If it's not turned in, an employee clearly has kept my phone. I'm terribly disappointed with American Airlines. Not sure if it's worth the lack of customer service to use them again."
Date of travel: December 2021,40,First class isn't what it used to be (so what else is new?),"With only (more correctly, not even!) 1 and 1/2 hours between flights, there was no time to go to a lounge; just dash to the gate and get in line.  Being that this was a Maui (Hawaii) flight, there were a few extra hurdles too jump through.  To visit Hawaii, one must go through the Hawaii Safe travels portal and enter Covid info and, then, with a QR code in hand, the next stop is to go through the connecting flight to Hawaii's properly assigned gate to answer a few more questions, show the QR code, and get a wrist band.Even if there was enough time to go to a lounge, this extra bump in the road gobbled up any and all extra time.  No one said this would be easy so we were not surprised.  Bye, bye, free time.Once on board for the 5 hour and 43 minute flight to Maui, our last-row in first class seating was like being at the back of the bus.  All the meal choices were chosen by the time anyone gets to the back row.  Any beverages and drinks may be less frequently offered to us last-of-the-last folks.  Hopefully, when they get to you and tell you that you get what is left (after all the others have made their choices), maybe you get what you like and maybe not.  Hello?  First Class?  Maybe you airline folks could order, oh I don't know, maybe a few ""extra"" meals so there would be some suggestion of a ""choice"" at the end of the line?  Yeah, that sucked.  Oh, but that would cost money and the bean counters don't like to see any of that cold hard cash go to waste.Our ""lunch"" was a packaged sandwich, a salad, a sweet-something-or-other, and something else less than memorable.  One of us got the mozzarella and tomato baguette and the other the turkey sandwich.  It was decent.  Not great, but edible.  As the attendant told us, the other people across the aisle from us did not get what they wanted either.  Oh, now I feel so much better!!!  Misery loves company.Who do we have to thank for this?  Probably the corporate bean-counters who think up new ways to tighten that bottom line.  Whew.  So good to know someone is out there taking care of us travelers!  Or not.First class seats are now a bit tighter, there's no seat-back entertainment (or even music),  and nothing at all that reminds us of what First Class used to be.  At least we got wine; the poor folks in Economy could not even deaden the pain with that sedative as none was permitted to be sold.Let us all hold our collective breath for the next bean-counter's bright idea on how to squeeze a bit more out of us passengers to feed their corporate hunger.  Don't you hate flying?  Oh, before I forget, our plane was a 32Q: (per American Airlines)""Now, American Airlines has updated the A321neo aircraft type to be “32Q.” American's Airbus A321neo aircraft are configured with 20 seats in the First Class cabin and 176 in the Main Cabin, for a total of 196 seats on board"""
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Operated by SkyWest dba American Eagle,"This was a 1 hour and 50 minute ""hopper"" flight to LAX from which we would then depart to Maui.    The airplane is classified as an E75 (Embraer) which is a smaller regional jet.  Only benefit for first class here is first-on/first off seating and exiting, as well as priority ticketing on the luggage.  I don't think we even had time for water or coffee on this flight.  But it left on-time.  The bathrooms are miserably small; an adult male will have great difficulty trying to use the ""facility"" (do go potty first before boarding!)   And we expected nothing more so were not surprised when we got just that: nothing more.  On the up-side, the overhead bins were able to perform their functions (as opposed to the much smaller planes which certainly do NOT)."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Ripping off clients,"Last year I booked  2 business tickets overseas on American thru a travel agent. Due to Covid I had to cancel  as the country would not accept travelers. So I was offered a refund if I paid $200 per ticket or keep the value as a credit $5919 to be used by July 22. I am now trying to book my flights and American want more than the other airlines and I would have to pay an extra $900 per ticket. The normal rate on other flights are cheaper than my original credit. I now want a full monetary refund and get told it’s $950 per ticket to get my money back, I did book a non refundable ticket but these are not normal times and the other airlines are cheaper. This is unacceptable from American and I am a 5 million miler on American. I get passed back to the travel agent and have no joy in getting this resolved."

Date of travel: October 2021,40,Better than expected,"I was expecting the worst:  delays, cancelled flights, and COVID mania.  Not sure if I just got lucky or if the problems are overhyped, but I had a bunch of very pleasant flights (or, as pleasant as domestic US flying could possibly be) with American in 2021.I'm not sure it's the best domestic option, but I don't think any of its betters have more reach.  Overall, I'd for sure choose American again."
Date of travel: January 2022,40,loud passenger,"I was going to my seat during loading, when a man in front of me was using  foul language to a female flight attendant when he grabbed his jacket and slung it around almost hitting me in the face. I got out of the way she called the captain to come handle it . I was amazed at the way it was handled. He was moved from the seat in the back to first class. This was all because he didn't want to sit next to someone with a child. Morale to this story, pay for economy raise hell and you have first class for economy prices."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Do not use this American Airlines- Bad for health,"My first time using American Airlines, I was delighted to book with them. I was travelling from London to Guyana for my brother's funeral. Flight from London to JFK NY was brilliant. After that everything went downhill. I had to stay in NY on the 20th and leave on the 21st on a direct flight to Guyana which I booked...only this didn't happen. I checked in, everything went well, I was waiting with all the rest of the passengers on our flight to Guyana, no announcements showing up, no communication from anyone, one the digital board behind the desk thats used when boarding the flight it stated that the flight was late, not only that, but we were going to Miami. There was no one to speak to, no one to explain to us what was happening. After about an hour someone showed up, he had to answer a barrage of questions from the passengers, none of which he had a valid answer for. We were told we can either go to Miami or book another flight, that was the response form a major airline. I spoke to the person behind the desk and told him, I have some collecting me in Guyana and have no way of contacting him, can he do that for he, he gave me a resounding no. Four hours later, our flight left for Miami instead of Guyana. We landed in Miami, we were not told how long we had to wait in Miami, we waited, and waited and waited. Our flight from NY to Guyana was supposed to land in Guyana at 15:10, it landed in Guyana 22:20...no apologies, no compensation, a total lack of consideration, no offer of refreshments. We were given a small packet of pretzels and a glass of juice on a 7 hour flight...unbelievable.My return flight, from Guyana to London:Check in was seemless, the flight from Guyana to NY was delayed by one hour forty minutes, no communication whatsoever, still I was happy that it was a direct flight to New York. I also had to connect on a flight from JFK to Boston and from Boston to London. I woke up and checked my email and received a message that my flight from Boston to London was cancelled, no reason was given. I got so fed up of the whole situation and decided to book a flight directly from JFK to London. I tried contacting American Airlines and Expedia regarding my disastrous, shambolic flights and experiences and both are claiming"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,They have morphed into SPIRIT!,"I avoid SPIRIT Airlines by choosing the majors when I travel.  AMERICAN has been taken over in spirit by SPIRIT.  We chose our seats for the flights to Miami well in advance.  When we got the notice to check in my wife had an assigned seat for the first flight to Charlotte but did not.  When I attempted to choose seats again on the first leg I was met with upcharges (ala SPIRIT).  There we no seats together that did not require extra payment. I chose another seat away from my wife whose is petrified to fly. We both of course ended up with center seats.  When I attempted to choose seats on the second leg none were available without an upcharge.  I refuse to be robbed.  I called the ""Customer Care"" (Laughable!) line and had to wait more than an hour for a call back.  The woman I spoke to was very nice but she said this happened for two reasons 1.  I purchased the tickets thru EXPEDIA which make me a second rate customer apparently.  2. Equipment changes.  Both are just excuses for poor service.  At the airport in Grand Rapids the counter people were very nice and provided us with assigned seats next to one another with no additional fee.  Do not fall for the online scam and pay extra cash for something you have already paid for.  The first flight was delayed an hour due to the tow bar being frozen to the aircraft and them not being prepared to deice the plane.  The door on the second flight's aircraft hit us in the behinds after a mad sprint thru Charlotte airport.  All this adding to my wife's anxiety.We spent our time in Florida.  I spent my time dreading the return trip for three reasons.  American Airlines poor customer service, my wife's anxiety (fueled by American Airlines and MIA's layout.The day before our departure I again got the email to check in.  This time there were no seats available online to check into...here we go again.  After I checked in without choosing seats I received another email.  This one stated that our assigned seats had been changed.  Guess what they were center seats and were again not together.  When we went to the airport check in counter (Why did we check in online when it is useless?)  I was met with a very rude, threatening and angry attendant.  She gave us American's stock excuses and was not happy when I pointed out I had heard the excuses before and to just give us our borading passes.  I mentioned that my wife would need to take a sedative and she went ballistic.  She tried to get me to raise my voice to her level but I am better than that and did not stoop to her level.  She informed me I could go to Delta or United if I liked.  I have by the way used both of those airlines recently and have to say their service and demeanor is superior by far to American.  I asked her if she was finished and requested our boarding passes.  She told me she was going to ""Mark"" by reservation as a threat.When we got to security we noticed that the nice lady had printed 4 boarding passes.  Three for our second flight and 1 for the flight we were about to board.  This left my wife with no boarding pass.  I suspect this was done on purpose maliciously.  We noticed her ""Mistake"" immediately but chose not to return for more abuse from the poor excuse for a AA representative.  I called the customer service line and had to wait only 20 minutes this time (not much going on at 5:00am I guess).  At the same time I positioned myself in front of the desk at the boarding gate and stood there while I was on hold.  The people at the gate finally arrive about the same time a human answered the phone.  They people at the gate were able to correct the ""Mistake"".  I mentioned our seating problem and they started to recite the stock excuses.  I told them I was good and that I didn't need to hear them again.  A short time later they approached my wife and asked that I go to the desk.  I was standing in another area.  When I got up to the desk they offered to change my seat so that I could sit with my wife.  I declined because the experience had worked my wife up to a point that I did not want to be near her.After boarding I could not help but notice all of the empty seats...I had one next to me.  She sat between two strangers.  Please note that she has recently been diagnosed with cancer adding to her fragile mental state.  Thanks AMERICAN."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Biased Airline Ever,"I really hate this airline. I got a round trip ticket from Miami to Austin. This was the only airline at the Miami airport that had a ridiculous longest checkpoint line that I ever had to wait on. Many people missed their flight due to this. I usually never fly through AA. I use either JetBlue or Frontier. On my return trip, the same carry on luggage my sister used with no problem for some reason was a problem on the return trip. Must note we are black. She was pointed out and told she couldn’t use her bag as a carry on. Meanwhile many “White”passengers with huge duffle bags and carry ones just breezed on by without any 2nd look. Now same flight… Our friend whose traveled with is a white women wanted to get on an earlier flight that was completely booked and they were offering $200 vouchers to passengers to give up their flight for a later one. But for some white magical powers… they granted her wish on that completely booked flight. But another black passenger that we knew was denied that same flight when he asked before our white friend. I will never fly this airline again."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,American Airlines has cost us an additional $620… so far.,"I am currently in tears sitting at the airport worried we might miss our flight. We called American Airlines to ask about proof of recovery from covid within 90 days and whether or not that would get us into Italy and were told YES it would and we did NOT need a negative covid test since we had doctor’s notes proving our recovery. At the airport they are now refusing to check us in despite what the agent told us over the phone and we had to spend $500 on rapid tests here at the airport that we hope will give us results in time to make our flight. We also have had our flights cancelled/changed multiple times, the most recent of which was three days ago, and are now out $120 on nonrefundable train tickets that we no longer need since they had to change our flight and airport. We are down $620 that we had saved for sightseeing and don’t know where to turn and are so incredibly disappointed with American Airlines and with what the agents have told us over the phone that has turned out not to be true. This will be the last time flying with them and we won’t stop trying to recover our losses."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,How Is American Airlines In Business?!?!?,"Hands down some of the most idiotic decisions to have ever been made. Our flight was going great, and we even landed early. We pull into a gate, only to realize the gate is broken. A smart person would go to another gate since you have no idea how long it would take to repair the gate. However, we pull into it and wait. After 2 hours, we finally decide to go to another gate since they do not know how long it will take to get fixed. They literally made all of us passengers sit and wait for 2 hours before doing the common sense thing. Almost all passengers missed their next flight if this was a connecting one."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Horrible Horrible Horrible,"American Airlines changed our flight by eight hours, never emailed us, and then when I happened to check the flight two they refused to change the flight to a time that worked for us or credit the return flight if we had to go to another airline. And, oh my, the customer service was horrible, I mean horrible. She was rude, interrupted us regularly, and kept reprimanding us for booking through basic economy and not a higher class ticket that allowed changes. I never received an email about the changes and the customer service agent seemed confused about the eight hour difference, kept telling me it was fifteen minutes and ""negligible""."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Rude or Nonexistent Customer Service,"All airlines occasionally disappoint, but American has the worst customer service I've seen. We were notified two days ago that there was a travel alert for our upcoming flight and to try to rebook on another flight to avoid the east coast storm; for this change there would be no fee. I went online to change to an earlier flight to beat the storm, but it said ""cannot be changed online--please call reservations."" So I did, only to be told that they would call me back within 2-3 hours, which is the time period I had to actually change and take the new flight, and the website showed seats available. So rather than wait for the phone call, I drove to the airport to change it in person and take a flight, to find that the American agents were gone for the night. The nice folks at Alaska Air, adjacent, tried to help, as the first leg was with them, but they said I needed to talk to American reservations. So I sat at the airport waiting for them to call, which they did after 3.5 hours. I explained that I wanted to change to an earlier flight,  which had room, but they said I cannot change this flight because it was using Award Travel. I explained that they were the ones who emailed me and told me to try to change it, and that I was at the airport and there was room on the flight, so she said she'd see what she could do. 35 (35!) minutes later, she came back on to simply say, ""we cannot change it.""I guess award travel recipients don't count as real customers, even though to obtain award travel, one must be pretty loyal to American. Not any more.This was just one of many recent bad stories. I get it that Covid, the labor shortage, inflation, and all makes things difficult, but the other airlines I fly seem to be doing well and taking good care of me."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,No refund giving after missing a Funeral,American Airlines cancel a flight to PVD for a funeral due to weather (understandable) . But what was upsetting is that I got a texted at 2pm stating my flight at 7 is being canceled. Meaning I had to find a flight in the next 5 hours for a funeral that I end up missing out on. ( airport is an hour away)  I feel like AA  should be responsible for the trip due to a devastating mistake on their behalf .  I then also had to pay for a hotel for that night ….
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Mediocre service; airline full of robots who don't know how to be flexible or accommodate,"We flew American Airlines 2x and learned they are not flexible and willing to help.  First our flight got cancelled and when it was automatically rescheduled; they put us from first class to economy seats. The phone rep were not willing to give back the price difference.  Finally at the airport someone switch the seats to first class after asking a supervisor for an approval.  On another flight that was rescheduled we had a $150 credit from an overpayment in a previous flight; not from points. We had three luggages which resulted in a $110 fee; they would not use the $150 credit towards the luggage.   We had to pay out of pocket for the fee.  We ended up upgrading to first class on that flight, which allows you free luggages.  American Airlines would not adjust the luggage fee and would not allow us to use the $150 credit towards the upgrade. We had to pay $400 extra out of pocket.  American Airlines still has the $150 credit and we are saying the hell with them. Never flying AA again! Another disappointment about this airline the food quality was just awful. Saran Wrap sandwiches that was so cold and the bread was so dry. We flew to Hawaii on AA in January 2022 and Hawaiian Airlines April 2021. By far Hawaiian Airlines treated us like first class and had much better food."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Worst airline ever,Not one AA flight runs on time. It’s like running late and keeping people waiting is their USP. Staff is also rude and un-empathetic. Terrible experience. Never boarding this airline again
Date of travel: January 2022,30,No mask,2 gentlemen in 8 B and  8 C were without masks the entire flight. Even after landing one of them did not put on mask. Flight attendants walked past several times. Picked up trash. Said nothing to them.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"Take what they can, give nothing back","Back in 2020, they cancelled my $1000 ticket to Poland because of COVID, refused to give me a refund.Now in 2022, I choose to cancel my flight because I test positive for COVID, they refuse to give me a refund again.This company is greedy and money obsessed with no respect or value for its customers. Do not give them any money because there is clearly no circumstance where they have the integrity to give it back even if they are in the wrong."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,terrible experience,"I traveled to Paris last January 5 and the airline assured me that I did not need a life to enter France and when I arrived the customs of that country took my belongings from me and took me to a detention center without communication for 24 hours the airline did not know was not responsible or responsible for anything that happened despite the fact that I made two claims because they, in addition to giving me incorrect information, let me board the plane"
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Thank you American Airlines for doing the right thing,"I have a good review of American Airlines and their employees, but first let me provide a story with some context.  My husband and I were on the 4:40pm flight from PHX to SAT on 1/25/2022.  What follows here is public information that a passenger bellowed from her seat for everyone around her to hear.  A red headed woman was sitting in row 8 with her husband talking loudly and not wearing a mask.  She kept repeating herself and dropped a few F* bombs, I’m pretty sure there was some alcohol involved.  She said she’s from Cave Creek AZ and she had quit her job at the Marriott because they wanted all employees to get vaccinated.  She also said she hadn’t worn a mask in months, and her opinion was that it’s her choice.  She also bragged that her son had tested positive for Covid, but exhibited no symptoms.  All of this was going on while the flight attendants stopped by several times and asked her to put on her mask and to lower her volume.  Finally the gate attendant came by and asked her to please follow them.  She stood up and stomped off the airplane towards the jet bridge saying, “well I wonder what I did?!?”.  Then yelling and screaming commenced on the jet bridge, with lots of F* bombs.  Then she stomped back on the plane cursing and yelling at her husband that they were kicking her off the plane.  He stood up and asked why, when they explained that she didn’t comply with their several requests to put on a mask,   He said, “she only had it lowered for a minute! Do you have video of her not wearing a mask?”.  Those passengers didn’t return.  I want to commend American Airlines and their employees for making the difficult choice of asking a very disruptive and obnoxious passenger to step off the plane.  I know it wasn’t an easy choice, or an easy situation, but it was the right choice! As for red haired Cave Creek woman, thank you for showing me how NOT to act in public.  You are welcome to spread your germs and your obnoxious opinions, just not on Federal Property or on commercial flights where everyone is required to wear a mask, and respect the people around them. Per FAA regulations and sitting in such close quarters, her actions were very disrespectful to the passengers around her.  Yes you are entitled to your opinion, but not everyone on the plane needs to be subjected to it."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Complete Mayhem During COVID,I booked a flight from Toronto to Cartagena and I had a antigen test done 72 hours before boarding. I had called American Airlines to speak to them about what test I needed and when I needed to book it. American Airlines assured me that an antigen test 72 hours prior to my flight was acceptable. I went to check in and the kiosk lady told me I needed a PCR test to get into Colombia and I needed a test done 24 hours prior to my departure. This is not what they had told me over the phone. So I had to rush and switch my flight and book a PCR test so I could leave the next day. American Airlines did not offer to upgrade my seat or find me a place to stay so I will be spending my 24 hours at the front of the airport. THE ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED. Spoke to a customer service agent named Joe over the phone who couldn’t offer me anything to help me out in my situation that their employees put me in. Please reconsider flying with someone else when flying.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,No refund for cancelled flights. Misinformation and aggression from agents.,"First of two connecting flights was cancelled. Told it would be refunded, in addition to an alternative travel fee. Instead ended up driving 5 hours in the pitch black in a snow storm to make the connecting flight.Couldn't initiate a refund on their website, eventually talked to 4 different representatives across the span of a month, 2 of which said they had already ""handled it"" on their end. Refund never came... Called a final time and an agent (with extreme attitude before I had even described the situation) told me they ""don't do refunds for cancelled flights, and can't keep documentation unless you have an active reservation,"" (so I had to describe the scenario every single time...). They also said an agent can't do the things the others promised they had already done. So I've heard three different things from 4 different people, and paid for flights they never provided after wasting many hours trying to sort this out. Truly, never fly this airline if you can avoid it."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Garbage Airline,"Worst customer service, and airline service I have experienced these past six months .  I feel awful for leaving Delta !! So rude zero empathy!!  You hate your job quit!!!! I have not had one flight where I can say you people have been great!!"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Had to cancel my flight because of covid,"Not only did I have to deal with not going on vacation, I got a credit of $952 with AA.   I’m trying to book a local vacation and they won’t allow me to book a ticket in mine and my husbands name.   They are so uncaring and I WILL NOT book with them again. You’d think with Covid they would be more understanding.   I tried to post on their Facebook page and they declined my post."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,What they say is NOT what they do.,"Posted on their website, and repeated by their agents :  ""If your flight is cancelled by us, you will receive a full refund"".   NO. You WON'T.  Our flight was cancelled and we were given an 18 hour ""new"" flight itinerary that was completely obnoxious and not realistic. The agent told us we did not have to accept the ""new"" flight as it was not something they could hold us to. She said since the airline cancelled the flight we were eligible for a full refund. She gave us a ticket-like document and a phone number to call with a website to request a refund.  We attempted to use the money as a credit by calling the 800-843-3447 number, and in the middle of re-booking the agent hung up on us. Twice. We decided to wait for the refund, and booked another flight with our credit card.  The new day of travel, American emails us to say our ticket is not eligible for a refund. No appeal website, no customer service number-just a notice that they essentially are stealing our money and making it our problem to try and get it back.  I have not flown AA in 20 years-and if we weren't forced to fly with them because of a limited window, we would never have done this and it's all coming back to me why we never, ever, trust AA and will never make this mistake again-even in 20 years."
Date of travel: January 2022,30,Left extranded in SFO,"Saturday I was going to fly to Colorado for a small get a way with my wife, after I was working hard with sick patients.I arrived with 1 hour to the San Francisco airport and I was informed that the flight was closed and that I couldn't board at that time.My Westie Blizzard  was with me like the always (he is a frequent flyer) since he joined my family. He weighs 16 pounds and travels as a pet in cabin under the seat. You have to see how good he behaves and enjoys the travel.Mr. Edward Garcia (american airlines costumer service) weighed my pet and told me he was fine to travel and we proceeded to re book the reservation for the following Sunday.I went back home that is an hour and a half away, made some phone calls to rearrange my vacation and proceeded to drive in Sunday morning to SFO and arrived to the counter and Mr. Edward Garcia was serving it. I thought that I was lucky since he knew what happened and expected to go by fast and easy.Big mistake. He told me that my dog couldn't fly because he was to big; surprise!!!I asked him how come that the day before it was fine and 24 hours latter with the same pet and carry on it wasn't.He didn't like the inquire and started becoming nasty and condescending. I keep my cool and proceeded to ask for an explanation and a solution and all his ideas were poor thought trough and impossible to accomplish.The first one was to ask someone to come to the airport to pick up the dog. I explained him that i live 1.5 hours away from the airport and if i manage to convince someone to come the flight would be gone by then.Things got better when he proposed that i drive the dog home and dropped him off. I guess his math skills are not very good because that would take 3 hours to accomplish.The last one was the best one; He told me as the greatest idea that he would let me take the dog to Colorado but he would write in the computer to advise that he couldn't fly back.That is one of the most absurd ideas that I have some one propose.My pet is part of my family and of course I wouldn't do that, This is like asking you to leave one of your children behind.He got mad when i pointed out the absurdity of his idea and became condescending and insulting to finally as a punishment disallowing me to get my flight.I wish I had recorded the interaction with this person to show the world how poor the costumer service American has and how inconsistent their employees follow policy depending on their mood or God knows what.Not only I lost my money, 1400 for airfare, hotel (900), activities,(500) but I had to buy my wife a hotel in Phoenix and an extra ticket to 500 cost to come here and most valuable, my time.I wrote an email to their costumer service and I really hope they get this individual to do some training and anger management classes to improve his persona."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,The most unreliable Airline I’ve flown,Avoid this American Airlines and pay extra to travel Southwest or Delta if at all possible. They have canceled our last 2 flights from Milwaukee to Chicago with less than an hours notice. Will never fly with them again.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Horrible Experience,Spirit Airline was fantastic so when I flew with American Airlines the difference in service was immediately apparent. The staff was so incredibly rude and unhelpful. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.
Date of travel: January 2022,30,"Make it easy to do business with, Please!","I had a terrific experience with the crew on these flights.BUT>>>Why does Ameican Airlines make it so difficult to get a copy of a past ticket/invoice?  Really, I need to email you the ticket number to get this information (make it easy to business with you)?  United makes it so easy for me in my profile to get this information.  I would fly American much more and one of the reasons why I'm 1K on United."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Injured while traveling in July,I slipped on a water spill that wasn’t cleaned up promptly and there was no signs. I was pregnant and still haven’t received any word on the airline accepting responsibility for my fall or injury. Be advised while traveling with them!  I was also traveling with my toddler who could have been injured.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Flight Delayed,"Flying from Minneapolis in the winter often requires deicing the plane. Currently I'm on a flight that was supposed to leave at 6:00 a.m. It is now 7:31 a.m. were still waiting to be deiced. The pilot said the crew had the wrong mixture of deicing fluid in there tanks...That the temperature was too cold....Do they not premix there tanks ahead of time, do they not look at the forecast to see what the overnight temperature will be? They have told the pilot it will be another 15 minutes wait 6 different times. We are on our way to Costa Rica  and will now be missing our connection.....Thank You American Airlines for your great service!!! HA. Thank you for lying to all the passengers on this plane!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Awful Service for Brazilian Passengers by the Crew - Péssimo Atendimento,"American Airlines is simply the worst airline I have ever flown with. On my outbound flight to the US, I pre paid for a comfort seat which was an additional US700.00 more for that, turns out they had mechanical problems and couldn’t fit me in any flight with available Comfort seats. So we had to take regular seats and had to take additional connection flight. the service was appalling both at check in São Paulo and on board, the crew treats customers very poorly, as well as  that the treatment they give to Brazilian customers is totally different from the one received by Americans. Even the Brazilian crew is rude, they just  throw food on top of you.  I travel to the United States at least 4 times a year, and I have never been so humiliated on a flight, I only chose you this time because you had one Fastest routes to my final destination and I was in a hurry to be in New Orleans, I was supposed to have had arrived at 10:00 am and instead I arrived at 7:00 pm, I was supposed to go from São Paulo/Miami/Miami New Orleans, but was sent to New York after Miami and then New Orleans, this associated with the bad service made our trip very incredibly difficult and disappointing. I realized that the service they provide for Americans is totally different from what they do for Brazilians, if you don't like our people, don't come here to get our money.  I would like to be reimbursed for the difference on the ticket I was given because it was not what I bought, I didn't even mark the miles because I hope I never get on one of your aircraft again."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,ABSOLUTE WORST AIR TRAVEL EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!  DO NOT FLY AMERICAN!,"Horrible service. Disorganized, poor communication, understaffed, and rude unhelpful customer service. Unreliable updates with constantly changing excuses. A colleague made the entire trip on another airline in significantly less time than I spent stranded in Charlotte airport. 3 separate flights cancelled or significantly delayed. Over 18 hours stuck in the airport for a 30 min. connecting flight. No rental cars available. No accommodations offered and refused on request. Slept on the floor with many other stranded American Airlines customers. Choose another airline if you value your time."
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Terrible service and quality,"Although I appreciate the safety AA provides for passengers in the air, this is typically a low bar given the safety standards for the industry. I'm particularly frustrated with the random changes of flight times for nonrefundable flights. Why force someone to purchase a nonrefundable flight and then change the time? What if we can no longer make the new time? That should allow us to refund the ticket. The planes themselves are old and dirty. Delta is such an incredible alternative and I wish they had a hub in Philly."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Claim your miles? Really?,"I became a member, log into my account, buy some tickets, travel, and then they ask me to claim my miles? Really? Why don't you just add the stupid miles one shot? When I go to claim my miles, is the most complicated crap I've ever done. Why wouldn't you just add my miles after buying from my member account? Obviously because they don't want you to claim no miles. That's why I'm not traveling with you anymore. Stop making fun of people by ""claim your miles"" who wouldn't want to claim their miles? Such a shame."

Date of travel: January 2022,50,Springfield Mo to Dallas TX to Burbank CA.,"This was a split trip....half was first class and half was economy. Oddly I had the same crew on both outbound and inbound flights.I fly a lot and use various airlines. This trip was really nice. Made so by the crew.They were just as nice and polite to people in the economy section as they were in the first class. They were friendly, helpful and (it may sound tacky) clothed properly. So often the uniforms are so tight and ill fitting it is uncomfortable. This crew were neat, tidy and presented a good image for American Airlines.They worked well together. Obviously enjoyed their work and it showed.This is not always the case. Many flights I have had this has not been the case.Hats off to the entire crew of AA#2599 and AA#1208, January 18th and 19th to Burbank from Dallas/DFW..... I hope to fly with you all again.You helped to make a stressful business trip less stressful."

""It's 11 minutes beforehand!"" we said.  She distracted us for another minute saying things like ""Well the crew is really pushing to go on this flight"" and then "" 10 minutes beforehand, the computer locks us out so there's nothing I can do any more"". Really caused problems for me as well as my wife and her family waiting for us since it was the last flight out that night. This lady had ice water in her veins."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Worst airline experience in 20 years of flying,"Avoid at all costs. Booked 11:20am flight from Sydney > Los Angeles > Dallas. 7pm the evening before I get an email to say my connecting flight from LA to Dallas has been booked at a later time because my Sydney to Los Angeles flight has been delayed. I logon to AA website and see estimated departure time has changed from 11:20am to 9:30pm, a delay of over 9 hours.I called as the booking still said 11:20am but estimated change to 930pm. As it is the night before the flight, obviously concerned about plans for the following day. The customer service representative assures me the flight has been delayed to 930pm and will not fly at 11:20am as scheduled. At this point the flight shows estimated departure 930pm and am assured by customer service it is now a 930pm departure which is why they also changed my flight from LAX to Dallas to a 9 hour later flight.I wake up in the morning and at 8am get a text to say my flight is now departing at 11:20am. As I required a PCR test before boarding there is obviously no chance of making this flight.I call customer service. They tell me the flight is 11:20am and that there was never any change more or less politely suggesting that I either made a mistake or am lying. I logon to my AA flight and it shows 11:20am, no reference to 930pm anywhere. Luckily, I still had the tab open in my browser and I can get a screenshot showing 930pm. After taking the screenshot, I refresh the browser and the 930pm reference disappears.The muppets at AA suggest an new booking. Now they want me to fly from Sydney to Melbourne, Melbourne to Los Angeles, Los Angeles to Dallas with between 4 and 6 hour stop overs at each destination (not to mention the 4 or 5 hours including PCR test at airport before the first flight). I say no, please book next direct flight to LA (next day). So they do.. and then... half hour after booking... a new email from AA... ''your flight has been delayed and you may not make your connecting flight''... now going through exactly the same thing again.. I am now phoning customer service requesting they book me with another airline (Qantas maybe?) that has some idea of how an airline.I understand times are difficult and unpredictable. The insulting part was suggesting that none of this ever happened and that my flight was always 11:20am and being absolutely unapologetic about their own incompetence.I would never fly or recommend this airline to anyone."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Disgusting customer service.,Easily the worst airline I have ever been on. Disgusting customer service.

Date of travel: January 2022,20,Bad Customer Service,"The stewardess named Jasmine was extremely rude and DRILLED me about my medium sized PURSE on the floor. Purse was there the whole flight, about 3 hours of a flight from LAX to O'Hare, and tells me at very end it needs to go up in top shelf storage. Doesn't even politely ask me. Mind you, this is first class seating. I look behind me and there's another lady with 2 bags twice size I have sitting right on her lap and ""Jasmine"" never says a word. When i asked her name, she replied ""Jasmine!"" with an attitude and eye roll, then tells me she has my name as well. Very immature, and being a smart Alex about it. So rude. It reminded me of an 18 yr olds attitude coming from a mid 40 yr old looking woman. She had strawberry colored hair with bangs. I think she had glasses on, but that's what I got for paying for a first class seat, a 45 yr old looking woman who acts like an 18 yr old drill sargent. Couldn't wait to get off flight and dreaded if she was going to be on the next one. Thank goodness she wasn't! Not first time had bad customer service with AA."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Absolute garbage airline.,"I have never had a good experience with them. Today was the last straw. Delayed our first flight, which caused us to miss our connection. Fine. Sat for 3 hours after they confirmed the new flight. We went to board, and they told us we were never actually put on it despite having digital confirmation. Everyone we talked to was super nasty; they blamed us for missing the connection (as if we caused the delayed flight) and not magically knowing what to do despite no direction and employees deliberately saying they won't help us (or holding a phone to their ear that didnt ring and saying nothing until we just walked away). This was in the terminal and at the service desk. We had to sit again for another several hours before we even got on a flight. Missed worked today on top of having to pay way too much money for breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the airport. I will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Wonderful customer service,My husband had a major spinal surgery at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. He was in the hospital and rehab for 4 weeks. We live in Oregon. When it was time to fly home I was very worried about the logistics since he was still weak. We had wheelchair assistance set up all the way through. From the time our transportation pulled up to American arrival area to the time we departed in Oregon we felt American provided exceptional service. Every employee was friendly and helpful. This was a very stressful time for us and we couldn't have  been more pleased. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.David and Sandra Smith

Service dogs can fly without a kennel and free of charge, fyi. I gave all the appropriate documentation, records and IDs needed for both my service dog and i to the woman who was checking us in and she still charged me $125. Which i paid without complaining because all i wanted was an easy and stress free check in process. Which failed, epically. Once the transactions were finally done and i proceeded to walk towards the TSA line when the AA employee behind the desk starts to yell “white girl! Excuse me, white girl!” Someone in line grabs my arm and says “i think the woman behind the desk is trying to get your attention” I had no idea she was speaking to me because I am not a white girl. I’m a biracial woman who speaks three different Languages. Anyway, I turn around and walk back to the desk in the employee continues to carry on with a horrible, heartless and hasty attitude with me (which I’m still not understanding why) and says “you can’t get on the plane without paying for one of your bags” all i had was a personal item and a very small carry-on . So to avoid an argument I handed her my debit card and she rolls her eyes at me and states “cash only” At this point and became very uncomfortable and told her that I was going to check the bag they were going to charge me for it and just fly with my service dog. Fast forwarding, I got to my gate 2 1/2 hours early, when it came down to boarding everyone in front of me slid their ticket and processed to walk thru the gate. HOWEVER! When he came to me the girl snatches my ticket out of my hand and states “your ticket had been cancelled” when I asked her why she says with an attitude, “call AA customer Service” and the walked away and left me at the gate dumbfounded and 100 questions. So i called American Airlines and the rep told me in the comments it stated “my ticket was canceled because I missed my flight”I arrived at the airport 5hrs early. Got to my gate with 3hrs extra to kill. The plane was still at the gate when i called AA 1-800 number. So, how in the world does that qualify as a missed flight??? How can the the employee get away with lying and putting me through all that stress without getting in any kind of trouble??? But instead everything in that situation was taken away from me. How is this fair or even morally ok for AA to do?? All I wanted to do was fly home to my terminally ill mother and i never made it. I spent so much money between my ticket $400, $125 for the registered service dog, $55 for the kennel, $100 for parking (nonrefundable), $40 in Uber rides to and from the airport. Not a single dime reimbursed to me. AA said they will not refund my money. How is this possible!? I’m so confused and hurt by this. As if we all are not going thru enough stressful hard times already. No need to add extra stress that can be totally avoided. Especially when the other person (me) is NOT being combative or confrontational. Sad part of all this, this is the short version of what happened. PsAmerican Airlines, you guys should be ashamed on how you treat your pain customers. If it wasn’t for our money your company wouldn’t be as successful as it is today."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Terrible,"American Airlines is always delayed. This specific flight was delayed from the start when a member of their staff showed up late so we all had to wait past boarding time, then has been delayed over 1.5 hours due to air conditioning issues. The issue was supposed to take 15 minutes, it’s concerning it takes this much longer and the issue is only identified as we are supposed to leave. Always something with American Airlines. Unacceptable and terrible consumer experience."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,American airlines,American airline sucks. Can't wear a neck gator for some odd reason. Have to wear masks grrrr what's the difference. If mask and shots work so great how come there is shortage on TSA workers they wear mask and were forced to take the shot. But they work right?
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Delayed Flight,We got to the airport and was checked in an hour before boarding time. Flight was delayed twice. Missed our connecting flight due to the delay. The next flight was 7 hours later at 7am.  American Airlines stated they would not pay for accommodations overnight due to it was the airport fault and not theirs. However we paid our money to fly with them. No apologies and then when we asked for our bags they stated we would have to wait outside for hours to get them.  So basically your flight was delayed and its not our fault so get it how you live tonight with no cloths or items to clean yourselves.  Poor customer service. Its not the customers fault either. American airlines should take care of their customers better. Using Orlando airport as a cop out not to pay for hotels is ridiculous. Never flying with them again. We have never been treated so horribly.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Complete incomplete,Orlando Airport is Disorganized cluster f….. And American is the most incompetent airlines I have ever used. Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Please call there customer service number and stay on hold for 6 hours. This is the truth 6 hours to talk to these morons. And you get a guy on the phone that speaks 6 languages not one is English. Flipping Geniuses.

The airport is easy to navigate and easy to enter and exit. American flies several flights per day into this airport. Our flight was about 30 minutes and was uneventful. The flight attendant was great and all went well."
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Early Morning Flight with American Staff Fixing a Flight Change For Me,"My trip started off with American changing my flight from Oklahoma City to an early morning flight. This was good, but it would result in a six-hour plus layover before my next flight. The representative at the bag check-in helped me get an earlier flight on the second leg and I was on my way. The AA team was polite and courteous. The flight attendants did a nice job as well. Very satisfied again with AA."

Date of travel: January 2022,20,The Airline Travel Industry...Luxury to Loser,"Flights - MEM to PHX to HNL. Dates Jan 6-15, 2022. Purpose - Honeymoon 2nd time around for the both of us. Very first individual we experience during the security check-in was beyond rude, disrespectful and had the worst sour attitude. She was a TSA female agent at 4:45amCST (check-in). Had she been my employee she would've been terminated before 5am. There is a way to be diplomatic without being disrespectful. AA needs to teach their employees etiquette and manners. They act like nothing but a bunch of entitled, lazy idiots. And this is what the aging population is left with to come up behind us. Ridiculous!"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Terrible travel back home !!,"Took a 7 day vacation to St. Thomas from Philadelphia. It was a round trip ticket and on the way back was absolutely terrible! They delayed the flight a total of 8 times. We were suppose to board at 3:30 and they continuously delayed the flight from 3:30 pm 1/16/2022 to 10:00 am 1/17/2022z. After sitting in the airport since 12 on the 16th. They want to claim bad weather, but the weather didn’t start until 6. And had we originally boarded, we would have made it way before the storm even started. Then instead of paying for our hotel, they tell us we are gonna get reimbursed for our overnight unexpected hotel stay. I know that isn’t likely at all. The worst part is that I actually saw the bad reviews for this airline but decided to try them anyway because they were the only non stop flight to St. Thomas when we booked the trip 4 months ago. Definitely learned my lesson and will NEVER book a flight with them again and I mean that!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Another Horrible Experience with American Airlines,"We were leaving Toronto to visit our family after 2.5 years. We had done our research on the COVID-19 requirements for Jordan, and had obtained our RT-PCR tests. When arriving at the counter, we were greeted with unfriendly and rude staff that told us they cannot accept our test results because it was an 'RT-PCR' and not a 'PCR'. They claimed that the RT stood for rapid test (which it does not). We called the Jordanian airport and confirmed that they would accept our results. We also called the lab and they confirmed that the RT-PCR was not a rapid test and was accepted. Despite this, we were rudely told that this was not the staff's problem and they had been given explicit instructions from their management not to let anyone through. They mentioned that if they were to let people through and Jordan sent them back, they would have to deal with the costs. We spoke to 5 different team members, all of which treated us disrespectfully, even rolling their eyes at one point. We were with 5 other passengers running into this same issue, one of which was travelling to see her mother prior to her surgery. They showed absolutely no compassion for any of this. The worst part of all this was that one of the American Airlines employees told us to alter the document to remove RT and they will be able to let us on the flight. What a joke of an airline!We ended up having to cancel our trip and were told that our re-fund would show up in 6 - 8 weeks. We booked another flight on Emirates that same day, they accepted our results and we were able to get into Jordan successfully with absolutely no issue. We are still waiting for our refund, and despite us having 0 control over this, we had to pay a cancellation fee.We will never be taking American Airlines again, the slightly lower price is not worth it and often ends up with more of a headache. We have also shared this story with our family and friends to ensure this ""airline"" will not get their business."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Expect Delays and Expect Disappointment,"Someone forgot to tell American Airlines that part of being a travel company is being on time. I just finished an international journey that took me toultiple European countries and an island. I took a total of 8 flights and only 2 we're delayed. Both of those were the tiny 1 hour flight that American Airlines runs between Minneapolis and Chicago. On the way to Europe they delayed our flight by 3 hours and we barely made our connection to London. On the way back they decided to delay our flight 4 hours. Although we don't have to worry about catching an international flight, it is still a huge annoyance. If I had a choice I would never fly with them again. American Airlines does not care for my trip nor for my time."
Date of travel: January 2022,40,Satisfied Traveler,"I flew from Rochester NY to Tampa with brief layovers in Charlotte, NC. My flight s were on time, service was friendly and helpful, and my baggage was quickly available. I read on my flights so didn't use the wifi. My flight experience was easy and seem less."
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Terrible experience from Miami to London,"Well, what can I say about AA (American Airlines), firstly I would liken the reader to note I very rarely write reviews as I am fairly laid back and most things goes however the inflight entertainment does not work on this 7 hour flight and I quite frankly became unbelievably bored and needed something to fill my time so here we go. To start with a number of the staff particularly at checking and a few on the plane where particularly grumpy and unhelpful providing little information leaving plenty of room for interpretation; you can compare their demeanour too Ross (the angry slug lady) from monster.INC, I was able to watch this film as after three attempts of restarting the entertainment system only the children movies worked. Now we come to the food which was somewhat questionable; I never really expect high quality food in the air however AA should consider having words with their meal planner as this menu did take the biscuit compared to other airline meals, I have had the pleasure of tasting.  To start with they the provided an option for the chicken or pasta (very descriptive options) I went for the chicken of which was included sting like bits of chicken with what I assume was giant cuscus or bulgur wheat which resembled and provided the mouth feel of eating frog spawn. The miniscule tub of lettuce had the appearance of three-week-old lettuce which had somehow retained its crunch must have been radioactive, this roughly 15gram salad was accompanied by a 43 gram sachet of salad dressing; the AA food planner has an unusually ratio of dressing to salad you might as well drink it if using the whole sachet! The additional items included a alterative brand dairylea triangle which was politely labelled as gourmet cheese of which I found relatively amusing by this stage. The mini bread roll provided was inedible as it was cold and very dense (with comparable density to pellets we fed to alligators in Gatorland a few days prior) neither me or my travel companion managed a quarter of this dense bland doughy bread roll, if you can even call it a bread roll. The saving grace of the meal which is an run of the mill cinnamon Churro roll. Throughout the flight passing air hostesses happened to crash into our isle at every opportunity and did not drive the cart with the gracefulness you would expect from Dominic Tureto in fast and furious 9 or so I have been told as the viewing privileges for this movie were unavailable. Here's to hoping the rest of the flight goes well and I am able to collect my bag on departure!"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,The most difficult process of my life,"American Airlines has to be the worst airlines ever. I wasn’t going to write this initially just because I’ve never felt the need to write a review until recently. On 27DEC21 AA decided to cancel our flight back to WA the day before our departure with my wife. We then called AA to which they said we could file for a refund and expect a reimbursement 7-10 business days. We spent the whole day being placed on hold and fighting for flights because it wasn’t in our control the flight was canceled to begin with. We finally get a representative who then tells us that we have to purchase new tickets and due to the holidays the tickets we had purchased months in advance were now going for 3 to 5 times as much. AA did nothing to help and even tried to scam us out of our tickets, telling us we had to purchase new tickets saying we had canceled our tickets with the first representative we spoke to. The morning of our flight we woke up from a call from a waitlist we were expecting from another agency and when we had checked AA it said our original flight was now still on time! Being in a panic we called AA hoping we could resolve this issue at 1AM as we’d have to leave in another 2-3 hours to even catch this flight. Luckily the fifth representative we spoke to was helpful and then sent us a link to get us on another flight back to WA. This does not make up for the four previous representatives who not only did not help us but practically tried to scam my wife and I for another couple hundred dollars each. I would not recommend AA to anyone down the line, your time is not worth their prices. I’ve had multiple instances with AA like this and I hope that this saves someone from having to go through the trouble we did."
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Excellent flight from Philly to Palm Beach,Long trip from Prague and went through london to Philly and on to Palm Beach.  So tired but comfortable in first class with American Airlines.  Great service.  Plane left early and arrived in Palm Beach 31 minutes early which was terrific.  Got my luggage quickly.  Will fly with American again....I fly quite often and find myself flying with American or Delta most of the time.
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Great flight from London to Philladelphia,great flight from London to Philly.  Flight left early and landed early.  Loved my seat and the service was excellent.

Date of travel: March 2021,10,Should've never flown with American,"We were booked on a round trip vacation and call to see if we could change the time over our flights. We were told that it would cost an additional $100 each which we gladly paid. After 10 days in Palm springs we went to the airport to return back to New York to find that they had canceled the rest of our itinerary. It costs me another $550 for two new tickets. After returning home, I contacted customer service and was treated like a criminal. They insisted that by changing the time of our ticket we had canceled our itinerary. Even after I sent all of the tickets boarding passes and receipts they still insisted that they had done nothing wrong. Obviously if they had told us that by paying them $100 for each ticket change the time that it would cancel the rest of our ticket that we had already paid for we wouldn't have bothered. They refused to do anything to make good on this. After dozens of emails back and forth with condescending customer service for relation (Adrienne Treet) indigesture of what they considered great magnanimity, they returned the portion of our ticket that was unused. However, when we went to use that portion we were told that because of the fees involved the ticket was worthless. WHAT A SCAM. THEY WERE NOT ONLY RUDE AND INSULTING, THEY CHEATED US ALL ACROSS ALL ACROSS THE BOARD.It makes me sick at the idea that I would ever have to step one to another American flight."

Date of travel: January 2022,10,Worst Delays Ever,"My wife was supposed to arrive at 0945 in Jacksonville, but now won't arrive until after 5. This airline is awful.

Date of travel: January 2022,10,"Pathetic Service, Miserable Experience","Don’t ever fly with American. I only do so out of absolute necessity and I’m let down every time. There’s rampant maintenance issues with their fleet, and they consistently have made me miss layovers. Maybe don’t do business if your planes are never ready to travel. Poor follow up and instruction whenever they do inconvenience you (which is all the time). No apologies or offer to help locate your checked bags, just overall bad company."
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Very Accomodating,"American Airlines was a great choice for our flight from Lima to the US.

Date of travel: January 2022,10,Review is for bookaahotels -,"When making hotel reservations you will be dealing with topoffers@bookaahotels.com.  I had to modify my hotel arrival date by 1 day due to a delay in obtaining my PCR-test results. Contacted the 'concierge ' desk and "" they would put in a request with the other desk.."" and get back to me within 24hrs??? I was supposed to be on site in 24hrs. Never heard anything back.  3 emails, 3 phone calls later still no action. Upon arrival, my reservation was canceled.  According to the Courtyard Mariott front desk rep 'by a third-party'. I also want to stress the false advertising of the cancellation and refund policy on the AA website versus the booking confirmation details!!  Moreover,  my credit card was charged in full the moment I made the reservation!! This was my first and last booking I will EVER make via AA. For all I know,  I am out $1,602.00."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,REfund polisy is a JOKE,Due to pandemic I cancelled the 2nd part (return flight) once I finished the first flight also because of the poor service the airline provided as often I got airlines credit of $500+  shown on the cancellation page with this restrictions 1. Only the same passenger can use the credit for rebook2. Expiration of the credit $  is less than 4 months It is equal to no refund to me as it is quite impossible for the lockdown to reopen for canadian people to fly out so soon   It is absolutely unfair  Credit usually never expire like cash or minimun acceptable time frame should be 12 months
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Jamaica no bags,"Use Delta if you can. This is my first and hopefully last time flying with y’all. Arrived in Jamaica on the 12th… it’s the 13th evening and our bags are sitting at the airport while we’re at Beaches Ocho Rios. Per online, bags have been sitting there for four hours. This is crazy. We had a very long layover in Dallas so our bags should have been on plane first. This is awful for our first international experience."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Least possible customer service!,"I was at the scheduled date on time, 55 minutes before my flight departure. Waited for 45 minutes so they send a shuttle to send us to the actual gate in LAX. When we arrived at the gate 52I, the flight was gone. They suggested to book me another flight with AA, 14 hours after my original flight which I definitely couldn't use! And after a month, they gave me a credit of 80% of what I paid in CREDIT!

Customer Service in airport (help desk) and by phone not helpful at all. I won't be traveling with this airline again. I traveled with my dog  by cargo and planned ahead for almost a month to have all vet paperwork and schedule our flight. Called customer service (3 times) to help me schedule my dog flight (cargo), information given to me was wrong (I was informing them based on AA online page ) not helpful.

Date of travel: January 2022,20,One Felt They Just Couldn't Be Bothered,"Unfortunately our return flight to the UK with BA was cancelled at short notice and we were shunted onto a flight with their Partner airline, American.We were unable to check in online because American was not showing our hold baggage on our booking.  Luckily we had the paperwork from our original booking with British Airways, including the receipt of payment for an extra bag, and the member of staff on the check in desk agreed to honour it.My other half and I had not been seated together, despite being on the same booking reference.  We approached staff at the boarding gate, who jiggled things round and put us on the same row.We flew Economy on a 787.  Leg room okay for Economy, seats uncomfortable.  Entertainment package basic, but good enough.An announcement pre-takeoff regarding the imperative to wear masks throughout the flight, except when eating or drinking, was poorly enforced by crew; a gentleman a couple of rows in front of us was without a mask for the majority of the flight.When flying over with British Airways, due to there being no menu cards (Covid), an announcement was made, explaining the meal choices to passengers.  No such announcement with American Airlines, crew pushed the cart down the aisle, asking curtly 'chicken or pasta?' - chicken what? pasta what?I chose chicken - pieces of meat in a tangy red sauce served with mushy grains, which was horrid.  A tired salad, hard roll and a triangle of cheese with a couple of biscuits.  The only tasty thing was a churros cake.On the in-seat screens, under food and drink, a wide range of beverages was said to be available but, when my other half asked for a gin and tonic, he was told that no alcohol was being served, other than wine or beer.I struggle to sleep, if at all, on flights.  With other airlines on overnight flights, cabin crew regularly walk through the cabin, identifying passengers who are awake and offer them drinks.  I barely saw the crew throughout the night.  In fact, other than a small bottle of water given to every passenger, there was no water or drinks offered outside meal times.  Luckily we had filled water bottles in the airport before boarding, but they were soon empty.Breakfast, on a 9 hour, overnight flight, consisted of a paper sandwich bag containing a yogurt, a small pack of granola and a fig roll.  No carton of juice, other than on the cart and no top ups.I appreciate that Covid has significantly changed air travel, but it did very much feel as if crew were using it as an excuse to step back and be largely absent.We emerged from the flight exhausted, dehydrated and determined never to fly with American Airlines again."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Zero customer service,"AA lost my bag and it is impossible to speak to a live agent to resolve the issue. I have been placed on hold several times for 2+ hours, only to have the agent transfer my call to be placed on hold for another 2+hours. They give the option to call back, but do not call back. I have been unable to contact them for four days. Avoid this airline. They are short staffed and it shows. Customer service is the worst."

Date of travel: January 2022,10,Just Another Number,"I will never fly with this airline ever again! Their customer service is complete trash. They do not put the customer first at all. I wasn’t able to make any updates or changes to a pre-existing ticket on my mobile app or from their website. We got tech-support involved anf They couldn’t figure out the issue. In addition, they could not give me any due date as to when the problem could be fixed. So they told me that I needed to create a whole new reservation.I told him that’s fine just give me my refund and I will look for a flight later. They would not give me a refund because they said they didn’t want me going to any competitor airline and then I had to make a change right then and there, Mind you it’s 12 AM. They also said that if I didn’t make a change now they can’t communicate to another supervisor my issue and that that supervisor would handle the situation how he wanted.I was very upset because they weren’t thinking about me the customer they were only thinking about themselves the company. He kept saying I needed to give him a valid reason as to why I needed a refund. My reason was I was offered a service and I was promised certain benefits from using their airline and I wasn’t given That. Therefore, if they are not keeping up with their side of the bargain then I deserve my refund. He wouldn’t accept it.So how did it end? Well since American Airlines wasn’t able to figure out why their system wasn’t working they told me that I had to buy a whole new ticket and hopefully that would resolve the problem. That and I rely on having that flexibility as a customer mainly because my schedule shifts around often.I felt like my hand was definitely forced.So I had to buy a new flight which was $30 more than my original ticket because that was my best option at the time. Entire experience just made my blood boil. I really did not feel valued as a customer and felt like I was just another number. Therefore I choose not to use this airline ever again I will be looking into their competitors a lot more for any future or upcoming flights."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Rude and impatient customer service reps after American Airline late flight caused a misconnection,American Airlines plane broke down I missed my connection which is fine it happened. But when I went to the customer service desk they talked to me like I was a dog or a three-year-old. It was absolutely no compassion very little information an attitude of impatience and actually at one point nastiness in their tone of voice and like a mother talking to the child will go get something to eat and just calm down. Seriously I'm a 70 year old doctor and I'm trying to solve the problem that was caused by the airline's? And this is how you handle it. And by the way yes they had a small group of people lined up maybe 15 or 20 and at one point about eight of them left because they figured something out themselves. So it wasn't like they were mobbed and about 10 minutes later when I walked by again they were completely quiet and they weren't working they were just hanging out. So I don't see any reason for people who are supposed to be hired to solve problems for the consumer to be acting this way. I have never gone out of my way to write a complaint like this but this deserves attention because they need to train their people. If you're hired for customer service and to solve problems we need the personality to do it as well as the skill set
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"dirty plane, wrong bag claim area","TSA staff were very rude at Las Vegas. American Airlines flight attendants said bags would be at B5,but they were at A 29. So we were locked out of terminal.. Had to take employees shuttle to terminal.  3 staff that I told about the wrong information given us, never apologized. Southwest will get our business from here on.The flight attendants are not very friendly ever either. Plane was not sanitized,  as tray tables had dirty stains from prior guests. Must buy internet use. No movie I pads. Just use your phone. Someone played loud candy crush game without flight attendants caring. But they did jump passengers whose nose stuck out lol. now we have covid or flu day of dirty flight."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Appalling service - management and staff,"I called my travel agent to book the flights and I was told to avoid AA/BA at all cost due to bad reviews and anecdotes. However, I wanted to give it a try anyway and went ahead and booked tickets. This is when the nightmare started. I realized after booking, its a mistake on my part, that only one check-in bag was allowed and had to pay extra for additional while other airlines offered 2 check-in bags for free. This does explain why the pricing was a little better than others. Then, while trying to choose seats, you have to pay extra to seat my family together, seriously? I then wanted to choose meal preference which I couldn't do online and had to call customer service. I had to be on hold for 2.5 hours to be told that I can't choose until 30 days of travel. I waited a few days and called with in 30 days, again 2.5 hours hold time, but I was able to get meal preferences changed. However, that was only for one leg of the journey and only one way. I was asked to call AA on a separate number to change the preferences for that leg of that journey. That was one whole day on the phone just to change meal preferences - one way. Next, during the day of travel my family arrive at airport 4 hours early and there is a big line for check-in. There were only 2-3 crew members checking in at snail pace. I am not sure if you are poor in planning for customer load or just plain apathetic to their time. So far this has been a consistent theme I have observed through out. Thank fully they just made it in at exact time of boarding - that was 4 hours of just standing. In the midst of this confusion they were only issued boarding passes until layover destination. They were told they will be issued the next boarding passes at next destination. After they arrive in there they were not allowed to board the next flight because they didn't have the boarding passes. Even there, just to speak to customer service they had to wait in a long line by that time the flight had departed. By the time someone paid attention to them it was 2 hours after the flight had departed. They were told it was their mistake to not have obtained the boarding passes which left them more confused. Eventually it was sorted out and reached the destination 30 hours late.We will be telling this story to everyone who plan to travel with AA. My niece who was part of family travelled made a joke at the end saying if you need to scare children you don't have to speak of ghosts or monsters, you can just say I will put you on a AA flight. I feel that is totally true."

With American Airlines, its mediocre customer service has turned into a nightmare. My flight has been cancelled, and I can't rebook or get a refund online. Instead, I have to call the 800 number. After being told to wait five and a half hours for a call back yesterday, I never received one. Please be aware of AA's problems if you have to deal with them!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Charges for services that they fail to provide,"My wife and I attempted to purchase upgrades to first-class seating. Upon entering my credit card information, I received an error message stating that the transaction could not be completed. We therefore did not receive an upgrade, but I discovered that American Airlines (AA) charged us for the upgrade nonetheless. I contacted customer service, spending an hour on hold, to request a refund. The airline refused to provide the refund, insisting that I had been charged correctly. In addition to charging me for services that they did not provide, AA's computer system did not allow us to pay the fee for our baggage electronically (if they had provided the first-class upgrade, it would not have been necessary to pay the baggage fee, negating their argument that I had been charged correctly). We spent approximately 90 minutes in the international baggage check line and almost missed our flight because of the airline's incompetence."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Customer service call on 1/9/22 @ 2:23 pm from 1-800-433-7300,"After a day and half trying to get a hold of AA because of a long list of cancelations and complicated lay- over issues and finally getting a return call a half hour before the intended flight out from Pensacola Fl to Manchester NH- I finally received a call from the THE most arrogant condescending AA customer service rep. said to me "" Talking to you people in the northeast is like beating a dead horse..you just go on and on""!!!! I wasn't the only one who heard this as the call was on speakerphone.   I was trying to explain that I've received over 30 conflicting texts about the flight/layovers I was about to take . I finally called back to AA got a really nice lady who booked me a flight out of another airport to MHT. I will never do this again- extremely poor customer services, extremely poor mismanaged flights, and even worse communications.  You can't even make it right by saying YOU""RE SORRY-YOU SCREWED UP- you cost me not only a day and half of stress, and took time away from my vacation but you cost me dearly for reservations...completely unacceptable! This is not my opinion these are actual facts . My opinion goes way beyond this.."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Lack of Customer Service; Lack of Personnel,Miami Airport is synonymous with the ninth circle of hell. There was no wheelchair assistancee; no electric carts were running; people-mover walkways were not operational. No one manned connections from international to domestic airports. TSA agents were aggressive and invasive of body cavities.Pilot of plane broadcast a pitch to apply for an American Airlines credit card during the flight.Concierge waited an hour to speak with an American agent who refused to issue a refund for canceled flights. I had to buy new tickets to get home from South America.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Completely lost my snowboard + gear,"I had a 2 HOUR layover in Dallas and American still managed to lose my snowboard bag (containing my snowboard, snowboard boots, all of my ski gear, warm clothing, and — to top it off — Christmas presents for my family). I arrived in Hayden, CO and reported my lost luggage to an American agent. She said to proceed with the process online. Waited on hold for 2.5 hours. The agent hung up on me. 2 more hours. An American agent answered and filed my case for a second time. Its been 15 days and still no word. I’ve never felt a stronger need to write a review about an airline — but american sucks. period."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,"Worst customer service ever. Horrible app, and website","My son was flying one way from spending Christmas with his girlfriend family from New York. We bought our ticket through expedia and was sent confirmation numbers but when we tried getting  a boarding pass the app and website went to a blank screen every time. I tried calling 8 hours before my son's flight, but no one  would ever answer or returned a phone call from the many voicemails I left. Long story short my son spent 48 sitting in a airport because the in person employees at JFK continue sending him to different desks to avoid helping him. All I can say we will fly united or delta from now on. I also like to mention I asked to speak to supervisor to which I was told one call in 3 or 4 days. I never got that call so...... I be spending all my time going on every review site trying warn others don't fly american airlines."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Stay away,"I flew from Cancun to Evansville, connecting through Dallas. On the first leg of the flight the stewardess on the loudspeaker was audibly drunk and slurring her speech. By the end of the flight she sounded as if she had re-upped and became even more inebriated. This isn’t the reason for the negative review, however. Upon landing in Evansville, myself and about 15 other passengers waited by baggage claim to receive our luggage for around 10 minutes. At this time an employee notified us that there was no more luggage on the plane, and that it would be flown in the next day. Today is the next day and that flight was cancelled. Screw American Airlines."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Double the Rate vs. EXPEDIA- Terrible CUSTOMER SERVICE- BE AWARE!,WE usually fly AA - and we have a voucher from AA due to a cancelled flight during C19.Today we wanted to book the flight to Switzerland with AA- leaving Belize to Zurich one way this Saturday Sat Jan. 15th- leaving 3:25pm. The flight is on Expedia for 1108 $ USD. For some reason AA is refusing that we can use our valid AA voucher for this flight if we book over Expedia.The EXACT same flight booked Direct with AA ( over Miami & Mad) cost 2'705 USD !We contacted the AA Customer Service- but they seem to be clueless about this huge rate parity issue. We always assumed that booking direct with AA is the best way to get the lowest rate. BY FAR NOT! We are very dissapointed about the situation. The AA Customer Service in both- Belize and Switzerland would not come up with any solution for us. IT's called ripping off loyal customers - never heard of  RATE PARITY?WE will not book with American Airlines again.We now booked the flight with KLM for 712US$!
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Very poor customer service,Our flight was cancelled due to no staff. I was given a card with a phone number to call. When I called they said there were no options for 5 days. I booked the next day on United and paid an extra 980.00 per person and had to spend the night in Chicago and last a day of vacation. American did nothing but reimburse the flight that was cancelled. Very poor service
Date of travel: January 2022,10,N/A,Changed flight without notice. Absolutely no help in trying accomodate. Stuck in Philly for a layover for 5 and half hours due to flight change. Going to Buffalo for an NFL game that started at 425pm. Flight arrives in Buffalo at 342pm. We will miss part of the game to American Airline incompetence and lack of communication. DO NOT USE PRICELINE OR FLY AMERICAN AIRLINE if you value your time and money spend it elsewhere.
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Great Airline & Customer Service,Todd from the front desk at EWR was incredibly helpful and the flight was great! Nice plane & friendly staff
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Unprofessional behavior,"As flight 4348 was preparing to board for the flight to Waterloo, Iowa I asked 2 American Airline employees if we could board early as we are senior citizens. We were met with laughter and it wasn’t clear if we could and we boarded with our assigned group which was #6.We request two ticket refunds and training for these 2 immature juvenile employees as we felt embarrassed and humiliated. We took photos of these 2 employees laughing at us.Please contact us at 62088isu@gmail.com"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,I wish I could leave 0 stars,"Do not fly into key west air port.  The air port could be better managed by children.  From arrival to departure American Airlines was late all around.  So late in fact on our way home they screwed up the gate assignments and we took off an hour late, then requested the pilot slow his route, and then of course we missed our connecting flight by 5 minutes bc they close the gates 10 minutes early for some reason.  American Airlines rectification was some economy class tickets in the back of the plane for a flight 4 hours later.  I typically fly southwest, and will continue to do so.  I will not fly American Airlines again.  If they cannot cope with covid related employment issues then they should stop offer flights.  They continue to cost me money for parking and other expenses related to our late arrival.  Incredibly unprofessional and they should not be allowed to operate an airline for commercial travel.  Absolute incompetence form each stop to and from our destination."
Date of travel: January 2022,40,Good flight,Good timing. Arrived on time.Food on board not great.Helpful staff.Flight was empty so I could stretch.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,LAX Safe travel desk,There was a lady at the safe travels desk in LA that was so beyond rude that I wish to never fly again.  I understand that everyone is under pressure but to purposely treat people badly is definitely a personality issue.  I had a bad experience with her and then we met up with my kids in Honolulu and they reported the same experience with the same lady!! The day before.  We were at the counter on 12/23 at 5am when they Ipened and she was flat out rude.  I luckily had to do something to my account and get out of line and was treated wonderfully by the other employee.  I feel bad for anyone that has dealt with this woman and hope that American gets some sense and puts her somewhere behind the scene.  Miserable is the only way I can describe her.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,take this airline if you want your luggage to leave without you,"You might see that it says that my flight was from DFW to CHICAGO... well to my surprise American Airlines didn’t even allow me to step foot on my flight. I am a 14 year old with experience with traveling independently with no issues whatsoever until yesterday. I got my bags checked and received my boarding pass with no issue until I reached the gate and was told i cannot board my rightfully paid flight due to my age. I was called to the side by the check in personnel who later referred me to her supervisor who was in fact was no help at all and had very poor customer service and poor knowledge of the policy. She made me go all the way back to the ticketing counter, remind you, I was already at the gate and way passed security. the supervisor had alerted me that I needed my mom to pay the unaccompanied minor fee and fill out paperwork, which she had to complete in person. We followed the simple instructions and was told right after i couldn’t travel with the unaccompanied service, right after we filled out useless paperwork. Let me also remind you by this time, my bags were already on the Chicago flight which had already taken off by this time. They had enough time to offload my luggage; since this whole altercation took place during the course of the whole boarding process... beginning to end, which was about an hour and a half. My issue is that if the problem with me boarding this flight was with my age, why wasn’t i alerted about this at the beginning? Why didn’t the ticketing agent notify me that I needed to purchase the unaccompanied minor service? They had all my information including my passport which has my date of birth, there’s no  excuses. Why wasn’t the supervisor at the gate aware of the policy that I wouldn’t be able to travel at all with the unaccompanied minor service? (due to Chicago not being my final destination and one other airline being involved in my travels to my final destination, Nairobi Kenya). They were aware of my whole itinerary, supervisor should have known. American Airlines employees are not well aware of their policies and have lack of communication. Very horrible, do not recommend unless you want to be walking in circles with disrespectful employees talking back at you."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,AA IS CONSISTENT WITH DISAPPOINTMENT,"Without fail, American Airlines will mislead, miscommunicate, and show zero regard for their passengers. Poor aircraft maintenance, constant delays, and a clear lack of regard and respect for passenger’s time and schedule make every experience with this airline an absolute nightmare. I will never fly with AA again and neither should you."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Worst airlines ever!,AA cancelled my flight ticket even the flight was still on- didn’t notify me via email or phone! If I wasn’t checking I would miss my work!  Being on hold for more than an hour with no response!
Date of travel: January 2022,10,DONT TAKE AMERICAN AIRLINES,They changed my flight so I wouldn’t get to were I needed to be until 3 days after 4 different flights so they expected me to live in the airport until I got to my destination I complained and miraculously was able to get a plane the would have me the same day I needed to 1030 at night but at least I’d be there now mind you I scheduled my flight for 830AM and my layover was at 1030 so I would be back around noon but not if American Airlines had anything to say about so I get my flight rescheduled for one at 11AM and a layover at 6PM that was a little ridiculous but it was better then 3 days my first flight got delayed until 1230 almost one finally get on the plane and it takes another 45 minutes to even start moving the flight itself was not to bad when the flight attendant came around to ask people if they wanted anything they came up to me now I had my headphones on and I was trying to get some sleep cause I’ve been up since 6 to make a flight at 830 to get kicked over to a new flight and the flight attendant that I already noticed and made eye contact with shook me to ask me if I wanted anything I was upset but once we land I couldn’t get off that plane any quicker than I did at this point it’s almost 3 so I’m like ok sweet I can go get food and have time sit and not worry about flights not if American Airlines has something to do about it flight gets delayed till almost 1130 at this point I’ve spent the better part of a whole day in an airport just trying to get back once I finally get back to where I’m going I need my luggage not to my surprise that’s nowhere to be found I go to baggage and there I find out my bags are on the other side of the Country they gave me a tracking number and said they would call and email me when It got there it’s been almost a week and nothing I’ve tried calling and have been on hold for OVER 4 HOURS my bag tracking number doesn’t work anymore I’ve tried everything on the baggage claim and nothing I’ve flown  American 3 times now and every time there’s an issue I hope American get shut down or they fix there stuff because they need to get their stuff together ASAP before the get a massive law suit or they mess up and it ends up getting someone’s life messed up like what if in my luggage had extremely important in it that was irreplaceable thankfully it was just clothes but now I have to buy a whole new wardrobe just if your gana take a plane don’t take American Airlines I love my country and there ruining it’s name more then politics are
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Crappy 💩,"Absolute crap💩  Just look at their COVID safety protocols. Wouldn’t upgrade me after having deplaned us and keeping us waiting indefinitely despite having availability. I have been traveling for days at this point, yet no assistance and nothing could be done. Looks like they don’t really care much."
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Lost luggage and impossible to contact.,"I was originally booked to fly from El Paso, TX to Chicago on the Sat 1st Jan, this was cancelled. The ""alternative"" I was offered flew me to Chicago on Sun 2nd Jan but there were no ongoing flights available to my final destination of La Crosse WI until Tuesday 4th Jan therefore I would be stranded in Chicago for two days with two grandchildren in tow.American Airlines were no help at all in the regard, the ""alternative"" was unusable so was in reality no alternative at all.I took a different flight to Phoenix AZ and then connected to Madison WI because even though it was long and clearly going the wrong way it at least got me to Wisconsin on Sunday. I was then picked up from Madison and we drove home, if I wanted a long drive I would have flown from Chicago to start with, I fly from La Crosse because it's my regional airport and I don't want a long drive to get there.My luggage never arrived in Madison, clearly AA lost it somewhere along the way, it probably went in the first flight plane and was never moved over as AA staff promised me it would be.I've been able to find it arrived in Madison a full 24 hours after I did so clearly it was impossible for me to retrieve my luggage when I arrived.I have not been able to contact ANYONE from AA at all in regard to this, it is impossible to find out how you plan to re-unite me with my luggage that YOU lost.Worst customer service EVER, in an industry not known for high levels of customer service, that takes some doing.My husband did warn me, he's not your biggest fan, I should have listened to himI want my luggage back please."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Awful service,awful I sat on my plane for 3 hours for them to keep delaying and then cancel 2 hours later this is the worst service ever didn’t even give us updates on our flight process until telling us we sat too long and then used to much gas so we didn’t have enough gas to get back and had to take us back to the gate for them to make us sit for even long to then have everyone get off the plane and get delayed again when we had the opportunity to take off at 12:15pm when we were supposed to and it’s currently 4:30pm. Worst airline of all by far
Date of travel: June 2021,10,AA kept my money!!,"I purchased a Ticket from American Airlines for a round-trip to Toronto (Confirmation Code RMBWTE) to attend a wedding.The event was cancelled due to the COVID Restrictions; I received an Airline Credit from the Airline that is due to expire on 31 March 2022.I np longer have a reason to fly to Toronto (wedding was cancelled!) so I requested a refund, or the opportunity to fly to another location. AA tells me that I must fly the original route, before the end of March or lose my money.So I've lost the funds for that Trip that was impacted by COVID, and AA will not provide me with a refund allow me to use the money I've already paid.Recommend everyone be extremely careful before booking with AA, I will not use this Airline again,"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst mistake,"They changed our flight 4 times prior to departure date, then was late departing day one. Upon return, they canceled our connecting flight during flying, so I found out after getting to the gate. We had to pick another flight, which was 1hr later, but then it cancelled again leaving us with flights at 11hrs later, requiring us to stay overnight at the airport. Meanwhile, it took 4 employees to direct us to customer service area so we could get new tickets printed (because the old ones won’t be accepted). It took 1 1/2 hour to get assistance. I inquired about my baggage and was informed American Airlines is good at taking care of that. Obviously they should because they canceled the flights so they should follow through. We paid for our luggages to be carried and delivered with us.   We had to pick a flight with layover so that was 3 flights home. The headache didn’t end there! After arriving at our home airport, we only received one of two luggages. The customer service man was rude and short when we asked for assistance. He said AA could ship or have the luggage here for pick up. I requested it be shipped to me since I did not ask for all the inconvenience and since they are responsible for my luggage-I paid for the baggage remember? He was able to look up my luggage and informed me that it was in Los Angeles because I requested it be held there. I informed him that was not the case-why would I hold a luggage there if I lived in another state and was supposed to be flying home? I didn’t cancel my flight to begin with. How irresponsible of AA! The forms given to me states AA typically returns/ships out baggage within 3days. If not, the customer should file a claim form. There goes the duplicate process!  No matter how I tried to track my luggage, it keeps saying no luggage exists with that number. Odd because the man informed me it was at LAX!  The following Wednesday, over a week later, I get a call/voicemail from AA baggage center stating my luggage was there for me to pick up. . After multiple attempts of returning their call and leaving messages, no one returns my call and I was unable to get a real person on the phone-it’s all automated or online, which is useless for lost baggage. They only have humans assisting in reservations (that’s because they want you to fly and spend your money there but they don’t want to take care of anything else). Where the hell was I supposed to pick up my luggage? Unbelievable! No address was provided. I will never ever fly with American Airlines again. I can see the company sinking already."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,DON'T FLY AMERICAN,"American Airlines I booked a flight back in Sep 2021 for Feb 2022 trip, paid over $300+ to get seats with extra leg AND aisle seat for my tall husband. You changed planes and decided it was ok to change our seats to a window seat? Oh HELL NO. I called customer service and was basically told ""We can't do anything for you"" As a faithful AA customer, guess what? Not flying with you anymore."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Disappointing Prem Econ flight to Miami,"We flew PE to Miami for Chistmas and was really disappointed with the level of service received from AA. Here this list: TV service failed (as were chargers to the chairs, so no tv and no devices after battery died - not good with a 7 year old). When asked about this was told ""I'm not a technician, hope you brought some books"". Ran out of food choices (there are only 30 ish seats in Premium!). Ran out of wine. Since I couldn't use call button on my dead chair I walked into the Business Class section to get a cabin crew. Was told by an angry crew member that I can't do that as it 'breaks Federal Law'....really??? I did complain to the Head Purser. A great opportunity to delight a disgruntled customer. Nothing. Thankfully our flight home was on BA. A totally different experience. So, although I'm a frequent business trans-Atlantic traveller, I've ruled AA out of my selection going forward."
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Very nice flight from Chicago to West Palm Beach,Been flying with American Airlines lately and they have been excellent for me.  On time out of Chicago which is saying something and on time in West Palm Beach.  Very good cabin crew.  Not crazy about the food but ok.  Enjoyed the flight.
Date of travel: January 2022,50,One of the best International flight ever,I flight frequently and understand that all flights will not be perfect.  This particular flight was excellent.....the cabin crew should be commended.....I have had many good flights with American Airlines but in these trying days it was nice to have such a great flight and cabin crew.  Not crazy about the food but the plane was on time and the bathrooms were clean.  Definitely recommend.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,$150 for checked bag,"Because the cabin baggage was a little bigger, they charged me $150 for it. I would never take this bag with me if I would knew .Any other airline is better"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,rude staff.  dirty.  Bathrooms disgusting,"the member of the crew sarcastically responded to my disgust with a bloody pad in the bathroom and pee all over the floor of the second bathroom right before take off as :  Well, if you want us to clean the bathrooms we can delay the take off!  When I complained to another crew member about. his response she proceeded to yell at me and dismiss me and be very rude.  Its the shortages of crew members that is giving license to the ones that are working to be rude and dismissive.  AWFUL."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,The most HORRIBLE AIRLINE VERY WICKED.,"This is the most horrible airline I am advising everyone to AVOID THIS AIRLINE. They are very horrible and they are VERY RACIST!!!! Jealous people!!!! When they see how much fun we have they feel like they have been killed. THE manager IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!! The superintendent is HORRIBLE!!!!!! FOOLS!!!! This happened to me today on JANUARY 5, 2022 in the morning at 5:30 AM they left me stranded until 7:00 PM (I am still waiting). They do not even deserve the 3 stars that they have!!!!!! Not even a quarter star. This airline should be CANCELED!!!! DONE!!!! They should not even EXIST!!!!!! I advise all my loved ones that they should be VERY CAREFUL and to WATCH OUT. They don't CARE about the customer and they only care about the money. God will deal with everyone who was there on the 5th of JANUARY 2022."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"If you enjoy delays and misguided overlays, THIS is the place for you!",First leg of flight delayed 2 hours and 40 minutes made the gate for second leg from Dallas to Lexington and plane left before the time on my ticket. No explanation no time to listen to whole sentences the staff at AA are the rudest as a whole I have ever seen. I've been waiting 6 hours for the next flight to finally make it to Lexington. Must be status quo since theres wasnt a single AA employee concerned with the customers around her.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Absolutely disappointed in AMERICAN AIRLINES--A MESS,"My bag was LOST in JFK--American Airlines.  When it got there, it missed the flight to DCA.  Then they sent it to Charlotte.  Now Charlotte is saying ""It is at DCA"" . DCA is saying ""It is not there"". WHERE IS MY BAG??? All my precious items I bought on my trip MEANS something to me. If lost those memories are LOST. NOT ONE MISTAKE IN NY....BUT TWO MISTAKES made by AmericanAirlines. I always get direct flights. I decided to let a travel company book for me. I have not been on a connecting flight in over 25 years. This is why I fly direct. This is so unfair to heir passengers.  WHERE IS MY BAG????? Floating around. Are the airports SAFE is the US???? Not with bags floating around. American Airlines process to help you FIND your bag....SUCKS!!!"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Don’t care at all about customers,"If you’ve ever flown American Airlines, you don’t even need to read this because you have probably switched airlines by now.  Always late or canceled and customer service is the worst in the industry. I would rather fly Spirit Airlines for the rest of my life instead of taking another flight on American Airlines."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,No refund,"I booked a trip from Lansing to Phoenix in October 2021 for my father-in-law to visit in January 2022. Now I booked a round-trip with American Airlines coming to Phoenix and United going back to Lansing. Within two weeks both flights canceled and only American Airlines found a new one. So as of today January 4, 2022 I cannot get my father-in-law back home as there are no flights. This is resulting in me having to cancel the entire trip because how else would I get him home? American Airlines refuses to give me my money back even though this is beyond my control. I will never ever in my life recommend this airline. Like are you kidding me? Yeah let me find my father-in-law to Phoenix and not let him have a way home."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Mr,"This American Airlines is now compete garbage. I'm not sure what happened to them but I paid 1500 total for my latest flights and they were both canceled, one because they couldn't find a pilot. Don't make me pay for something if you can't produce."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,My trip was ruined by AA and DFW’s gross negligence,"On January 2, 2022 my husband and and I headed to DFW airport in anticipation for what we thought would be a great start to 2022. A trip to Montego Bay Jamaica. When we arrived at terminal D the luggage conveyor belt was down. All of the luggage was being tagged and placed to the side. We were assured that the luggage would be on our flight. Fast forward 4 hours and we arrive in Jamaica and 85% of the passengers are missing luggage. I stayed at the airpirt for THREE HOURS trying to figure out  what went wrong. I was assured that my luggage would show up the next day. It is now January 4, 2023 and I still have no luggage. DFW AA says my luggage is in Jamaica however the AA website shows  that one piece of my luggage is in New York and the other is still in Dallas.   AA DFW has taken no responsibility and seems to not to care about the customers that their freaking mistake is affecting!!! I am in another damn country with no luggage and had to spend an obscene amount of money just to replace essential items!! Montego Bay Sangter airport confirned the luggage had NOT arrived. AA and DFW 800 number is a JOKE. While my husband and I are just trying to make the best of a horrific situation, this is very stressful and unacceptable on the part of DFW AND AMERICAN AIRLINES. This is in no part a reflection on Montego Bay Jamaica and the resort as they have done everything possible to help accommodate us however this does not take away from the fact that I am in another country with LUGGAGE. How and why did American Airlines allow the flight and any other flight for that matter flying out of terminal D to take knowing that all of the luggage was still just sitting at customer service. How about give the passengers a heads up. Maybe people could have purchased some essentials in the terminal, changed their flight, SOMETHING. But no. AA took that power away and allowed families to get on this flight with knowing the luggage would never make it to its destination. Answers are needed for everyone on AA2500 on 01/02/22 and any other flight leaving terminal D on 01/02/22. LEGAL ACTION WILL BE SAUGHT!!! This is ridiculous!!!!"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Never Again,"I never wanted to be a person to write reviews but this hd to be said. I am currently sitting in JFK Airport where I was supposed to be catching a connecting flight back to LAX. Unfortunately due to the fact my flight to JFK was by AA 3 times. We boarded late AF not to mention we sat on the plane for two hours cause they had to refuel. Also, the plane is uncomfortable AF do not recommend. I’m stuck in JFK till tomorrow with not clue in how I’m gonna get home. I was told that my ticket cannot be touched until they contact customer service when there was a sign that was clear as day over their desk that said Customer Service. Good luck for those out there suffering through this BS. Way to start off 2022."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Horrible,"I had a flight from Dallas to Seattle. Upon checking my bag back in Dallas, the baggage check conveyor belt was broken, so American Airline customers where told to place their luggage/bags in a pile with other luggage. Once I arrived in Seattle, I waiting at baggage claim for over an hour with no word on where my planes bags where. I was lucky to have over heard an American Airlines employee say to an other customer to go wait at the American Airline customer service area as to all of the checked baggage for my fight never made it on the plane. They didn’t even announce to their customers what had happened and we had to hear it through the grape vine. It has now been over 24 hours and I still have no idea when my bag is, even though they sent me a tracking number, when I try to track it, nothing pops up. It just says “open case”. I will never ever recommend American Airlines to anyone and will NEVER fly with them again. Where the F is my luggage?! I’m"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Never fly American Airlines,"They cancelled our tickets the day before my flight without telling us and sold our first class seats to someone else.  No one knows why they cancelled our tickets. We had to stand in line for 1 hour at the Aruba airport for them to determine it was their error. They gave us economy seats on another flight that was leaving 3 hours later and refused to credit us for the difference in price between first class and economy seats.Additionally, the flight was bumpy and the landing was very harsh. Both mine and my husbands body hurt after being in the cramped seats for so long.I understand that mistakes can happen but they did not treat us well or do what was needed to make it right.Nearly all the flights on American lately have been bumpy. They are using smaller planes."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,No Security,"Hard to believe this happened.  Even harder to accept AA’s response.  My wife and I flew back for vacation form mexico to hartford with a stop in Miami.  Bags from mexico were delayed in Miami, something about mechanical failure.  When I arrived at Bradley airport, in hartford, I opened my suitcase to get my hoodie.  It was clearly rummaged, with my toiletry bag emptied out into suitcase.  Also, my $200 sunglasses were gone.  These were  25 year anniversary gift from my place of employment.  AA simply responded “no receipt, no reimbursement”, even when I escalated.  I have flown with this airline over 20 times, in the past ten years.  This is how they treat loyal customers.  My business is going to delta.  They have humans working there."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Best Business Class from Spain to the US!,"Great seat, very comfortable , food was top notch and movie selection too. The staff were very  friendly, and they set up a food bar mid flight with a great selection of snacks, fruit and drinks. First time flying facing backwards and was surprisingly comfortable. Loved the signature dessert sundae too. Best service across the Atlantic from Barcelona to the US."

Date of travel: December 2021,10,How can we spoil getting there for holiday fun.,"Second holiday trip in a row scheduled with flights on AA that started a day late. First time we were rerouted from ABQ-PHX-PVR with an overnight stay in Houston. The reason was lighting at Phoenix. Not all their bad. ABQ was ground hold for lightning in PHX. We took off 55 minutes late from ABQ. The PHX-PVR leg aircraft was boarding as we touched down and departed as gate as we deplaned. A 20-25 minute delay to that flight and we make the full trip. no PHX -PVR leg for 48 hours. IAH-PVR leg the next day Airline cover PHX-IAH, hotel and off to PVR.Second trip same ABQ-PHX-PVR, ABQ leg cancels 4 hours prior to departure.did not offer a change to a flight out of SAF that would have made PHX on time just rescheduled for flight next day -- Two Christmas / New Year holidays start a day late. We had 3 of 8 adults flying AA (2 SWA and 3 on Delta) The 3 on AA had to fill a 3rd party app Verifly that verifies vaccination or negative covid test before we could process check in for the PVR departure flight to go home. Get on the flight home with little troubles. Passenger behind us (last row of seats was moved from the seat number on his ticket because 2 ticketed passengers were assigned the same seat. The flight attendant commented that was AA's new mote ""WE ARE NOT HAPPY TILL YOU ARE NOT HAPPY"" Jan 2, 2022 light home is PVR-DFW-ABQ. At DFW passengers clear customs and must pick up their customs cleared baggage and move it to the flight transfer check in area. Four US entry flights being processed and all were told to leave the luggage on the floor next to the broken conveyor belt. Appeared to be about 3500 peices of luggage and still growing. That was yesterday afternoon. I have been notified that one bag arrived in ABQ this morning the other still at DFW All the while any attempt to speak with AA in both trips was meet with a recorded intro advising ""callers with flights in the next 72 get priority"" there is no entry request for flight information. The next IVR info is ""You do not have to wait on hold"" where is both trip 2019 and 2021 last week in December the committed call back time was 4 hours to 4 hours 15 minutes."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,The worst Airline Company,"I was supposed to depart at 11am, today (01/03/22).My flight began to be delayed due to mechanical issues. Meanwhile, there is a whole other flight that is leaving at 12:25pm. I was told by a worker to call a number at 12:15pm. When I called, I was told that my flight was cancelled. I had no idea that it was or why. I couldn't switch over to another flight because it was ""too late"", and now I am on the phone with a customer service supervisor named Melonie from Winston Salem. She currently has had me on hold for 30mins and counting. Nobody has information about the next flight. I would never recommend anybody to take this Airline."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"Atrocious airline, rude and unhelpful customer service","I had the displeasure of travelling with American Airlines recently, this is a mistake I will not make twice. Our flight to Aspen was delayed by 2~3 hours, causing us to miss the 11pm curfew imposed by aspen airport, a totally forseeable enforcement. We disembarked the plane on the tarmac and spoke to the customer service desk, and were told they were not responsible for our flight being cancelled, that it was light control preventing their takeoff. We attempted to explain multiple times that the plane was denied takeoff permission only because it was over 2 hours late, however the staff were rude and showed zero understanding or compassion. We organised our own accommodation for the night (now 1am) and our own change of flights to Vale as the remainder of the Aspen flights were booked. Despite being told that our luggage would follow us to Vale, none of our bags made it and the customer service employees at Vale airport let us know there is nothing she could do. This has been the worst experience I have ever had with an airline, I will never be caught dead on another American Airlines flight and the rudeness and unhelpful attitude every step of the way has only rubbed salt into the wounds. Very disappointed."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"Would give 0, hell Negative stars if Possible","Me and my buddy had a Flight with these airlines, with a connecting flight after we landed. Our flight was supposed to leave it 7:30pm, and we got here at 6 pm, and the flight was delayed like 8 times, from 7:30 to 8:45, to 10:30, to 11:14, to 12:45, before being completely canceled. Afterwards, the airlines wouldn't give us a Hotel, and wasn't able to rebook us to anywhere close to our destination until 4 days later. And even tried to argue giving us the $1500 we spent on the flights. This airline has given the worst experience I've ever had, completely unacceptable and ridiculous. Would recommend literally any other airline besides this one, never again will I even think about flying through this Airline service"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Horrible Experience,"My family and I had a great vacation together for Christmas. However, it started off with a terrible experience with American Airlines. My mother in law and husband have similar names. The ticket agent printed out the wrong boarding pass with my husbands name on my mother in laws. After waiting online with TSA the agent told us that the name was wrong on her boarding pass and couldn’t let us go through. My mother in law had to go back to the American Airlines ticket counter and start from the beginning.  They wouldn’t do anything to help us get to our flight in time. We ran to the gate. My parents were telling them we were running. We had ten to fifteen minutes until our flight was about to take off and they gave our seats away. They didn’t even call our names. When we got to the counter to tell them what happened and that we were meeting family they said to me “it’s not going to happen sir” (I am a woman). That was it, no help or concern. We ended up flying stand by. My parent and mother in law got on the next flight. My husband and kids didn’t get a flight until our third standby flight. One agent tried to help us. We were never able to find a supervisor. The only thing they told us was we didn’t need a boarding pass to get through TSA?Luckily, we met up with the rest of our family. It was just unfortunate that we spent half of Christmas Eve in the airport."

Date of travel: January 2022,10,Horrible Supervisor.,The supervisor for AA in Dallas is horrible and should not be in customer service. He was yelling at a women who had her children with her for asking questions about a flight that was canceled. He kept arguing with me and other customers and could not answer any questions. The counter clerks were more helpful and patient. He cussed at one customer.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"I would give you a 0, but I can’t. So you get a one.",Hi travelers. I’m coming at you live from an American Airlines plane on the tarmac in Dallas where I have been spending the past three hours of my New Year’s Day. No one has offered us any water or snacks. I’m cramped and annoyed and cranky. We should have been deboarded three hours ago. Delays happen. I understand. What I don’t understand is why I have to sit on a plane for three hours. I will never fly American again. 0/10. Actually -15/10.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Never again,"I have flown every airline recently. AA is absolutely the worst: they are incredibly stringent on the masking requirements, forcing even passengers with HEARING AIDS to wear an ear-bound mask instead of a neck gator. I cancelled a flight that was 'non-refundable' (admittedly, my fault) but when I called to inquire about possible credits or transfers, absolutely zero options were provided to help recouping the lost funds for a flight that is still not for another 45 days as of this writing. Completely shameful, will not fly with AA ever again so long as I live. Plenty of other airlines out there."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Xmas Fort Worth,"Check in at Heathrow was trouble free but we were delayed  for a couple of hours at Heathrow due to a technical fault and missed my connection at Chicago for Fort Worth, The staff at Chicago (O'Hare) were brilliant in offering a later flight or a stay in a hotel with a flight to Fort Worth the following morning which I opted for. The stay at Sonesta was excellent with very friendly and extremely helpful staff and excellent bar and food. My return trip from Fort Worth to Heathrow was trouble free and I would fly with American Airlines again"
Date of travel: December 2021,40,Good service and easy travel,Everything went smoothly from checkin to boarding to baggage claim. The seats and snacks are not as good as Jet Blue but good enough.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Man handeled by an employee,"Never ever fly American Airlines.  We were booked Hawaiin Airlines out of Honolulu.  Our flight got cancelled and we were moved to American Airlines.  When we and several other passengers showed up we were told we had to wait till 10:30.  Us and about 20 other passengers went up at 10:30 as instructed.  We were told to use kiosk.  The lady next to me was yelling and cussing to no end because her kiosk wasn't working.  Mine wasnt working either.  I asked for help and the gentleman grabbed my arm.  I told dont him touch me please.  He wouldnt let go and I repeated myself. He let go and started tapping my arm and telling me to calm down.  I told him I was calm, dont touch me.  He continued. I broke free and went to the counter and asked for the manager.  The manager said she printed my ticket that morning and that was my kiosk wouldnt work.  I said fine but, your employee manhandled me and either you do something about it or I am contacting my lawyer.  She told us we couldnt fly Amerucan anymore.  We went back to Hawaiian Airlines and told them what happened.  They not only got us a wonderful flight with United they helped us file a Sheriffs report with the Department Of Public Safety Sheriff Airport Section  for assult.  Report number SD21-15585.

Date of travel: December 2021,20,I will never take AA,"Please stop using Veri Fly app. Because of the this trash app, I will never take AA. Service was not bad actually. But this trash app has a lot of errors and it is not easy to upload some documents. If they don't use this app, I will take AA again. If not, I will never take it in my life. I wanted to give them 1/5 points but the service on the plane wasn't too bad. The reason why I gave 2/5 points."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Great check in service,"My family and I came late to the airport, we thought we would have to schedule for the next day. The check in employees named Teresa and Gail were very helpful in getting us another flight on the same day and at no additional cost! They were very helpful and accommodating."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Incompetent fools,"A short story is the only way to write this review. You board a plane that is about 85° you're waiting, in the parking spot, your departure time comes and goes. You hear the ding "" sorry for the weight, we have over loaded the plane and we are offering a $900 credit and a hotel for 3 people to get off the plane"" you watch 3 sorry souls leave the plane, turns out they were the smart ones, ""ding"" ""we need another passenger to exit the plane"" right there I watched my last chance at freedom and an enjoyable experience go past my eyes. We being to taxi to the RWY, now 45 minutes late. We hold position in a big essentially parking lot, ""ladies and gentlemen this is the captain, we need to burn off 300 pounds of fuel, should take about 5 minutes, this is to keep 1 passanger because we are over our maximum takeoff weight"" 15 minutes come and go, we begin to move, now an hour after our plane was supposed to leave we take off for ORD. Rutine flight to ORD when we finally touchdown. 25 minutes before boarding to PHL gate H17 starts. Plenty of time to get off our plane and walk from what ever gate, oh look H14 is open, their right next to each other perfect! No. H14 was not for us. We continue to taxi until we pull over in a parking lot, ""ladies and gentlemen this is the captain, it's going to be 25 minutes until our parking spot is open"" ok, I think to myself, that's not terrible, 15 minute boarding window, no. Exit the plane as boarding ends, grab my bags and run. Get there 2 minutes late because they were able to leave on time even though there were 10 people from DSM to PHL on that flight. Now I write this review waiting for a plane to Newark to take an uber to PHL to get my car, which is currently being fined because I'm not there to get it at the time I said I would. Who will pay for this it's not me and apparently it's not AA because it's all ""weather related"" no. Just no. Sure we held outside of ORD airspace for 10ish minutes but I think the real problem was the 45 minute delay while the apes tapped away on their calculators trying to see if they over booked/filled a quite small plane. Made an American airlines account 9 days ago and will be deleting its presence on the 10th day of its existence. F you AA. I've flow AA with every single flight I have ever paid for myself but never again, ill just pay some guy with a C172 for a slow, shifty ride from now on. F you AA"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,AVOID AA,"I had a similar experience to the review a few below me. I was at the airport at 6:10am for a 8:25 flight. I tried to check into my flight the night before on my phone and had errors that told me to see an attendant. So I just waited til this morning to finish my check in and the kiosks at the airport were showing me the same message. The issue is, NO ONE. AND I MEAN NO ONE was willing to help me check in. They just told me to “try again.” And there was a handful of us having the same issue with the kiosks. After an HOUR of trying to check in, by some miracle and no change in input of info, it went through. Once we wanted to check our bags, they told us it was too late to check our luggage. Even though there was till an hour until the flight. If they had known a lot of passengers were having issues checking in, why wouldn’t they alert the flight crew and tell have them coordinate something for us? There was no help from any of the AA staff at the airport and when you did ask, they were rude. They ended up rescheduling ours and a handful of others another flight until tomorrow morning. Now I’m nervous that the flight will be overbooked. I’ve flown a lot, before the pandemic and recently and I’ve never dealt with such an AWFUL and incompetent airline. Now I’ve lost money on ubering to and from the airport and had to reschedule a shuttle and hotel booking. Not to mention I lost an entire days worth of vacation. Angry and upset doesn’t begin to cover it."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Not enough staff at check in made us miss our flight and lost my luggage for 30+ days,"We arrived at the airport 3 hours prior to or domestic flight, but due to lack of staff and poor communication did we never check-in in time, and they rescheduled us. Made me late for an event and then lost my baggage. My baggage is still missing (lost on december 11.) It is impossible to communicate with them and their baggage tracking is terrible. How can it be so hard to find a yellow bag. Worst part is there has been no communication, I have no idea where they are in the process, and everytime I ask for updates I get pushed aside."

Date of travel: December 2021,10,Scam,Flight got cancelled same thing that happened at the same time before waiting until the last second and refused to give use a reason why and then our second flight has a 3 hr delay they destroyed my luggage and most of the flight attendants are beyond rude this will be the last time we ever fly American
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Discrimination against disabled people,It is ridiculous in this day and age for any facility to not be readily accessible for people utilizing assistive devices. This airport is not friendly to people needing wheelchair assistance. My sister (who is a disabled veteran) went to American Airlines to check her bag and walker (as she has done with every airport since she started flying) and was told that she had to take her own walker to oversized baggage. Hello! How would she walk back without a wheelchair! And they did not seem to care or want to go out of their way to assist her. I’m bothered by how she was treated so much I felt it was necessary to post this review because ANYONE asking for assistance should not be treated badly or ignored. I hope that this review will be taken seriously and that these airlines will strive to do better. People with disabilities are people AND paying customers. They should not have to go through bad experiences in the places where their money is being spent. American Airlines ended up leaving her at the wheelchair assistance for two hours. She ended up missing her flight because no one came to help her. I was on hold with American and Atlanta Airport for over 30 min trying to get her assistance and did not receive a response. They ended up putting her on a non direct flight and we’re rude to her regarding having a service animal. Then they made her check her bags and would not help her get to her seat even though they saw her struggling. This was just overall poor customer service and it saddens me greatly that my family member had to go through such an event. I hope this airline holds its staff accountable for their actions and poor service.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Vouchers,I scheduled to go a day earlier than originally planned which actually was cheaper. $120 cheaper. They wouldn't refund my money and said it has to be used as a voucher.  The problem is I rarely fly. This flight was the first one I've been on in like 25 years. I don't plan on more flights anytime soon. If I don't use the voucher it will expire and I'll never get that money back. Pretty cruddy of a company to do that. Just greedy!! I hope they go out of business. AA sucks!!!
Date of travel: November 2021,10,A disaster. Impossible to get miles when travelling with other One World companies. The worst Frequent Flyer Program,"One of the worst customer service. I am One World Emerald FF and I have flown 3 flights with Iberia and 4 flight with British Airways, using my American Airlines FF card. After 2 months it is impossible to get miles and they have denied me them for unknownw reasons. I sent them all the tickets and receipts but nothing to do. Unbelievible, a really fraud. Avoid American Airlines."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,An amazing flight from Cancun to Chicago,"I was traveling with my family from Cancun to Chicago on Dec 27th. We flew a brand new 787-8 Dreamliner (N870AX) to Chicago. When we arrived to our seat, we saw on the plane that there was a new inflight entertainment system, more movies and games onboard, and a new interactive map. I saw Free Guy onboard (not pictured). Again I visited the business class section and the cockpit and got a real pilot badge. The flight was so comfortable thanks to American Airlines.We will fly AA next time we go on vacation."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,An amazing flight from Chicago to Cancun,"I was traveling with my family from Chicago to Cancun on 21st Dec. When we first boarded the plane, we were surprised we were gonna fly a 787-8 Dreamliner (N818AL) for a short flight, although it was an older plane. I saw there were movies, games, and the interactive map onboard the plane. At the end, I visited the business class and took a cockpit tour! It was such an amazing flight thanks to American Airlines."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,The worst airline known to man,"American Airlines is the worst company I’ve ever worked with. Firstly, there was nobody even at the help  desk to check my bag and get me checked in. When the lady finally came out from around back (I’m assuming she was just taking a break?) she proceeded to tell me that it was “too late” for her to check me into my flight even though it wasn’t gonna leave for another hour and I was in a tiny one terminal airport with very few people in it. If she had been doing her job checking people in in the first place I would have been allowed back because I was there well before an hour prior to take off. Then to make matters worse an elderly lady came into line behind me. She had requested wheelchair service which she had needed in order to get into the airport. NOBODY CAME TO GET HER which is why she was checking in later than usual. The lady working for American told her that she couldn’t go through security because she was too late even though it was American Airlines fault she was late because they failed to provide her with a wheelchair. After arguing for about 5 min she decided to be a good person and let the elderly lady through. Me, on the other hand? Not a chance. I’m glad this lady was allowed to get on the flight she paid for and needed to board but for her to let her through and not  me really showed that she was capable of helping me and blatantly chose not to. F American Airlines. I wouldn’t even try to reason with these people and sure as he11 will not be a paying customer any longer. This is also not the first time that the people working check in for American have just not been available to check in. Previously this year my gf had to carry on a bag that she had already paid to check because nobody showed up and She was about to miss her flight. If I was hiring for any customer service job and wanted an example of exactly what NOT to do I would have people go try and talk to someone from American Airlines."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,American Airlines - Not Good,"First flight was delayed 3 hours due to a ""software issue"". We had a connecting flight to Hawaii that we ultimately had to miss and take a later flight. This caused me to miss the rehearsal dinner for my best friend and miss the transportation we had setup beforehand. American Airlines response, ""sorry""Bad customer service, especially when everything that happened was directly their fault"
Date of travel: December 2021,20,Baggage delayed,"This was my first time flying with an infant on lap on an international flight. They misspelled the name I gave them for my son when I made the reservation. I only had one bag checked in ( my son's car seat). I also had a stroller that I was able to bring up to the gate. This was very helpful in carrying my son and carrying my carry on. I had to stop in dallas since there is no direct flights to Zacatecas. They did provide me with more leg room which was nice from Dallas to Zacatecas. However, when I arrived at the airport in Zacatecas, my son's car seat was not in the baggage. When I arrived in dallas someone at the front desk called her supervisor to ask if I needed to pick up my bags for the next flight, since I was not sure. She indicated they told her the bags would transfer over to the next flight. It did not happen. I tried to file a baggage claim online and it would not allow me too. I also tried to do it in the airport and the american airline desk was closed. It has been a week and I still have not received my son's car seat."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Zero Customer Care or Service,"Flight back to base for an active duty military individual was cancelled, the rebooked flights led to delays, missed flights, basically stranded in an airport with no access to food, had to pay for a hotel room to hopefully fly standby the next day. This is unacceptable, this individual lost two days leave because of the airline. Flight AA3023 CVG to ORD 12.27.2021 was cancelled. They rebooked this individual on AA4596 CVG to CLT on 12.28.2021 and then AA610 CLT to SEA. Flight AA4596 was 2.5 hours late resulting in missing flight AA610. This individual was turned away at the AA ticket desk. Was not allowed to the USO, was not allowed back thru security to access restaurants. We paid for the hotel and meals that were a direct result of the American Airlines inability to provide the service they were paid for and their unwillingness to help a military individual in any way is disgusting and we cannot believe they call themselves American Airlines. We will never fly AA again."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Outstanding Service,"We had the best flight ever, due to the excellent and outstanding service from Scott.Scott was attentive all throughout the flight, checking with us constantly to make sure we were comfortable and had plenty to eat and drink. Scott gave five-star service and we appreciated his positive attitude and courteousness. Scott should be commended on representing American Airlines in such a positive way."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,This airline is awful,"I will never fly with American again after the experience I had today. We were trying to travel with a dog and were told that we were unable to fly because he was 'too big' for his carrier. This is a 9lb dog in a carrier rated for 20 lbs. I had pre-registered him via online chat beforehand and was told the criteria was that the dog needed to be less than 20 lbs - nothing else. On arrival at the airport today, we learned that the registration hadn't gone through (despite my having a confirmation number) and the gate agent then advised that she felt our dog was too big for his carrier. She told us that he could not adequately stand in the carrier as his back touched the top of it. This is the carrier he flew up to Milwaukee in and rides in whenever we're in the car. He actually enjoys sitting in, but this agent knew better. There was no supervisor that we could escalate to, no one at American would help us over the phone, and we were left to make alternative arrangements. The total lack of empathy by the employee we worked with (or anyone else at the front desk) for the extreme inconvenience due to their extreme interpretation of American's vague pet policy only made the situation worse. I will never fly with American again even if it means paying more money or worse routes with other airlines."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,A company that truly doesn’t care,"So I flew from Mobile Alabama to Doha, and was on American for the first portion. First thing they do is cancel the second leg of the flight, send a text, then another text telling me that there are no other alternatives…too bad. This was 10 minutes before  the boarding of the first leg!I called, and they somehow were able to rework it and get me booked through to Doha. I asked multiple times about my luggage and was assured all was taken care of and my luggage would be in Doha upon my arrival. Fast forward to my arrival and surprise, no luggage! I file a claim with Qatar airways and wait till I get to my residence in Doha to figure out where my bag is. Check online and it says my bag is at Dulles international…not sure why, I never flew out of there. My flight went thru JFK! Called American and they said they’ll get right on it and follow up with me…nothing! No phone call, no email, nothing! I’ve called them 6 times and each time they say they’re waiting fir their own people at Dulles to respond to them (we’ll, except one time their baggage agent named Kimberly told me they transferred it to Qatar airways when in fact they hadn’t, then said it was out of her hands and ended the phone call)! To date, the only communication from them to me was on Twitter where they told me they’re sorry and they’re looking for my bag. Three messages from me to them on Twitter after they’re response still remain unanswered!So my advice is that if you like a company that will ignore you when you need them, lie to you throughout majority of your interactions, and generally make you aware that they consider you to be less than insignificant, fly American Airlines!"

Date of travel: December 2021,10,Awful Airline,"I don't usually write complaint post but god dammit this one deserves it. Trying to bring my family for the holidays, AA decided to change their flights willy nilly, adding 11 hours to a already 21 hour journey. I'ts almost 1AM and I have been on the phone for over 5 hours trying to resolve this issue. It is literally the worst customer service in my life! I'm embarking on a crusade to do as many bad reviews and convince as many people as I can to not use AA anymore. Usually it takes 12 good reviews to counter one bad. I'll make sure to up that number and to use the amount of time they made me waste to write bad reviews of AA."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,"Helpful staff but one screwed up airline, keeping a nurse from helping patients","The airline delayed times of our outgoing flights Christmas Day with no notification. They changed the airport we were supposed to fly out of for returning flights without so much as a notification email. I spent 400 dollars to get flights later in the day from the airport we were supposed to fly out of. We missed a connecting flight to our destination and had to be rerouted to an airport two hours away from where our family lived to get there in time to celebrate the holiday with relatives. Coming back, our first flight was delayed 5 hours, causing us to miss all our return flights. We have to pay close to 300 dollars to stay in a hotel with no compensation from the airline, and in order to even get home a day late, we'll have to fly into an airport two hours from our home and pay to rent a car to get home very late. I am a nurse and had to fight to get the time off that I did to spend time with family I never get to see. My unit is short staffed and I had sick patients that needed my help tommrrow and colleagues depending on me to be there to help care for those patients. Becuase of American Airlines, I won't be there for my fellow nurses or my patients for possibly two days. If not for the helpful agents at customer service and our flight gate, it might have been more. The customer service and gate agents have so much crap to deal with this holiday season. Each one I dealt with should be commended for their continued professionalism and helpfulness in very stressful circumstances for us all. Kudos to those agents and the great crew we dealt with. But the higher ups at American Airlines need to get it together. They always have an excuse about why they eff things up and always have a problem that they dump on their over burdened employees and stressed passengers to deal with. Congrats American Airlines, you might have just helped prevent a sick patient from recovering by keeping a nurse from their undetstaffed unit for another day. I will never fly with this airline again."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Very rude and unprofessional service,Horrible service they change my flight without let me know and I missed the flight I was traveling for Christmas.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,"American Airlines withheld my luggage and sent me out to sea BARE BOTTOMED, REFUSING to allow me access to my luggage.","I had a cruise booked which departed December 18, to return December 24th. I flew from sky Harbor Airport to LAX at 9am. My large Luggage, with ALL of my main essentials including medicine, clothing, shoes, toiletries, etc. did not arrive in LAX.   We waited from 9-9:45, no luggage. Melissa (attendant) stated it should arrive on next flight (10:05am). My partner and I had cruise that embarked at 4:30; check-in at 11. Melissa eluded to fact that if we left airport without luggage, we were assuming responsibility of cruising without my property. We waited. It never arrived. Melissa (counter person), and her supervisor, Paola, made several allegations against entities that should be to blame. They continually said “American Airlines is not liable”. First it would be my fault, , then it was Sky Harbor, then they said TSA had my luggage (we have confirmation with TSA that they DID NOT hold up our luggage)…they repeated over and over it wasn’t American, American NEVER does this. Even after my partner and I commented that they were being so rude, and unsympathetic, that “an apology goes a long way”, they stated they would not apologize, because they were not responsible. When we expressed that we were missing our check in, and because of COVID, the process was VERY STRICT, and we were concerned that waiting at airport put us in jeopardy of being denied entrance on board, they continually stated if we left, we would assume all liability of not receiving luggage. Nearly 3 hours later, we stated we needed to leave, and PLEASE send luggage, if found, to cruise ship. We had address, ship number, etc., as we contacted Carnival Cruise Line about process . They told us they would not even initiate arrangements to deliver luggage to ship until I arrived and checked into ship. Melissa even repeatedly stated that if I purchased anything, American is not liable, that would be out of MY pocket. We rushed to the ship, checked in with cruise director, called number they gave us, but no one answered, and mailbox was full. After a few more times, got ahold of someone from another avenue, they said they will deliver before 3:30 (latest time cruise could accept). At 3:00, got a call, the luggage won’t make it. They assured they would deliver to Cabo, but I had to pick up my own luggage. ALL of my amenities were in the suitcase; shoes, toiletries, medicine, clothes, underwear, swimsuit. ( I included pictures of all clothes I had to work with). Carnival would arrange to assist me in picking up luggage. Waited in line, and on phone for two days with guest services ( they had ZERO amenities including toothbrush, razor, extra clothes, toiletries, shoes, swim suits, nothing). Got to Cabo on third day, found a tooth brush, a pair of sandals, and a prescription for my acid reflux. Still, I was VERY nervous about purchasing products, because Melissa stated American was not liable, that me purchasing anything would be my choice. Only got off ship to try and shop for necessities, however, ports did not sell swimsuits, razors, underwear, clothes for daily wear, or shoes-only bags, t-shirts, hats, and souvenirs. Rushed back to ship to find out information, carnival had no info on my luggage. Waited in line, called American, on hold for hours, etc. Carnival then received a call that American Airlines decided to send the luggage back to LAX ( not sure where it was). I had NO underwear’s, hair products, clothing, swimsuit, etc. for the entire 7 days on cruise. I had no consistent phone or communication, so I was tied down to guest services, take out food, sitting in corner to have buffet food, and checking emails in my room, surviving on the one outfit, one pair of pajamas, and a couple scarves I used as a bra and skirt, since I had no underwear. What’s did have to purchases was from my vacation fund, which prevented me from further participating in vacation activities. After I arrived at LAX, they brought out luggage, leaned against counter, said “here’s your baggage”, and left. I tried to roll bag, bag tipped over. Noticed the luggage was completely cracked through bottom, and wheel was broke. Tried to report, American said they aren’t the people to handle this. No apology, nothing. Luggage now broke, cannot transport. There is an “ inspected in Hawaii” sticker on luggage, a Puerta Vallerta sticker, and a tag that stated it was in Cabo airport ( I was there for two days, why could it NOT be delivered? Was it in Hawaii at the time?). Regardless, the charges us AGAIN to transport the baggage back to Phoenix. Additionally, the same two customer service employees, Paola, and Melissa, we’re working. Paola admitted that we had been asking for an apology since we initially filed this complaint, and stated multiple times that she REFUSED to apologize, she doesn’t owe us an apology, and she doesn’t like the way we were acting (I was able to get the end of this on recording because she kept talking over my boyfriend, repeating, I am refusing to apologize, I am refusing to apologize, over and over, because we were trying to place a complaint about lost luggage, stickers that state luggage was in Hawaii, Puerto Vallarta, and SJD, about destroyed vacation with no medicine and essentials, lack of communication, intimidating and dismissive treatment, and destroyed luggage. There were MULTIPLE TIMES they could have gotten me my luggage, but they REFUSED…vacation ruined.I have audio of American Airlines employee admitting we tried to resolve issue for a week, but they refused to apologize; they didn’t like the way we were acting."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst experience flying ever,"Worst flight experience ever with AA. I arrived with a 5 hours delay and my luggage was delivered 8 days after my arrival (8 days)! As a result I had no Christmas present for most of my families (they were in the suitcase) and had to buy loads of items. No compensation was even mentionned from them. The cause of the delay was a chaotic organization at the New Orleans airport. I was there 3 hours before my flight but they failed to check me in before flight time at 11am, like many  other people in the flight. The check-in queue was completely disorganized with loads of people with flights in the afternoon getting checked in before the people in the 11am flight. I ended up spending 15 hours at the airport, arrived 5 hours late at my final destination, and my luggage was delivered 8 days later.Absolutely avoid flying with them on transatlantic journey. European companies may be slightly more expensive but they are accountable by law in case of major delay or inconvenience. AA clearly just don't care."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Just don’t.,"I am starting this review with the classic “ If I could leave less than a star I would” This is a long one… but worth the read; so stick around if you have time. Let me fill you in on some context before I describe how truly awful of an experience my husband and I had on our trip to Scotland to get married (yes, you read that right. This horrible experience happened on our trip to another country to get married) our wedding was planned for August 24th 2021. Originally, we had planned to get married in 2020 but had to postpone due to covid. So anyways, the long awaited wedding. Luckily, it was jus the 2 of us traveling to marry so no friends or family were involved. Our original flight plan was to depart 8/20 from TPA with an arrival date into INV on 8/21. (TPA-CLT-LHR-INV)Announcements were made that onboarding was beginning at TPA so we made our way over, some time had passed and we noticed that nobody was getting on the plane. Then we heard the announcement “Flight #2915 to Charlotte will be delayed due to mechanical reasons” then some more time passed and they decided to let us board. Once everyone boarded they made another announcement that there would be additional delays due to inclement weather. My husband and I were checking the weather radar at this time and saw no sign of inclement weather, just the beautiful sun shining skies of Florida. At this point most people on the plane were getting upset because of the upcoming missed connections that were going to take place once arriving to CLT. We spoke with one of the attendants on the plane an explained our situation and asked what the arrival time would be he told us it has been pushed back from 3:30 to 5:30. Which of course is going to cause us to miss our connecting flight to London. He advised us that it would make the most sense to stay on this flight to get to CLT because they are a bigger hub and would have better luck getting us on a sooner flight to London than staying at TPA. So we finally land in LHR at 5:30. My husband and I rushed to the gate to try to make our original flight to LHR which was scheduled to depart at 5:45 but once we got there it had departed. Mind you, this was our first time traveling internationally and our first trip with American Airlines. When speaking with “customer service” (and yes, I am putting that in quotations because it should hardly be considered customer service) the associate re-booked us to a flight leaving to LHR the following evening. At this point we had lost an entire day of preparation before our wedding. The associate also offered us a coupon for a nights stay at Comfort Inn and told us that there would be a shuttle waiting in front of the hotel. She also made us aware that since our flight was now delayed by a day that we would need to retake our Covid Tests. But not to worry, she gave us a location that offered a rapid PCR test costing $190 per each test for a total of $380. After leaving the “customer service” counter we then stopped by baggage claim to insure they were aware that our original flight was missed and they assured us that our checked bags were being held and had been directed to our new flight leaving August 21. We then proceeded to the area we were directed to wait for our shuttle to Comfort Inn. We waited for an hour and a shuttle for Comfort Inn never showed up. However, several shuttles for other accommodations did. Obviously, at this point we decided to board the next shuttle that showed up which was to Fairfield Inn & Suites.Mind you, we also contacted your “customer service” telephone line to be sure there wasn't any other flights that could be taken so that we were behind schedule an entire day. The rep insisted that there wasn’t. Not even with any other airlines. At this point our frustration with the lack of care or effort that we received throughout our trip so far was growing. We asked the representative on the phone to speak with a supervisor that could potentially be of more help. She told us there was not anyone else to speak to and that American Airlines does not have a customer support team. She also told us that in order to file a complaint the only way to do so was by email and that we were not able to officially file the complaint until our trip was completed in case any other issues were to arise. I wish that this was the end of the complaint but unfortunately many other issues ended up arising and this was only the beginning of a nightmare trip that should have been everything but. The following day we made sure to get to the CLT early so that we could check with baggage claim again to make sure both of our checked bags were being directed to our new flight to LHR, they assured us they were holding them and they were in track to be put on our new flight. When it became time to board our flight from CLT to LHR we checked again with the onboarding desk at the gate because our app was showing only 1 checked bag was in route to be loaded onto our plane. She also assured us that if 1 was showing then the other was loaded as well. We checked the app again after getting seated on the plane. It was still showing the same thing, 1 bag loaded and the other still in CLT. We were planning to check with a flight attendant to explain the situation and see if they could offer any type of insight but instead the first attendant that came around was unbelievably rude and hateful. Before we even had the chance to speak with him he looked in the overhead storage and proclaimed ”who’s bag is this?” In which my husband replied “mine” and the attendant said “you should do something with it because if I have to touch it, it’s going under the plane with the checked bags”  To be talked to like that after everything else that we had just went though truly was enough for us to decide to NEVER use American Airlines after this trip again. I am not sure where this man received his training from but I can assure you if it were my company I would not keep him employed. What a poor excuse he is for a flight attendant. Horribly rude and no manners whatsoever. Needless to say my husband was furious and decided to ask one of the other flight attendants, Pattie, if there was anyone he could speak to about this interaction. She sent over her “supervisor”, Keith. Keith came by to ask what the issue was and preceded to tell my husband that he would prefer the short story of the situation that transpired.  So we started the short version of our story and Keith equated everything we had endured so far to being a “rough day.”  Keith and Pattie would not give us the name of the attendant and instead told us to tell you that it was the male flight attendant on the back of the plane. We also asked for a bottle of water on this flight and the attendant told us they didn’t have any bottles of water for purchase. Which is shocking for how long the duration of that trip was. We also paid for preferred seats on this flight.  So, as you can imagine at this point we just gave up with any hopes that anyone on this plane had any respect or empathy for their passengers.Once again I wish I could say this was the end of the awful experience we had but as I’m sure you can guess at this point it is not. After finally landing in LHR and going through customs we went directly to the American Airlines service desk to have them track our bags and he too assured us that both of our bags were now on track to be delivered to INV and was unsure as to of why our app wasn't updated.Now, we finally were on board to our final destination- Inverness, Scotland. As I’m sure you have guessed by now, once we landed in INV 1 of our bags did not. We honestly weren’t surprised based on the turn of events that we had already experienced. We were just exhausted and emotionally drained from the entire experience. So now, we have to deal with a lost bag on top of our wedding in 2 days. We were lucky enough to meet a true customer service rep with British Airways, the first person throughout this experience that actually seemed to care. This rep not only filled out the appropriate paperwork but also immediately called the airports we had flown through explaining that our wedding was in 2 days and how important it was to find and receive our luggage in a timely manner. He was able to locate the missing luggage and even arranged for a courier to deliver it since our place of stay was located 3.5 hours from the airport. Thank you, Ian!This review has taken some time for us to write because we wanted to celebrate our marriage and not focus on the negativity of the trip. We have been in contact with American Airlines customer relations rep, Cesar, and he has advised us the only thing that they can do is reimburse us for the hotels stay at Fairfield Inn & Suites and offer us a $200 flight credit. This credit really has no value to us as we have mentioned several times we will never be traveling with American Airlines again. It would have been nice to be reimbursed for the additional cost of covid testing we had to pay out of pocket for since this was something we had already done in preparation for our original flight. Unfortunately, Cesar said this was not possible. So we assured him we would be leaving a review for American Airlines that truly showed our experience. Now a couple months have passed and we are doing that.I also want to be clear that my husband and I have both worked in the customer service industry for a majority of our working lives and know that this was not handled in a professional or courteous manner. We firsthand understand the stress that is placed on everyone in service industry fields due to the ongoing covid pandemic. Unfortunately, the way this issue was handled from all aspects was a total miss and disappointment on American Airlines part. We hope this review will have you look at other options when deciding on who you will travel with next."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst Experience Flying EVER!,"I have never in my life seen a less organized, more chaotic, poorly organized airport/airline area as I have during our December 11-18 trip from Nashville, TN to Miami, FL and on to Anguilla. Not one single staff member seemed to have any idea what was going on or how to handle the crowd of people at either airport. No one was telling us where we were supposed to be or what we were supposed to do, there was virtually NO signage directing the awaiting passengers, we almost missed and DID miss one plane. All in all, it was the most stressful flying experience I've ever had. In addition, they did not get our bags to us once we got back to Nashville until the next day; that was unacceptable, especially since when we finally got back into Nashville, they told us we'd have them by 5:00 p.m. that same day. I will never fly American again."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,"Late, Bad Food","Our flight left late, more than an hour late.  The captain in his sketchy updates said that a screw had to be replaced and then paperwork needed to be completed.  It all sounded fishy and did not give us much confidence.  So we were stuck and late.  We were in First, but the food was barely edible.  Still the service was as good as possible."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Terrible organization,"Used Southwest, delta, and American airlines for consecutive traveling. No issues until I hit American airline. Both flights late/no crew...actually they were wrong we were waiting on a broken ramp. American is always messed up."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Generally unpleasant,"I constantly tell myself I'm never flying with this dumpster fire airline. Then there's no other flights available and I'm stuck with these turds.Short version: they're generally disappointing.Long version: this case in point rant.... my most recent experience. When I initially booked the flight, I booked over the phone and was told that my husband and myself (along with our baby) were seated together. Day prior to the flight, turns out we were not and called the line to see if we could change this. We were told that this could not be done over the phone??!! So we waited til we got to the airport and changed but then discovered that the unfriendly as h*ll guy at the desk CANCELLED MY HUSBAND'S ENTIRE A*S FLIGHT??? And marked him a no-show?! Does he do this regularly but he's kept on because why? How does someone accidentally cancel a flight?We didn't discover this until the day before our return (today) when we attempted to check in and could not FIND HIS FLIGHT BACK. We called customer service to attempt to fix this prior to our flight tomorrow. We were kept on hold for 2 hours and eventually told that we had to PROVE that we were on the flight somehow? We had an entire ticket that was scanned when we boarded? Does that NOT confirm we were on the flight?! We were told that absolutely nothing could be rectified over the phone? She told us we could not prove he had flown. She told us that this had to be done day of at the airport (why not say this from the beginning then?????).What is the point of calling customer service if they can't book the flight correctly in the first place or change a flight or fix something like an accidentally (?) Cancelled flight? What exactly are they capable of? Does American airlines just bet on people getting so mad and giving up?Or do they expect the customer service people on the phone to just get yelled at and take it? Because that's horrible and unfair to them. That puts them in a shiet situation. All in all, they're awful. They fudge up and won't fix it and act like it's your fault for booking with them in the first place and existing, I guess? Avoid if your can. If you have to, know it'll probably suck."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Disappointing performance in 2021,"We took three trips this year, and every leg of every trip was cancelled, delayed or otherwise screwed up. They did everything but lose our luggage and they came very close one flight... Sometimes it was crew shortages, but more often it was the M word - gee folks we need maintenance. Well I want the plane fixed, but it should be on their time not ours! Very sad - we used to be loyal customers. Delta next year."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,The worst service I have ever received by a airline,"So Dec 25th I was supposed to fly back from St Louis to Philadelphia.  That flight was delayed 3 hours behind schedule.  So by the time I get here to board my second flight to get back home to Virginia, that flight was already gone.  So I had to stay here in Philly overnight till the next day.  And the funny thing is that flight on Dec 26th to Norfolk was DELAYED AGAIN!!!! I was supposed to be leaving at 5:45 pm and it kept getting pushed back to 9:58 pm. I’ve been here since 2 pm this afternoon waiting to go home now I’m not gonna be back till 11 at night, I will not be flying with American ever again how y’all mess up 2 days in a row!"
Date of travel: December 2021,20,First experience going out the country ruined,"This was my first time flying internationally and I was told the wrong information that I had to get my bag from baggage claim after I missed my original flight. After waiting and seeing no bag I was then told to go to baggage services so they can find it. Finally an hour later waiting on this line and missing the next flight, I was finally told that I didn’t need to do any of this as the bags automatically go to the next plane. The next flight was the next day so I had to spend extra money and get a hotel for the night as I wasn’t offered a hotel room for free even though there was wrong information given to me. Then when I finally got on the next flight the next day I arrived to my destination only to see that my bag was missing but my travel partner’s was there. After going to baggage services I was told that my bag was still in America but will be coming on the next flight which was luckily an hour later. My entire vacation plans were delayed by a day because of all this."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Ripoff Airlines,"Bought refundable tickets intentionally.They were ""refundable"", but with a cancellation fee higher than the per ticket price paid over week prior to flight.They're simply stealing money.  Utter joke of an airline that we will never use again."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Canceled flight/ rude customer service supervisor,"Flight was canceled just minutes before getting on a 5 hour shuttle to the airport. the tickets were rebooked for a flight for  tomorrow, but Now The shuttle will need to be rebooked as well as a new covid test because in order to travel internationally I now need a negative result within 1 day of travel.  I'll have to eat the cost of the shuttle and the covid test and rebook both. (Not even sure that it will be possible to get a new covid test done in time without an appointment and during the holidays). This is all a huge inconvenience not to mention I'll be missing a whole Day of my vacation! AA just canceled with no thought of how it effects everyone on that flight.When I called AA customer service about this matter, the customer service rep supervisor was so condescending and rude. Told me I had to go to the site and write an email to customer relations which I am sure will take a very long time to hear back. It will most certainly be well after the new booked flight for tomorrow. There was no apology for any of the inconvenience or the new expenses incurred because of their issue!  What's an individual to do if the large corporation just decides not to fix the issue? I guess all I can do is to keep posting on social media and maybe call the BBB. The least they could do is issue me a full refund for the original ticket price."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,What is on time departure?,"We were stuck in line while others, that showed up late jumped the line time and time again. We got to the plane and forced  to check bags, even though there was plenty of overhead space. It was clearly to pull away on time and sit on the runway for 45 minutes, I hope probably longer. I hope our conscientiously packed carry on makes it to our destination and we make our connecting flight. Why were the airlines bailed out for poor service and unhappy passengers?"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,No refund for cancelation,"American airline is the horrible airline ever. I booked a ticket to Thailand on February for the round-trip, and needed to cancel it because of covid19.  First of all at the time when I booked the ticket, in Thailand they needed the thing called Thailand pass to be able to travel there. However, I didn't know about that, so I booked a ticket though the third-party, and ending up with this terrible airline. I contracted the third-party to get my full refund,  but they told me to contact the american airline instead and I did. You know what she (the awful costummer service) said with lazy voice and let me hold for more than 35 minutes. She said we can't do nothing about it. I said that mean I will lose 500$ for nothing? Her answer is be like 'Yes' Terrible, worst, terrified airline ever! Very disappointed. I will never use AMERCAN AIRLINE again!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Food seved,"Asian vegetarian meal was booked online, but not served. Highly disappointed. Especially being a strict vegetarian, had to go hungry"
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Medical emergency & kindness,My son was in PA & had a medical emergency & I have a vertigo condition that comes in waves so the stress made it really bad. At Yuma airport the employees helped & a lady named Diane helped me so much I consider her an angel. I was in bad shape & she got me to my Phoenix connection & we parted. I didn't get any of her info & would love to thank her again. AA treated me like a queen with wheel chairs & helping me walk to bathroom. All my flights were on time to & from PA.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,"Dont expect them to go the extra mile, or even an inch","Travel plans change, and sometimes we ask for accomodation. I havr had great experiences withbdelta, southwest, and all non us based airlines. Then there is american. Rather than go into detail, i will just say my experience with them falls squarely into the “i give them one star because i cant give them zero”"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,A long time AA customer,"I travel with AA at least one time per week. Lately AA has become a terrible airline with so many cancelled, late flights. Also 8/10 flights start with some sort of technical issues to begin with. Very frustrating. Will start changing airline for sure."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Christmas Morning,"My daughter and I are flying home from a short visit with family. We were both a little sad we were traveling on Christmas. Gate attendant, Tonya, made it a wonderful morning by the gift of an upgrade! Sure was cheerful and chatted with everyone. She did a fabulous job turning a bummer of a travel day into something we won't forget. Thank you Tonya and Merry Christmas!"
Date of travel: December 2021,40,An interesting experience with a pleasure of a messup,This is the airline we flew to lax with. The first flight was a little bit turbulent but the staff were very polite and we got treated to good views also. We had a connection in Phoenix sky Harbor airport. However On the second flight. The plane was much nicer than the first one as the first plane was a very old plane. The flaw was on the 2nd flight that I liked the boarding music but it is not needed for deplaning. However we had an excellent experience and we hope to fly with them again soon.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Flight Cancelled Last Minute and Horrible Rebooking Experience,Horrible experience. They cancelled my flight on Christmas with less than 10 hours notice. They put me on hold for 30 minutes and said they would only offer me a flight that was 9 hours longer than the one I originally booked with two new connections I would have to catch.  Very rude in their delivery as well. I ended up having to get a flight a day later and they said they would give me no compensation for the change in flight - even though I have to pay for a hotel reservation I can not move and I am missing Christmas with my family.  Save yourself and fly a different airline because this was a horrific experience.  Wish I could give zero stars.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Unacceptable Service,"On, December 12th, 2021, I had to change my flight due to me arriving to the airport late. I had just completed an eight day cruise and due to no fault of mine, we were not able to deboard the ship on time. I called customer service to change my 10am flight to DFW from MCO (0012318160083) to the 11:20am flight for $74.01. Then, I was informed the flight was delayed until 3pm, then 10p, then 11p, then 8:50p then to 8:20p. I was placed on the Standby list for four different flights with no chance of getting on due to prior cancelation because of the tornado that happened the day before in five different states. I was in Orlando's airport for nearly 12 hours and I only asked for a refund for the difference in the fair ($74.01 not the original price of $319.00). Now, normally I would not have asked for the refund but the Gate Agents allowed four crew members on the 1:45p flight instead of four full fair passengers, two who were behind me on the list. Now, when I expressed my concerns with the Representative on the phone she asked if I knew their situation; like were they trying to get to work. I explained how I did not know or care and if they were trying to get to work,  they are supposed to leave early and that is not a reason for them to bump full fair passengers. These crew members choose to live somewhere that the airline is not based out of, so again bumping full fair passengers is unacceptable. Having passengers waiting 12 plus hours in an airport because th original plane is having maintenance issues and no other plane readily available is unacceptable. So, I guess playing a little more with another airline with better customer service is worth it going forward."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst airline EVER,"I was sitting in the plane as well as the other 100 people, and they said 2 minutes after we were supposed to take off. “We are late on filling out paperwork.” I have sat in the plane for an extra 50 minutes which can possibly get me COVID-19. I advise no one to stay here this airline is trash. The captain hasn’t said any further instructions of why we have been waiting here for about an hour."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,"Awful service, from the gate staff to online customer service","Changed my departure airport so I had to find a ride 2 hours away to another airport. Terrible service in PHX with gate staff too busy gossiping to let people know the flight was delayed on the layover. Rude as hell when we asked the status 20 minutes after we were supposed to board. Now a week later, 3 customer service reps who can't speak English and hung up on me twice...because their stupid computer systems are so outdated that a father and son with the same name can't check in online.  Oh, and thanks to the one rep that could speak English who scolded us for having the same name. Absolutely the worst service across multiple AA locations means AA just plain sucks no matter where you go."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Very disappointed is AA,"My husband and I were suppose to travel to Montego Bay jamaica from Raleigh Durham airport. We live 1.5 hours away. Our neighbor dropped us as it would be too expensive to leave our car parked at the airport for over 2 weeks. We got there 2 hours before our flight and it seems As if the airline was over booked we could not get assisted and therefore we were not able to make it on our flight. Nothing was provided for us but a flight for the next day. We had to pay for a taxi and a hotel close to the airport as we did not want to inconvenience our neighbor to come get us the same day and bring us back the next. We also had to do another Covid 19 test which we had to pay for. It was a hot mess and I am beyond disappointed, I will travel with any airline but my husband only fly’s with AA which I doubt will be happening again and the worst part is all this took place the 21st of December which was his birthday. It ruined everything for us as we were suppose to be in jamaica that afternoon to celebrate it with friends and family."

Date of travel: December 2021,10,Changed my flight 2 times.,"I would never recommend this airline, they changed my flight 2 times . I bought my flight with 6 months of anticipation to be with my family in Christmas Eve. Never flying with American Airlines again. Heidy Velarde."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Couldn't be better!,"As an 80 year old, semi-handicapped (unsteady on my feet) curmudgeon with senior agoraphobia, I may start traveling again after our recent flight with AA.  From the gentleman who got us our tickets and checked our bags in Philly,  to the two people who pushed me in a wheelchair to and through TSA at both sites, to the woman who boarded us in Ft. Myers with a reassuring ""take your time, there's no need to hurry"" encouragement, we were both surprised and delighted--particularly in these stressful pandemic times.  Both flights left and arrived on time; the waits for our luggage were unbelievably brief; and every employee we encountered was simultaneously professional and affable.  Over the years we have encountered seemingly disgruntled, expedient non-service oriented personnel at airports around the world, but our AA experience featured caring, expeditious individuals--quite an astonishing upgrade!"
Date of travel: December 2021,20,Masking and hearing difficulties,"My understanding was masking was a regulation with this airline. We went to Mexico for vacation and was seated in Back of a child ( about) 4 who COUGHED non stop from Sacramento to Mexico with out a mask ON ! Not ONE STEWARD OR EMPLOYEE asked the MOM to make sure the child wore mask.. so I had to ask ,if which the parent told me ,He wouldn't wear anyway. This ruined my trip that day, because your squeezed into the plane.ALSO when the attendants are giving out important information they don't speak loud and clear enough for those of us who don't hear well and dont know what we are suppose to do in regards to airport regulations.. I won't be flying them again."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Disaster,Don't use this airline . The staff are rude. They don't tell you what's happening. You can't get any info from anyone
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Made me sprint a mile through PHX just to get to my connecting gate.,"Connecting flight deboarded late, with 5 minutes between deboard and gate close from the second leg of the trip. This airline made me sprint a mile from terminal A to terminal B just to catch my next flight, no pick up or delivery service. FFS, absolutely whack"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Bad customer service.,My flight is tomorrow morning and is my first time flying and I wanted to make sure everything was right. When I got there I was in line and this elderly woman with short gray pixie  hair cut assisted me. I asked her if she could tell me if everything with my flight was right she then proceeded to respond with an attitude for no reason. Overall the experience was not it and for it being my first time I would not recommend especially now as I am reading all these bad reviews. But let’s hope everything goes okay tomorrow 😀. I will not be taking  AA again😗. Dios los bendiga.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Bad Airline,"20 plus year flyer, I will not use them every again. Flew first nonstop NC then north to Philly. Long flight segment, poor quality sites, no film or entertainment service. Food, did allow you have the can of soda, only water and tiny bag of peanuts. This what the call first class. AA should be a shame to trash their brand. I got more service on a short leg segment.  Save your money!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,AA are crooks and thieves,"I fly regularly and 80% of the time there is an issue with AA. Stay faaaaaaaaaar, far away from these people. Charged twice for a flight and they wouldn't refund it even though they botched it. I could go on and on with several other stories (Oy.. the Punta Cana trip 🙄) but long story short... absolutely horrible and incompetent customer service and they will not fix issues if it requires them to do any work. This is piss poor business being conducted by these hacks."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Never on time,Even with a 3 hour layover you still miss your connection because no flight is ever on schedule.   Putting us at a hotel and a $12 meal voucher that doesn’t even pay for a burger is a joke. What a horrible way to start vacation.  Then the trip back was worse.  5 hour delay finally get on a plane then need to deplane because of issues.
Date of travel: December 2021,20,American Airlines is the new Spirit Airlines,"I used to enjoy flying American Airlines but after this experience today, I will never take the chance again. Not only did I spend 12+ hours dealing with multiple delayed flights and missed connections, but the customer service to take care of these issues was disappointing. There was ONE attendant having to handle a very long long of people needing rescheduled flights. That one attendant obviously was overwhelmed and dealing with many upset individuals to the point he finally broke. The attendant became extremely hostile, rude, and unhelpful which only caused the upset individuals to only be more upset. FINALLY after almost 2 hours in this line for rescheduling, another attendant came to assist with rescheduling and another lady came to try and calm everyone down. Her name was Lunita I believe and I respected her patience and concern to get everyone the help they needed. American Airlines has shown us this past year that their business system is NOT working. Stop over booking and stop under staffing. One employee should not have been responsible for such chaos. Although I want to be angry with that attendants behavior, I can understand why he got to that point. The entire experience was miserable and I highly recommend everyone be cautious booking with American. They’re the new Spirit Airlines yet charge the same high prices as other airlines. Not worth it."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,american airlines - liars,LIARS LIARS LIARS!!!i don't know where to begin. upon landing in hartford i got a message from AA stating that my bag didn't make my flight. HOW CAN IT NOT MAKE THE FLIGHT??? I had 25 hour layover in a small airport!!! I spoke with someone on the phone who said it would go out the next morning at nine even though my APP showed it was en route. More lies from an airline!! I went to baggage service at the airport to explain the i needed the bag as it had my CPAP equipment which allows me to sleep without stopping breathing because of sleep apnea. They said that the bags would be delivered as soon as they arrived in hartford. I did get an email that stated my bag was out for delivery with an ETA of 4:07 PM. More lies!!! I just spoke with the delivery company TNT Delivery at 830 PM who told me they just picked up the bag and it will be among their first deliveries tonight!!!!! WTF!!!!!I just started looking at reviews from Skytrax and i probably wouldn't have tried AA had i read them earlier. I'm experiencing EVERYTHING i've been reading on those reviews. Customer services is HORRIBLE!!! Just about EVERYONE i've spoken to or any automatic information i've received have lied to me time and time again!!!
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worse Flight,One of the boarding attendants is not trying to help when my flight was delayed serval times in one day. I was forced to sit in the airport for more than 13 hours because of the flight delay. It was my first-time using American Airlines and based on my previous flight experience use United Airlines they offer much better customer service. I have received a good apology and  300 dollar flight credit because of their delay.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Unprofessional Flight Crew,"I am horrified regarding a virtual video related to your flight crew unprofessional, very aggressive & nasty behavior to a family flying with a 7 month old child. To slap a cellphone out of a passengers hand while reaching over the baby was discussing on top of a few other things I saw. I will never use your airline as a means of transportation."

Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst ever!,This airline is the worst! Baggage stuck for so long and some more let dog on the plane without complete documentation. Won’t recommend to fly with this airline. Stewardess are all above 50’.. wth???!!!
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Poor service by American Airlines again!,The folks working the desks at American Airlines counters for both check in and boarding we're extremely rude! They gave false information and accused other airlines of not doing their jobs. AA does not allow gators even though the CDC AND FAA both say doubled up gators are allowed and safe. AA is allowed to make their own rules but they should acknowledge that it is in fact their rule and not an FAA guideline as they claim.They insinuated that I was lying about wearing a gator on flights and then said the other people were not doing their job.This is just one more instance among many reasons why I don't like flying on American Airlines!
Date of travel: December 2021,10,They hold you over phone when you needed the most,"Flight was cancelled, had to rebook over phone...1st agent said he could not make decision, transferred...2nd agent tried rebook, then 3 hours 15min passed...Now I am with 3rd agent and he said he need 1 more hour to rebook and apparently I waited long enough that no more flight tonight would be available...I am sure their system should be faster than searching over google flights.THEY JUST WANT TO KEEP YOU HOLD... MAYBE FOR OTHER 'BETTER' CUSTOMER TO SECURE THE SEAT... OR JUST WANT TO DISGUST YOUAVOID IF POSSIBLE"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Zero rating if possible,"I said our  class of travel was first class. Key word there is WAS. After three delayed flights we were rebooked and rerouted. Not only were our seats not in First class which we paid for, we weren't in exit rows where we at least would have had more leg room, we weren't even seated together. Gate agents were rude and the rebooked flights were delayed as well. Never flying American again. Should have known to stick with Delta."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,BEWARE DOG OWNERS----$250 is not enough for AA.,"BEWARE DOG OWNERS----$250 is not enough for AA.       Being a frequent flier on AA, I was embarrassed and dismayed when my 17 lb. dog and I were turned away from the Priority ticket counter at ORD because my dog was “too tall”.  The rule says the dog has to be able to turn around in the carrier with the top of the carrier zipped. Only teacup dogs would fit this ARBITRARILY enforced rule. The supervisor took great pleasure turning us away.        We had flown on AA 28X in the last 3 years with no problem."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Stranded by American Airlines in Dallas.,"We took a vacation to Colorado and on our way back from Durango Colorado American Airlines delayed their plane due to maintenance issues on flight 3162 the same plane that actually came and picked us up nearly two hours later only to miss our connecting flight last night and running through the Dallas airport to gate c28 flight 1336 only to find the door slammed in our face and told us we will not get on the airplane, and we had our boarding passes only to go to customer service and they yelled at us and now another day later still at Dallas Airport trying to get home to Orlando the worst experience as far as flight is concerned it's horrible that there even called American, to add insult to injury they have lost our baggage and we're trying to figure that out now. All of this while traveling with a 10 year old I would recommend United Airlines or Southwest or Frontier but not American Airlines which is a shame because their name is American."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,"Flight changes, horrible service","I am absolutely disgusted with American Airlines. I am am AAdvantage customer and have several flights currently booked with them. They have made my travel plans this holiday season beyond stressful. You have changed my fights so many times (5+ times according to your customer service agent) and not once notified me.  I check both my email and AA app relatively frequently. My flight home to Portland apparently was changes 5 times and I only found out about it when I went to check in for my flight this morning and found that it had been changed from a late afternoon flight to a morning flight. I now do not have a ride to the airport and there are no ride share services in my town. I now will have to pay someone lots of $$ to get a ride. When I called to see what could be done the customer service agent said that this is something I should have taken care of shortly after booking, and this is when I told her I was not notified of any scheduled changes. She told me there was nothing she could do since my flight had apparently been “confirmed” by my grandmother. When I asked her how this had happened she said that my grandma called on 12/13 to fix our return flights to Florida since those schedules had been changed as well. When I asked my grandmother she said she was not informed that she was confirming the entire trip, she understood from what the agent had said that she was only confirmed the return flight. Now my options are to either PAY $600 or keep it the way it is!! People book flights at certain times for a reason and then once flights are booked we make transportation arrangement and other travel plans based on flights. It is ridiculous, especially so close the the holidays that you are changing our original flight times, making it very difficult to change flights back, and then have the audacity to charge $600 to make a change. This was all 100% out of my control and I honestly expect better from them as an airline. I understand that things happen and that everyone is overworked and stressed due to the holidays and COVID, but the lack of customer service and respect that I have received with this experience is enough to keep me from booking with American again. I’d prefer to fly with Spirit airlines because at least then you know what s*** you’re getting yourself into."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,Multiple delays due to issues with planes,I flew to Sarasota from Milwaukee with one connecting flight stop in Atlanta. I used Delta and arrived to both ATL and Sarasota 15-20 mins early. The way home with American Airlines was the exact opposite. Our flight delayed 1 hour. Then another 45 minutes. Then they had us board where we sat another hour before they said we can get off the plane. Another hour went by and we were boarded back on to the same plane after they fixed what was wrong. We had to change our connecting flight since we missed it. Then the connecting flight was late and broken down. We were on the runway for an hour before they turned us back to the gate to fix it. We sat and waited another hour. Finally we got home…..at 2am the next day. I wouldn’t use them again even if they have the best rates.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,"Delays, Forced Baggage Check, Theft","What I am about to say, I mean quite literally: every time I fly American, my flight is delayed. This connecting flight was no exception; delayed by 90 minutes, with no explanation as to why. To add insult to injury, I was forced to check my bag at the gate, in spite of the fact, that I had not needed to check my back on the 3 flights prior (2 flights to my destination and the flight connecting to this flight from Chicago). Once, I got home and unpacked, I discovered that the car GPS I had in my bag was gone. Nothing else had been touched and the bag was undamaged. Clearly, this was theft.I will never use this airline ever again."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Always a delay with American Aurline,"I flew with American Airlines 5 times this year. In the 5 times I travelled, we had to make connections every time. Unfortunately, every single time there were delays departing the airport. Their tracking parameters must be trash because this is ridiculous. How come any of their flights aren’t departing on time? I’m not talking about 10-15 minutes. I’m talking about 45-1hr just sitting on a plane. This is just disgraceful. They need to do better."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Awful Service - Lost 2 luggage and damaged 2  !,"Lost 2 of my luggages, and broke the wheels of 2 others, and only one luggage out of five survived. I filed a claim and had to wait in the airport for a long line for 40 minutes, and I was told one didn't get shipped, and the second one arrived on the belt, but I was never able to locate it. The lost items are invaluable to us, and nothing will compensate that. Customer service on the phone never pick up. I was not considering American Airlines for my travel due to downhill slope of reputation, but had no choice, but if times flies back, I will pay an extra 1-2 thousand to buy my comfort and leisure, and preserve my precious belongings"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,The Worst Airline,Terrible.  They have no idea what they are doing.  Miserable experience.  We arrived 3 hours early for a flight and didn't even get to TSA.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Dangerous planes,"2 out of three planes were broken and required 4-5 hours a piece to repair at the gate. This added 10 hours to my 15 yr olds trip bringing him to Mobile at 12 am, 10 hours late. I called American to see if they would assist my son that was freaking out. And their reply was I would need to pay. They were the most unprofessional people in air transport. I will never use them again. American sucks."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Do better.,"Got to the St Louis airport 2 hours early for our domestic flight back to North Carolina. We fly first class, and waited in priority line to get our boarding passes and bags checked. They only had 1 agent available to check in priority, and 4 agents for main. There were 2 agents walking around the kiosk area. With what would seem like a good amount of help, the place was an absolute crap show. The priority line didn’t move for an hour..after that they finally brought another agent to help. For over an hour one agent was working with a women who’s flight was cancelled, trying to find a new one for her. Since the line was held up, we , along with 4 other families ended up missing our flights. American Airlines has poor customer service and exhibits lack of communication between the agents. If they would have communicated they would be taking a bit longer with a customer, therefor holding up the priority line, a lot of families would have made their flights. Many complained to the girls running the kiosk area, and the agents were extremely rude and unprofessional. Also not helpful. Be better, do better AA."

Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst travel experience ever,"American cancelled my trip with no warning then, placed me on hold for excess of 9 hours! Yes you are reading right 9 excruciating hours and still on hold, and very little has been solved. Do yourself a favor, drive, use another airline or wait until teleporting machines are a thing because American Airlines is just terrible! I would not wish this on my worst enemy!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,*WILL NEVER FLY AGAIN*,"TERRIBLE! UNFRIENDLY! The gate was changed multiple times one of witch being last minute; as delayed multiple times and scheduled back to the original time. We had made a connecting flight had a long layover. Had to check in to be one the first flight but at the connecting flight were turned away for the plane being over crowed and ""not checked in"". Were at the airport for nearly 12 hours without leaving. Impossible not to be checked in. It then took nearly an hour and a half to get straighted out with hotel and taxi vouchers. Our trip was cut almost 2 days short due to there neglect. We talked to other denied entrance to the plane one of which had been there for 24 hours. They had refused her a hotel voucher the night before. She spent 24 hours just to be denied again. NEVER FLY WITH THEM!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,RN,"Worst experience I’ve ever had flying. First class ticket. Ticket counter agent and supervisor, Marjorie, were very rude. Maybe they needed a lunch break. I use to fly for continental. I know it’s not easy dealing with the public. I try to be nice to these folks. These people were poor at their jobs, had little knowledge, little patience, and it took two supervisors to resolve my issues. Checked two bags. I saw them tag the bags. I should have stayed to watch them put both on the belt. Honestly, considering the gate agent’s  attitude and demeanor, it would not surprise me if my bag was held behind deliberately. With a first class ticket, checked luggage is supposed to come out first at baggage claim. One of my bags came out almost last, and 24 hours later I’m still waiting on my second bag to be delivered. American has been unhelpful and apathetic on the phone during this process. As I use to always purchase American tickets first, i will be rethinking my choices in the future. Airlines and the employees have a duty to try to ensure safe travel to from their offered destinations; not act as though they are temperamental gods that control people’s destinies on whatever whim they are feeling any particular day."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Rude and unprofessional conduct,"Arrived at the airport 2hours prior to flight but spent most of that time in the security line. When we arrived at the gate 10min before departure (because my special needs son can’t run!) we were told that the door was closed and we had no options but to fly the next day. I tried to explain that my son only had enough medication to last for THAT day but not the next and asked if they could call the plane and allow us (and the other 5 passengers that were there prior to departure time) to board. The gate agent at the Austin airport, Aisha Scott, said no, I said “you’ve GOT to be kidding”….at which point she said she could call the police and have us removed. She also yelled at an older couple next to us that barely spoke English; yelled at a younger man that was now going to miss his extended family’s Christmas in California; yelled back at me to get out of the line until I decided what I wanted to do. We and the others sat there in disbelief for 20minutes until the plane pulled back from the gate. Had to cancel our trip.  She was the most unprofessional, rude, power hungry, obstructionist agent I’ve EVER come across.  All before 6:00am! Wow….merry Christmas to you too American Airlines!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Awful awful experience,"We left Gainesville airport to Aspen with a connection in Dallas at 7 am. We were to leave Dallas to Aspen at 12:30. Our flight got delayed because American didn’t have enough pilots and crew. We ended up leaving at 9:15 to Aspen but when almost ready to take off, the plane was stopped and after few minutes the captain announces that they have really bad news for us all. We cannot take off because Aspen doesn’t take any flights in after 11pm.  So we returned to the terminal and over there we are left to deal with re booking of the flight. American doesn’t offer hotel room although was it’s fault we cannot complete our flight to Aspen. And the queu to re book is 4 hours long, not having any kind of luck re booking on the phone.by now is 2am when finally we decided to go back home since the next available flight to Aspen is going to happen on Sunday  pm. This is happening on a very early Friday. Very frustrating, they were very rude, they can do all this because people don’t have many options. Worse traveling experience ever but not the only bad one missing connections with AMERICAN."

Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst airline to fly,I was flying to Dallas from Austin to catch an connecting flight on 14 December. flight was delayed which is ok and can happen. But the attitude of the staff was pathetic. Most arrogant and impolite staff I have ever seen. One lady staff shouted at a customer and called him names. The gate was changed and while display was for  Dallas they said the flight will go to Charlotte. Anyone who was approaching the staff for clarification was told that unless you are boarding for Charlotte move away from counter. What a staff.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Left us!,The worst airlines ever! We were at our gate 10 minutes before boarding closed and they shut gate on 4 different parties. The best part is the ticket lady gave me a peace sign when we asked if we could still get on our plane. Will NEVER use them again. Definitely the worst experience I've had flying. This happened in. DALLAS.  See picture of everyone who had this happen and they were all different destinations.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Overbooking,"Bought tickets on September to flight in December. The day that we have to flight, with everything ready iat the airport. Baggage with documents ready.

Date of travel: December 2021,10,Where is your customer service and communication??,Flew out of Orlando flight was delayed 20-30 minutes had a connecting flight at Ft Worth Texas to El Paso which of course left me and other passenger's. Why wasn't it communicated plane was running behind to give us a grace period to board? Why weren't we a priority at exit? Why wasn't there some mode of transport as courtesy from the Airline to drive us to the other side of a busy airport? Why am I being punished waiting 3+ hours for another flight placing my business meeting ar risk? First and only time I will use AA. And all I can get is a sorry while the plane is sitting at the gate. Where is your service American Air?

We had our tickets booked well in advance, and took great care in ensuring our COVID and travel documentation was in order.  At the ticket/boarding counter, the AA representative told me I could NOT board the flight -- because my passport was due to expire in FEBRUARY; she said there's a ""three month"" rule, that your passport must be valid in Costa Rica for a full three months from the time you arrive.  (We were only staying there a few days -- December!)   She insisted this was the case, even though that information was NOWHERE to be found -- I called the Costa Rican EMBASSY IN WASHINGTONG DC and they said that this was 'totally wrong information' - your passport simply has to be valid for the time you're in the country.   I'm now proceeding to officially complain - our trip was ruined by American Airlines, DON'T BOOK W/ THEM."

Date of travel: November 2021,10,"treatment of a customer in ""pain""","My husband and I were travelling to India via  Dallas TX, with British  Airlines. We had to  travel in American Airlines from Dayton to Dallas and from  Dallas  to London. Normally we fly economy but  this time we booked in business  class because of  my health condition. I had hemorrhoids and  couldn't sit  even for a minute, thinking that I  can sleep on my side in business  class we booked  paying so much. When we reached Dallas and when  it was  time for us to board the plane, at the  counter they just told us that  they were putting  us in economy premier. Without any warning or any indication whatsoever they just told us that. When they were talking to us they were not  even looking at us, they  were just busy typing something, as if we were nothing and no regrets about what they were saying. There was no   apology or any kind of nice behavior, they were  out right rude and  obnoxious. When I asked why  they moved without any warning, the lady at  the  counter said ""lower you voice"" in a stern voice.  That was  astonishing for me. We were never  treated like that before with such rudeness. They  told us ""either this flight or fly tomorrow"". Did  we have  to change our plans just for these rude  people and go next day???? I  tried to explain my  condition but they didn't even bother to listen  they  just gave us the voucher and went on to the next customer.This is an utmost  disservice to a  customer and I never felt so helpless in my life.  Is  this the customer service AA provides? Do you call this customer  service? Why do they exploit  the customers like this? if we needed to  pay  less we would have booked in economy but for my  health reasons we  booked in business paying  more. I had a hard time sitting during the  whole  time from Dallas to London. My condition was  aggravated and had  lots of trouble. There is a  reason why they call ""pain in the butt"". It  was  unbearable and I had to tolerate it all because the AA decided to  move us to economy without any  consideration for my health or human decency. My husband even begged the flight attendants to at  least move me to  business since I couldn't sit,  they didn't even try to help. Even the attendants were not nice. They were unresponsive  and almost inhuman."

Date of travel: October 2021,10,The most horrible airline I flight with. Avoid if you can!,"We got some flight credits and paper voucher from AA leftover from our previous trip and try to use it in our new trip. Previously, AA says we can just use this for new flights when we need it but it’s actually just a nightmare!In order to use this credits and voucher, we had to call AA customer service 5 times, each time the agents were giving us different information. Many of them say we can’t use our paper voucher with credits for our new tickers for different reasons, but when we call the supervisor or other agents, many of them confirmed we could. Then after many calls, they finally resolved and agreed it’s possible and ask us to go to the airport to redeem the voucher as the last step. But when we arrive at the airport, the agent told us they can’t use the credit at the airport, and ask us to call online agent again. In the end, one airport agent really helped us, and honestly the only one that knows the process and got the ticket for us. If we haven’t met him, we will probably need to spend another 5 hours calling AA customer service line.It’s a horrible back and forth experience, almost no agent seems to be trained enough to know the correct answer. The wait every time is super long. Every agent is saying different things. I’ve never experienced this with any other airline. AVIOD at all cost. After this, we will never fly Aa again!"
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Beware of Seat Changes,"While we had no issues with the flight itself, we could not understand why we booked our flight in August & chose our seats we found ourselves 17 rows further back and not even together?  When we inquired as to why, the customer service  rep 1st lied and said due to plane change which the plane was exactly same.  She then told us if we ""purchased"" our seat then they would honor it, meaning if we paid the extra up charge for a certain seat then we would probably not have been moved. I guess the few hundred dollars you pay & choosing your seat at time of booking ahead on their own portal guarantees nothing but a seat on the plane.  They offered us exit row seats for 33.00 each more which we declined."
Date of travel: November 2021,40,American Airline Evaluation,"Airlines are not very accommodating at this time.  No meals, Only tiny bag of pretzels. No alcoholic beverages.  Even on cross country flights, no alcoholic beverages.  They should decrease their price of tickets for consumers immediately."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,Delays and more delays,How do you not have an inspector on hand to do a quality control check on a repair to our aircraft that is now late for departure and consequently we won’t be making our connecting flight because of this. I’ll tell you what the problem is. It’s the triple P. Piss poor planning.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Horrendous scheduling,"Somehow American has become the worst airline in the business at scheduling. No longer holding connections, stranding passengers, and poor reconnects. Worse than the budget airlines now"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Do NOT pick this airline -- ATROCIOUS customer service!!!,"My flight from Dallas to Vegas was delayed to the next morning and I had to stay overnight without any toiletries, which happens and is understandable.What is NOT understandable is the way American Airline's incompetent staff handled their passengers' inquiries! Whoever put Samantha at DFW in a management position should be ashamed... her rudeness to passengers was like nothing I've ever seen. One passenger, a young single mother holding her baby, approached Samantha to ask if she could get a change of diapers from her checked luggage, since she wasn't expecting to stay overnight, her baby's diaper was full, and she didn't want him to develop a rash. This poor woman was on the verge of tears, but that didn't hinder Samantha from callously and aggressively scolding her for putting the diapers in checked. Don't get me wrong--I get how hard it is to pull luggage out of checked; it could take hours to an indeterminate amount of time. But there is a WAY to deliver even the grimmest news, and that way is respectfully, graciously, and compassionately. Why on Earth would someone as disrespectful, ungracious, and unempathetic as Samantha be put in a customer service MANAGEMENT role? When the mother asked, ""What should I do, then?"" Samantha simply stared at her and dismissively replied, ""We don't handle that here,"" turning to another staff member so that she doesn't have to ""deal"" with the passenger. When the passenger continued asking, breaking down into tears, Samantha just continued repeating the same nonchalant, monotonic answer, like a robot. She did this until the passenger, emotional and frustrated, finally left with her baby.I personally did not engage in any confrontation or dialogue with Samantha, nor did I have to ask for her name (there were enough other dissatisfied passengers to do that for me), but in the short time that I waited for my hotel voucher, I was appalled to see the same situation repeat with an elderly woman who asked about medication for a major illness. Needless to say, I will be avoiding American Airlines at all costs in the future, as well as spreading the word where I can. Any airline capable of carrying out such exceedingly poor hiring decisions is not worthy of anyone's money and time."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst Airline….perhaps EVER?,"Prior to this year, I have always flown on the cheapest flights possible, usually in Economy, or sometimes in Business Class. Most of my previous flight experiences were very long-haul, international flights roundtrip from USA to Asia. I have experienced being in the worst possible seats for Economy [literally the last seat on the plane behind 3 sets of screaming babies] and [what I thought at the time] was the best in Business. For my most recent trip to Austin, I decided to fly fancy and booked First Class tickets. On the way there I was on Delta, and while it wasn’t as great as the Business class experiences I had on Asiana Air, it still exceeded my expectations.On my way back was a completely different story, however.The issues began at the airport, American Airlines counter, as I was checking in. The person informed me that I was able to access the Lounge with my ticket, and that I didn’t need a credit card. I was pleasantly surprised, and walked towards the nearest gate. The nearest security checkpoint was closed for the night so i had to walk 15 minutes across the way to the next one, get checked, then walk all the way back to the other side of the airport. What’s more, my bag got stuck because of a candle and I was waiting for over 30 minutes because they only had ONE [slow and rude] lady checking people’s things one at a time. When I finally arrived at the lounge, I was turned away because I “needed a special credit card”. -__-;;On the flight, the flight attendants are all rude af. They start yelling at a passenger who fell asleep with his mask a little below his nose! When he was upset by being yelled awake he was berated for having his mask slightly below his nose.There was a flight attendant who looked to be in her 20s or 30s, wearing glassess, who was so freaking rude. Every time I asked her a question she would seem really impatient and upset. Why did I pay extra for a ticket for the flight attendants to be so hostile?? Their in-flight entertainment was a joke. They had no TVs/monitors on the seats and they forced us to use our own devices to connect to their damned entertainment things. This would be okay if the apps worked well, but lo and behold, it did not work well. You HAVE to use Chrome on Android devices and Safari on Apple in order for any of the content to load. The ads work regardless, don’t get me wrong. If you were using Chrome on an iphone, for example, after the ads played, you would get a black screen. You have to switch to Safari, rewatch the SAME 5 minute cringey travel ads, and then maybe the videos will load.For music, they connected to Apple Music ONLY. So if you didn’t have the app downloaded, tough t. No music for you. What if you have the app but you forgot your password? Oh well, same sh—. You either payy for the $7.99/hour Wifi or suck it up.At the end, when we finally landed, we couldn’t go to the gate we were supposed to go to because another plane was there. We had to wait 15 extra minutes for the plane to move out of the way. 15 minutes later we hear an announcement that the plane in front of us is malfunctioning so we have to find another empty gate to deploy into. I had to use the bathroom so I got up to use it. The SAME RUDE FLIGHT ATTENDANT starts YELLING at me and giving me attitude that “now I have to notify the pilot. You weren’t supposed to get up” I asked if she wanted me to sit back down and she scoffs and goes “too late now” wtf???? why am I being berated on my flight?!This takes another 10 minutes for them to find an open gate, then another 10-15 minutes as our plane rolls over to the area. The area turns out to be in the INTERNATIONAL arrivals section, but for whatever reason, our LUGGAGE was still dropped off in the DOMESTIC arrivals section. They told us to walk around the entire airport with a. bunch of twists and turns to get to our luggage. The pilot announced this ONE TIME and expected all of us to remember.Shouldn’t they have had someone ESCORT US TO THE CORRECT AREA????If y’all couldn’t tell by now, I effin hated this flight experience.Never flying AA ever again."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,First Time and Last Time,"I will never again fly with American Airlines again. It was the worst experience I have ever had. Now I understand that planes can be delayed for weather and that is not their fault however, unlike most airlines when a plane is delayed the connecting flight waits for the delayed plane to get in, so that those passengers don't miss their connecting flight, which is exactly what happened to me and several other people. We were flying from Omaha to Phoenix, our connecting flight was leaving at 8:40, we didn't even get to out gate from Omaha until 8:45. Again I understand flights being delayed for certain things however I feel that the airline could have done a much better job of accommodating the late flight, especially since we all ran to the next gate to find the plane still there, but they couldn't let us on because the ""doors were closed"" this was by far the most frustrating situation, but wait it gets worse. To say the lady standing there was less than helpful is and understatement. Since there was only one other flight leaving at 10:45 to Vegas we did get on that plane, but they had to delay it until 1 am as the flight crew was coming in from Minneapolis and they had been delayed because of weather. So now I am sitting in an airport for 4 hours past the time I was supposed to leave because the flight was delayed BECAUSE OF WEATHER and we had to wait for the flight crew BUT THE PLANE COULDNT WAIT FOR US TO GET IN BEFORE CLOSING THE DOORS BECAUSE WE WERE ALSO DELAYED!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Do NOT fly American Airlines,"In my 61 years, I cannot remember ever writing a bad review for anyone or any company.  We bought 1st class tickets for the first time for a once in a lifetime trip to Europe in 2020. Long story short, Covid hit and we had to reschedule for 2022.   American would not refund the $8000 tickets & so we fought to get them extended. We were finally given vouchers but they were for $2500 less than our original tickets.  We have tried since May to contact AA  customer relations to get this resolved & will not return our calls.  Think twice before you use AA for your airline carriers."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst airline experience in history,I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW HORRIBLE AND INEFFICIENT THIS AIRLINE WAS. Arrived at the airport 2 hours before flight and spent that entire time waiting at their ticketing counter so that we missed both of our flights. Shocked they have survived as a business and hope they do not continue to. Choosing to fly with them was the biggest mistake I’ve made in years. All the airport workers literally laughed when we said we were flying American and knew we were screwed. This line turns a corner twice. Wish there was a zero star option.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Do not Fly!!!! Choose another airline,What has happened to this airline!!!! The worst airline ever!! U gave to sit an hours after landing to get off tthr airline!!!!!! Its ridiculous!!!!!!!
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worse Experience,American airlines Miami Florida Airport Worse experience ever Service so rude They do not care about people. Thanks American airlines My kids an I won't never forget about today. I will see you guys in court
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Rude uncaring ticket agent,Upon arriving to the terminal to check in bags we were informed we needed to go online and fill out the emigration form or else we would not be able to board the plane. Ticket agent hands us a piece of paper that looked as though he tore it off a bottom of a piece of paper and says we needed to go to that site and fill it out online. After having difficulty completing form  we asked for help. We are an older couple and not as cell phone savvy as most. The ticket agent turned to the other ticket agent next to him. Tall woman with blond hair for help. She stated very rudely they need to do it. It's not our problem.If they don't fill it out they won't be flying.  I stated we r not looking for anyone to fill it out for us just guidance. I finally called customer service and the gentlemen on the phone began to help us. With that the original ticket agent comes over and says u have 20 minutes to finish or u will miss the flight. We went over to a another ticket agent by the name of l. Powell who helped right away. She saw the error and helped us fix it. The customer service person on the phone also stayed on the line until we assured him the form was completed and were checking in the luggage. Needless to say the stress and anxiety this caused ruined the first part of our flight. I couldn't believe how rude this blonde haired woman was. Uncaring.  Btw the terminal was not crowded.. this person has left a sour taste in our mouth and we will think twice before flying AA again. If it were not for l.powell as well as the customer service person we called were willing to help we would have never been able to board a much needed flight to punta cana. I deal with covid patients on a daily basis and it's sadthat an American airline rep would treat anyone the way we were treated. There has to be a better way. Our regret is that we did not get the name of this rude and unprofessional rep. We boarded flight 452 on 12/6/2021 @ 3:40 @ phil international Airport. I hope AA will reprimand and retrain this agent. Caring is very important during these times of covid.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,American Airlines. “We’re never on Time”,"Ill start off by saying Flight 1100 was one of the more pleasant flight I’ve had on American. It was only two hours late! Since the pandemic started I’ve flown a dozen or two times on American of which every flight was either delayed, canceled or switched gates. Keep in mind 90% of those flight were out of Dallas, one of their major hubs. In other words, I don’t understand how a company can be so mismanaged at an airport that they pretty much own and have virtually unlimited recourses with the one exception of pilots and crew. You would think after furloughing all their pilots to save a buck and then calling them back after they had to quit their new jobs they’d be doing a lot better. I will say that their employees are generally fantastic.  I don’t envy them when management puts them in theses situations where passengers are coming at them as if they had anything to do with the problem. American Airlines really ought to considers changing their part 121 operation (scheduled air carrier) to a part 135 operation(unscheduled air carrier)."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Just Don’t Do It!,"Fly any other airline! My flight was originally scheduled from Salt Lake to DFW to CVG on 12/13. However, because the initial flight was delayed for 2 hours- no explanation given. Was given a $12 food voucher for my troubles. Arrives in DFW after 10pm (3hrs later than supposed to) and all the restaurants were closed- so useless food voucher. Was told I had a room booked inside the airport, however it was 3 miles away and I had to pay for a $30 cab ride there. Arrived at the hotel around midnight, left at 3am bc I was rebooked on a 6am flight $30 cab fair again. Departed from DFW and arrived in Charlotte at 9:02. Sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes. Missed my connecting flight by 15 mins. Was sent to customer service by a rude gate lady who just pointed and said customer service. Was rebooked again on a 1pm flight to CVG. I have been traveling for 2 days now, through no fault of my own, simply because AA cannot get their stuff together and have their planes arrive on time, their staff be friendly and cannot hire employees who have common sense."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,Overall my husband and I love flying with American,"My husband and I fly with American Airlines frequently and for the most part we are satisfied with the quality of service. I am however curious as to why my husband is not added on my AAdvantage membership. I’m curious to know why we never get seats directly next to each other even though they are booked at the same time. During this recent flight our seats had to be put together once again and a wonderful agent by the name of Dave in Montego Bay Jamaica took care of that for us with no problem. Upon boarding the plane we realized even though our seats were together we still had to board the plane in different groups. Now we are on the plane heading to our seats and a Caucasian woman and her children are in our seats and her husband is across the aisle yelling you can sit somewhere else it would be better for the whole plane to keep these kids together. Now your children are your children but I’m not one of them and if I paid for a seat then I should be able to fit in it. We bought it to the attention of a flight attendant who had us stand to the side while he went and spoke to the couple. He comes back and says just give me one minute and I’ll get you guys some seats. After standing there for 20mins while the rest of the plane boarded, he finally came and sat us in the exit row which we did not want but we’re forced to take with no compensation for the inconvenience even though there were other open available seats.I am very disappointed in how the manner was handled because I paid for something I did not receive. Very poor service on handling this situation. Unfortunately we are not going back to American Airlines."

Date of travel: August 2021,40,Amazing Customer Service,7 hours prior to our scheduled departure we received an email cancelling our flight home from St. Louis.  At the time I had no idea what the cause of the cancellation was and spent the next 3 hours on hold waiting to speak with someone....unfortunately the line was disconnected.  So we went to plan B - go to the airport and speak to someone in person.  That is when we found out that all of the flights the prior day had been cancelled and it ran into the day we were to fly - weather was the culprit.  By the time we spoke to the check in agent - found out there were absolutely no flights that day to get us home.  I asked to speak to a supervisor - which is when we met Arianna Gray - she was absolutely amazing.  After about 90 minutes of searches she was able to get us on flights home on another carrier (granted it was the long way home) but none the less it got us back on Canadian soil so that our PCR tests were still valid.  We will forever be grateful to Arianna as she went above and beyond to get us home.  Thank you
Date of travel: December 2021,10,#NeverFlyAmericanAirlines,They are almost incapable of arriving on time to any destination. Your flight will be delayed at least once every trip you take.

Investigating everywhere there is no rule that vaccine is required. We had PCR result with us but they sent kids home .Kids went home crying
Date of travel: December 2021,10,They stopped caring - 20-year AAdvantage customer here,"American Airlines just doesn’t care and has no empathy. If you’re interested to know why, read on, and to give some background I’ve been an AAdvantage member for at least 20 years, many of which I was Platinum so I know what I’m talking about. This past weekend I made a visit to my brother who lives out of state and I flew American. This is what happened: I purchased my nonstop ticket months ago and shortly before my trip American sent me an email telling me that they had changed my ticket and had added a stopover. Not only is a stopover inconvenient and I had initially paid more for a nonstop flight but they were goofy enough to state in their email that there would be “no additional charge for the change” (Why! Thank you American!). I know it’s the pandemic but they could do better (they gave me only 25 minutes for my connection!) A day before my flight they sent me an email  saying that they had changed one of the gates to a different concourse. So now not only did I only have 25 mins to make my connection (and everybody knows it can take a while for passengers to exit the plane once parked at the gate, which makes such a short connection even tighter) but also now I was arriving at a faraway concourse and had to run as fast as I could to barely make my flight. When I finally made it to my connecting flight’s gate the overhead bin space was full and so they made me check my tiny carry-on (no fault of my own), and this normally would be fine (I guess?) but with my flight arriving at my final destination a bit after midnight and after a long tiring and stressful day now I had to go stand at the baggage claim forever to wait for my tiny carryon to come out. Had they apologized or shown a tiny bit of empathy I would have understood, but nope, that didn’t happen (instead the gate agents were rude, I know they work long shifts and are stressed so I guess I should not expect at least some courtesy anymore). American Airlines just doesn’t care."

This company cares nothing about the customers, and after repeated issues with them over the past four months, I will never fly with them again!  Every level of customer service has been terrible, from the airport level to the corporate level. Despite the huge hit the airline industry has takes due to covid, the majority of flights that I have taken with American since September 2020 (approximately 25 flights) have been problematic.  They have cancelled countless flights, the staff has been outrageously rude and speaking with a representative is almost impossible.  I have had flights cancelled and rescheduled, through no fault or choice of my own, and in doing so have been downgraded from business class and refunded next to nothing.  Corporate does nothing and cares only about the financial bottom line, with no thought to the customer experience.  Do yourself a favor— save yourself the time, money and stress, and fly with ANY other airline other than American!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Empty Promises,"This vacation to Palm Springs has been extremly stressful as a result of American Airlines inability to fulfill our travel registration. AA canceled and/or delayed our flights, causing us to travel to other airports and extend our travel time from 3.5 hours to 12 hours. We paid higher rates for the shorter travel time because my pregnant wife is not suppose to travel for extended time (high risk of preeclampsia, increasing the likelihood of deep venous thrombosis, which can cause a pulmonary embolism, increasing the risk of death), not to mention also traveling with a 21 month old. My wife's medical risk is low with short travel times, but increases as the travel time increases. These are reasons why we were willing to pay HIGHER rates for a shorter travel time. This was unfufilled by American Airlines on BOTH booked flights traveling to/from Palm Springs. This is unacceptable. But worse yet, no accountability was given for any of the cancelled and/or delayed flights. In addition, as a result of AA's inability to manage their scheduled flights, we missed out on the first night of our vacation rental (non-refundable), costing us $580 for an unused house. We had to rent a car to drive from Palm Springs to Phoenix, instead of flying, costing us $262. We had to pay to book a last minute flights on another airline, costing an additional, $260. In total, this company's incompetence has cost us $1,102. From this point forward, we have lost faith in American Airlines to care for their customers. We do not plan to use this airline in the future and will be cancelling our AA credit card. We will pay more to fly any other airline. We wouldn't have reached this conclusion if we had been given any impression AT ALL of American Airlines willingness to rectify the problems created on their end. Time and time again we were told, ""Sorry, there is nothing we can do."" So we are done."

Date of travel: November 2021,10,Gross,"I use American Airlines because they are the only airline that has a non-stop flight from San Diego to Miami that allows unattended minors.  I fly my two young teenagers back and forth from their Mother to me their Father.  Recently (November) we arrived to the airport 2.5 hours early as requested.  Once I got up to the counter to check them in, I told the attendant that my two minors were 12 and 14 and were flying unattended.  She gave me a dirty look and said, ""where are their ID's?"".  I explained to her again they were minors and did not have an ID.  She goes, ""where is their paperwork you are supposed to fill out?""  I told her she had it and I always filled it out at the counter because it wasn't available online.  She glared at me and then got the paperwork and handed it to me.  I asked her if she had a pen I could use.  She goes, ""We're in the middle of a pandemic, we don't have that stuff""  I told her I didn't bring one because I wasn't sure if I could take it through security and it had never been a problem in the past, I've flown them many times since the pandemic started.  She scolded me again for not having a pen and then stormed off.  I don't know where she went but she came back about 5 minutes later.  She then turned to the attendant at the next counter and asked to borrow her pen.  The attendant handed her a pen and she gave it to me.  I filled out the paperwork and gave it back to her.  She printed the gate pass for me and the boarding passes for my two children.  She has them in her hand and then says, ""Ohh we have a problem here"", ""You haven't paid for their trip"".  She was dead serious.  I immediately pulled up my email with the trip confirmation and receipt.  She didn't even look at it but goes, ""ok"".  Then hands me the passes.  I feel like this woman was intentionally trying to bait me into causing a scene or getting mad and yelling (I felt like it on the inside but wasn't gonna give her the satisfaction).  My two children were right there next to me watching all of this.  When they fly out it's already a sad and nervous time for them because they are flying alone and leaving their father.  It was truly appalling and gross.  This kind of behavior is not acceptable.  This women made it 10 times worse for them and just left a really bad vibe.I was polite to her from start to finish for the sake of my children.

Date of travel: November 2021,40,First Class Cross Country,Flew cross country for the first time and decided to upgrade my ticket to first class. The seat was able to lay flat so it was extremely comfortable and convenient because it was an overnight flight. Highly recommend upgrading if you can.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,American Airlines makes all other airlines look great,"American Airlines makes basic things that other airlines do regularly and things have become standard practice seem like futuristic alien technology. Bad seats, Poor Wifi, Poor customer service, Bad website, unusable App, and awful company policies. On too many occasions have flights been cancelled and American Airlines has 'Conveniently' be-booked my flight for me for 2-3 days later... You are better off just avoiding this airline even if its tempting to save a few bucks."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Terrible service and experience!,"My fiancé  and I traveled from Newark to Miami to curaçao. Once we got to Miami, an American Airlines associate assured us that we didn’t need to pick up bags because they will automatically be transferred to our connecting flight. Well that did not happen. One of our bags made it to Curaçao and the other bag was left in Miami. So my fiancé was in a 5-star all inclusive expensive resort without his bag! He was without his clothes, hygiene products, money, shoes, and more for a day and a half before it was delivered to our resort. We spent hours in hours on the phone only to be met with rudeness and nastiness from their employees. They was giving us a run around trying to figure out where exactly his bag was. Or first 2 days on vacation we spent most the time making phone calls and trying to locate the bag. Once the bag arrived in Curaçao they gave it to a driver to deliver to us with no name, number, or way to know how long it will take to get our bags. He eventually came at 10pm that night. Ridiculous!! Thats just the beginning!!On our way back, we reached Miami from Curaçao on American Airlines with a connecting flight to Newark. Once we landed , the plane was stationed on the runway for at least 30mins. When we deplaned, we ran to our connecting flight, not wanting to be late, and we forgot to recheck our bags through immigrations. (Good thing we didn't) After running the whole way to the gate for our plan, they started to give seats away and the seat we paid for was giving to another passenger. When i asked the associate why and what was going on, he quickly said what he said. I asked him to repeat himself because i didn't understand and he totally ignored me and my fiancé. So we missed our connecting flight due to American Airlines deplaning us so late when they know they have passengers with connecting flights. If we were to stop and recheck our bags to immigration, we would have still been late to the gate and our bags would’ve been on the flight but not us. We asked for a manager, in which the associate became more nasty and rude. This Airline will never get another dollar from me! This was the worse experience traveling I’ve ever had. NEVER AGAIN!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Worst Service Ever,"AA is terrible, not worth the money. Flight attendants seem to have an attitude on every flight I’ve been on recently. The attendants got aggressive with one passenger about him wearing his mask, although it was his first warning. Terrible terrible service. This airline seem to care about quantity over quality."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Traveling,"Very, very rude people.  American counter.  Bad people skills. They treat people like animals.. like telling people,, I chose what I want.. "" there I ever call your name.""   It happens on November 28 2021. In the afternoon shift."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Homophobic Employees,"The American Airlines boarding crew at Miami International Airport has some major issues with homophobia and racism.  I witnessed them treating various passengers very differently.  They tried to prevent us from boarding and tried to take our carry on luggage, which was smaller than other passengers’ luggage.  When I told them it was clear they were targeting us and noted their names to report them, suddenly our bags were fine and we were able to board.  When we got onto the plane, we realized the overhead bins were actually the oversized bins and there was no shortage of space at all.   This is unacceptable.  American Airlines needs to make sure that their employees receive some training regarding their bigotry or they’re going to end up with a lawsuit.  Flight AA795 on 12/6"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Don’t Care About the Customers,"We had a flight from Atlanta to Dallas and then from Dallas to Colorado Springs. The flight from Atlanta was on time but then they stated it would take an additional 45 minutes in flight. We, as did many others, had connecting flight from Dallas. We originally had an hour but then had 15 minutes for our connecting flight which was in a different concourse. When asking about the connection, the flight attendant was EXTREMELY rude stating we can “deal with it through their website”. She didn’t give us the website or anything and just walked away. She then made an announcement that, everyone probably missed their connection flight and will be rebooked whenever they have another flight which is probably not today. When they plane was stopped at the gate to deplane, they had everyone in front of people with connecting flights get off and didn’t bother to assist the people who had 10 MINUTES, to get to their connection. We had to SPRINT through the airport to make it to our connecting flight and the attendants were annoyed that we were late. This is on top of me changing my flight for this trip and being lied to about cost on MULTIPLE fronts. I was told one price then, when going to pay, it would “magically” become more. I despise this airline and will NEVER fly here again. The majority of airlines, are cheaper, better quality, better service and, if they know you will just be a couple minutes late to the gate due to the AIRLINES ISSUES, they will hold the plane for a couple of minutes. Don’t waste your money or time with them. You will be treated poorly and when they make an error it’s the customers fault, not theirs."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst customer service,"Unable to leave 0 stars. AA cancelled original flight. Subsequently, changed my flight twice, routing me through a different city, landing hours later than originally planned. Missed my connection at the airport. Late for check in at BnB costing me extra $$. Customer service does not care and rude saying there are no guarantees in life and she could be dead tomorrow. Who says things like that?"
Date of travel: December 2021,20,Awful,I remember now why I never fly with American Airlines. What an awful airline but most people know this already.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst flight I’ve had in 25 years,"United and delta will serve you alcohol but not AA, also the seating is much smaller and has no room, if your flying just go with another airline, they have really lost touch with the customer imo. They also do not sanitize the planes for an entire day or offer sanitizing towelettes, so you take a greater risk of getting Covid with this airline. It’s very sad in these trying times this airline cannot keep up."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Just Awful,"Whoever does the hiring clearly prioritizes poor communication skills, disrespect and inconvenience toward customers.  American Airlines has made it very clear how they feel about those who choose to do business with them."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Agent charged additional $180  for ticket,"I called to change a reservation. I spoke with an American airline agent. I was told by the agent there was no additional fees to change the reservation. When I tried to check in, the system wouldn't let me. I called American Airlines for a second time and they told me I had to pay an additional $180 if I wanted to fly out on time. I had to accept their terms because I've already canceled hotel reservations and meetings. My advice fly with a different airline."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Lied to get people to deplane,"Due to a weight issue, people were offered a voucher to deplane.  Those who did were told the offer was a mistake, but by then the plane was gone. They admitted that the flight attendant made the offer, but they refuse to honor it."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,You can do better American Airlines,"Our flight was delayed coming out of Cozumel due to some equipment issues.    As a result we were late arriving in to DFW and missed our connecting flight.  It was late at night and we were directed to go to a ticket counter for further direction.  We were essentially told the only option was to stay over for a flight the next morning.  The counter representatives were curt and somewhat rude.  Midstream in the interaction,  they passed our group off to another representative and they left.  I asked if we could rent a car and was told they ""don't do that"".  We were given food, transportation, and lodging vouchers,  Our hotel was a Days Inn which was pretty rough.  We were dropped off and there was an empty wine bottle on the steps, we had to drag our bags up the steps as we did not see a ramp in sight.  We checked in and wet to the rooms which were horrible.  Sheets and bedspreads were stained, peeling paint on the doors, rusted hardware on the doors, light in the bathroom didn't work, grout in the bathroom was filthy (so not showering),and shelf on the bathtub wall was missing.  Overall, really bad conditions.  Throughout the entire evening's experience not ONE of the American Airlines representatives apologized or exhibited any empathy for the situation.  I was also told the passengers behind us were booked at the Hilton.  They must have had more miles than we did.   The next day we arrived at the DFW airport and the American Airlines representatives at the counter were great....they had heard of the situation and were very helpful.  The flight attendants on our morning flight were very helpful and kind as well.  They apologized on behalf of all the others that did not.  These two flight attendants were AWESOME!        Come to find out, if you want to call and submit a complaint....you can't.  They only accept online or written complaints which require you have all of the travel document information so more of the responsibility falls on the paying Customer rather than American Airlines.   Their system is pretty efficient as it takes your payment but not so much if you are not pleased with their service."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,All went well,"We had a very good experience flying from Springfield Illinois to Reno Nevada to Los Angeles to San Diego and back to Springfield. All the flights were on time. The staff on the flights were courteous and friendly. My wife needed a wheelchair and we prearranged at each stop. All of the staff that helped us with the wheelchairs were very friendly, courteous and helpful.  Especially Johannas from Ethiopia in LA and the young lady from Somalia in Dallas. Good job American."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,American Airlines is always difficult to travel with,"Totally Unnecessary Baggage fee!!!   Came from an international flight and they charged me $30 because it was booked through Norwegian Cruise Lines and according to American Airlines they booked it separate from my international flight which was inaccurate because it was listed when I selected my seat assignment back in September and was in the international terminal. (Flight was Nov 14th). Fellow travelers who I flew with did not have these fees, and flew across on Delta and did not have any domestic baggage fees for the outgoing trip.I fly at least 1-2 times per month and have not flown American Airlines for years because ALWAYS have issues, delays (not due to weather)  missed connections, etc...I will continue to avoid American Airlines and suggest the same for everyone"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Not a single flight ever on time,Well back at the airport and flight already delayed over two hours.  No anouncement or updates on to what is going on.  This is my 12th flight this year with the worse airline on the planet!!! Every single flight I took this year was either delayed or canceled.  If they don't have the staff to handle flights they simply shouldn't schedule them.  Unacceptable how they treat their customers.  In Europe they couldn't do this as there are laws in place to compensate passengers.  Here in the USA American Airlines does whatever they want.  Avoid at all cost if you have other choices to fly.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Rude selective Gate Agents,"We and several others were asked to check our carry-on, because they were ""too big!"" The same agents allowed large duffle bags in which were clearly larger than our bags. The flight wasn't full and there were Empty Overhead Bins upon takeoff."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Las Vegas - Dubai - Las Vegas,"Our trip was a circuitous route from Las Vegas to Barcelona for a cruise and we entered Dubai from the Cruise Ship Terminal.  We flew on American Airlines from Las Vegas to Barcelona and their partner - Royal Jordanian Airline from Dubai to JFK and from JKF to Las Vegas on American Airline - it was a long return flight taking us approximately 30+ hours given our two stops (Aman & JFK).  We are American Airline frequent flyers - we like their service and Royal Jordanian was equally very good service.  I should mention we were in business class for all flights, had access to lounges, and used priority check-in.  Here are some tips: (1) We needed to present our CDC vaccination card and Spain QR Health code at the Las Vegas check-in.  (2)  To receive the Spain QR Code we needed to upload our vaccine card and as a backup had COVID antigen test within 48 hours of our flight (though we did not need this); (3) We needed to present a PCR Test and a QR code at the Dubai airport check-in along with our CDC vaccination card which we uploaded to Royal Jordanian to receive the QR code; (4)  At JFK we did not use the re-check after claiming our baggage, instead with when to ticket purchase & check-in area - used the kiosk to obtain new boarding passes and self-luggage tag for handing off our baggage (all very simple) and finally (5) A visa is NOT NEEDED if you are a USA citizen and staying less than a week - DO NOT USE ON-LINE VISA SERVICES LIKE - Insta Dubai Visa - www.instadubaivisa.com."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,American Airlines and Their Corporate Greed with 3rd party businesses,Don't use veterans advantage to book your flights.  American Airlines won't honor prices if you have issues. I could not correct the issue that their software had in time since they kept giving me wrong contact information.  I got the run around and after I explained to them that I have been emailing them and calling them with no luck for help they didn't honor my confirmed price and they wanted to charge me almost double.  Just go to another airline.  I hope my brothers and sisters in arms make it home for the holidays without the issues I'm having.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Visit,"I went to the counter to ask for an upgrade. They said they had a full flight. I sat back down, a few minutes later they called me up and said the pilot saw me and said I couldn't bored since it appeared I had been drinking. I think AA is trying to lead the way in a second prohibition. Also, their seats are small their armrest are low and make no sense."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,AA came through for me.,"My wife and I purchased a flight in April of '21 for an upcoming return trip from Panama in January of '22. We had to cancel it because it turns out I am going to be undergoing chemotherapy during that time. According to AA's rules we could get a voucher good for travel up to 1 year from the original booking date, meaning we had to use it by April of '22. The problem is that I would still be immune-compromised in April and travel would be very risky. So I contacted AA's customer service and asked that they extend the voucher for even just a couple of months until it was safe for me to fly. Chad G. and his team went beyond what I asked and gave us until the end of 2022 to fly. The airlines get a ton of bad press these days, but in this case American Airlines showed that they had my best interest in mind. Thank you, AA!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,This is the worst airline on earth,"I fly literally every week for business and I cannot understate how trash this airline is.  Flights are so frequently canceled or delayed, connections missed, customer service is a joke.  Their loyalty program is overrated.  Because so many of their flights are overbooked/oversold, upgrades are rare and the inflight experience is generally miserable.  Frequent equipment changes mean that selected seats are very often jot honored and I’m convinced they change flight times and gates at the last minute intentionally so that more people miss these overbooked flights.  Very often flights are delayed, sometimes by hours only to have the flight time moves back up.  So imagine you’re sitting at home and see that your flight is delayed 2 hours, so you delay heading to the airport.  Then as you’re on your way you see your flight is loved back up, so now you miss it.  And do they help you or at least rebook your for free? Nope!  And with Charlotte and DFW as their main hubs, they allow bookings with connections so tight they are all but impossible to make even if everything is on time (both airports have terminals that can take up to 30 minutes to travel between), God help you of the flight is delayed even 10 minutes!  Avoid, avoid, avoid!!!!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Complete lack of customer service and professionalism,"Booked a flight to Milwaukee to surprise my grandmother for her 91st birthday. Flight was supposed to take off at 8:54pm. We boarded a plane, and sat there for roughly 2 hours before being informed that the plane had mechanical issues severe enough that it was now out of service and we would need to deplane. American Airlines then had us board an alternative plane which reached all the way up to the run way before that plane had to be brought back to the gate to look into further mechanical issues for this alternative plane and they didn’t know how long it would take to resolve these secondary issues. After boarding 2 planes that had mechanical issues severe enough to return to the gate, I made the decision to deboard due to safety concerns and a continuation of an already 3 hour delay. Upon deboarding the plane I attempted to discuss my options regarding rescheduling my flight or obtaining a refund as well as information related to regaining possession of my checked luggage from a representative by the name of A. Napier at the DFW airport. The representative proceeded to tell me that American Airlines did not have a number for customer support, or an email address to contact and that my only option was to reschedule or cancel my flight. As far as my luggage, and despite the flight attendant telling me they would pull my checked luggage from the plane, Miss Napier informed me I would just have to hope it was unclaimed when it arrived at the baggage claim in Milwaukee. I was able to locate the customer service number for American Airlines and despite having my flight delayed by more than 3 hours, the planes they intended on flying having significant enough mechanical issues that the pilot made the decision to head back to the gate, and the money I spent on a hotel that I was unable to utilize due to the conscious safety concerns I arrived at based on the pilots actions… I was provided the option of a refund or the same flight in the same seat the next day and basically told that it would be up to me to locate my luggage.BY FAR, the worst customer service experience I have ever had and the lack of professionalism and business efficacy from each service representative that I spoke with was extremely prevalent over the course of this ordeal."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Boarding Pass Fiasco,"American Airlines email check in web page only allowed by to print 2 of 3 boarding passes. I had 2 connecting flights on 11/23/21, so I needed 3 boarding passes. American Airlines check in web page did not have an option to print the boarding passes from home and get the email link for boarding passes.  I called American Airlines customer service. American Airlines agent was not able to email be a link with the boarding passes. American Airlines agent agreed to transfer me to another department that could potentially help. Instead I got some worthless customer service survey, then their system hanged up on me. Luckily one of their agent's at the gate was able to print my final boarding pass. On my way home to NY State I checked in and selected the option to receive my boarding passes via email. I had two flights. The first flight from Phoenix to Chicago. The boarding pass from Phoenix to Chicago would not scan. Luckily I had one of your agent's at the Phoenix airport ticket desk print my boarding passes. For my second flight from Chicago to Albany the boarding pass would not load on my phone. One error after another. Again, luckily I had a printed boarding pass. The flight from Chicago to Albany was a small plane one seat on one side of the plane and two seats on the other side of the plane. The seats were very uncomfortable. It felt like was sitting a steal rail. Nothing, but problems. A real hassle and stressful situation during my vacation. American Airlines boarding pass system is flawed and needs a lot of work. I would not recommend this airline."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Wonderful service,This was the first time business class made us feel extra special since Covid A five course meal with glassware silverware China and excellent foodWow
Date of travel: October 2021,40,Smooth Trip,"I flew from Boston to Wilmington NC on AA for a long weekend. The flight was unremarkable, with no delays or cancelations - which somehow feels like a win. Snacks and drinks were provided on both legs, which was appreciated, and a bit of surprise given that one of the connections was ~1 hour flight. My only complaint is that  the streaming service did have some issues not loading content. I would recommend downloading any movies or shows in advance, and apple music if you want to stream or a playlist if you want to listen to your own music. Spotify wasn't supported :("
Date of travel: September 2021,40,Reviewing American Airlines,Flight was fine. Snacks were nothing special. Wish they had better in-flight entertainment. There were no screens.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,worst business class flight of my life!,"$2500 used to buy some comfort and some courtesy. Dont you wish???Not now with this bunch of clowns.Worst crew, least ever comfy seat and grim food. Wine was appalling and the attitude from the off was that they are doing me a favour taking my money from me. I have a better idea - unemployment!Thats what the rude, unhelpful, opinionated jerks in the team deserve.I am a GOLD CARD holder with British Airways which means I fly A LOT!They could also do with learning a little bit of courtesy when it comes to mask exemption. Their customer service team assured me that they would honour my UK exemption from my heart and lung disease. NO! They threatened to throw  me off the flight if I didn't wear a mask for the full 9 hours.  I have had a chest issue ever since. Bless 'em.Crap comfort, crap team and crap attitude.  I never knew how much I appreciated BA until this flight so some good has come of it all after all.AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Horrible Airline...Are They Serious?!?,Horrible service all around from the cabin crew.  Are they serious about running their operations with such disregard for customers?!?  I really hope the Airline fails and goes bankrupt or something - we need to get these kinds of garbage services off the market.
Date of travel: November 2021,50,JFK to MIA on an AA 777-200 in First Class,"This was the return flight from my previous review of the AA 777-300ER.  Like that flight, this was also operated by a 777 but a 200 as opposed to a 300.  This is significant because of the different cabins and seats.  The 300 is a 4 class plane with an actual first class cabin (2 rows in front) and the 200 is a 3 class plane; biz, premium econ and econ.  I was in the first row (yay) on the right side of the plane.  The seat itself was similar to the 300 variant but was also different enough to warrant this review.  Overall, I preferred this seat to the 300 version.  It felt a little roomier, the screen was fixed in place and the overall impression is that it's a newer product.The ground experience was pretty good.  Checking a bad was quick with the kiosk but then I had to leave the kiosk area and get on a short line to drop the bag with an agent.  It felt like the line should have been setup more naturally from the kiosk area.  Terminal 8 at JFK is one of the better terminals and getting through TSA was quick.  The flight started boarding on time but we left the gate about 20 mins late.  It was fun to board the plane and go left instead of right.  The service was good on this flight with a few FA's in the forward cabin.  Like the last flight, it was nice to get a meal for such a short flight and with a real cloth napkin and metal utensils.  The food itself was decent but nothing amazing.  The flight was smooth and we landed in MIA roughly on time.Good experience overall and will def book again."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Expect delays,"Of the last three American Airlines flights I have taken, all were delayed. 2 required flight rescheduling. You get your tickets cheaper at the cost of significantly less leg room, dirtier airplanes and constant delays. If you choose to fly American, do not make plans when you land. This includes connecting flights. If you must, absolutely give yourself 3 hours or more for layovers to avoid rescheduling flights. If your layover is less than an hour, do not expect to make it."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,DIRTY Airplane during pandemic!,"I never write reviews, let alone negative ones, but this is unacceptable. My fiancé & I traveled from NYC to Wilmington, NC for Thanksgiving and even though they gave out sanitizing wipes at the entrance - they CLEARLY don't clean their planes. During a pandemic this is unacceptable, it was filthy!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,American Airlines is AWFUL,"The experience with American Airlines was the worst travel experience I have ever had. We were delayed for nearly 2 hours before our departure due to an unknown problem, and then upon arrival to our connecting airport we sat on the runway for nearly two additional hours. My party had to make a connecting flight and was not assisted AT ALL even though I had two very elderly travelers. After RUNNING through the airport and having the tower hold the plane we arrived at our gate, plane still sitting there, and told we were too late to board. We then stood in line for two hours to get tickets for the next day and a hotel voucher for a dirty hotel a half an hour away from the airport. The only redeeming factor was the kindness of the flight attendants and the customer support representative. Otherwise, this is the most atrocious airline company in the US."

Date of travel: November 2021,20,Pre-Check Hassle to Maui,"We flew to Maui on 11/13/21. Three months before leaving my wife and I and the other couple we were travelling with all got on the state of Hawaii's travel site and filled out the required forms. We thought we had fulfilled our obligation to the state of Hawaii. On the day of the flight we arrived an hour and half early. A TSA employee told us that we needed to get in a line in a different wing of the airport to get pre-checked for our flight to Maui. The pre-check area was not well marked and after searching we found a hand full of American Airline employees assisting passengers with a line of at least 50 people, they were too busy to answer our questions and were obviously understaffed. We asked others in the line if we were in the right place for the pre-check to Maui and they confirmed that we were. We went to the back of the line and began waiting. The line did not move. As our flight departure grew nearer and our stress level rose I walked to our gate in another wing of the airport and was told that we didn't need pre-check in order to get on the flight, I got back to my group and we left the line to head to our gate just as they were making the final boarding announcement for our flight. We barely made our flight and started the trip off with stress that was completely avoidable if American Airlines had explained the pre-check situation to us in advance on their app or through our travel agent."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Not Ready For Prime Time,"American Airlines has attempted to make everything app-based. They call it Verifly and threaten that check-in is only possible using it. Not so. After spending several hours wrestling with the app, I made sure to bring paper-based evidence of ourCovid Tests Results, Vaccination Status, and Passport Details to the check-in desk.The agent took the paper graciously, checked us in smoothly, handed us everything back with boarding passes and claim checks, and wished us a nice flight. She made no reference to Verifly.On our return journey, the app refused to accept the code for BGI airport, which meant that it was not possible to upload anything to the app.Once again, paper saved the day. I was asked if I'd used Verifly and I answered honestly that it hadn't worked. The agent smiled and proceeded to use the paper. All went smoothly.It's too bad that American, already on my list of Please Don't Make Me Fly This Airline, has once again demonstrated a complete inability to manage its business."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible don't fly with them,"Overall American airlines sucks. Reasons  Seats are too small. There is always fecal matter on the toilet seats and you can’t even sit down. Toilet paper is always drenched in pee and poop. Plus the bathrooms are way too small. Food sucks, it's like eating cardboard. Maintenance staff are ignorant and don't respond to anything. Same with the flight attendants/deck."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Will never fly AA again.,We bought business class tickets.  Our connecting flight was cancelled and no explanation given.  Weather was not an issue. Our travel ended up being 12+hrs.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,DONT DO IT!!!,"Delays delays delays, forfeited car rental and hotel rooms early after being contacted from AA just a couple hours prior to our flight that it was now cancelled. An earlier flight was offered. We left unshowered, no meal and in a rush to make the new flight with a toddler. Only to get to the airport and be told by AA that there were no flights unitl 1 pm. Later changing to 5 pm then told no flights until the next day. Tickets were sold for 600.00 cheaper for the next day and AA never offered a refund or compensation for the disaster starting with their call to  us to get to the airport immediately.Delta Airlines accommodated my families travel needs during this crisis. Delta is who we will use for all future travel. AA horrible customer service, customer relations and total lack of concern for the paying customer."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Weekend from Hell,"I booked business class round trip for my elderly parents to fly to Lebanon. I was told American Airlines has the best service and I went with them.They arrived all fine however the trip back started with one disaster after the other. Their connecting flight from Dallas to Tampa was full and they were bumped from Business to economy. With no word of difference in payment or anything now mind you their trip was $8400!I thought a reputable( little did I know) company would reimburse the change….My parents arrived to Dallas after 10 hours flight, they were waiting at the gate ready to board. All of a sudden flights got canceled. All American Airlines from Dallas were canceled. Again things happen. However what doesn’t happen is the rude unprofessional customer service I received from their employees! The lady at the counter in Dallas her name Tia should be trained on how to talk to people.I was more than polite and I told her I understand she is raising her voice because of frustration all I want to know is where my parents luggage was at the moment so I can plan on booking another trip for them…. She was belligerent, insensitive, and rude. I was not getting an answer from Ma. Tia. So I called customer service.I was on hold for 4 hours. No one knew where their luggage was!!!! Transferred from one department to the other. Now mind you I am telling them my dad is an 86 year old diabetic and he has enough meds to for the flight the rest in the luggage.After hours on the phone and my parents being in a hotel. The airline tells me I have to call again in the afternoon which I was on the phone already waiting for 5 hours the afternoon was 30 min to book another night and they might not get the same hotel!!!!!!I begged the lady not to do that because the wait is ridiculous long and it’s only 30 min away for the afternoon. Of course I got the I am sorry I can’t do anything. Hung up I called right after and waited for another 4 hours until I reached a human to talk to. They gave me list of hotels far from where my parents are staying and I have to pay for an Uber to move them. I tried to tell the lady on the phone that they are old and need help they can’t do all of that on their own… all I got was right… yes…. Sorry… they have to move! So we had to pay for the night at the hotel. And good to eat and drink. Which really was NOT in the plan at all! After two days in Dallas they finally arrive toTampa of course with a delay! When we got their and asked for luggage I was told the luggage arrived the day before!!!!!And no one from the people on the phone was able to tell me that! I could have booked a flight on other airlines.If I could rate American Airlines a below zero I would.   After paying a business class ticket and being treated like that with AMerican Airlines I would NEVER FLY with them again."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Very good flight with American Airlines,I fly a lot and there are times when I am not happy with the airlines.  This particular flight was very good to excellent even though we left a little late they made up the time on the way and we arrived early.  Service was excellent and the food was ok for airline food.  One thing I have to say about American Airlines is their phone customer service is really excellent.
Date of travel: November 2021,40,American Airlines/Iberia,"Review of Trip to Spain11/19-26Let me preface my remarks that we are a septuagenarian couple who have traveled extensively to Europe for over 30 years.  This trip was our high school senior grandson’s which allows us a week of one-on-one time with him. We booked our trip through Costco Travel; our first time to do so.  The trip included flights to Madrid, Spain, a high speed train to Barcelona, and the flight back to the US with hotel and transfer to and from the airport.  In addition via Tripadvisor/Viator we booked some excursions: HoponHopoff bus in Madrid and Avila and Segopvia, the Prada Museum and Royal Palace; and Montserrat and Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. We flew with American Airlines to JFK in New York and there via American Airlines we flew Iberia Airlines to Madrid.  We typically fly Premium Economy on the long flights to allow us to sleep on the way over.  However, due to an error on both our parts, we only received upgraded economy which is only a little more leg room.  Uncomfortable seating, etc.  For those who fly you know the drill.  Our Iberia departure was a 1 hour delay with a half-hour delayed arrival.  Nothing unusual but remember we booked hotel transfers.  After we arrived we waited about 45 minutes for our luggage to find our luggage was lost!  We asked and was guided to the Iberia customer service center and arrived to a relatively short line.   There were about 4 agents handling the customers. I was concerned about our driver so I went to make sure he was there and explained our luggage was lost and I had to fill our the forms, etc.  My wife and grandson stayed with him while I returned to Iberia customer service.  It took me an HOUR to get to the customer service representative and another half hour to fill out the paperwork.  I explained that our cold weather clothes were in our suitcases and we would need to purchase some clothing, etc.  To my dismay he gave me a print out with a telephone number to call...TOMORROW!  That they would not provide any vouchers, etc until tomorrow!!  Perhaps customer service but certainly NOT customer care.  In addition our driver demanded 60 euros cash for his time. Uuggh.  So instead off getting on the HOHO bus we trotted to stores to get coats, hats, toiletries, etc.  It was so late by then the museums, etc were closing and the HOHO bus stopped at 6 pm. We stayed at the NH Collection Suecia in Madrid.  It was very nice, great location,  and the staff very helpful and helped direct us to some stores to buy clothes, etc.  While we speak a little Spanish (Our grandson had taken 3 years of Spanish and was a great help) we certainly are not fluent.  I called the number given me by Iberia customer service to see if there were any updates.  I had received a text message that they had located our luggage and it was being sent to the airport.  Where it went before we never found out.   I called the number and listened to a Spanish recording, but it was so fast I couldn’t understand nor could our grandson.  I was listening for an English option but there was none.  Regardless, we felt our luggage would arrive the next day; little did we know it would not. The next morning we went to catch the HOHO bus near the hotel.  We waited, and waited some more.  No bus.  We finally decided to walk, in the cold to the Prada. It is a great museum; overwhelming in fact.   You can not go wrong going there but plan for a lot of time.  We could have easily spent the whole day there and still not have seen it all. We then went to the HOHO stop right beside the Prada.  We waited and waited some more. No bus. We even asked several personnel near the museum and they all said that is where it stops.  I noticed a HOHO bus stop near by but never made it to our stop.  So we trekked over to that stop and waited and waited some more.  FYI, we learned that they had changed their schedule but never notified us nor did they post any signs at the stops. Even the kiosks which sell the HOHO tickets didn’t know!!  Anyway, while we have always used the HOHO to get around cities, etc. these were worthless.  They even stopped the buses going to some of the major attractions in Madrid such as the Royal Palace!  A total waste of TIME and money.  The time was the greatest loss. We did use the HOHO bus to get near the Royal Palace but that was the only time.  We never even toured the whole route.The Royal Palace is fabulous and again well worth a visit. Don’t miss the armory though; it too is fabulous.  Although you can’t take pictures in most of the Palace they have a great book in the store, Royal Palace of Madrid.  It is well worth purchasing.  It is at the Royal Palace HOHO stop that we found out(after about 30 minutes) they had eliminated several stops including this one.  ???unbelievable. So we used Uber and taxis the rest of our stay. They were quick to respond and relatively inexpensive, certainly not as inexpensive as the HOHO bus or public transportation.  Note: we often use public transportation when we travel but with such a short time we wanted to maximize our time and waiting for buses or metros was considered to time consuming.  In hindsight we would have been better off to use it.After the Palace we returned to our hotel with the expectation our luggage would be there. It wasn’t.  I asked the concierge to call for me and ask where our luggage was and about reimbursement for our clothes, etc.  He was able to determine that our luggage was in Madrid and would probably arrive that evening; but nothing on the reimbursement.  Note that we had received no such information via text from Iberia.  So we went to dinner and had a nice evening.  Getting back to the hotel we found...no luggage.  This proved to be very problematic as we had no time to go buy any additional clothing. The next day we had our excursion to  Ávila and Segovia.  As we traveled by bus we noticed the outside temperature drop from 9 C to 0 C.  When we arrive at Avila it was actually snowing, which normally would be a delight, but with the clothing we had we were freezing, especially my wife.  The tour was great and we highly recommend it.  Our guide was fabulous...am I using that too much? But she was.  We had a great lunch in Avila; I had their famous large bean soup; highly recommended. Afterwards we traveled to Segovia and I decided to give my wife some of my clothing and I stayed behind.  I had some nice cups of tea at a local cafe but I would have rather been on the tour. My wife and grandson did have a wonderful time again.  Again our guide was fabulous.  While I was at the cafe I called the hotel about our luggage and eureka it had arrived!  Since we were leaving the next day for Barcelona it was very important to us.  However, once again nothing about reimbursement from Iberia or any text message that they had delivered our luggage.  Extremely poor customer service and certainly no customer care at all.   The next day we departed the hotel to take the high speed train to Barcelona.  Everything was very easy; easy to get to the station, easy to locate the gate, easy to find our car and seats thanks to the staff.  Ride was very nice with some nice scenery including snow on the ground!  We had lunch on board and just had a very nice trip.  My only complaint is that we wanted to leave early to arrive in Barcelona in time to visit some sites.  As it was we departed at 1 pm and arrived about 4 pm.  By the time we arrived at the hotel the day was pretty lost. We stayed at the NH Collection Podium, again a very nice hotel and location.  The next day we strolled Las Ramblas in the misty rain; but later as we walked the Rambla de Catalunyaand the Gothic Quarter it began to rain hard!  By the time we arrived back at the hotel we were soaked!  Fortunately we had our luggage and was able to change.  We met that evening with a pastor friend and had dinner and attended his church.  It was a great way to spend an evening. The next day we traveled to Montserrat leaving with Explore Catalunya.  Our guide Robert was great or should I say fabulous. They were well organized and allowed us some free time.  If you’ve never been to Montserrat(we actually had) it is really quite incredible.  We took the funicular to the top of the mountain as well as walked to the Cross of Saint Michael.  Afterward we headed to the Sagrada Familia.  It had been several years since we had visited and they have accomplished a lot.  It is due to be completed in 2026.  Again, fabulous.  It is so extraordinary that someone could have such a vision yet alone have it constructed.  Just beautiful and wrought with symbolism.The next day we left to return to the US via American Airlines.  Due to some mixup again we had what they said were premium economy seats but not what I had hoped for.  We managed and the flight was uneventful; customs and passport control were easy(we have GOES). Our luggage had arrived –eureka and was easily rechecked to our home destination.  Our only complaint was the 7 hour layover in Miami.  But even after booking I looked for options and there really were none. All in all, a week with our grandson was priceless and worth any aggravations that occurred.  I am sure he will remember it all his life --- unfortunately the good and the bad. It will be interesting to see how Iberia and perhaps American Airlines responds as I will copy them on the letter as well."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,will not return to aa,"Due to long lines at security I missed my flight and was put on standby for another flight. I couldn't get on that one and was looking for an agent to talk to, I asked an agent at one of the southwest terminals how they do things and if I'd have to wait there all day and she said that if I was with their airlines she would find the best possible standby option for me and that might be the next day which is what I wanted because the airport was very busy that day and I have anxiety. So I went to find an agent for American downstairs and they said they can't do that and told me I'd have to pay 145 $ for that. I couldn't fly home on my daughter's birthday and I am still here in Ontario until tomorrow because I couldn't afford Americans 500$ one way flights. I cried so hard the skin on my face burned and again, I'm still not home. I bought a ticket home from another airline and will not be returning to American, I have spent a lot of money flying with them I literally fly out once a month and they just didn't care to help with me or my situation so lots of money wasted on a flight home I couldn't get on and even more to buy a whole new ticket (a ticket that was still less money than the 145 dollar option I was given) The agents are also very quick to just shoo you away without really listening."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,RED FLAG!!!,"American Airlines is the absolute worse! Do not ride them! They had me arrive at DFW and made me sit on the taxi for like an hour because there was stuff in the middle of the gate and no one would move it. The captain kept telling us a few more mins, however that was not the case. I will never give penny to American Airlines again and if you don’t want to have a great experience flying, I wouldn’t either."
Date of travel: November 2021,30,Disruptions,"Flying Myrtle to Charlotte connection to Key West.  Bordered aircraft and after 20 minutes deplaned, mechanical failure, sensor problem. Every body pushes to desk but they started calling names by the first to be impacted.  After 2 hours it was obvious we would not make any connection that day.Finally our turn, booked us on the next days flight to Key West and suggested to take this flight when it goes out and they said they would get a hotel room in Charlotte. After another hour this flight was then going out 12 hours late.  Went down stairs, had the ramp agents cancel and they were great.  Went onboard and retrieved our luggage.  We drove to CLT and finally got to Key West.Day before our return took another agent on the phone 1+ hour to cancel the unused portion of the return.   Rough trip."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!",Don’t waste your money on premium! No food! No snacks… Nothing…Even to buy!!! Our flight had 2 hours and 50 minutes delay and they kept us hostages in the flight with not even offering a soft drink to passengers! On top of that we had to fly 5 hours hungry! Because of extremely long waits at security check points we had to run to the gate and could not get something to eat before boarding. There was an Starbucks right at the gate and I begged them to allow me to run and buy a sandwich for my pregnant wife in 2 minutes and they told me I will not be allowed back on airplane and the captain expects to fly in 1-2 minutes. It took more than 2 and a half hours for the airplane to take off!…United Premium Economy is far better with actual meals! Served. Shame on you AA for carrying America’s name!!! Should have gone bankrupt long time ago!!!
Date of travel: November 2021,40,"777-300ER MIA to JFK in ""First"" Class","I flew from MIA to JFK recently in an AA 777-300ER in their ""first"" class cabin.  The reason first is in quotation marks is because this particular plane has an actual first class cabin and business cabin but they're both sold/marketed as first.  I originally was in the actual first class but the night before was bumped to the biz seat.  A bit of a let down since I booked this particular flight for this cabin but not the end of the world.  There was one issue checking in (luggage) at the terminal.  The electronic kiosks weren't working so we (everyone else trying to use the kiosks) had to wait in line to speak with an AA rep to check bags.  The rep was really nice and was able to get me back in a window seat but not my original seat.  Boarding was quick and we pushed back from the gate roughly on time.  The seat itself is nice with lots of room and a large monitor.  The only thing I didn't like was the angle of the seat made it hard to see out of the window.  It was nice to be served a meal on a short flight and I was surprised to get actual metal utensils.  The food was pretty good but nothing amazing.  The service was nice and the staff were friendly.  Overall I was very happy with the flight and will def do it again."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Awful experience,"I flew a lot of low cost airlines all over the world but flying with AA has to be THE WORST travel experience I had. Not a single thing went right from the moment we got our boarding passes, the boarding process was chaotic, and they do not seat together two passengers travelling on a same ticket on purpose which is a low I had only seen at Ryanair. The plane was shaking the whole flights (8hours) even though there was clear weather and no turbulence. We arrived late which then caused us to miss our connecting flight (which was booked on a same ticket but they got us off the next flight without even letting us know whilst we were running through the airport to make it in time just to realise at the gate that our boarding pass is not working). As our ticket was issued by British Airways but operated by AA, BA rebooked our flight (obviously the only flight with seats available was 11hours later) but told us that should we seek any compensation we need to speak with AA since the delay was their fault. They were not able to get hold of them on the phone so we had to walk across LHR to stand in the AA line just so that they could tell us that they can only issue a food voucher worth 10£, they would not issue any confirmation on the delay(which is needed by the insurance company) and just told us to make a claim online. We were sent through the airport back and forth for 4 hours in total but there was not a single piece of information or at least an apology from AA on what happened."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,AA - Amateur Airlines.....,"Every time I fly with you, I book my flights, paying a premium to have the quickest, shortest route possible, once paid for I hear nothing from you until about 6 weeks prior to flying.Then the emails start, flights canceled, flights changed, no service available on that route. A duration of 10 hours of flying with one stop becomes flying for 23 hours with 2 or 3 stops. You even ask me to pay again to rebook seats I want to sit in!Over the last 20 years AA have fallen so low. The customer service dept is anything but, they just do not care. I book my flights well in advance, only to have them screw everything up at the last moment, and they turn around and offer you your money back a week before you meant to fly!I will never fly with this bunch of Amateurs again, they need closing down."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Aretha Matthews,All my clothing was stolen and my bags was damage. No one want to do a report. Called and not getting any where. I was put in the back of the plane and I was wheel chair person in seat 33 and kept getting emails that my seat had changed. They check my carry on bags and all my personal belongings were stolen and my family clothes. I have nothing at all to wear. I travel to Kingston and Iwent to that airport to report there because this is the area that I am staying in they are telling me Ishould travel back to that airport to make the report. This is American Airlines so I should be able to report at the closest location because I did not know my belongings were missing when I left Montego Bay. American Airlines need to stopHiring Criminals and fire employees that steal. They are not considering there customers who are away from home. They even took my medicine why is anyone stealing medication. My carry on bags should not have been checked because I was the first person on the flight and my bags would be first. Do not Do not use American Airline and do not travel to Jamaica 🇯🇲
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Owner,"I would not recommend this airline to anyone. They change the flights whenever they want. They change a flight once and then change it again. The most frustrating part, they wait to delay it until you can’t get another flight out. You go talk to the help desk in terminal B, Hell that’s a waste of time and money! They don’t care, they just sit there and look at you! This will be the last time I fly with American Airlines!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Chose a different airline,"Delayed flights, and the app + website are terrible when i comes to checking in. App should really let you print or pull up your flight ticket before the flight. All in all, Im not flying with this airline again. The reviews really say it all"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,The entire experience was riddled with rude and disgruntled employees from the baggage check-in on up. Sucks.,The baggage check-in lady couldn't be more rude or unhelpful. Her helper was a joke.Come on anyone can do better than this.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Disgraceful,"Worst airline ever. Told us we couldn't sit together as a family with our infant because the randomly generated seating assignments were finalized. Not to mention, 3 different customer service representatives were rude, disrespectful, and hung up the phone on us. I'm assuming this is how they train their representatives since they all acted in the most unprofessional manner I've ever witnessed. I wish I could give them a lower rating. I'm absolutely disgusted with American Airlines."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Delay,"Today I lived one of the biggest nightmares for a passenger on a plane, first the one that his flight is delayed and nobody in the 7 hours delay deigns to go to the boarding door to make an announcement, nobody ever appeared to give us water or some food voucher, I have never seen an abuse or an offense in that way for the passengers of a flight like today I felt sad and disappointed because I work in aviation and that should not be done in the end they canceled the flight and The pesadilka continued with the raxi service that transferred us to the hotel as they complained that the nonles airline had paid enough and then the horel charged me for being in that place that I did not choose as it was the big thing!"
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Cargo pet travel,"I just sent my fur babies with AA PetEmbark and besides it being a little expensive my dogs made it to their destination safe, which to me is the most important thing. The drop off and pick up experiences were good and the staff was friendly. Will definitely use AA PetEmbark in the future and will recommend it to family and friends."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Great experience!,"This is the first time I have ever written a review for an airline! I can not say enough good things. Planes were so clean and comfortable! We had a stop and plane chamge in Miami and the second plane was even better! Staff was fantastic! Great selection of in flight entertainment! I haven’t flown American for wuite some time, but this experience was so different than a few years ago! A+ American! Great job!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Late and Rude,Well all kinds of changes were being made on my reservation a month before we departed. All of a sudden their useless app tells me they changed our flight to Miami from 5:30 pmBack to 8AM giving us a 12 hour layover. I hit a change reservation button and got a threat that the cost would be 5600 dollars. So I backed away from that and allOf a sudden our original reservation was restored. Of course on the way to the airport they are sending messages saying our flight wil be delayed by 24 hours. We get there and our flight is canceled so some nice reps rescheduled to JFK via Jet Blue so we get to lug 150 lbs of luggage from B section to C section of the airport. We had a good Jet Blue flight to Miami. Then the f—-ry continued. Plane can’t be boarded . Need a new plane. Of course I have by now lost my window seat and have been switched to a middle seat. Two hours later we get in a 777.  The plane has been designed in an evil way. If you have long legs or strength train or have extra weight on you you will not fit into these basic economy seats. The seat armrests don’t go up. My hips were hugged by the arm rests. My son who is 6’2” had to eat off his lap because the tray is so low and had no legroom. The food was disgusting. The stench of the chicken cooking made me sick. My salad was decomposing iceberg lettuce that was literally brown and rotting. My husband ate the pasta . I could not stomach it. Husband had cold sweats after eating it. During this 10 hour flight I got up to stretch my legs and take a rest from the complete lack of legroom and the sensation of my knees jammed into the back of the seat in front of me. There I was accosted by the rude male attendant who seemed to be just looking for a fight as he slammed things around in his surprisingly spacious kitchen. I was sitting on a protrusion near the bathroom and he came up to me after about five minutes of seeing me there and warned me not to sit there and pointed at the warning picture  where I had been sitting. He did not care about my safety but needed to enter something in the computer near me . Otherwise he would have kicked me off when I first sat down.  So I got up and stood for a while and noticed a little window and pulled up the shade to see the sky. “Oh no no no” I hear from behind me. “ flight attendants are sleeping!!” I have been on long flights on Air India and Thai airlines twice as long as this 10 hour flight. I have sat near or on door and never been told to move. And I have never been spoken to so rudely by an attendant.  They say the right words on the speaker but they really just don’t care about you your comfort or your safety. It’s a part of their culture.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,First Class with NO Benefits,"First Class with NO First Class service. After paying some $1300.00 for a First Class ticket, they offered absolutely NO Meal/Dinner service, though so stated that Meals were available on the flights.  Now I fully understand personally why American Airlines has such a bad reputation and lousy business management with no Leadership."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Blew my mind,"I 5-10 times a year and I always pay FULL PRICE  for first class on American Airlines.  I have claustrophobia so wearing a mask is difficult for me. I did have my mask on but it was not covering my nose. I was asked to pull it up over my nose so I did. After five minutes I had to take a break and pull it down for a second. While I have it down for a second I was asked by a second stewed to pull it up while we are taxing. I told him to give me a minute.  He blew up and said “ I will turn this plane around and go back to the gate” I ignored him and before you know it... we are back at the gate and I was asked to get off the plane. WOW.. I got off without any words spoken and the women that actually listened to me fully understood my situation and was understanding. She got us another flight a few hours later. I missed my business meeting that cost me thousands of dollars and that’s why I’m writing this review The crazy part of the story is every time I fly I get to take my mask off to eat and drink for half the flight but I can’t pull it down for a few minutes to catch my breath. American Airlines needs to inform and train the employees as what to do in certain situations. The pilot was pissed off that this guy made the call to go back to the gate. It’s been two weeks and no one from American Airlines has reached out to me. Forget about me, all I could think about was the other passengers that now ran late to their destination as well. So disappointed and saddened with how American Airlines has handled this."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Racist,"This is my 4th time in American Airlines its one of the worst airlines in terms of customer service.Infact I would say bunch of racist gathered in one place.Having travelled in almost all domestic airlines and some of the best international airlines I definitely know what to expect from an airline interms of customer service.I had couple of instances from my first flight I asked for direction to the airport lounge at the Austin airport at a guy standing in Gate 24 and he was like its on the first floor and I wanted to make sure its not far off as I had to attend a meeting and get back to my gate right after it for the flight,and this man started laughing as if I was a fool who didn’t understand what he was talking about.Second incident was at the front desk the old man just kept throwing passport and my resident card very irrespecutful.And the third incident inside the airline I was sleeping while they had come for the water service and was not thirsty at that point so didnt bother getting anything once We were about to land the flight I walked up to the people behind and asked them for a glass of water and she was commenting after all this you want water and I was like I slept during the flight so couldn’t get water.Seriously these people need serious customer training service very rude and racist airlines."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,My tickets were cancelled by American without notification,"My wife and I were expecting to get on a JetBlue flight purchased with American Airlines trip credits via the American Airlines website. When we arrived at the gate JetBlue informed us they never received the reservation from the American Airlines system. Upon questioning American Airlines it turned out they had ""exchanged""  my credits with another flight I had booked. This was false and later they admitted it was a ""misunderstanding"". I ended up having to repurchase the tickets on JetBlue. Awful experience and no help from the American Airlines ticket counter."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Biggest rip off in the air.,"We went to Las Vegas for a four-night stay and I upgraded our flight with AMERICAN AIRLINES to first class. We were celebrating my husband's 60th Birthday and I wanted this to be just write. It was the worst mistake I have ever made. 1. I needed a wheelchair to help me get to my next flight, nothing showed up. I had to walk from one end of the terminal to the other and it took me over an hour. I almost missed the plane. The food in first class was so nasty that we could not even eat it. Ice cold sandwich and a warm soda. It should have been the other way around. I asked if they had anything else and was told that's it, take it or leave it. No preflight cocktails offered during flight. No inflight entertainment and the airline personal did not really want anything to do with you while you were on board the plane. Once we got to Baltimore, we had been told that as we were first class passengers that our bags would come of first. WHAT A HUGE LIE. We waited 45 minutes for our bags, because all of the economy bags came off first. This airline will lie to you like crazy, just to get you to book with them. If I were you, I would fly Spirit airlines big front seats, because at least you get what you pay for?"
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Employees steal out of luggage,My husband and I took a trip to Mexico. The American Airlines employees decided to take my professional hair tools out of my luggage and keep them. When I brought this to American Airlines attention when we were at the airport nobody recommended that I file a claim at that time. I filed a claim once we returned and the Airlines stated they would not refund me for the stolen luggage. That was around $400 of my money they stole and refused to reimburse.  I'll be flying delta and recommend others to do the same.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Rude,I will never fly them again. Rude from beginning to end unprofessional at times just plain nasty. If your mask is on crooked they come down on you hard. You are treated like a common criminal and not a customer
Date of travel: November 2021,30,First Class not....,"Really this is First Class? Seats wide and semi comfortable but what no entertainment features here, left off or never ordered? The stewardess was mostly not that friendly and you felt as if she has much better things to do with her time than deal with the 7or 8 customers in this area of the plane.Food service well lets just call it pathetic Trip was not direct so in Charlotte where we landed we changed to another flight to Minneapolis. More comfortable, more attentive and wait for it a real mealVery surprised at the service in the US having flown to Italy and back several times on American and it was just great.Lets hope things will get better as things in general improve."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,THIEVES! Their System Double Charged Us and they Refuse to Issue a Refund Only a Credi,"My wife and I had two credits to apply towards two seperate plane tickets and one credit was applied and American Airlines failed to apply the 2nd Credit and charged us for a full ticket. When we connected with their customer service department they would only offer us a credit for the charge that they mistakingly applied!!! They REFUSED TO ISSUE US A REFUND ON OUR CARD. We have already disputed the charge with our Credit Card company and will now have to change all of our credit cards. Also its interesting to see that their ""refund department"" only works 8am-12pm CST. It appears that the department for issuing refunds was the last department staffed after they recieved a Government Bailout.PAY THE EXTRA $100-$300 to fly ANY OTHER AIRLINE AMERICAN AIRLINES IS THE WORST AIRLINE IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY. THEY HAVE THE ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. NOT TO MENTION THE CHARGE THEY WILL NOT REFUND US."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Flight Change BS,"We've planned this nice vacation cruise. Choose to save a little on our flight and go American Airlines. Now we are 60 days from flying American Airline s decides to change are flight. Was flying out in the afternoon, now they want us to fly out in the morning.  No way we could make this flight. We contacted them and all I could get was I'm sorry.  No other flights leaving that day. So now we have to pay for a hotel and fly out the next morning. I guess saving money by going American Airlines was a big mistake. Should have stayed with SouthWest Airlines. Never had a problem with them!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Please do better.,"Flight delayed which caused us to miss our connection. This caused us to be stranded overnight w/our 4 yr old. AA automatically rebooked us. We saw were not seated together which is a problem. We attempted to rectify prior to next am flight and went to customer service. We were told, we'd have better luck trying get seats change if we go up to podium the next day before we fly out. We insisted that they change then so we wouldn't have to deal with it in am. Next am came, the attendants were rude and stated they will see what they can do.  They seated standbys etc & everyone before changing our seats. When we did get on the plane from seat changes the flight attendants told us we needed to move. We had to explain to flight attendants that our 4 yr old cannot sit by himself. This whole experience was outrageous and infuriating. Not to mention food voucher that doesn't cover a family to eat and $10 doesn't cover anything in the airport.  Not to mention missed work, missed pay etc. Not when the delay is caused by staff error from over fueling the plane.  So NO, it wasn't weather or technical issues. It's the rudeness of the staff and their nonchalantness on top of AA always messing up when folks fly into Charlotte. Always! Do better."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Worst travel experience of my life,"I have been on close to a dozen flights since the pandemic started, aa was easily the worst. I will never give this company a single penny of my money again."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,American Airlines -Another horrible experience,"The Gate Agent in full view of all passengers and one would assume the Airline knows she does this.   1.  Told Several people holding jackets that - that is a 3rd item and they must check one item in. (Note flying from warm PHX to very cold Milwaukee -Any common sense here).  Of course everyone put the jacket on like they told her they would- so all this did is upset customers and delay the rest of us and the flight.2.  She told at least half of the customers to “scan their own ticket”. -Again slowing down check-in because not everyone is good at that.3.   She told several people who were wearing expensive fully sealed masks that were much bette than the rice-paper thin one AA has that they needed to take off their masks and wear the paper thin one.Once -Again all of this upset flyers and simply delayed all of us and made for a horrible experience.The cabin Crew In-First Class was kind and helpful and nice.   However, even In first class they only have two choices of cold tasteless meals that make anything you buy at a 7-11 look like a gourmet meal.American Airlines customer service, meals, etc have become so horrible that I have chosen to only use my miles.  I paid $5.60 for this flight and in the future I will simply use my miles and Never pay for a ticket with them again.The customer service phone numbers are not answered and when they do they simply want to argue- no attempt to accept blame and try to change things or correct the actions of their out of control people.Sad to see a once fine Airline hit new lows every year.Summed up Advice Fly any other airline"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,"Darius Zone, to be a major company they really need to get their stuff together, this is a major headache for me!","This sucks, been sitting on the tarmac for hr and a half because they have no one to pull the portable gate to the plane to be able to get off!"
Date of travel: November 2021,20,I try real hard to work with this airline...,"This is not about the flight, it was actually very well done.  The problem I have with AA is you can't talk to anyone about anything but flights.  Anything else good or bad goes through their app or website (whole other mess).  The latest was their silly anniversary ""celebration"" several months back.  I played the silly games because I ""won"" a fair amount of miles.  I have never seen them and trying to ask for them is nearly impossible.  Maybe they should just shut up and fly the darn planes?"
n/a,10,Very bad travel experience.,"Our flight was cancelled in DFW Sat and delayed until Monday. No hotel or so offered because it was “weather” related. Although other airlines were traveling. After standing in the only customer service line for 2 hours (with many in similar situations), we were rebooked to JAX. No luggage on arrival, and hold times for hours for our luggage as well."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,AA terrible experience so far,"I booked a flight to go to Brazil and AA completely changed it forcing me to go through several flight connections or even forcing me to change airports in NY. I’m travelling with 2 babies and it’s completely unacceptable what AA did to my travel. Now, I’m forced to accept a 4 connections flight (instead of 1 connection from my original plan) and I don’t even have the special seat to travel with my babies (as I was supposed to have also with the original plan). I’m beyond disappointed and upset about this flight company and I can’t even reach a representative to look at my case. I see no A class on AA customer services so far. Don’t recommend it at all!!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,AVOID AMERICAN AIRLINES FIRST CLass,"Flown over 1,000,000 Miles with American Airlines and flying First Class today,  Was denied access to the Admirals Club.Only way to access is to have their Credit Card.My most horrific and horrible travel flights over 4 decades have always been with American Airlines.     Only fly them out of pure necessity.    They do not care about your loyalty or buying a first class ticket."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Left almost 24 hours after scheduled flight.,Absolute mess. We were supposed to leave at 12:30pm and plane kept getting delayed. Finally boarded at 6:30pm. Got on sat for an hour and a half to find out we had to go back to gate and unboard plane. Flight got moved to the next day at 7am. We boarded plane just to find out flight is delayed 2 hours because our pilot isn’t here. Never flying this airline again. Don’t recommend.
Date of travel: November 2021,20,What's in the food?,"Flying first class from San Antonio to Pittsburgh, one leg was from Dallas to Pittsburgh. Flight crew was basically nice, but the food was really sub par. It was presented as a ""bagel with cream cheese"" but it was actually some type of sandwich with maybe sundried tomatoes and or peppers on it. I asked what it was, because I have some foods I can't eat, but the flight attendant had no idea. He said,  it's cream cheese"" twice,  but what I was asking about was the red veggie looking thing.  ""uh, it looks like a tomato or something"" he finally said. It was really bad. The crew made up for it with kindness and otherwise good service, but I'm disgusted with the airline for providing something so bad when other airlines have returned to serving hot food.  I'm not saying we need a hot meal,  but how about at least knowing what the thing is or serving something that's not so bizarre that it's hard to recognize. I saw anther reviews that posted a picture of the same sandwich I was served. Apparently it's all they serve now, regardless of time of day.  It's time to move on, American. I don't care how many you bought and need to use up, you're losing credibility and you can't afford that right now. Step up your game."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Unacceptable,"Flight 2441 out of gate B7 of the Charlotte Airport. May be the Flight will be fine, but the American Airlines staff at the gate are rude and inconsiderate. A middle aged man in his AA uniform was standing at the at the desk but texting on his personal phone. He could not be interrupted. I called out to him,  but he ignored me.  After about 10 minutes a lady showed up and said""thank you for waiting"" but she was both unwilling and unable to provide any information. She was rude in her tone. I had paid for a first class ticket,  and I just wanted to get some information about the Flight so I could make decisions about what to do with my layover time, and she acted like I was asking for the world. She said ""I don't know what he told you,  but we don't have any information"". I said that he didn't tell me anything, he just ignored me like I didn't exist . She just looked at him and shrugged.. it's not like they had made an announcement and I was refusing to accept what they said or pressing them for more information, they hadn't announced anything, and the I walked up and stood there, got ignored, and then ultimately got treated like garbage. I have been flying exclusively in American for at least a decade, and I guess it's time to stay looking for another airline. I'm very disappointed."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,1 hour delay,"We had an hour delay because the plane just sat on the runway. The actual flight was okay. However, I wouldn't really recommend flying American any time soon."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst service ever.,Too few contracted employees. Waited in front of our gate for at least 45 minutes... The last 100 feet... Never again. AA is a circus airline.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst Airline Ever,"Customer service agent started coming at customer saying she was going to fight her. It started when a customer asked her to repeat what she said because she couldn't hear her, customer proceeded to come closer to listen and the agent got up and got in her face and the  other agents got up to hold her back. All the customer service agents left and went in the back leaving a long line of customers with no help. My flight had been delayed 4 hours and people were trying to figure out our options. I then saw a supervisor walk out and I said ""we all need help we have flights to catch it shouldn't take this many agents to restrain one agent,"" he responded saying ""my agents are more important than your flights"". I will NEVER be flying this airline again. This job should put customers first and I almost missed my new flight because the customer service agents were too busy trying to fight people. Worst service ever. Every single worker at American Airlines has been rude today and given me an attitude on any question I had."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Mask Mandates? Really,"Aisle 17 behind the emergency aisle. A young woman is coughing and attempting to hide her face so that people would be less likely to notice her mask pulled down below her chin. I asked to be moved from the seat next to her, and was told the flight was full.  She was given a ""first warning"" by the flight attendant for not following the rules. Behind us in Aisle 18 across the aisle a man sits with his face mask pulled down. The flight attendant walked right by him as she picked up passenger's trash prior to landing.  She said not a word to him about covering his face with the mask. Afterall, there was no eating or drinking going on.  Was she afraid of maybe getting punched, or a broken nose? I don't know.  If so, it's probably not the job for her.  Maybe there's a new job description required for a flight attendant and air marshal role rolled into one? All I know is, it's not fair to the rest of us who do follow the rules and would like to NOT catch COVID-19 while flying over the holidays. Some of us expect airlines to follow their own government-backed mandates for flying and getting passengers to where we need to go deadly virus free. Good luck."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Long wait on hold times,So far I have been hold for 2.5 hours; that's almost half a working day; I called 800-433-7300. Still no one has answered the phone for two questions I have.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Never again,"I haven't flown American for years and now I remember why.  No flights had TVs - even the international flights - and the streaming service does not work on the newest iphone iOS. They also had absolutely no food other than pretzels - again, even on international flights - not even food for sale, which I would have happily paid for."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Concerned Father,"My wife and I just had a great week at Disney World, only to have them get split up and scattered from Dallas to LA.  AA even had the audacity to split up a family of five.  The poor dad has to travel separately with his 2, 6 and 9 year old sons while their mother with RA fends for herself.  This is ridiculous and undue pain and suffering.  AA will probably hear from an attorney.  Jerks lied to them and oversold a plane that didn’t actually exist."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,"First flight delayed, missed connection,Terrible costumer service","While flying back from Denver to our home in North Carolina, we had a single 45 minute layover in Dallas. Our first flight was delayed causing us to miss our connection, despite having sprinted through the airport across 2 terminals. Customer services only offer was to send us to a city “near” our home, at which point we’d be hoping to find a rental car, on a holiday weekend, and pay for it ourselves. Besides that our only choice was to take a voucher for an absolutely awful hotel, and wait an entire 24 hours to catch the same flight the next day. My partner and I are now both missing a day of pay, stuck in Dallas. The shuttle that was supposed to transport us to our “accommodations” failed to arrive with enough room for us, and the other poor souls stuck here as well. After two hours of waiting, and even attempting to get a rental car, we folded and got an Uber to the nearest bar to drown our sorrows. The customer service representative made it very clear that they had no intention of offering any sort of discount, or compensation despite the fact that the 24 hour delay was entirely their fault. American Airlines clearly understands that people don’t have many options flying affordably and their attitude towards the customer is “welp if you don’t like it, F*** you, enjoy your crappy hotel and 12 dollar food voucher for the airport to feed yourself for the next 24 hours”"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Avoid doing business with American Airlines,"AA changed the departure time, from St George to Las Vegas ""at no additional cost"" to them. Changing the departure city is not a schedule change.I was on hold for 3 hours 5 minutes to get to someone who could fix part of the problem. When we did get through, the poor customer service person was mechanical and slow, but when my wife said, ""Good luck at American Airlines,"" she laughed out loud."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Wouldn’t fly again,"I’ve never once felt compelled to write a review about an airline, but my recent flights on AA were horrible to say the least. First things first is I was forced to check bags BOTH flights when I was on a business trip where I needed to be quick. I’m not sure what the solution would be for this, but I’m definitely not happy. My flight from Dallas to Chicago today was unlike any flight I’ve ever been on. The flight attendant literally looked like she was on another planet. When they ran out of space for overhead carry on bags she just was staring into space and didn’t give any type of directive to people. People were just standing in the aisles with no idea what to do. I don’t know if it was an inexperienced pilot of what but it may have been the longest landing I have ever experienced in my life. I never get sick on planes but I was praying to the gods and white knuckling it the whole way. Also the internet was down which was a huge inconvenience. I feel there are other airlines that offer way better service and amenities. Wouldn’t fly again."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Deceptive cancelation refund scheme,"Needed to change a flight. Web site said I had to do it over the phone. The phone greeting tells me is  over a four hour wait to receive a call back! That alone is outrageous, but then I decide I'll just cancel the flight and rebook. The website claims I will be refunded, so I cancelled, only to receive an email confirmation that Basic Economy tickets are non-refundable. How come that information was not provided on the ""refund"" page?! Why was there no warning?! I wonder how many other customers have fallen for this scam..."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Customer Service!!!,"I cannot believe what heartless people work here. The care and treatment of your customers is absolutely disgraceful, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves and how you do business. I have a flight credit that expired 2 days ago, and I've asked a supervisor for a small extension of time to figure out a new trip, as I did not know the credit had already expired. And I have been told NO. I'm not asking for my $500 back, just a simple extension of a few days time to figure out a new plan, since my first 2 trips with credit were canceled due to COVID. Something that was definitely beyond my control. How does a few days of time take away from your success? When it can absolutely make or break mine. How does nobody there care? I was told from the beginning not to book with American Airlines, and now I can see why. NEVER EVER again will I make this mistake. I will always pay more to fly with Delta so I can be treated like a real human in this world."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst airline on the planet!!,"Worst airline I ever experienced in my life, the stewardess was the most rude obnoxious lady I ever met in my life, the people at the front gate were so rude, I would literally drive wherever I have to go over taking this airline ever again!!!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Disgusting Food on Long Haul Puerto Rico to Dallas,"Yesterday on Business Class on a four hour plus, American Airlines I had a disgusting meal given to me. Not bad, that's normal. Disgusting. Wilted lettuce and tomatoes on the salad, two cherry tomatoes and a small smear of cheese on a ""caprese"" sandwich. I could not eat it out of fear for my health. Old, miserly disgusting food served to its customers paying premium prices. I will try not to fly American in the future because of this."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Mr.,"Greetings,Let me start off by saying that I regretted ever having Americans Airlines as my number one choice to fly for this trip VLDZFG. I’ve been flying American Airlines since the late 1990’s and early 2000’s back and forth into Haiti with my family with no issues. The time I decided to choose American Airlines to fly to a particular trip into Thailand, they not only let me down. But when I showed up at the check-in desk at the airport the lady checking my bags told that my connecting flight into Japan to Thailand is not going to happen because Japan is closed and not allowing tourist to connect through it. The American Airlines Agent noted my file telling me about the cancelation of my flight saying that Japan is going to open Nov 15,2021. I’ve book this ticket since October 1, 2021, I prepared in advance with my job to get the requested time off and now your going to tell me that a major company that I trusted and believe in since I was a child deceive me into purchasing the ticket to Thailand when they know that the connecting flight was not valid. That is just unacceptable in all accounts, you don’t sell tickets to customers that is going to deceive them, that’s a big red flag and dirty business. Taking the customers trust, and misleading to purchase tickets to later give them flight credit is a scam to the customer. As a major company that represents the United States in the Airline industry you don’t deceive your customers into purchasing something that is for future use, that is not fair and not the American way of doing business, we call that a scam. Also to make matters worse, I spoke to the reservation agent and supervisor at American Airlines about the issue, they told me to submit a request for refund and I would receive my funds back to my card because of the matter, because they had to cancel my flight. I check my email this morning in Thailand, and the email said your ticket is not eligible for refund 0012302169199. I want to American Airlines and I would never thought I would ever come on here to write such review because of the high regards I had, but you’re a scam to deny my refund of funds to my card and offer flight miles when you arrange a connecting flight that was not possible because Japan is closed off to tourist, American Airlines that is a scam. I would never forget this or trust you guys, and yes Delta does have valid routes into Thailand connecting through South Korea, I was able to fly through Delta and be in Thailand as I once planned. I want my funds refunded back to my card and want to fly American Airlines ever again if your going to scam me out of my money by giving me flight miles. I’ve work hard for that money not to have back to my card. I want my money back. I didn’t cancel the flight you guys did. I want my money back, that is not fair dealing with customers like this. Why deceive customers into purchasing your tickets to your business and give them the service. That is dirty business dealing. I want my funds refunded back into my card, I do not want your air miles. That is not the way to go with a customer because of your own mistakes, I want my money back. You don’t gain a customer trust by doing that. I want my funds back to my card please. I don’t want to be scam. And if I don’t get it, I’ll make sure the world knows of how dirty you guys are doing business. That is not fair. I want my funds back into my card."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Unprofessional,"How do you say horrible...""American Airlines."" Flight attendents are so unprofessional.

Date of travel: November 2021,10,Lost baggage and Damaged baggae,A terrible experience. It was my first travel with is airline and would be the last one.I am really disappointed about this airline.After having a delayed flight. They broke one of my bags and lost the other one.They have not found the lost one after 18 days! can you believe it?DO NOT TRAVEL WITH American Airlines.
Date of travel: November 2021,40,Very good experience Nashville-Philadelphia,"American Airlines Flight 409BNA-PHL6:00 am-9:02 amAirbus A320I recently took this flight with my family when returning home from a weekend trip to Nashville, and the experience was surprisingly positive. It was a relatively short and simple flight that departed and arrived on time, and we had great space in exit row seats. Everyone from American Airlines that we encountered along the way was quite nice too, which was a pleasant surprise for this airline.We arrived at Nashville Airport around 4:30 am for the 6:00 am flight, which was more than enough time to return our rental car, walk from there to the terminal, and then get through security and to the gate. We only had carry-ons, and definitely could have arrived at least 30 minutes later and still had plenty of time. Security at Nashville Airport looked crowded that morning, but they have a very large and pretty well-designed security checkpoint, which made the process easy for those with and without PreCheck in our group. Those of us who have PreCheck were through in less than 5 minutes, and the regular security line took no more than 10 minutes.I was surprised by how many flights were leaving from BNA in the 5:30 am-7:00 am timeframe, so the terminal was pretty bustling even so early in the morning. American’s gates are all on the C Concourse, which is under a bit of construction right now, but is otherwise a very standard airport terminal. Our gate (C15) was a really small gate with limited seating, but the gate across from it wasn’t in use and had tons of seating, so we had plenty of space to wait over there. As our scheduled boarding time approached, the gate agent began making the standard announcements about how the boarding process would proceed and offering to gate check carry-ons, since the flight would be completely full. Boarding began a few minutes early, was generally well-executed and civilized, and the employees at the gate were friendly. We boarded toward the beginning of Group 5, and had absolutely no problem finding overhead bin space. We had also paid for upgraded seats in the exit row and were glad we had. We had a really significant amount of extra legroom that was well worth the upgrade. The Airbus A320 didn’t have any amenities to offer, with no seatback TVs or outlets, but it was totally fine, and the aircraft was clean. Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and arrival time. Boarding proceeded with no issues, and the crew just generally seemed nice, professional, and helpful in preparing the cabin for departure. We left the gate a couple minutes early, but just pushed back and sat there for a while before moving toward the runway. Once we started moving, a bunch of planes were in line to takeoff, but we went to a different runway and took off without any wait at all, which was nice after just sitting for a while near the gate. The pilot also made a few announcements before we departed with helpful information about the flight, and he seemed pleasant and nice, in the same vein as the flight attendants. Shortly after we reached our cruising altitude, flight attendants came around with the drink cart, offering full cans of soda, or juice, water or coffee, in addition to Biscoff cookies.The flight was otherwise totally uneventful, and we landed in Philadelphia right on time and quickly taxied to our gate in Terminal C.  Even though the flight crew didn’t make any announcements asking passengers to do this, I really liked that basically no one jumped up in the aisle the second the seatbelt sign was turned off. Miraculously, virtually everyone just sat in their seats until it was their row’s turn to get up, which was a nice surprise.Overall, this flight from Nashville to Philadelphia was good. We had a nice amount of space in the exit row, and we thought the service was surprisingly friendly and professional from start to finish. It was an uneventful and on-time flight, so we had no complaints."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Always delayed flights. Zero Staff support or contingency plan from the airlines,"Hi travel frequently in the states and whenever I have to use American Airlines, I suck my luck. AA is always delayed with the worst customer service. Try to avoid AA as much as possible"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Change flights without notice. No live person,"American Airlines changed our non-stop flights to flights with layovers.  I booked seats for my daughter and me together.  They moved us to the back of the planes 4 rows away from each other.  My daughter was put in the back row.  We paid for non-stop and ended up with layovers, extending our travel time 3 hours and reducing our time at the resort.  I tried to call AA and they said I'd have to wait 4 hours!!!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Little help during booking or during the long flights to and from Paris.,"The flight was booked well in advance. Soon after booking, I received an email that my flight had changed to an early departure from Austin, Texas. I live in San Antonio which is 75 miles away on a very busy highway. We had to go to Austin the night before the flight since it left at about 6:30 am and we did not want to miss the flight. There was no explanation as to why our flight was changed; no communication. American has gone to the bottom of the airlines in my opinion. I am a lifetime Platinum and I go to great lengths to fly any other airline if it is possible. I give up my Platinum perks so that I don't have to fly American"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Absolute incompetence,"I was home on leave for the month of October; flight back to the US was fine no issues, however upon arriving at MSP airport for my return flight it was an absolute nightmare. The line was over 1.5 hours long just to get to the baggage counter for American Airlines specifically, every other counter was empty.After finally getting to the front I handed over my orders, ID, and negative COVID test but American Airlines counter said the test couldn’t be accepted because it didn’t specify the testing method even though it was the PCR test. So I was turned away, had to spend $200 at the airport for that test which was identical to the original test. After being turned away from American Airlines and having 6 hours until my next available flight I checked with Delta and United and both airlines said my original test met the requirements. So not only did American Airlines total incompetence cost me the additional money for the test it delayed my reporting back to my unit by 24 hours and additional costs because I now had to spend the night in Dallas instead of flying out the same day.After all the problems caused by American Airlines staff they only saw fit to provide a $50 credit that can be used traveling in the US for the next year. I am stationed overseas so the nontransferable credit is absolutely worthless to me. I am completely upset with this company and the lack of customer support. Truly an awful experience."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,TERRIBLE Service,Ladies working at the gate were SO rude. My husband and I were the first ones in group 8 to get on the plane and the girls at the gate informed us we HAD to check our bags and pick them up at baggage claim. I informed them I did not want to do this as I had things in my bag I could need on the flight. They rudely placed a sticker on our bags and waved us on. The next passenger after us was much older than us also in group 8 & allowed to keep her bag! There were about 4 EMPTY spaces when everyone was finished loading the plane and 2 people after us were allowed bringing bags on! I now have to sit through this flight and pray I don’t need to pump (nursing mother) as all my supplies is under the plane…. TERRIBLE SERVICE.
Date of travel: November 2021,40,Great flight and value for the money,"Took flight from Columbus, OH to O'Hare for connection to Wichita.

Arrived in Wichita early, had to wait for gate to be available !"
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Gabby is Amazing!!,"My husband and I just received news that I am pregnant and was told I could travel and that I needed to cancel my flight. My husband called AA for assistance with the cancellation and A rep told him she was unable to cancel one flight and that he needed to cancel himself online. Upon doing so, the flight was cancelled for the both of us. I called AA Customer service and was transferred to supervisor Gabby for assistance since the original rep may not have had authority to reinstate the flight at the original price. Gabby took the time to reinstate my husband's flight at the original price and now my hubby is back on track to his dream destination. Although It's bitter sweet since I can't go, I know how much this trip means to my husband. Thank you sooo much for your great attitude, patience on getting things fix and knowledge of what AA is capable of doing. You are truly a blessing Gabby. -Stephanie Smith"
Date of travel: October 2021,30,Baggage Claim process unfriendly,"My  suitcase was badly damaged on the trip. I didn't get my bag (after connection in MIA) until arrival in MDE. The CS lady @ MDE was nice enough, but didn't fill out my claim form correctly. Now I can't submit my claim online. AA doesn't have a phone line for damaged bags!  I'll have to make a trip to the St L airport in order to get reimbursement for the suitcase. It's nice to say that I can file the claim online, but their system failed me."

You poor suckers who earned Global Upgrade Certificates in 2021..."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Never Fly American Airlines,"This was my first time flying American Airlines this weekend and I had horrible experiences both trips around. On my way there, due to a power outage at my local airport, a 7:15 AM flight became a 12:30 PM flight, which meant I missed my connection and landed at my second location 8 hours later than I was initially supposed to, and with much of the reason for my trip scheduled on Friday, I would miss most of it. Wifi was completely inactive on the trip there. Then on the way back, I woke up at 3 AM got on a 5 AM flight from Las Vegas to Charlotte, NC and 30 minutes prior to my connection from Charlotte to Raleigh, NC, my flight changed gates, and then was cancelled. My flight was rescheduled from 2:00 PM to 10:45 PM. Keep in mind, this is to go to a city 2 hours away. I decide to tough it out though, as I did not have a car to drive myself and had little knowledge of local public transport, and wait only for my 10:45 PM flight to get delayed again to 11:30, which means I will have spent my entire day in an airport, from 3:30 AM to 1:00 AM in an airport because of American Airlines as a student with early morning classes the day after. Also worth noting is that I am still at the airport while writing this, so my flight may well get delayed or cancelled once more. Overall, pick literally any other airlines."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Ruined my vacation and 😡,"Separated our family twice, horrible service ! Flight delayed, had to run to connecting flight, I’m 67, my sister and got there and had given her seat away to standby person! Thought I was going to have a heart attack. Then my sister couldn’t get on, they made us leave her! NIGHTMARE!!!  Had to to wait for an hour and half for her!  Offered her a meal ticket, right! 3000+ ticket costs! 😡🤬"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst Airline I've Ever had the Displeasure of Dealing With,"Horrible horrible experience with American Airlines! I will NEVER book through them again. My husband and I had a 10 year anniversary trip planned to Jamaica. We were supposed to fly out with American Airlines at 10pm, October 31, 2021. We got an email at 6pm on October 31, 2021, an hour before we were to leave for the airport, that our flight was CANCELLED. AA cancelled our flight with a 4 hour notice due to a ""lack of staff"" I was told. Keep in mind we'd had this trip planned for months. We had arrangements made for who would watch our kids and when. We had all our Jamaica travel documents and negative covid tests ready to go. We had already dropped our dog off with the person watching her...There were no other flights that night, so in total panic mode, I began rearranging our entire trip! Luckily, I was able to book last minute flights through Delta and Jet Blue for the following day, November 1, 2021. I had to push our entire trip back a day with our resort and reschedule our excursions we had planned since our original dates now didn't work. The main excursion we wanted wasn't available to book for another day so we lost out on that. I'm thankful we were able to still get flights through other airlines to still go, but now our negative covid tests were out of the 72 hour time frame. Frantically trying to find a rapid testing site, that was open on Monday, we found only one in our area that cost $130 per test. After all was said and done, American Airlines left us hanging with an unbelievable amount of stress and an unexpected expense of over $300 after the new covid tests and extra, unnecessary, night of dog boarding. On Monday, November 1, 2021 I called AA customer service number on their website, which is apparently only the reservations department. I told them what happened and requested a full refund and compensation for the unexpected expense. The man I spoke with was very nice, but said he couldn't help with compensation and could only refund the plane tickets. Fine. He instructed to me to email customer relations about my complaint and to include that I could show proof of purchase for the new covid tests and extra night of dog boarding and that they should at least compensate me for those. I did just that, and they came back saying travel documents and covid tests were not their responsibility, but here's a $100 AA credit to make it all better. First of all, I will NEVER book a flight through American Airlines ever again. Second of all, I had all our paperwork and testing ready to go for the flight we had entrusted AA with in the first place. It was 100% their fault we were now in this situation and they refused to own up to it. I responded to the email my concerns and that a $100 credit wasn't good enough and they pretty much told me to pound sand, that they weren't going to do anything for me. I tried calling American Airlines again today, November 15, 2021, to express my continued frustration with the company and again no one would help. I've still only received half of my refund from our cancelled flights, so apparently AA just likes sitting on their customers money while screwing them over. I figure reviews are the best I can do at this point to hopefully help spare someone else from dealing with this nightmare of a company. American Airlines has ruined their reputation with me for life and I will be sure everyone I know knows how horrible this business is and how little they care about their customers. Do not fly American Airlines! You'll be glad you didn't!"
Date of travel: October 2021,40,Vacation,Took 50 minutes to check in due to all the forms required right now. Each country has their own rules so read up before hand and come prepared. Very friendly check in staff but since there are so many different rules not completely up to knowing exact requirements. Easy boarding and our first leg to Philly was pretty crowded but staff was very attentive and there was plenty of room. On the international leg it was our first time in Premium Economy and was well worth the money. Plane was not full in any of the areas though. We were early getting to LHR but extra time was spent in working out gate problem. Staff kept everyone up to date on what was going on. Great food and extra comfort package.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Stay away save yourself please this is not a joke!,"On the way to my home town of Brazil American cancelled a flight and never told us, thank god I had the app I was made aware. We jumped into an united flight thank god we made it to our next flight on time no thanks to American. I had to go online and book it myself loosing money.Than on our way back to keep this short, they delayed our flight 2hrs bringing the flight from 12am to 2am, ok slight inconvenience, I get to the airport 6hrs before my flight, I try to do the same thing please book me on another flight I have only a carry on!!!! No sir we have no space I said you have had the space before or put me on a different carrier. Again dissapointed, I am told to wait at 205am still no airplane, they drag this airplane out of a hangar, to only to tell all 380 passengers that the flight is now cancelled and moved to another day, at 1030pm!!!!!!!! How is this ok??? I had to find hotel, food and taxi. Absolutely inconvenience and incompetence, I'm appalled by this company stay away, do not attempt to fly with them spirit airline is better, imagine that."
n/a,10,Upgraded to a premium seat on check in. Not given premium seat on boarding pass. Seated in another seat.,Awful service.  Upgraded my husband's seat to premium and paid for it. He was not given the correct seat on his boarding pass. Terrible app for check in and updating boarding pass.  Customer service sucks!!!!!!!
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Discrimination and Racism Still Exists,"I do NOT recommend American Airlines. For our 9 year anniversary we took a trip to Barbados and purchased Business Class tickets in March 2021. We typically fly American Airlines and we ALWAYS sit in seats 1A and 1B. This particular flight we were the only Black couple in First Class and were forced out of our seats because a privileged white guy was allowed to buy our seat 3 weeks ago 😳. The agents at the gate to include the supervisor called 4 police officers to escort us off a plane and from seats we PAID for and had the receipt to show. This was not only embarrassing, discriminating, and so much more and we are still dealing with the emotional stress caused from this incident. We will never fly American again…"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Very disrespectful attitude....counter,Hispanic lady (older) at A15 was just absolutely  nasty attitude.  Very dispectful.  Not iistening and just want to tell people.    With this type of customer service...no wonder their reviews continue to tumble.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst airline ever,Worst airline ever. Due to staff shortage they cancelled my flight just 5 mins prior to boarding. I had flew international for 20+ hours to find out AA to my final destination was cancelled. I was not allowed to check out my baggages at Chicago despite begging them to give me my bags . I was assured I would receive my bags Denver and a ticket was provided by AA.   However my bags were sent to Colorado Springs without my consent!!! AA is not even taking the responsibility. 3 rd class airline
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Horrible service! Very unprofessional.,"I will never fly American Airlines again! This was the absolute worst experience ever! We flew out of McCarran Airport in Las Vegas had a connecting flight in LAX and then down to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. 1st leg was fine, normal flight nothing special but nothing bad either. When we were getting ready to board out of LAX it turned out they overbooked the flight and by a lot! There was mass confusion. The staff at the gate desk weren’t explaining what was going on. If you tried to ask them a question, they were just rude and didn’t listen to you. It was a terrible and nerve racking experience! Once we were finally able to board and 30 mins late, a man was walking aimlessly up and down the aisle looking for a seat. They let too many people on the plane! So this took at least another 30 mins to figure out. Then the staff on the plane was very rude and inconsiderate! My daughter had to go to the restroom and got caught behind the drink cart. This was one seat above ours and they hadn’t even started serving drinks yet. They wouldn’t push the cart up one row of seats to let her sit down. She politely said my seat is right there can I please sneak by. The flight attendant ignored her pushed back into her and just continued getting ready to serve drinks. So my daughter squished by her to sit down. The flight attendant said in a very nasty voice “Geez, you can’t wait a couple of minutes?” Then she turned to my husband who was sitting in a different row and she clearly didn’t know he was with us and said people are so pushy and rude! He went along with it and she just kept saying inappropriate things! It was so unprofessional! When she finally realized we were all together her whole demeanor changed and she was nice as pie! Ridiculous! I’m not one to write a bad review on something or someone but this was just horrible and I wanted American Airlines to know how the people representing them are acting!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worse Airline Ever,"I arrived 2 hours early for my return flight home from Honolulu, Hawaii to Newark, NJ. I had 2 connections- 1 in Dallas and the second one in Charlotte, NC. My ticket clearly stated it was departing from gate A34. I all but ran close to a mile to reach that gate only to find it was empty. I found someone who informed me it had been changed to Gate D29. I had to take the skylink to get there. When I reached it, the flight was closed and I was told there were no seats. They put me on standby directly to Newark on an 11:30 flight and I was told that flight was overbooked by four people. The next flight was at 3:00 - getting me back to Newark at 7:30 PM when I was initially supposed to be there by 1:10 PM. Absolutely hands down the worse airline I’ve ever dealt with. I will NEVER fly with them again and wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone. They don’t deserve customers."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Crabby flight attendant,"The absolute worst flight attendant I've ever encountered!  Before I had barely entered the plane she started lecturing me about how to carry my backpack.  Then she invaded my personal space and lectured some more.  While making announcements she tried to be funny, but it just came across as rude and abrasive.  She even went so far as to threaten that if we didn't obey her, she could make it so we'd never fly with American again.  Also, they need to switch to text message boarding passes instead of email.  At the airport, their system was failing, and at the last minute I had to get a paper boarding pass--as I was entering the jetway!  Overall, everything sucked.  I will NOT fly American again unless I'm desperate to go someplace only they fly."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,American is the worst airline!,"I will never fly with American ever again.  I paid for an upgrade that I didn’t get and did not receive my mile or money back.  I also paid for premium economy in case my first class upgrade didn’t come through then they changed the flight schedule and put me back in main so I had to pay again to upgrade to premium economy.  I also had to pay $40 for my second bag since the first class upgrade didn’t come through that I had paid $75 and 15,000 miles for.  I respectfully tried to explain to the ticket agent what was going on to see If I was going to get my upgrade then.  She was so rude to me .  Even after I showed her my receipts she said I hadn’t paid.  She then refused to check my bags in and made me take my bags to another agent.  She was not wearing a name rad and she covered her badge with her hand.  She refused to tell me her name and so did her supervisor.  She was so disrespectful to me,  and I guess that is allowed on American Airlines.  Never again.  My money is gone and I experienced blatant disrespect."

Date of travel: November 2021,10,Travel nightmare,"From delays (8 hours in Miami), to lack of communication and lost luggage, AA seem to be a sinking enterprise.    To top it off, the angry ebony woman at the AA luggage service in New Orleans, filed a claim but entered someone else’s name and wrong luggage number.    I had to get on a cab and return to the airport to get my bag because they were unable to match the claim with the bag number.  Maybe the woman was having a bad day, but she was the quintessential DMV-like employee.   Aaaaaaangry."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Ridiculous Delay and Poor Service,"I have never missed a flight in my life. Have had a nightmare day with American Airlines. I was on a flight through American Airlines going from RDU to FLL that had a short layover in Charlotte. Our initial flight ways delayed about 30 minutes due to ""power outages in the Raleigh area."" Mind you it was a sunny 72 degree day. Then we were delayed at the gate in Charlotte because of a ""sluggish jet bridge."" Our connecting flight was scheduled to depart at 4:50 pm and we were not able to deplane until 4:38 pm. Our connecting flight was in a completely different concourse. We ran the entire way. When we arrived at the gate, the gate was closed but the plane had not left yet. We were informed matter-of-factly by the customer service rep at the gate ""You missed your flight."" Apparently, this was our fault. Not American Airlines fault. He informed us that as policy they can only hold the flight for 2 extra minutes (gee thanks!).  We were rebooked on a flight that would not be leaving until 8:45 pm since all the other flights were full. So instead of arriving in Fort Lauderdale at 6:50 pm we will not be arriving until almost 11 pm. Our day with American Airlines started at 1:15 pm when we arrived for our flight at RDU. So basically I could have driven from RDU to FLL and made it in almost the same amount of time (it's an 11 hour drive). To add insult to injury, none of the staff even acted genuinely sorry. Needless to say, I will NEVER be flying on American Airlines again."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Overcrowded. No Room. SLOW,"I haven't flown American Airlines in over a decade and now I remember why. They charge you for everything. Internet was $19 (crazy). If you didn't buy it the ""free"" version doesn't work. Smallest seats and space that I have ever experienced on ANY airline. Complete misery on a long flight (round trip - so 2 terrible experiences). Never again. Southwest or Delta."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,"Never, ever again.","After being delayed more than 5 hours I finally arrived in Portland. Went to get my bags from the luggage carousel as I have for the last 20 years. Except this time the carousel wasn’t running and there was a large group of bags just cordoned off with zero indicator of what they were. The young, angry girl that was supposed to be watching them presumably was too busy on her phone to let any of us know they are our bags while the entire flight just stood there waiting. Finally I noticed my bag amongst them and asked this girl how I could get my bag. She said I would need a boarding pass. To get my luggage. I told her I had thrown it away, and she told me she couldn’t do anything to help me since I didn’t have my boarding pass. The lady behind me said she had also thrown her pass away, but for some reason she was allowed to get her luggage with just her ID.So, my lawyer is working up a letter to demand an answer as to why I was discriminated against by American Airlines. I suspect it’s because I’m a white male. I’ll post whatever answer we receive here on this site. Whatever you do, don’t fly American Airlines. They are an embarrassment to the entire industry in my opinion. Never again."
Date of travel: August 2021,30,"Ok service, but could be improved","After flying so many times with Southwest it started getting old for me, so I decided to branch out and fly on American for a change. Service was ok, not too much given current environment. Legroom in coach was okay, but coming home, decided to treat myself to Main Cabin Extra. I would fly again, but AA - I beg of you, please DO NOT cram your planes with so many coach seats, and put the PTVs back in!Oh, and let me also say they're a saving grace because I had to fly standby because my flight from CLT-BWI got cancelled, so they got me on."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,THE ONE AIRLINE YOU SHOULD NEVER FLY.,Worst experience ever. We arrived before cut off time to check in our luggage we were already checked in. Just our luggage wasn’t . The women had soooo much attitude for no reason and refused. She claimed she made last call when her coworkers knew she didn’t and so did we. I had proof showing that my Uber had well arrived before cutoff time & that I was standing there the whole time. I don’t even have words to how nasty she was acting . Disgusting I travel a lot but never again with them. They have the craziest stories from that airline I should’ve known.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst travel experience of my life!,"Flying with American Airlines was by far the worst traveling experience I have ever had. After my family and I boarded the plane at 940 pm we were strung along hearing new that we would be taking off in 20 min, then 30 more min, then they weren’t sure when we would be leaving. Then we could get off the plane if we wanted to. Then we had to get off the plane to move to a different gate and board a new plane. Then we waited in line for over an hour to board the new plane only to find out that the flight had been cancelled due to “previous weather” and “crew legality issues”. They conveniently strung us along until 0200am when their customer service desk closed. There were over 200 people in line waiting to speak with customer service when their representatives just left. Just left everyone stranded because their shift was over. No taxi vouchers, no hotel vouchers, no food vouchers. Nothing. My flight was supposed to leave at 940pm and I was stuck in the hotel with no where to go until 11am the next morning. I will 10/10 recommend that no one ever use this airline."

Date of travel: November 2021,10,Sick and tired,"I fly every year. Never have I had worse experience than flying American airlines. Cancelation, problem with the cabin pressure, not following the schedule time not just for a few minutes that I could understand. You name it... sick and tired."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Very bad treatment,"Horrible passenger treatment both at the airport and during the flightI was not allowed to board with a small backpack a small caary-on bag and a pair of pillows wrapped the two together in a very compact transparent bag by Bloomingdales. A business class passenger is allowed the same lugagge as one in economy, there is a lot of space in the overhead compartment. The impertinence and rudness with which I was treated cannot be accepted under any circumstance.. I consider American Airlines an airline of abuse!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,AA cancelled flight; refund was a joke!,"AA cancelled one leg of our flight (supposedly because of weather??) so we drove 4 hours to catch the next flight on our itinerary.  AA refunded us only half of the cost of the flight they cancelled.  We also had to pay for gas, pay for our car to be stored, and a significant amount of lost time.  AA does not value their customers."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Great flight attendant,"My gate for my flight changed 4 times. After finally boarding the aircraft the flight attendant was amazing. She assisted my wife's and I. She was a great in servicing all of the passenger. Yanique has done a wonderful job today. Before today I was not a fan, I guess it's true the staff makes the crew. I will flying American Airlines again."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,The worst AIRLINES in the world,"The employees are extremely dumb and incompetent does not know anything about customer service, told us we need to provide health declaration forms in order for us to board the plane COMPLETELY wrong information made my parents travel hell plus they were enforcing WRONG information, a bunch of dumb asses working for American Airlines shameless people"
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Horrible customer service,"We flew from MSO to DFW, then from DFW to STL. Our first flight was delayed just enough that we barely made it to our connecting flight (was supposed to land about 5:40, landed at 6:06, made it to the gate at 6:28 for a 6:30 connecting flight). After running through the airport - as an asthmatic - I was gasping for breath and pulled my mask down for a split second so I could breathe. Upon my arrival at the gate, I was immediately snapped at to put my mask on. I complied. The boarding was finished but the lady at the counter scanned my boarding pass and was going to let me board. Told the gentleman at the door (who was rushing me in and also the same person that snapped at me to put my mask on) that my boyfriend was flying with me and was a few paces behind me. He slammed the door in my face and told me neither of us could board because they couldn't wait for anyone else. There wasn't time. He started to direct us to a later flight, and I begged him to please let us board...we has just made it in time and it wasn't our fault that the previous flight was late. I collapsed to the floor in tears and still unable to breathe as my boyfriend ran up to the gate behind me. The lady who scanned our passes let us board, and the gentleman hurried us in, along with one other man who had run up to the gate around the same time. We sat down just as the plane left the gate, just in time for one of the flight attendants to be extremely snarky with a man sitting behind us. She was rude to several other people throughout the flight. The plane left at 6:45 and arrived ahead of schedule. Oh, and our bags ended up on the later flight because of the delays, so we still don't have our luggage. I'll choose another airline next time for a more pleasant experience."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Left high and dry,They should be shut down.  Left me stranded in North Carolina and no alternative to get home.  Thank God I had the good sense to rent a car to get home or I would probably be sitting there waiting for them to reschedule the flight now what  a joke this airline is..
Date of travel: July 2021,20,"Classless ""First Class""","I used to always enjoy flying first class but American Airlines took first class to a very ""classless level"". On a 5 hour trip to Vegas they served woke sandwiches covered with in saranwrap, packages of snacks and let a train of coach customers use the bathroom.We fly coach now, bring our own snacks and use the concourse bathroom before take off."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Do not Fly with them,Flight was delayed then when I got to New York my connecting flight home was canceled. There were no flights till the next day and American said they would not cover lodging. I rented a car and drove home. I was late for work and out the rental car cost. After waiting on hold for an agent they said that they couldn’t issue a credit or compensation for my rental car over the phone. This is one of multiple times I have had problems with American Airlines flights. I will avoid this airline every chance I can. Horrible experience.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Will never fly American again,"We were flying home from Puerto Vallarta.  Landed in Dallas with a 2 hour layover.  30-40 bays in Customs with only 2 open, took forever to get through.. took the train from international to domestic to our gate  5 minutes before take off... 'sorry, door is closed you are too late' Customer service rep tells us (along with other passengers that got held up in customs ) that we have to go to another gate to get tickets for a later flight.  I asked why she couldn't do it and she tells me she is leaving on the flight we are supposed to go on.... so they can open the door for her but they couldn't for us which I'm sorry, made no sense to me!!   After going to the other gate to get new tickets for the next flight we are assigned seats in row 30, I tell her we had paid for premium economy seats, she said we would have to take care of that at the gate we leave from.  Original flight was scheduled to leave at 7 pm, next flight wasn't until 10:30pm.  Already exhausted and just wanting to be home we accept this is what we have to do and take it in stride.  Checking in at the gate of our flight I explain that we paid for premium economy in which she loudly exclaims it was only 28 dollars per seat, I'm like whatever we paid it wasn't for the back of the plane.  I asked if the plane was full, she says no, I ask is there was  empty rows anywhere and we'd be happy to take that, she says no.  She then hands me tickets for row 10.  Once on the plane we discover that row 10 has 2 seats facing forward and the window seat(no window though)  is facing back for the crew.  I am claustrophobic but normally can  do ok in a middle seat but these seats seemed extra small.  We then noticed after take off that the row in front of was completely empty but before we could ask to move, a passenger in front of that row came back and enjoyed the row to himself.  I began to have a panic attack and my husband rang the bell to ask for water in which they brought a very small glass and we had to ring again for another, asked for a bottle of water and they said no.  They did offer me an ice pack for my neck and it did help once I was able to stop hyperventilating.  I really feel the customer service reps were rude and where they sat us was a big f-you.  I do realize I was a little hot under the collar but I did apologize and said I knew it wasn't their fault that customs took so long.  I understand how short-handed companies are and I can't imagine having to deal with unhappy people all day so my complaint isn't really directed at the crew but AA.  We fly a lot, mostly on Alaska, and have never had such an awful experience.   No more American Airlines for me!!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Wow! Maybe a little help??,Terrible guest service. Waited at the check in desk from 45 min before boarding to 7 min before boarding. Trying to figure out our seats. To be met with a rude employee who acted like it was my fault she wasn't where she was meant to be. Gave zero help to me and my wife who were trying to sit next to each other due to my severe anxiety while flying. Will never use or recommend American airlines or use American airlines again!!!!
Date of travel: November 2021,10,CAN NOT TRUST AMERICAN !!!,Watch out for American Airlines !!!!I had a trip booked for 6months with American Airlines to fly from Orlando to Vegas with a layover in Miami.     At 2 am in the morning -  the day I am suppose to board the plane at 6:30 am - American Airlines decided to cancel all flights to Miami.   American wanted to move my flight to the next day and stick me in coach -  WHAT !!!!   That is NOT what I paid for.  I can not believe they can cancel flights like that and do not care. Which left me looking for another flight in a hurry and I got stuck on Spirit Airlines ( which is the worst airlines in the sky) I will never fly on American again. The company is  UNTRUSTWORTHY  AND UNRELIABLE !!!!   Here is a good tip -   If you do not want to make it to your destination on time - then book American. They will make sure you do not get there.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Find another airlines,"baggage delayed - no one picked up the phone. No one knows where the bags are. SKB staff was very rude when I visited them at the airport. They told me to call back and I showed them how the desk phone kept ringing for half hour and no one picked up. I wouldn’t bother flying AA. Customer support didn’t help, chat support didn’t help, SKB just doesn’t pick up the phone and their tone is quite demeaning. Customer baggage office doesn’t pick up the phone. I ended up not getting my bag & the trip was quite ruined. The Marriott resort was the only saving grace. I would highly recommend against flying American Airlines if you can. Many people at our resort shared the same sentiment and were livid at how AA treats customers. I think because they have monopoly for being the only airlines from USA to st Kitts, the service is quite dismal. Our family members are canceling AAAdvantage card."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Don't fly American Airlines,Worst flying experience of my life. My flight was delayed and instead of being forthright with customers they gave a really dumb excuse. Their staff is overworked and it reflects on the service they provide. They also lost my baggage and that was an additional headache.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,M,On our connecting flights there was trash in the cubby on the back of the chair. In Dallas we missed our connection and the employees were rude. The next day I video tapped American Airlines being mean to a disabled person. All around bad experience!
Date of travel: November 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN,"Wow, I’ve never written a review for an airline, and that’s with flying very frequently. Sad to have to write this one. I will start in order of how the day went:-flight was delayed due to a maintenance issue-WOULD NOT HAVE CARED if they didn’t wait until the scheduled departure time to start informing everyone we would be delayed-the flight was delayed roughly an hour, and all passengers were directed to start calling an 800 number to schedule potential reroutes -I ended up calling even though I was hoping maintenance issue would be resolved, and the next flight was over 6 hours later. The customer service rep was rude, unhelpful, and ended up scheduling me for the WRONG FLIGHT. -I then had to wait in line to speak to an attendant after I had already gone through the hassle of the 1800 number. What a nightmare. No vouchers offered, horrible customer service, and complete lack of communication in regards to the estimated times for rescheduled flights, maintenance issues, etc etc. Cannot emphasize enough how strongly I hate American Airlines after this experience. I’m someone who normally flies based on what is cheapest, I don’t fly based off of airline brands. I would have paid 200 more to pick any other flight compared to this. Will be strongly recommending to anyone in my life who flies that American Airlines is by far the worst airline I have ever flown in, with no regards to passengers time, families, or requests. Thanks for finally giving me a reason to know the differences between airlines, American Airlines you are horrendous!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Rude employees,"With flight delays, I had to quickly switch my flight to American and I had the worst service at the desk waiting to board. I had asked about a refund because of losing the level of seat I paid for and both women were very cold and short. Then I had to come back to one of the same women as their flight was delayed. She switched my seat to be closest and I had to ask a follow up question (I didn’t see my updated seat change) and she made me feel like I was an idiot for not seeing the update on my ticket. It was beyond rude customer service and I will definitely not be flying American again if I can help it."
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Average.. but at least consistently above average,Average.. but at least consistently above average. Best part was the 787 business cabin style seating. But was dirty and coffee stained. Attendants were kind and helpful until the oldest senior attendant was rude to another customer. Overall the flight experience was above average.

Date of travel: November 2021,10,American Airlines- highway robbers,"Bought round tip tickets X2.  To Hawaii so not exactly pocket change.  Had to change airports due to accommodate family need.  Fare went down but I had paid for seat upgrades (more wiggle room while on plane for 7hrs straight)  The second flight was cheaper so I wanted to use the difference to buy status upgrade.  Oooooohhhhh noooo they said- you have to use that difference on a FUTURE flight- you want upgrade, you have to pay more now.  WTH?!  I'm not done fighting this- and will never never ever fly American Airlines again!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Not an airline for the customer,If I could give this airline a 0 I would. We have been traveling for 30 hours to try and get back home. American Airlines has a delay based off of incompetence of there own services. Now we have to travel another 10 hours because they refused to connect us with a different airline. We got no accommodations and no help from any of the American airline employees. I will never fly American Airlines again and I hope they go under as an establishment.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"3 delays, 3 cancelations and 15 hours in the airport","My flight was delayed 3 times so I was going to miss my connecting flight. So I rescheduled my flights completely, but then I arrived in Dallas only to find that my connecting flight to Salt Lake was first delayed and then canceled. The next morning, I went to the airport for my next flight only to find that it too was canceled. Finally, that last flight was delayed several hours. Overall, I was supposed to be home tuesday afternoon and I arrived wednesday evening after spending 17 hours in the airport."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Very rude👺 behaviour of check in staff and the manager.,"I had a domestic connecting flight , that connected to international flight, Etihad Airways from Washington DC to abu dhabi . When my turn came in a long queue, i approached the check in counter to check in. The check in person welcome me with a face( clearly he had a bad day...and instead of helping me he made a face, looks like he was a racist) and asked me all details. I provided all covid related docs , passport and visa. He also asked self declaration form , which I was not aware of it, neither my travel agent , nor AA  or Etihad  AIRWAYS published on their website that it is mandatory form. So obviously, since this was my first trip out of usa after the pandemic, i wasn't not prepared with the form but asked the staff to provide me the form so I could fill it up on the spot. He showed me an online self declaration form. It took me 15ish min or so to complete the form...meantime aa staff served others. When I showed the completed form , he said now I couldn't board you as time to checkin baggage is passed!!! I was so surprised that he knew I was working on a form and he simply rejected me to check in / to board. I asked for manager if i could get any help... surprisingly she acted worst, instead of helping me she did the same thing as the staff with harsh words. Not to mention due to whatever reason, they had to delay the flight AA1179 by 30 mins. When I went back and requested again, they didn't change their mind to help me as a customer. Finally I offered if I could pay extra to get another flight to catch my international flight from Washington DC, without looking anything in computer they again made up their mind not to allow me to board in anyway!!So as a customer who ever would like to fly through American Airlines? I wish I could have recorded a video to publish here so the customers like me can see how badly I was treated.Hope AA management knows what is going on the ground and take some steps to provide better customer service. I lost full price international ticket, worth $$$ which could have been saved, had i got better customer service from the AA staff at check in counter."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN,"My first time flying American my wallet got lost and I had to get off the plane which was fine it is what it is, but then everyone working for American was so rude to me and yelling at me as if it was my fault only to find out security lost my wallet. Then I was 6 minutes late to check my bag and they wouldn’t allow me to check it and I had to rebook my flight for the next day and i’m supposed to be getting married and I am so angry that this happened. They do not give you awareness at all to show up early or give a time you need to be there anywhere in the app or in my email notifications and I was there an hour early and I still missed the bag drop. They rebooked me and whatever, but now my new layover was 5 hours vs. the original less than 1 hour. My options were to get stranded in my layover location or rebook for the next day. I WILL NEVER FLY WITH THEM AGAIN."

Date of travel: November 2021,10,AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,Just incompetence! Went to do the check in for my  flight and got told that there were no more spots for my bags on the plane. Then they made me wait for the 10 am flight to see if there was going to be a spot. I waited for 3 hours just to get told that there is no spot and I cannot fly the next day cause there is no space. I didn’t got any apologies they did not want to give me any airline credits or anything. Awful customer service!!!!!!
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Expect a problem with your carryon,"I’ve been on a few flights.... and I’ve had the same beat-up carryon for about 15 years. I’ve always avoided American because I’ve had good experiences with delta and jet blue and haven’t heard the best about American Airlines. Lesson learned.I typically travel with some expensive and somewhat fragile things and pack them carefully and bring them in a carry-on to keep them safer than a checked bag. On each of my connector flights we had a problem. The first one just didn’t have enough storage and they wanted to check my bag (so I had to unpack my bag to remove the fragile items) and the second flight said it was too big to bring on the plane....Unless my bag hit a growth spurt since my last trip 3 weeks ago, it’s been acceptable everywhere else and by everyone else. Couple that with multiple people having to have their flights changed at the desk because of overbooking and begging to keep their flight, I’d say they’re not worth using.Choose wisely"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Want to charge $150 fee for a 15 years old to travel alone,"orst airline Ever! Tried to book a ticket for my 15 years old son to visit his brother in LA and the website said to call to book over the phone.Waited 45 minutes to speak to a representative and he said I had to pay $150 fee for minor traveling alone! The ticket was $90. Never heard of anything like that before. Book flights for my teens with Jetblue, delta and other airlines all the time and never heard of a fee because the kid is under 15. Also, the flight is November 12 and his 16th birthday is November 17.Will never use American Airlines again. What a rip off!"

Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst airline,"We had so many issues, they canceled our flight because staff did not show up. Then tried to say it was our fault and gave us a difficult time booking us in a hotel for the night. They finally came to the conclusion it was their fault. Then the flight agents were super rude on a power trip. Next time I’ll spend the extra money and book with a better more reliable airline. Our 5 hour trip turned into 16 hours. I understand delays happen but they all had the worst attitude and talked down to us. Never again!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,I WISH I COULD GIVE 0 STARS,"Rude, disorganized, greedy. American will leave you stranded across country, charge you extra for their mistakes, deny you at the gate for carry on size (.5” too large) despite this being the 6th leg. No issues with the previous 5 legs, but NOW it’s an issue. I offered to throw some clothes out, and they said no. I had to either pay extra or change my flight.Been stuck in LAX for 8 hours now. Missed two flights because of their incompetence. Had to notify my employer, change my hotel and ride pickup. Not one apology. Was told to “deal with it” by the attendant at gate. POS company."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,waitlisted passengers board ahead of customers with connecting flight,"so the airline books connecting flight but they do not guarantee you get on your second flight, and tbe best part of it: it is not their fault if control tower delays the plane, tbey are nit going to take responsibity.they need to go out of business"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Paid for a ticket but denied the service paid for.,"My wife and I usually fly Westjet or Air Canada. We were supposed to be in Florida in September of 2021 on  business but couldn’t go due to Covid 19. Florida was a hot spot and we did not want to put our clients or staff at risk. I explained this to American Airlines and they said they would NOT refund the fare. I said, Air Canada is doing that due to Covid and their demeanour was, well, we are not Air Canada and we will issue a ticket credit but it must be used within one year of its issue for future travel. I wasn’t happy about this as I didn’t receive the service I paid for and they just keep the money. I just tried to use the ticket credit and the lady comes back on the phone saying, we regret to inform you that you cannot use your ticket credit for that trip because you are not going from Canada to US only like your previous trip. I was like hold on, no one told me when the credit was issued that it was only good from Canada to US, it was a credit, money in my American airlines account for future travel. A credit means it is a credit, use it as you want within one year of issue. I have contacted Visa and they are opening up a dispute case due to American Airlines taking my money and trying to roadblock providing service to me that I paid for. You cannot charge people money and then deny the service. Just wanted to let everyone know that my experience was horrible from the time I tried to get a refund due to covid and then trying to use my credit that they have proven to make impossible to use. From now on I am sticking to Air Canada Delta  and Westjet, never have an issue with these folks."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,November 2021 fiasco!!!!,What is wrong with American Airlines and swapping equipment cancelling flights delayed flights This is shameful that they think nothing of their customers time and only about their profits for investors and ceos that they can keep minimal staff with minimal equipment
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Horrible Rewards Program,"I’m a Prestige member and have noticed no difference from Gold. AA is more about the money than about pleasing customers. Actually, they are ALL about the money. They will leave First Class seats completely empty if their customers are not willing to pay extra for them. Why not please customers by allowing them to sit in the seats if they are open. They say, “if you buy a Volkswagen, why would you expect to drive a Mercedes off the lot.”  That is a horrible analogy. The First Class seat will no longer be there after the flight. If someone purchased a Volkswagen and the dealer was going to lose the Mercedes no matter what at the end of the day, they still would not allow the person to take it?  Why not?AA makes up these horrible excuses for their Greed."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Do not fly American if you need to be on time,"During my vacation I experienced nothing but displeasure with American Airlines. The staff was downright disrespectful and nearly all of my flights were delayed.I arrived back home three hours later than planned, had to call off work,and sleep in the subway.As an Airline that claims to honor veterans I feel absolutely disgusted and never plan to fly American again."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,BEWARE: Refund process horrible for cancelled flights!,"American Airlines cancelled our flights home from LA and let us know that we could rebook at no cost. My boyfriend is a first responder and couldn’t miss his shift the day after our original return date, so we tried to rebook the day prior to our return date (no flights were available on date of originally scheduled return), but when we tried to rebook following AA’s “Manage your flight” link, we weren’t able to select a return date prior to our original return. We communicated this issue with a gate agent, and they let us know we could rebook online (tickets were going fast) and that we could request a refund following. Should’ve been a red flag to us, but no surprise we’re having trouble getting reimbursed, and now we’re paying DOUBLE for the flights home— paying for the one that was cancelled and the one we had to rebook. We’ve submitted a request for refund 3 days ago— no response or confirmation AA has even received it. I’ve talked to two customer service folks (who were honestly very rude when I was trying to stay kind about all this— I know they’re dealing w a lot of other angry folks right now, too), and both told me it was out of their hands and directed me to the AA website for refunds that still isn’t resulting in any follow-ups from AA. Super frustrating experience, and even more frustrating for folks who aren’t made of money to see a company like AA rolling in gov’t kickbacks and sleazing customers for double the flight fare on trips THEY cancel— pretty sure they can afford to comp a ticket that’s worth a month’s salary. This has been a really upsetting experience. Would not recommend booking through them."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,American Airlines Ripped us off,"Booked a trip to Hawaii. On the flight home, we got stranded at the connecting airport, 2,500 miles from home with the choice of standing in Dallas for 3 days at our own expense awaiting a flight, or making it home on our own.  We already had suffered through a mind blowing SIX cancelled flights with them and had no faith this one three days later sleeping on airline floors wouldnt also be cancelled.  We forked out $415 to get home, American Airline refunded us $89 after 3 and a half hours of negotiating. Never book as a package,"

Date of travel: November 2021,10,Customer service is poor!,"Ed Henderson (I’m not the first person to raise concerns about him on this thread) demonstrates a poor customer service attitude and poor leadership qualities as a supervisor. My international flight to Belize was delayed greater than 3 hours but not quite 4 hours. I’m going to miss my connecting ferry boat in Belize as a result. He told me I could fly the day before (meaning I’d have to get a hotel-paid for by me) or basically just deal with It . When I stated you’d rather strand an American in a foreign country where they don’t speak the language, than refund them bc they missed your refund window by mere minutes, he stated why you would want to visit somewhere you think is unsafe anyway. First, it’s none of his business where I travel and why I travel there. Secondly, how unprofessional? I’m a manager in a hospital. I’ve dealt with the ups and downs of covid for almost 2 years now. I wipe butts with a smile. Ed Henderson would rather his customers feels unsafe and unsatisfied than refund a few hundred dollars that won’t have any effect on AA meeting their annual business plan. Policy and procedure over everything is the most jaded concept that exist in corporate America today. We are all humans. Saddened to have received this level of disrespect from my former favorite airline. I know I’m only one person, and you don’t need my money, but I won’t be flying with American any longer. There is a way to deliver “no’s” without crossing professional lines and boundaries. Please listen to your recorded line around 1600 today for more detail."

Date of travel: November 2021,10,Do NOT fly with them,"I had the worst experience flying with American Airlines and i travel pretty often. It started when they rebooked my flight automatically without even giving me an option. Which would put me in Mexico on Saturday instead of Thursday (what i originally had planned). I ended up having to stay in Dallas for one night and i was told in Austin that this would be reimbursed. When i got to Dallas the customer service representative said that was not the case and they will not reimburse me. So not only did i have to pay $150 for a hotel i had to pay for transportation to and from the airport. I finally got a flight from Dallas to Mexico Friday (the next day) and was to told several times that my luggage would be put on my new flight no problem. Well of course i get to Mexico and my luggage was not there. I had to be in the same clothes for 3 days! I finally went and bought a change of clothes. I called the number they gave me to check on the status of my bag and was in hold for an hour each time and never got through to anyone. I finally was able to track it online and saw that my luggage made it to Mexico on Sunday. I took an Uber to the airport (another additional cost i should have to pay) and when i get there they would t let me get my luggage without the physical boarding pass. They would not take anything electronic. I waited 2 hours and finally got my luggage. I then had to pay for an Uber back to my hotel. I wasted so much money, time and energy that i couldn’t even enjoy this “vacation”. And all American wanted to do was offer me a measly $100 credit. They can keep that money because I’m never flying American again and i will never recommend them to friends or family."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst customer service/ Flight update system,"To follow up with my previous statement. Thank you for ruining my trip back. I had to spend an extra 350 in travel and lodging expenses. I was standing at my gate with an ACTIVE boarding pass. NOT a screenshot, waiting to board my plane. I had another customer tell me the gate had changed. I had my phone in my hand. I didnt get a text, email or update on the app. I had to run to the other gate by the time I got there they told me my flight had left. I ended up getting stranded in downtown Charlotte. I was almost robbed trying to find a place that wasnt 200 a night. While I was at my hotel, I called in, angry, which would understate my feelings at the time. The first rep put me on hold for 45 minutes and laughed at me when I told her about having to make extra arrangements and almost getting robbed. When I spoke to the first manager, Amber, she told me it was my fault and I should have been watching the screens. WHY DO I NEED TO WATCH THE SCREENS WHEN I HAVE A PHONE WITH UPDATES???? Then I called back only to have another manager blame me yet again for missing my flight. Im done with this airline and any horror stories any of you hear about the extremely poor customer service and total lack of empathy, believe it. This is a s*it company and seriously, they will not be getting my business again."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Stressful,"Flight got delayed an hour due to weather and once we finally got on the plane, we proceeded to wait another hour because they didn't have enough trash cans and fire equipment to fly. They proceeded to give us vouchers for hotels and such and I tried to book better seats for the next available flight. The app didn't register my seat choices but still charged my card. I haven't been this frustrated in a long time and I will not be flying with them again."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,useless credit,"Both my flights were practically empty so I wasted money upgrading to window seats (which, in itself, is a scam) so I asked for a refund for the extra $160. They gave me a $100 creadit which I can't use when I book on expedia or priceline etc. (Mind you, that's where I bought the flight in the first place and the onlly place i would buy an AA flight.) So I have $100 credit I can't use."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,As usual a  delay,It’s inexcusable that they no “plan B “ in place knowing that weather was and issue and our co pilot was coming from a weather impacted area. It’s bad planning and just sloppy operations. In addition what is the point of buying a first class ticket having  a bag marked priority and be one of the last ones out. They would have been better off having the additional staff rather then absorb the cost of paying the ground time. They should find an experienced Operations person and hire them . I 'll go back to other Airlines
Date of travel: November 2021,10,AA STOLE MY IPHONE,"I took an AA flight from Nashville to DFW. Right when I got off the aircraft I noticed my phone was missing. I did find my iphone and it was indicating my phone was at the aircraft. I went to AA lost and found and advised tne of AA employees, which told me they checked the aircraft and my phone wasnt there. 5 hours later I get a call from a flight attendant saying he found my phone and to fill out a claim and they will ship my phone back to me. I filled out the form and for what was a very long 3 month wait , all I received were automatic updates they have not found my phone yet, until one day i get an email saying they closed the claim bc the phone wasnt found. I called them for almost 4 months straight every day, left voicemails, sent numerous emails explaining the situation and never received a call back. One day finally someone replied to my email and said they were going to look jbto it and get back to me by tomorrow. Its now been 6 months and no one has reached out after that email dispite of the several follow ups and calls i have made not only yto the airline but the airport as well. What type of customer service is this, you clearly STOLE my phone and didd not give it back!!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Passenger,"I expected to flight back to Chicago on Sunday Oct 31, came to the airport around 2hrs early before the departure time 3:15 and got the text message that they cancelled our flight. We waited in the line to rebook it on the next day Monday Nov 1 at 3:39 to Seatles, and 11:59pm from Seatles to Chicago on Nov 2 at 6am as their suggestion. But the connecting flight to Seatles was delayed for 1.5 hrs due to tech problem, and when we got to Seatles at 8pm, and they said our 11:59pm flight got cancelled and rebooked it to us at 5am on nov2, arrive at Ohare at 11:45, which means I’m gonna miss another work day. No hotel voucher or anything, we just sat and slept on the chair from 8-4am. We spent almost 3 days at the airport due to their worse operation and unprofessional lame excuses regarding understaff due to holiday and bad weather. Dude, United Airline and other airlines are still operating. And if their staff had ask for vacation off, then the airline should know it in advance and should announce it earlier so their passengers could find alternative solution. They only announced us via text right few hrs before departure time. Hope they won’t cancel our flight at 5am, because I don’t want to sleep at the airport for another day."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Horrible,Terrible. over 1500 delayed flights but they were not prepared to handle the consequences. Rude rude rude customer service agents. I understand things happen and the flights get delayed but it's the way it was handled. No care or concern for customers or thier situations such as injures and elderly travellers. No waivers vouchers or accommodations. The airlines lost my luggage and the person that was supposed to deliver it never showed up .Horrible. No one is accountable. It may help to improve customer relations or look into accommodating weary travelers. This is the hospitality industry remember ?
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Terrible help after they cancelled our flight,Our flight at departing at 5:44 am was cancelled. The replacement flight they offered was 12 hours later and arrived at Orlando FL at 10:00 pm. Awful!! they took an entire day of our vacation and we got nothing in return. They told us to call our booking agency........the booking agency could not do anything because AA cancelled the flight. Just a terrible experience! We called AA and the callback time to get help was over 4 hours! Will not fly with AA EVER if I have the option to fly with ANYONE else!!
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Delays,"I get that flights get delayed, but the over 6 hour delay with the lack of communication from the American airline staff.

Date of travel: October 2021,10,Will never fly American Airlines again!,"When I boarded the plane in DCA, there was garbage stuffed in the seat and a bottle of water left in my first class seat area. The plane was dirty, the flight attendants didn't care or clean the spot up when I showed them. I had to! When I finally reached my destination, my brand new luggage... It looks like it went through a war zone. Torn, ripped zipper, dirty and useless to me now. There was no one to help me at the desk to do a damaged luggage claim.  It was my first and last time I will ever fly with them. I've flown Delta and have had superior service, clean and sanitized airplane. Delta has the best flight attendants... friendly, kind and attentive. I just never realized how wonderful Delta Airlines service is until I flew with American Airlines. American Airlines is the worst."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,American Airlines is what is Wrong with America.,"My team and I had to travel to Miami for a conference. We all returned to Guatemala within a three day time span. Some of my colleagues couldn’t get back in time for work and family and had 24-48 hour delays to return. For me and others we have had a two hour delay. We were lucky. This was due to the fact that plane crews were protesting vaccine mandates. I am an American working abroad and I find this unbelievable that the crew would hold the company and paying customers world wide hostage for an ignorant and entitled cause. There are countries around the world needing vaccines to save their schools, economy and the lives of the citizens and to destress their over taxed hospitals. And the employees of American Airlines  made their political movement our problem. They are the epitome of American entitlement and it affected my work. Not to mention, the crew who did show up were annoyed, and the pilot took advantage of a captured audience to express his political platform and apologized for the mask mandate on the plane. The employees who affected travelers around the world did not display heroism.. but instead affected paying customers—- who pay their salaries—-peoples lives and businesses. I will not use American Airlines again, nor will my business. I am sure there are many American Airline employees who did show up to work, who support the company, need their jobs, like their jobs and also know what it takes to get this world back on track health wise and economically. So I’m sorry for those folks and hope the company can recover after its global embarrassment. #nomoreamericanairlines"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,"Read updated American Airlines terms, they are not responsible(if 4any)for leaving you stranded. Travelers are D-fnless",".... And not many competitors, to be honest.... American Airlines delays and cancelations massively, and recently updated their Contract terms, be aware, read it!!... The only thing they are obligated (by themselves) is to refund you the rest of the trip. They can leave us stranded and run away. The cheap trick, as always, is to blame weather and riding in your money for the months or weeks you have reserved (only from interest, they are stealing you, already) . Any known class action lawsuit?.... Canceled 3 times, overnight stranded at LAX and ONT and now delayed and upon AA's mercy in PHX"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Gross mishandling,"Due to their incompetence, they rebooked me on JetBlue. American wouldn't give me my boarding pass and told me to go to JerBlue. Fair, so I went to JetBlue and they told me to go to American because that's who booked my flight. After neither airline taking responsibility I missed my flight. American Airlines is disgusting and deserves no business."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst Airline Service,"I will never fly America Airlines again. They cancelled thousands of flights, and mine was one of them. They rescheduled us for two days later. They left us stranded in New Orleans with no help for hotel stays or food. The lady at the counter was extremely disrespectful. They weren't providing vouchers because it was supposedly weather related, however no other airlines cancelled. They lied to their customers to try to get out of providing services to help them. They then wouldn't even waive a check bag fee when they put us on standby. They need to be held accountable."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,God Awful Experience AGAIN,"This is the second flight in a row American was unable to fulfill. My first flight experienced 3 mechanical failures and other unrelated delays. Current flight was cancelled and a 10 hour wait in line was required to receive a hotel voucher. I wish I could say I ever had a flight without issue, but I have yet to successfully experience a round trip without delays and cancellations from them. It was a mistake to try and fly with them a 2nd time."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst experience ever,"Just wanting to give my very first experience flying review on American Airlines. In my 32 years on earth of living I have never flown in my life until last week. Flew out from Atlanta to Palm Springs for vacation, with a connection flight in Phoenix. Getting there wasn’t too bad… the getting home part is the reason I’m writing. As of right now I will never fly with American Airlines ever again, point blank. We had our flight departing Palm Springs on Saturday at 11:10, the flight kept getting delayed and delayed hour after hour. Finally at 3:45 the plane arrived ( our flight from Phoenix to Atlanta was at 4:55pm) the plane sat on the tarmac for over an hour just sitting there, their excuse was plane was having problems with oxygen, fuel, check engine light, no a/c… sounds pretty scary to me to be flying a broken plane. We finally get to Phoenix at 4:30 … soon as we touched down.. our flight was cancelled.. great.. stood in a line of about 50 people for 2 hours just to get a hotel voucher and taxi voucher. And we said we would take any flight to Nashville or Atlanta at this point and drive the rest. Trying to have options. But no options. Alright so we get to the hotel and get some sleep wake up and had a flight to Nashville from Phoenix at 4:55 on Halloween. Get to the airport lines were 100 people deep. Get to check baggage and our flight was cancelled again… at this point me and my wife are not going to make it to work tomorrow, or to get our dog.. can’t sit here and wait for more flights to just keep getting cancelled on us. So 1200 dollars later we got a rental and are just going to drive 1,700 miles home, with 2 missed days of work pay thanks to American screwing up back to back on everyone’s flights. No telling how many families they’ve screwed up, how many jobs were at stake all because of the “ weather, and staff”. Pretty crazy about the “weather” when no other airlines were having any troubles with weather. But any ways…. Yeah American Airlines… thanks for the worst experience ever, we are currently driving in New Mexico now… safe travels everyone reading this."

How about you don't furlough your staff and replace them with half cost interns while giving yourselves millions in bonuses. Will never fly american airlines again. Doesn't matter if the flight is free. You will never get a single cent from me or my family again
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Sucks,"Oct 23 -  Charlotte to Phoenix cancelled. had to fly to LA & then back missing 1/2 day of vacation. Return flight on Oct 30 was cancelled too. Had to fly to Austin. that flight was late then we boarded but had to get off the plane. Flight was delayed but didn't make that time either. Finally arrived on Austin and was given food vouchers for any airport that was closed, a transportation voucher for a taxi service that had no cars there and finally a hotel voucher for a hotel that had no rooms. Finally got a hotel & a flight out a day late! What a sh@t show!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Cancelled flight 24 hours before departure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Worse experience ever. They attract you with low rates and free carry on but the funny part is - you're not going to fly with them. I believe they are doing it intentionally and it's  called FRAUD.  Someone need to start class A lawsuit and bankrupt this fraud cheating company. They not even willing to refund money for the flight that they had cancelled!!! How messed up is it?! DO NOT FLY WITH THIS COMPANY!!! BE AWARE!!! IT'S A FRAUD!!!P.S. HOW THIS COMPANY IS STILL OPERATING WITH SO MANY UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS?! IT WAS MY FIRST AND LAST TIME BUYING AA. HOPE THEY WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS SOONER THAN LATER!

Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst travel experience I ever have,"Our flight is from Las Vegas to Boston and stay at Charlotte for transfer. The flight from Vegas to Charlotte is delayed about 1 hour and 20 minutes with estimated arrival time 6:41pm. And flight to Boston departure at 6:45pm. Firstly, the staff sitting at customer service is working unbelievably slow, like more than 1 hour per person. Then we changed to Gate 9 staff who worked much more efficiently. However, we were told we are very likely gonna miss the flight but try to catch it and not able to catch, will take the flight the day after . ( hello? Is it possible to get off one plane and get onto another in 4 minutes? By then boarding is already f* closed )"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Misery,Worst airline I have ever attempted to fly with cancelled our flight last minute with zero viable solutions or compensation. Customer service rep basically said “yeah this company sucks they aren’t even letting us compensate the inconvenienced travelers” lol if you do one thing right in life - never ever choose American Airlines!
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst airline I’ve been on.,"4 cancelled flights, zero concern for traveling with small children, lost luggage.  Fly with anyone else."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Not a Premium Product,"I flew business class from Philadelphia to Athens.  Beginning with Check-In, the American Airlines staff member seemed very disgruntled and put out that I had the audacity to actually check-in for my flight.   She offered no guidance as to lounge access, the closest lounge is being renovated and when I asked her if the closest lounge was a far off walk---she just shrugged her shoulders.  The lounge was ok, it is a typical Admiral's Club, it is a bit rundown.  I did not see any sanitizing of commonly touched areas being done, the food was limited and left way too long.  I would like to see one staff member dedicated to monitoring the self service area.  I actually watched an old guy, blow his nose into a napkin, then go and handle a bunch of the utensils without washing or sanitizing his hands.  For some odd reason there were even children in strollers in the lounge.  When I finally entered my flight, I sat down in my business class seat and touched my head rest, and the cushion immediately fell off.  I showed it to the miserable flight attendant, he tried to fix it and then had to call maintenance which delay the flight while it was being fixed.  The flight attendant was horrible, along with the service.  He took my drink order and meal order.  He passed over me while dropping off bottled water to each guest.  He came to serve my drinks, and asked me what I was having.  I told him, that I would like some water, and I reminded him that he already took my drink order.  He returned with two tiny bottles of water and in about 30 minutes, my drink order.  Dinner was then served.  After dinner, my flight attendant was not seen again until the snack service.  At no time was water offered or anything additional offered.  I actually had to get up out of my seat, and track down another flight attendant to get some additional water.  This was not a premium product at all!!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst airline ever,"THE Worst airlines. They cancelled our flight last minute and put us on a flight back home the next day to arrive at midnight. They didn’t offer us any hotels ,meals or any form of transportation. One lady put me on hold for 3 hours and then finally hanged up. They were finally able to get us a hotel but  left us no choice but to spend our own money for food and transportation because they denied us. They were also RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL they acted like we were the ones late to our flight. Didn’t apologize for the cancellation didn’t give us any excuses. Totall worst day all because of AMERICAN AIRLINES. We also stated to them that we were students and didn’t have any money for food or transportation but they didn’t seem to care about us. They were in such a hurry to hang up the phone. Such RUDE people! I’m soooo sad and disappointed."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"American Airlines Is A Lying, Dishonest Con Machine","American Airlines cancelled my flight…as I was printing boarding passes for the flight.Mine was one of hundreds American cancelled without any prior notice the weekend of 10/30/21 to 10/31/21. The airline blamed “severe winds” in Dallas for disrupting its fleet service throughout the country but that is a transparent lie.American’s ticket agent and its customer service center told me the issue was “crew” but could offer no further information. A “crew” issue? Huh. Apparently, American did not put out an internal notification to its ticket agents and customer service representatives about “severe winds in Dallas”, which means American has grossly incompetent management or its wind story was a lie.American cancelled my flight, stranding me, my wife and dozens more hapless travelers in Orlando, telling us it could get us on on a non-direct flight on Monday morning, 11/1/21. Not one word from American about offering to re-route us on another airline, not one word from it on what hotel it would put us up in for the remainder of the weekend.American’s toll free customer service number? Yeah, that’s for flight reservations or cancellations only. American doesn’t give a damn about its customers and this attitude is both on the part of its management and its petulant, overpaid pilots and flight attendants, all of whom are in pissing contest over the president’s Covid vaccination order and its customers are their toilets.My hope is one day, in the not too distant future, American Airlines goes bankrupt and its employees face destitution because the organization and its worthless employees placed themselves above thousands of customers, abandoning them literally at the last moment. American Airlines and its employees don’t deserve anything but our contempt."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Horrible airline, never flying American again","We were supposed to fly out of Sacramento to Puerto Vallarta October 20 at 6:20 AM we received a text message from American Airlines at 11 PM canceling our flight. I got on the phone with American Airlines about midnight and asked why the flight was still open on their website and could be booked and she, the representative said she didn’t know why but that that flight was canceled so she said the only thing that we could do is rebook it for two days later, which would mean we lost two days of resort fees at our resort in Puerto Vallarta. So the only other thing we could do is to drive to San Francisco which takes three hours to fly out of there to Puerto Vallarta  at 6:30 the next morning. So we had to get up and drive to make it to that flight. Then when we got there that flight on the runway had mechanical problems so we had to wait an hour and a half which in turn made us miss our flight in Phoenix . So we had to be booked on a different flight in Phoenix which was our connecting flight to Puerto Vallarta which was a couple hours later. Needless to say this was a nightmare and I cannot believe that the airline just canceled your flight when you’re pretty much showing up at the airport  I will never fly American again goodbye"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Third unexpected cancellation,"I travel a lot for business. American Airlines cancelled my ticket today, 20 hours before boarding after sending the check in information. Had they cancelled a week ago, I could have made accommodations. This is the third time I've had this type of experience with American Airlines. I won't be flying them again; maybe good for a cheap vacation, but not for a predictable one or an important business trip."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Beware!!!!!  Do Not Fly This Airline!!!,Airline Canceled our reservation a few hours prior to our flight. Offers nothing in return. Refuses to allow you to be put on any standby without canceling the new reservation they gave us with no choices about it. And if you choose standby over your new reservation they charge you for whatever price is going at that time for the ticket even though they canceled on you. And even after canceling our reservation they have 4 more flights going out the day we should have left out and refuse us any of those flights. This service Is not one that cares for Customer Service!!!!!!!!!
Date of travel: October 2021,10,RUDE  CONDESCENDING MEAN !!!!!,"This was the worst experience I've had with ANY airline, and I've had some terrible experiences. I would recommend to avoid booking on AMERICAN AIRLINES for everyone. I waited 4 hours for a call after they cancelled my flight. The rep that called back was rude, belligerent, condescending and MEAN.  Even with a low price, I will never book with AA EVER again. They just take your money and leave you hanging."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Still on hold with American Airlimes,Still on hold Saturday October 30th 800 433 7300.  It is now 3 hours 1 minute and 26 seconds.  Who does this to customers?
Date of travel: October 2021,10,I am bewildered by the business model of this airline,"This airline does have some nice staff on customer service but the wait on the phone is so appalling that most people must be murderous by the time they get through.  In 4 phone calls my shortest wait is 1 hour and 46 minutes.  This is evenings, daytime or weekend.  The tickets are so hard to get a credit for that the average person would never be able to follow through on what is required if they employed or a have family?.  There is no cancellation of flight or instruction e-mail so details must be recorded and kept safe.  I called back to use the credit (and wait on hold for a couple of hours plus) the American Airlines person told me that the cancellation information numbers are now different and the ticket must be booked by the agent.  She told me the price and Record Locator.    Again no e-mail of the flight details of the new reservation.   Therefore you cannot see if it booked correctly unless you look it up.  Today I looked up the reservation and although the flights, date and time are correct the price is strangely not the  $1227 she quoted it has acquired a $500 ‘airline fee’.  I am now on hold (1 hour 40 minutes so far) again trying to find out what is going on.  I cannot imagine ever flying this airline again as it is just so difficult to get anything done at all. All this messing around must be expensive and demoralizing for staff."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst airline ever,I showed up a hour and 30 minutes before my flight at 12:58 I couldn’t check in online because my phone wouldn’t load my 6 digit code when I put it in the kiosks. I’m thinking that’s strange  so I waited in line because my flight boarded at 2:26. I got to the front of the line at 1:55 and she told me “you have to be here an hour before your flight” they had ONLY TWO people checking flights and they were taking their time talking to customers. I believe they had already sold my flight ticket hours before I even attempted to check in. Because when I checked the website it was only one flight available for $2307 dollars. What is the purpose of me buying my ticket one month in advance if I have no protection. They gave me a new flight and now that flight is delayed and this is just an overall horrible experience because nothing was prioritized. I will never use this airline again

Date of travel: October 2021,10,You should provide the service you would expect for yourself!,"Just a heads up for people traveling. We had flight to St. Martin for today at 12:00 am. Red eye through Miami. American Airlines cancelled 4 hours prior to departure due to crew shortage.  They also cancelled flight exactly when their 24 hour service closed and is not really 24 hours. Their system said a 3 hour wait time which turned into 9 hours. Someone finally answered when they came into the office at 6 am.  Of course we were continually told how important we were and someone would be with us shortly.  American Airlines could not accommodate us until Nov 1st and not in the same type of class seating. We did get a full refund for our tickets. Lost $250.00 on Covid testing (what a con that is), hoping to get back required medical insurance through St. Martin. Praying we are not charged $500 cancellation fee through resort. Missed out on a great deal to St. Martin. Just don’t get your hopes up for your trips, the airlines are crazy and #americanairlines suck!!  Also, if they would have been more forth coming we could have changed airlines and probably made the connection, but they made themselves unavailable except for crappy change they recommended for us through their on line service. American Airlines cannot provide dependable service to it’s customers without better response time on cancelled flight’s.  They should provide people with the service that is warranted in these situations. American you cancelled, closed and said screw you take what we give you or stay home.  We are opting to stay home for the unforeseen future because you can’t provide dependable travel and responsive service when you can’t deliver. Also makes me wonder how well maintained your planes are and trained crew when you cannot even provide acceptable cancellation service to your patron’s."

They were not treated fairly! 70 passengers were rerouted because pilot saw heavy clouds which I understand but then  also stated that plane needed fuel.  Because of this stop, Passengers missed other flights. . All Passengers were told they were standbys even though they purchased round trip tickets. Once they got to airport,  AA had no plan for 70 passengers to board another flight. They made Passengers go to all these different gates to try to board as a standby which was impossible! Passengers were in this airport all day long because of AA negligence! Most Passengers missed funerals,  weddings, other appointments and still  had to wait 6 to 8 hours to get a flight out. This was terrible and American Airlines Headquarters needs to do better! I will not recommend AA especially when their number one priority is the customer and quality service!"
n/a,10,IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR SANITY AVOID!,"I flew with delta with a friend to go to New York for 3 days and go back to Seattle with American airlines. I left Newark on the 28th in the morning and It is officially October 30th while I type this....IN THE AIRPORT WAITING TO GO HOME!!! They have way too many excuses as to why they're delayed. They flew me to Dallas-Fort worth where my layover was and I got stuck in an insanely long line because they canceled the flight to get the rest if the way home. There were so many people who's flight got canceled waiting in that line it took over 3 hours to finally get the opportunity to speak to a representative. The first reason was that they closed off 11 different runways in Philadelphia leaving only 3 runways open which caused a domino effect but then they changed the excuse to air traffic control problems. I was booked for another flight that flew me to Philadelphia as a layover and then Seattle. Welp I flew to Philadelphia where again I managed to get kept stuck at that airport for an entire day. Their reasoning was?! ""The aircraft is here but in the hanger and we're waiting for them to bring it to the terminal"" we waited over 30 minutes AFTER we were supposed to board. We finally board and guess what. We landed late and I missed the connection. they got me on a flight from Philadelphia to Chicago as a connection and then Seattle. This plane should have practically half way to seattle by now with the rest of us passenger in it. We haven't been able to board Now with another lousy excuse that they are looking for flight attendants.....ARE YOU FRIGGIN KIDDING?? I JUST WANNA GO HOME!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Please Use Another Airline,"I am writing this review just so that I can save someone else the headache of flying with American Airlines. I haven’t had a worse day of travel until my experience with them. In one day, they cancelled 30 flights. I was supposed to fly into Miami and then to MCI. They cancelled my flight to MCI. I then had my flight changed to arriving in Charlotte with a direct fight to MCI in the morning. They then cancelled my flight to MCI that was just scheduled. They gave my husband and I a voucher to a hotel nearby the airport. Got there and the voucher didn’t work. We had to pay for our own room. Also, they kept sending people to this hotel and the hotel ran out of rooms. So next option was a layover in Dallas, then MCI. The flight to Dallas was delayed 2 hours because we were waiting for the flight attendant. Do NOT fly with them. Worst experience ever!!!"

Customer service was totally useless and unable to get me a refund over the phone and online my ticket was ""ineligible"" for a refund. American Airlines is useless and inefficient.One star is more than they deserve."

The fact that they even manage to ruin First Class (how is that even possible?)… their churlish “attendants”? The two hour waits on the phone lines? The useless mobile app and website?

When I asked,""Am I just supposed to sit in the airport all day and miss a full day of work?"", the lady working their counter literally said, ""People miss their flights all the time because of us."" They would not book me with another airline, not pay an UBER to get me to where I had to go (Greenville), so I paid $90 for an UBER to get to where AA was supposed to get me. When I called later in the week to talk to Customer Service about refunding the leg that THEY  missed, I was told it would be between THREE - FIVE hours before a representative would call me back.On both return flights, BOTH take offs were late.

Date of travel: October 2021,10,They do not take of their AA Advantage members or  offer any kind of reimbursements for inconvenience.,First flight delayed and had to reschedule because of the connecting flight. The rescheduled flight arrived late and missed the connecting flight. Stuck in Chicago over night. Was told by an American Airlines representative the flight was delayed by weather so they couldn’t help me. Asked about the inconvenience of the first flight and was told it wasn’t showing in the system. 12 hours at the airport and having to pay $250 for a hotel stay and won’t make it home for 24 hours. Think I will burn my AA Advantage card. Poor customer service and obviously don’t care where you spend your money.
Date of travel: October 2021,50,"Non Eventful Flight, Fantastic Flight Attendant","I am writing this review based on one thing, the fantastic flight attendant serving us. I have been flying frequently since I was a very young boy. I have never encountered a flight attendant as friendly, kind and helpful as Brenna who served the rear section of the economy cabin. She did things like offering to carry the baby of a young mother with another child off the plane when we arrived in Eire. It is obvious that she loves her job and cares about the passengers she serves. You are fortunate to have her as an employee. Most flight attendants seem like they are doing a job but with Brenna it is a calling. Airlines should have more employees like Brenna."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,UNRELIABLE,"Flight delay and canceled.  Called customer service and was told they would call me back in 3-5 HOURS.  Online chat is 90 minute wait.  Received apology letter asking to “restore my confidence “ and $50 credit to future flight.   Well,,,,, on my way back home from Vegas to Orlando, received 3 notifications that the flight is delayed. So if this flight gets one more delay time we will miss our connecting flight AGAIN.  No one answers the customer service number, and there is not ONE representative at any of the gates to ask… first and last time flying this god awful airline."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,No Empathy,"Purchased an International ticket to Japan from Florida about 6 months ahead of time, pandemic hits and borders are closed. No refund was given but a credit. Our credit odly enough wouldn't cover the same trip the next year. Even though it's suppose to be miles. They also valued our flight from Florida to Detroit round trip for 2 tickets at 800 dollars...not even a one way flight. Spirit does the same flight for 60 dollars. My original destination I could not go to and then everything was valued 3x higher in the U.S....also gave me a deadline to use my miles. Horrible company, horrible customer service, and don't care if you miss your mom's funeral, screw up your anniversary. No one cared or had sympathy for us basically spending alot for nothing. I have only stayed with them to finish out my mules. I'll drive before I ever use American Airlines again."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Here’s to another year with American Airlines as the worst company in the country,"As of writing, sitting at the apron, waiting for the plane to depart, just got another delay notification going into 5 hrs after it was support to depart. While waiting the plane turned off the lights in the cabin (cause of maintenance or some non-informarive excuse) and reduced the airflow coming in; the problem, is that the plane is 7/8s full and human heat easily turned the plane’s cabin into something sweatshops would envy.Oh, there goes another notification of a delay; a couple more and the notification department might qualify for a restraining order. The updates they send don’t mean anything, they send several every hour (even if there is no delay). I’d flag them for spam but that’s the closest to human contact you can get out of American. The gate agents, the crews, the customer support staff, all seem like automatons with running the risk of getting flogged if they say a word outside the script. Or maybe they get their lunch breaks taken from them. I’d wager the odds are about the same.You might think it’s unfair to thrash American this way, that there might be intangibles they can’t control. But seeing as how the weather is severe clear skies, light winds, and low 80s temperature, the problem must be their MO. I’m familiar with airline operations and airlines like American have a flew of aircraft in reserve, as well as crew, and round the clock support staff. How they managed a 6 hour set back in near perfect environmental conditions merits some recognition to their dismal business model. Remembering how these clowns were given literal tons of money last year so they wouldn’t go bankrupt makes this experience all the more souring. I’d hope something would change, but I heard someone say “hope is advance puting” and well here I am proving someone right.In the future I’ll look for alternate ways of travel seeing as how excruciating it is to expect standards out if American Airlines. I hear burros might make a comeback, they may smell a bit and have an uncomfortable seat, but then again, I’m already sitting in a smelly, uncomfortable cabin seat. Well if you made it this far that’s the end of my rant, I’ll try to stare at the cabin window for the next few hours wondering what happy people are doing while I wait for the airline to get it’s act together. Oh wait, there’s another delay notification."

Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terrible policies regarding changes!!!😡,"You would think, do to the cost of flying and the travel culture to buy transportation tickets early, that a company like American Airlines would be a bit more lenient towards trip changes. We are 8 months out from flight and had a person in our travel party cancel. We found a replacement. Keep in mind it's a name and birth date change, the end. SORRY, THIS IS NOT ALLOWED. So basically you are stuck with an expensive ticket that can't be transferred to a different name to be used, even though you have to go through multiple security hoops the day of flight. This is ridiculous. I will NEVER use AA again."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terrible Experience,"Terrible Experience.American flew myself and my 10lb puppy from Chicago to Denver no problem. This was my first time flying with a pet in cabin.I then returned to check-in to come home and Dorris / Dora... (Do not recall exact name), was very rude from the beginning basically saying ""what do you want"" as soon as I approached the counter.  She denied myself the flight because of my puppy. Who is very well behaved. He was too small and in a soft crate in which there is no way I would put him in with luggage.I requested an exemption being American had no issue flying me out.  She said no.  Really put me in a stuck situation.From the rudeness and fact that I had to cancel my flight and then was happily greeted by Frontier Airlines who got me home, I will never fly American again."

Extremely grateful for that. They got us home safely and on time!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Rude behavior, unacceptable service","I rarely write reviews, but these encounters were alarming enough to cause me to. While entering the San Diego international airport, I realized I’d lost my mask, and asked the airport employee where I could find one. He directed me the the American Airlines service desk. I waited in line and approached the desk, apologizing and asking if I could please have a disposable mask. He said yes and reached in his drawer, asking if I was flying American, to which I said no. He then handed me the mask and asked again, more aggressively, to which again I said I was not flying American, but thank you for the paper mask. He reached back over and ripped the mask out of my hand, saying i can’t have their mask unless I’m flying their airline, and told me to go somewhere else. It was startling, and very patronizing, as well as disrespectful to basics COVID guidelines we’re required to follow. Before this experience, I flew American several weeks prior, where I witnessed a flight attendant yell at an elderly man actively eating to put his mask on. The same attendant also yelled at the parent of a small child playing with their mask. For an airline that so clearly aggressively treats mask wearing and customers, they also seem to disregard public health unless you’re paying them. I will not be flying or engaging with this airline again."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Deceptive practices, Incompetent/Rude customer service","Due to COVID restrictions, I had to cancel my 50th birthday trip to Madrid.  I called American to find out if I could use the flight credit to book a replacement trip, and would there be any problems.  I asked her how much the credit would be, she said she couldn’t know until we canceled, so I said go ahead.At NO time did she tell me that flight credit cannot be applied to an economy ticket, regardless of whether the ticket canceled was an economy ticket, which this was.I had found the fare I wanted on google flights and read the flight numbers to her.  She repeated back a different set of numbers, and a much higher price.  Clearly she ignored me and just put in the dates and destinations. So I looked it up on the AA site.  I read the same numbers.  Then I waited and wondered:How is it she can’t see the same and better info and process it as fast as I? Why can’t I use the credit I have on the website?After 37 minutes, she put me on a “brief hold. “ She said with the credit, I’d be responsible for about $300.  She said she had to consult with a “price specialist.” 20 min later, she returned to tell me that no economy seats were available, so I would owe her $675. This was a lie, economy seats were still available. When I told her so she tried to send me to someone else.  After 58minutes!. Keep in mind as well that our credit was $611.UNDERSTAND THIS: there is no such thing as a credit with AA.  They will sell you a ticket that is at least double your original cost.  Once you send them your money, you will never get it back.Now this had happened to me before, but I made the same mistake again because I believed the lie from the previous agent, who had told me they couldn’t apply my credit because I had booked through Priceline.  For this express reason I made sure to book directly through AA, in case anything like this should happen again.2 calls to AA customer service, two lies about why they don’t credit canceled fares.  Then I did ask for a manager. The line had a terrible connection, and the manager didn’t enunciate.  I understood by now that everything difficult about this process was by design.This man refused to answer my questions, talked over me constantly, and when I finally got him to acknowledge that the first agent I spoke should have made the terms of cancellation clear without my asking, and certainly WHEN I asked, he smugly told me there was nothing he could do for me.  He, and both the agents before him were slow, rude, inarticulate, and most important, possessed of zero sense of commitment to the customer.I may give AA my  money again, because I will continue to use Priceline, which competes well with google flights for finding the cheapest deals, with none of the hassle.  But I will never deal directly with AA again. They have a culture of deception, disrespect, and blaming the customer.  When I can spend an extra $50 to avoid making their airline part of my bundle, I will.  DISGUSTING!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Harassing a two year old,"I have never had such a terrible experience with flying American Airlines EVER until I was traveling home to see my family with my 2 year old daughter. Checked in/went through security while my daughter was not wearing a mask with no issues whatsoever. And have traveled previous to this trip while my daughter was 2 and she was resistant to wearing her mask and never had any issues. However on this trip once I was got to the ticket agent at the gate I was told my 2 year old needs to wear her mask or else we can't get on the plane. I asked the ticketing agent if there was any leniency as my daughter is barely 2 and continually pulls her mask off. The only response I received was a prompt ""MOVE TO THE SIDE MA'AM!!"" and then while I'm struggling to get my 2 year old to wear her mask and juggling all our bags and trying to hold her I overhear the ticketing agent berating me to other passengers boarding the plane. Super hurtful and totally unnecessary. I was thankfully able to get my daughter to finally keep her mask on and asked if we could please board the plane. I received the go-ahead, but little did I know this ticketing agent had went ahead onto the plane to tell the flight attendants and captain of the plane that we were a ""mask issue"" So of course I was promptly stopped from boarding the plane and no one is telling me anything. I finally saw the ticketing agent and asked why we couldn't board the plane now that my daughter is not pulling her mask off. She said ""well we can't guarantee she wont' pull it off on the flight"" Ummm she's a baby! of course we can't guarantee she won't pull it off and further more what's the difference between someone pulling there mask down to eat/drink?? Somehow that's okay but a 2 year old tugging at her mask is unfathomable?? So at this point I was told ""the captain does not want any ""mask issues"" today and he said No to us boarding the plane and that's what I get, but that the supervisor was coming down to talk to me but it's not up to him"".  Well thankfully the supervisor did come down because I found out that the ticketing agent told the captain, flight attendants, and supervisor that I was the one not willing to wear my mask (mind you I had been wearing my mask the ENTIRE time) and as I'm starting to cry because I think that I'm not going to get to see my family the supervisor says to me ""you know you need to wear your mask the enter flight correct?"" OF COURSE! I was never the issue. My two year old didn't want to wear her mask and it's kind of hard to rationalize with a two year old who is barely talking why she must keep a mask on her face. Once he realized that this ticketing agent was clearly targeting me and my two year old daughter he was able to convince the captain we were not an issue, we were granted access to get on the plane. I'm so grateful to that kind supervisor and that I was able to actually speak with him and clear up the lies that were told about me.  I have never been treated so poorly and still can't believe that this ticketing agent was purposely targeting me and my two year old. I understand there are rules and regulations and we were happy to comply but the fact that my 2 year old pulling on her mask was the cause of us to almost not even be able to get on our flight was absolutely ridiculous! Where is your compassion??? Even on our trip back to Charlotte after seeing my family, we had just one flight attendant who constantly was checking up on my 2 year old to make sure she had her mask on, which she was wearing for most of the flight but of course my daughter at one point pulled her mask down and started to scream/cry (AGAIN SHE'S TWO!!) as I'm trying to put her mask back on, but no sympathy or help from the flight attendant, as she stood over us ensuring that my 2 year old wear her mask. I can't hold my hand over my toddlers mouth to ensure the mask stays put that's called child abuse! I was just berated some more about how ""If I'm traveling to another location I will have issues so be warned"" Ummm no I'm not traveling anywhere else and No, American Airlines and their awful employees were the ONLY ones I have had any issues with.  I will most definitely never fly American Airlines again, I will choose one of the many other airlines we have flown with while my daughter was 2 and were treated with kindness and help instead of constant targeting, berating, and any lack of compassion for a BABY!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Paying extra means nothing,"Literally as the title says. My wife and I paid extra to choose our seats as well as for extra legroom since I am a very tall individual. Additionally, my wife has a disease that requires her to have immediate access to the aisle. They have moved our seats multiple times and I’ve spoken to them about it just as many times. This last time they told me to read the conditions of the ticket, and I made the decision to never fly with them again. Choose them if you like, but they act as if our money is inconsequential during COVID when every airline is fighting for the next person’s dollar. I’d also go through your ticket conditions with a fine-toothed comb to see if legal action could be brought for false advertising and misinformation bordering on blatant lies."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Use another airline,"I paid for priority seating. When I went to ask the stewardess at the gate because I had no group number, she told me she wasn't answering questions and she'd help me when everyone was on the plane. I did not get the service I paid for and the employee was rude. I contacted the airline who refused me a partial refund. And they do not offer any alcoholic beverages unless you're in first class so be prepared to be treated like a second class citizen. I'd use another airline. I will not be using them again."
Date of travel: October 2021,40,There were a few hiccups but not too bad an experience despite COVID,"I booked my October flight to Athens in April 2021 and had a couple of hiccups along the way, although everything worked out in the end. For starters, the departure/arrival times changed literally within days of me purchasing my flight. Fortunately I was able to make the times work, although I had to make changes to my itinerary.While making my reservation, American offered the opportunity to make my fare refundable for an additional $200. I declined that offer, figuring it wasn't likely the fare would drop. That turned out to be a poor decision, because a few months later the price dropped by literally 50%. Had I gotten a refundable fare, I could have canceled my flight, gotten a full refund and booked again at half the price.One thing I DID pay for when making my reservation was a Main Cabin Extra seat. On the day of my flight while checking in at the airport, I saw that American had moved me to a middle seat in the back of the plane. I would have to pay an ADDITIONAL $200 if I wanted a Main Cabin Extra seat up front. I was annoyed, but agreed to pay it, opting for a seat in a row that appeared to be empty. That turned out to be money well spent because no one tried to move and I got the entire row to myself for the duration of the flight. Getting to lie flat and trying to sleep for the entire 10 hours and 20 minutes made a huge difference as we landed in Athens around 8 a.m. local time. I was very grateful that the flight attendants respected my desire to not be disturbed. It definitely helped that they could see my seat belt was fastened and I wore my face mask the entire time. I also downloaded and used the American Airlines' affiliated app ""VeriFly"" for my trip to Greece. It was very helpful on the way there, as American verified my vaccination certificate and ensured I completed the Passenger Locator Form (PLF) required by the Greek government for all incoming passengers. Getting it setup and finding my way around was a bit confusing at first, but a breeze once I completed everything on my checklist and was certified ready to fly.This was my first time flying internationally since COVID and I could tell that everyone, from the pilots and flight attendants to the passengers were trying to offer/have the best experience possible despite the circumstances. Given the uncertainty of variants and other viruses bound to develop in the future, enhanced protocols could very well be the new normal."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Ruined our plans . I was planning to go to vacation!,As a company you ruined all my plans !!!! With canceling flight don’t u think so you need pay all our expenses for hotel cancellations!!!  I hate you guys !!!
Date of travel: October 2021,10,The Big Screw,"American Airline changed the aircraft at last minute. I get that and understand that things happen. However, they bumped me from 1st class, shoved a 300 voucher in my face and rudely sent me on my way without any representative answering questiona I had about another flight. I am finished with American Airlines...Hello Delta!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Not a first class experience,"We flew AA Orlando-Washington-Buffalo in “first class” I’ve travelled first and premium with other airlines and got much more for my ticket. First there was no expedited security lane attached to the ticket which I have always had with other airlines. In Orlando we tried to enter the admirals club but were refused as our first class ticket apparently didn’t entitle us to that either!We got to board in group one and were given a drink and snack. When we got to our connecting flight in Washington, we started to board and our small case was taken off us, this was infuriating because we’d paid extra for these privelages but had to sit without our things while we watched some AA staff board as passengers with 3 pieces of luggage each! So we were 2 people with one small case and they had 3 things each that they could keep hold of. I’m guessing they didn’t pay for their seats either. Not only that but also people in coach were getting on with huge duffel bags and some had 2, it was a joke. Our plane had a problem so we had to get off and wait. The lady at the desk was getting annoyed with people asking her questions as if it was her who had been inconvenienced. We were told to wait “30” mins for another announcement every 30 mins for about 3 hours give or take then we eventually boarded another plane and got on our way. The delay is annoying but can’t be helped plus I believe they were trying their best. No one waiting was being aggressive about it, in fact it was quite comical near the end. Especially when they fixed the plane and then the crew timed out and skulked off in front of us. One staff member tried to tell us she wanted to go home just as much as us , yes dear but you are being paid to be here, this is your choice, we have paid $100s The AA staff that were passengers on our flight sat in the airport with no masks on the whole time we were waiting. Not a very good example in their uniforms. I won’t fly AA again, if I’m paying a premium price I expect a premium service so I’ll look elsewhere."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Horrible,They just keep packing these flights full. Not enforcing mask any type of cleanliness protocol at all. Not checking sizes of carry on baggage and leaving some people to check bags. Greedy airlines should start having more pressure to do better. I had to do 3 covid tests and be vaccinated to go where I was going and come home and the least they can do is freaking try..
Date of travel: September 2021,40,Traveled with cats,"Traveled with two cats this time, they stayed in the kennel and under the seat in front of us. The boarding process was smooth. But the seats were not adjustable, the entertainment was ok."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,AA,"People at check in doesnt help, horrible customer service at the airport as over the phone , and same with the website"
Date of travel: October 2021,20,No food on 6 hour flight to Maui,Told to BUY overpriced food in the Airport before we boarded. I paid $2200. for two tickets. Not even a prepackaged sandwich. Look at American Airlines earnings.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,TERRIBLE service at O’Hare,"Flying in from Mexico to O’Hare, my connecting flight was the next morning and they refused to re-check my bag since my flight was the next day. I was planning to stay at the airport because I didn’t want to get a hotel room and they told me there was nothing they could do to help me. If you can’t accommodate the flight then you shouldn’t offer those flight times. The staff at O’Hare airport were incredibly rude to me and wouldn’t even try to help me."
n/a,40,Handled a bad situation,"Our original flight ran into some issues.  First,  right at the time we were supposed to begin boarding they sent us all to a different terminal  (I'm assuming there was an issue with the plane). It was quite a hike,  but when we got there they announced that we would be boarding soon,  they just had to fix an issue with the lavatory. About an hour later they announced that they were looking for another plane, and a little bit agree that the flight was canceled altogether.  We were automatically revoked on a flight the next day,  but I got on the phone with an agent and she managed to get us on a flight to Atlanta and then switch us to another airline for the flight to cancun.  We only lost 5 hours of our vacation. Our luggage didn't make all the changes with us,  but it was delivered to our resort the next day.  All told,  it was a bad situation for everyone,  but they got us where we were going in a reasonable about of time."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,NOT IMPRESSED,Flew from Charlotte to San Francisco which was chaotic !!! Taking carry on bags at the gste to put in the hold - I have never experienced anything like it. A 5 5 hour flight and we were offered a cookie or pretzels!!! An insult. Will not travel with them again.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Never fly American Airlines,"We had a 3 hour lay over here in miami. Missed our connecting flight by 20 minutes due to ""a plane at our gate experiencing mechanical issues"" and no other gate to use. Took over an hour to get our bags from customs after multiple carasal changes, then had an hour wait through tsa again ran to our gate only to be told there was nothing they could do. Spent an hour on hold with customer service and 3 hours in line at the rebooking area to rebook another flight for us 24 hours after our flight was suppose to leave. Then we get a $24 food voucer to pay for food at an overpriced airport (again 24 hour delay). Booked at the run down trashy Marriott courtyard where the maids woke us up ""just to check"" ignoring the dnd. At no point did anyone ever apologize for our inconvenience or even offer any understanding for our side of this story. I WILL NEVER BOOK AMERICAN AIRLINES NOR WILL I VISIT MIAMI AIRPORT AGAIN."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Unprofessional Customer Service,"I was supposed to take off from LAX to TPA on October 21, 2021 at 9:30pm. However, 20 minutes before boarding we were told that the flight is delayed until 6am (which turned out to be a lie), because there were no pilots. We were told to call a number or wait in the lane for the customer service. I was unable to reach the customer service via phone (I had been on hold for lengthy amount of time) as such I kept on waiting in the line to the customer service at the airport. After 2 hours of waiting, I received a text message that the 6am flight I was supposed to take was cancelled until 9:30pm the next day, and I could either accept it or chose one with ridiculous connections (i.e. fly from LAX to Seattle and from Seattle to Tampa or fly from LAX to JFK and from JFK to Tampa). I ended up waiting in the line for 4 hours to interact with very unprofessional and impolite customer service representatives. We were all told that their system is ""down"" as such, we must book hotels on our own and ""try"" applying for a refund when the ""time comes"". We were also offered to fly standby with horrible connections, since there are no tickets available; however, I could go to the website and see that tickets were still available, which proves that American Airlines was trying to sell the remaining tickets while keeping us on a standby. One of the ladies waiting with me had an autistic son (she told me he was); she was denied help with hotel and told that her only option is 9:30pm flight the next day. If she could not book a hotel, she had to worry about her son wondering around the airport. Other ladies waiting in the line had kids with them as well. They were also told to figure out hotels on their own or sleep at the airport.Further, one of the customer service representatives in her conversation with a customer said, “American Airlines have never gotten back to pre-COVID conditions, we do not have enough people, we have less flights”. There is NOT a single company that went back to pre-COVID conditions. If you do not have enough pilots, why do you schedule flight you cannot make?!While listening to all of those unprofessional and impolite responses from American Airlines staff, I booked my own hotel, found myself a flight with Delta, and had to request a refund on my own (currently under American Airlines review). I was forced to stay in LA due to the actions of this unprofessional company. I (and other customers) was disrespected by American Airlines customer service and received no help, no food vouchers, and no help booking hotels. This is unacceptable behavior. There is no way, American Airlines did not know that there are no pilots until 20 minutes before boarding. Words cannot express how dissatisfied I am. I will do all that I can to make sure I do not fly American Airlines again."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE IVE EVER DEALT WITH,"Today (October 23, 2021) we were headed back to Ohio, leaving from Maui. The morning of the flight they moved the time of the flight from 6:10pm to 8:50pm Maui time. We had to turn in our rental car at 5pm. When we got to the airport at 4:15 they wouldn't let us check our bags until 3 hours before loading time (loading time was 8:05pm so we had to wait in no air conditioning until 5:05pm to check our bags. Then we get through security and are sitting at the gate when they announce at 5:45pm that our flight 116 is canceled. So they told us over the intercoms to get our bags and go to the check-in counter. We go down to the carousel where the bags for our flight is suppossed to be and our bags are nowhere to be found. After waiting around the baggage carousel for 30 minutes we still see nothing. So we go to the check-in counter where there is a HUGE line. We waited in this line for 2 HOURS and in that time they have only helped 3 customers. I walk up and asked one of the customers what they were doing and they were handing out vouchers for food and hotel stays. It was taking on average 45 minutes per customer and we were about 30 people back in line so we booked a flight through Alaskan airlines and they got us back home on a Sunday, October 24th. This is the most unexceptable experience ive ever had with an airline. We were standing in no air conditioning for 4 hours in 85 degree weather, had to go through security twice, and not once did we even get a simple apology. I hope this company goes under so they can be forced to stop screwing over their customers. Will never fly with this company again and will vehemently campaign against this airline to anyone who will listen."

Date of travel: October 2021,10,Never fly with AA - go to Delta or someone else total crap and unsafe airline,"I've made the mistake over and over flying with these d&*ks and now it stops. They constantly have delays due to mechanical problems that have made me think that must have Jiffy Lube techs doing aircraft works. Something is always broken causing delays that should not really happen with a hub-based routing system. No comps or anything when this happens. I was comp'd a hotel, and $100 for food by Delta when an delay happened. AND - I was put on a first-class flight for the replacement leg. This crap American Airlines should never be traveled on put you r money somewhere else and drive them out of business. They need to crawl back into the hole they crawled out of and die."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,I dislike flying these days,What a train wreck! Needless to say.. over crowded! the original flight was delayed because of reported maintenance delays. (Staffing Problems!) Consequently arrival of equipment to SJD was delayed and equated to a 4 hour delay in leaving SJD. therefore a impossible connecting flight from DFW to DTW. Necessitating a layover hotel in DFW (Not a comp.) and the meal rations coupon wasn't accepted in 3 food vendor/stores at the American Airlines Terminal... I still have the vouchers (unused).Flying commercial airlines used to be fun.... now it is just screwed-up. Talking to a waiting airline crew I found out how abusive the American Airlines is to the crew... do you know they only get paid when the airplane door is closed until it is opened again. all the delays don't count towards the crew compensation.For you older folks... the airlines were far better before deregulated!!!!

Date of travel: October 2021,20,Rude flight attendant,"The worst service. The flight attendant was a very rude man in his 50ties, he seems Argentinian ( his accent). He was rude with me during all the flight. I tried to keep calm and said "" hasta luego"". He would ignore and would pretend he didn' t see me, obstructing my way to get out of the plane looking at me with disgust. Please, train your employees in hospitality 101. He should not treat another Hispanic like me in this way."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worse customer service ever!,"Airlines wonder why people are so frustrated these days. It’s because airline employees (or at least the ones we came in contact with during this trip) are less than professional. From the jet bridge not working and watching elderly people struggle to get up stairs to get into a plane while trying to haul their own personal carry on items (while employees watch them as they struggle), to a flight attendant who physically grabbed me while trying to board, to delayed flights, inconsistent procedures (we missed our connection…with no explanation as to why we were delayed..with 8 minutes still on the clock before take off but doors shut and the employees refused to open but while trying to get into a standby flight they had no time limit. And the “manager” for that team told me he could do what he wanted and the accused me of being inappropriate and threatens to take my flight privileges away on American Airlines. Apparently they get to threaten to ban you from an airline if you don’t suck up what they tell you all while smiling and taking it.   Frankly I see why people are frustrated and to be honest, he doesn’t have to take away my privilege of flying American Airlines. My blood pressure can’t handle the employees attitudes. We have been part of the million mile club for years before moving to a location that our preferred airline doesn’t service. We thought we would give American Airlines a shot at our business but for our business to not be appreciated and I will never be threaten by an over ego “Manager” who by the way refused to give me his employee info…go figure. There are to many airlines out there to be tested as if your are imposing on the employees. Just my two cents."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Almost killed us, passenger was escorted via medics and hospitalized. Pilot sat behind us after, lying and complaining.","They claimed they didn’t “see that cloud coming” and had the plane hit massive turbulence. Went completely dead air for a moment as everyone’s bags went airborne, spilling food, drinks and pens everywhere. Afterwards we had to wait about an hour and a half for our next flight, completely worried when we figured out our next flight involved the same pilots. During this wait the pilot is called by multiple people clearly involved with the airport, and he’s currently lying in every question he replies with. He said no passengers were scared or upset yet as a passenger I very clearly remember multiple people screaming, as well as nearly everyone saying it was one of the worst flights we had been on. I’m posting this review immediately after, since I have nothing better to do for 30 minutes until I have to experience  the same pilot fly us again. Genuinely scared he’s going to kill us since he seems to think it’s a joke, as he laughs about his supervisors to the flight attendant. The least I can do is say something about this lunatic."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Nightmare and American Airlines Scam,"Horrifying Airline!  Do not fly American! Cancelled my departing flight.. had to pay $650 more to take Southwest.. the round trip portion of the ticket was still good thru American and was still booked.. hopped on this American airline to head home and now there was a problem with a light bulb. It took 5 men to remove a panel and a bulb. It made me late for my layover flight to home so they took me off of the plane to another and said I was booked to home. When this plane landed we couldn't get off for over an hour because there wasn't an employee available to set up the unboarding equipment. Then when I went to check my next flight To home I was told that there wasn't a flight booked home for me.  I had to argue with a very cold, cruel, rude employee to get it straightened out.  Then when it came time to board on that flight a man came on the loud speaker stating that there would be a delay because of engines overheating and a mechanic had to do some maintenance!! What a mess!! Then, after I arrived home I called to get a refund for the flight that was cancelled. They said no refund and that I flew on the flight that was cancelled by them. When I asked how that was possible she wouldn't explain how I could've flown on a cancelled flight. This is a scam. Take the money, cancel the flight and refuse the refund!! Beware!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Elyse Lindquist,"What a horrible experience. Flight from Grenada was delayed so long connections in Miami were missed. I was told to get an UBER to a hotel they assigned. The hotel was in a bad part of Miami and no place for a woman traveling alone. The airline offered no toiletries bags for any of us, something other airlines will do without question when luggage isn’t available. The no-tell Motel they sent me to was so bad there were no toiletries available, not even soap in the bathroom. I left the hotel and UBERed back to the airport where I slept until my flight the next morning. Now, American is refusing to reimburse me for the UBER from and back to the hotel, something they promised they would do. I will never give them a penny of my money again. Horrible airline."

Date of travel: August 2021,10,American Airlines (AA): A Huge Mistake,My wife & I paid 4x the price of economy on AA in order to be treated to 1st class…. This AA experience made us feel that we were “Cheated!”Especially when  Compared to a 1st Class trip we made last month on a competing airline. The following is our assessment of AA compared to the competing airline:1) access to their 1st class lounge - DENIED2) drinks upon entering the aircraft’s cabin - NO3) drinks & snack after reaching altitude - drinks ONLY 4) hot meal - NO (cold sandwich-mostly bread/ little meat) 5) drinks & snack after meal - NO6) spacious reclining seats w/ foot rest - NOOur conclusion of American Airlines (AA): Don’t waste you money
Date of travel: October 2021,10,American is probably the worst airline in the world.,"American was delayed for first leg, got on time to next connection but American pretty much shut the door in my face and did not let me in.  Of course, the next flight got delayed (no surprise).

After 30 minutes with him, he came to the realisation that I had to use the flight LHR - SJO - LHR as that was what my original flight was?? Utterly insane. SJO - LHR - SJO just doesn't cut it, unfortunately. They also only give you 1 year from when you BOOKED the flight, not from when the cancelled flight was to rebook. Absolute joke of a company - the first, and only, airline, that I've ever truly said these words:I'll never fly or book with them again."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,American Airlines v Delta Airlines ..  No Contest,"My Wife and I just completed a “Bucket List” 49th Anniversary Viking River Cruise Trip that was exceptional!  We were originally scheduled to fly British Airways to Budapest however that was changed to an American flight and then finally to a Delta flight. I was happy in that a number of Friends have told me how nice Delta is v. American. I have not flown Delta in a number of years opting for American because we were primarily flying out of AA Hubs in Philadelphia and Orlando. Boy were they right!  From Baggage Check in to Friendliness to Cleanliness and Flight Attendant Attitude, Delta wins hands down.  We were flying First Class so there was access to the Delta Club in both Orlando and Atlanta as well as the KLM Club in Amsterdam.  They were clean / airy, the Reception was extremely friendly, the choices of food and beverages was very good, windows clean and seating comfortable. Check In was a breeze and the cubical seating was clean and comfortable with lots of at seat storage space.  The seats were highly adjustable.  We were on an Airbus 380 series.  There was a mechanical issue with our flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam which caused a 1 ½ hour delay in departure.  Someone had flushed a toy on the previous flight that was stuck in a critical valve for offloading the toilet waste.  This was discovered after everyone was on board and the decision made to remain boarded rather than deplane.  The captain kept everyone informed of their progress in the remediation with factual information sprinkled with a little humor.  The flight attendants made everyone on the plane as comfortable as possible. When underway, the cabin service was great, the food upscale restaurant quality and the entertainment selections were current.  I cannot sleep on planes so I was able to notice the flight attendants were checking on everyone every 15 minutes.  They also attended to the toilets every 30 minutes.  The wake – up process was “gentle” and well executed.  The entertainment headsets were left at our seats on deplaning. The delay meant we had missed our connection in Amsterdam however, after passing through the Immigration Check, when we arrived at the KLM Club, they had our tickets waiting (same seats same class) for us on the next flight to Budapest departing in 1 ½ hours.  Turned out to be a FUN flight as one of the flight attendants was on her last flight with KLM and moving on to a new career.  Everyone was celebrating her the entire flight. Older model 737 but clean and comfortable.  Offboarding and baggage claim were easy in Budapest.Our return flight was on an American 780 series aircraft.  We were first in line to check in on an early morning flight with all documentation ready.  The person at the check in counter had obviously had a rough night and was not a happy individual.  That attitude continued when our boarding passes were printed and had split up my Wife and I on a 10+ hour flight from Amsterdam to Dallas.  The reasoning given was the captain had rights to one of our seats.  I’ve flown numerous international business / first  flights and never had that happen.  The check in person was borderline rude stating that was the policy and we could change to the last row (next to a galley and restroom) or stay in the current separated seats.  We went for the last row so we could be together.  It turned out to be a good move in that the noise up front from meal preparation and utensils was very loud.  By the way, the captain never availed himself / herself to that seat the entire flight.  There was no priority loading and it was a free for all line up to board the plane.  No attention to Group Number at all.  The plane obviously had not been cleaned thoroughly from the previous flight and the overhead bins were dirty on the outside as well.  My seat had popcorn and other detritus from the previous flight in the side of the cushion. The food was the worst I have encountered on an International flight (that's 40 years).  My steak was dried out and very tough .. could not eat it.  My wife’s was the same.  For the flight attendants, it was as if it was a chore to provide service to passengers.  The attendants checked up on passengers at one-hour intervals with a walk by (but no attention to empty drinks or trash) unless someone used the call button.  The toilets were not serviced the entire flight.  180 degrees from Delta.  The Wake-Up process consisted of turning the cabin lights on full.  The flight attendants retrieved the entertainment headsets 30 minutes prior to landing.  It was as if the passengers were going to steal them ..  not a good vibe.  On most domestic flights, the headsets are retrieved no more than 10 minutes prior to landing.Back on US soil, the Admiral’s Club in Dallas was very good.  Reception was friendly, seating areas clean, typical selection of food and the seats comfortable.  Our 737 to Orlando was clean and the flight attendant was very good.  American has always been a step below others on International Carriers but acceptable when garnering points.  With our experience on this International Flight, we will begin exploring Delta on Domestic Flights and opt for Delta over American on any International Flights from now on.I am an American Platinum Elite Pro Member and a member of the International Travel Writers and Photographers Alliance."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Can't Cancel Flight,"Unlike Southwest, where you cancel a flight no questions asked.  AA does not allow you to cancel a Basic Economy flight.  I booked a trip to the Bahamas thinking by November Covid-19 will be pretty much over.  This was not the case.  Now starting Oct 1, Bahamas is requiring a Medical VISA.  Of Course, AA will not refund/credit my ticket.  They also changed one leg of my flight, and still won't refund/credit me.  I have nothing but problems when I travel AA.  I'm done with AA.  I spent 2 hours today getting passed around their customer service.  Worst experience ever."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Just like any airline. All about their pockets,"Flight was delayed 2 hours from a tray table that wouldn't stay up. Someone offered tape. The attendant said it's ""special tape"". I feel for the connecting flights in Dallas that I'm certain were missed. Same flight. I called to return home a day early. First call was 1 hour 48 minutes on hold. I hung up. I called back, on and off hold while the lady tried to ""see what she could do for me"". Over 20 minutes later she offers that I pay $390 to change the flight. Both of the flights on this roundtrip itinerary were CHANGED by them. No discounts, nothing. And when I ask to change, it takes 2.5 hours to ask, and they want to stick it to me with $390 bill. All airlines are awful. In recent years I attempt to stop traveling as to not give them any money."
Date of travel: August 2021,30,Frustrating Rescheduling Policy,"I booked a round trip direct flight from BOS to LAX ensuring both flights were direct and during the day specifically because we were flying with 2 small children and didn't want to worry about layovers or flying overnight. Our flight was originally operated by American Airlines, but partnered with Jet Blue. A month or two after purchasing our tickets we received an email notification that the flight was canceled and that all the direct flight options on their site were now being operated by Jet Blue so you were unable to book them as a rescheduled flight per their policy. Very frustrating as I could have originally book the flight through Jet Blue and then wouldn't have had an issue with rescheduling. Felt a bit like a bait and switch and we ended up having to take a flight with a layover on the way home which was very disappointing. The flights themselves were uneventful. Wish they had more snack options given the flight is so long (Even for purchase), but thankfully since we had kids we stocked up in advance at the airport."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Cancelled flight,"In July we had an early morning flight. AA had 3 flights to CLT that morning about an hour apart. At some point, the night before - after we'd gone to bed, our flight was cancelled. In the morning (4am) we discovered the texts advising us our flight was cancelled and they couldn't rebook us.  We were heading to Bermuda for a cruise, only one flight a day, so rebooking later wouldn't have helped. We had to call the cruise line and, luckily, they rebooked us with no hassle.  This time we drove the 6 hours to CLT the day before.  We got to the airport 4 hours ahead, obtained our seat assignment and went to the gate.  Boarding started, but our group was never called.  We asked what was going on and were told the plane had a weight limit so we couldn't board.  Other people were still boarding. Then we were told they'd given our seats to someone else since we hadn't checked in. We proved we had, they wouldn't budge. We finally started taking names and pictures of the gatekeepers telling them we were going to sue AA.  They got on the phone, talked in hush tones with their backs to us, and we were finally ""allowed"" to board. Once on board everything was great.  On our return flight they attempted to take my husbands oxygen generator away saying there wasn't room in the overheads.  We forcefully explained that since they allowed other passengers to have multiple oversized bags board without checking anything, they could allow his one personal carry-on (8""x14""). They relented.  Again, once on board, all went well."
Date of travel: February 2021,20,Terrible Customer Service,"I booked multiple flights this year through AA, service was average but it seems like skymiles were not applied. Tried calling customer relations, on hold for 2 hours (estimated wait was 60 minutes) and they simply disconnected the phone. Very frustrating and negligent."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Do not book American airline if you are flying international,"I feel like I have to share this I am about to travel internationally I have membership with aa so I try to book with them as much as I can, but It was a mistake flying internationally we all know how important it is to bring gifts to our family back home all international flights have two bags check in except american airline and it's $100 to add another bag for international travelers who can only go home once a year this is very important to know I would have paid same amount to japan  airlines or Korean Air with two check in back if I only realized it right away! Lesson learn no international flights using aa"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,SCAM caompney,this is the worst airlines to work with this is not the first time it happened while filling my information and ready to pay the prices doubled !! that's a scam ! it like dealing with random cheap airline flights !!! be careful the price you see its not the price you will be paying !!! worst company to flight with anyways !!!
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Why Pay Extra,"Booked a flight from Phoenix to Green Bay with a layover in Chicago for January 2022.  When booking it was an late afternoon flight which worked great considering it will be New Years Day.  I always pay for upgraded seats and choose the seats we are paying for.  3 days later email comes stating flight has been changed from late afternoon to early morning flight.  Great 6 hours earlier!  Then find my seat that I paid good money for has been pushed back 5 rows back!  If I wanted to sit 5 rows back I would have choose that, but that's not what I paid for.  Airline customer service let me know that although you choose and paid for a certain seat, they can change your seat and sit you somewhere else.  Why am I choosing a seat then?  It's bad enough passengers need to change their plans to accomodate a flight now 6 hours earlier than booked for, but passengers also can just be shoved where ever the computer puts them on the flight regardless if you paid for a certain seat.  Bad customer service, horrible impression for American Airline.  If American needs to change planes then put the passengers in the seat they paid for!  If I wanted to leave 6 hours earlier and sit 5 rows back, I;m pretty sure that is what I would have booked.  Thanks American for telling me  what my plans are.  Very disappointing."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Flying Ohare to Ft Myers,We leave Saturday the 23 of October. I noticed the flight this weekend was canceled. I am a little concerned. Anyone know anything?
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Great Customer Service,"The average one star review on here is comical. People choose the lowest price and then blame the airline when there is a problem. Delays and cancellations are always a possibility on any carrier, so you have to have options. I was flying Philadelphia-Charlotte-Myrtle Beach. I check my flight status often throughout the day and I thought I'd have no issues with my connecting flight. I landed in Charlotte early, but the AA app notified me my Myrtle Beach flight was cancelled. I went to the service counter and the rep was able to put me on a confirmed flight to Florence which is about an hour away from my destination. I've been put on standby in situations like this on other airlines, but the awesome rep got me the last seat on the plane. No airline is perfect, but American delivered."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Crew didn’t show up,I hope this crew is fired.  All passengers are waiting for a flight and the crew doesn’t show up.  Passengers time is valuable.  They have wasted mine as I was at the airport.  No one cares!!   I have over a million miles on this airline and I’m not going to be loyal anymore.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,American Airlines Suck,"I will NEVER fly American again when I go on trips! First of all when I was going to Jamaica the AA flight leaving out of Philly heading to Jamaica was delayed 2.5 hours...how you ask? Well there was a gas smell on that plane so they turned around to Philly,  then we had to wait for a whole new crew to board the plane they got us. Coming home from Jamaica flying into Charlotte AA canceled this flight...due to no flight attendants!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terrible - cancelling seats that are paid for!,"Made my reservations in May 2021 for an Oct 2021 flight. Had 2 first class seats confirmed and paid for!! Got message in July that they changed our flight to another flight with a 7 hr layover! Original flight had less than 1 hr layover. Rebooked on a different flight with better layover but worse departure time, but had to pay $30/ticket to do so. Received confirmation that we still had 2 first class seats reserved. Then when I got my ""check in"" email this morning (Oct), I find that I only have 1 seat confirmed. Gave me some BS about sending out an email to me about an aircraft change which necessitated us bidding for a seat. I did not receive such an email and why should I have to bid for something I already paid for?? I have talked to a rep twice and first one said I will have 2 guaranteed seats in first class, but she couldn't assign it nor could I choose it online, it would have to be done at the ticket counter. Got nervous when I rec'd an email asking me to check in to a different later flight, so I called back and was told yes I was on my original flight, but my seats are not guaranteed!!! I've paid for these seats and when I booked back in May, we were the first ones--we had our choice of any seat. This is BS. Is this a way for AA to make more money from us? I hate flying and now I hate American Airlines with a passion!  I agree that they are liars!!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Bad customer service,"I’m hard to get upset but long story short. First flight from Memphis to Dallas was cancelled and wanted me to take a route that was going to take me to 5 different airports. And there is no way but they scheduled me a earlier flight to charlotte so I drove to the airport and that flight was cancelled. Talked to the people at the ticketing area and they told me they insured me a plane going to Dallas 7:30 am so we waited and when we was getting on the plane they told us they only had 2 seats. But I had a family of 3. they asked if I could split  me, my son and my wife can get one way late that day. I was like no way you told us that we’re insured to be on this plane. But no the lady at the desk said we “misunderstood” doesn’t make sense though because they’ve already placed the luggage on the airplane. And the employees did not try to help us one bit and decided to put the blame all on us. We still don’t have our luggage and we called and called and no ones picked up this company has my luggage but is not informing on where it’s at or when I’m getting it. DONT USE THIS AIRLINE."
Date of travel: June 2021,40,Great Flight from Mexico City to Miami,"Guess in Business you always enjoy a flight. The trip from MEX to MIA was short, about 3.5 hours. the seat was quite comfortable, but inflight entertainment could be much better. Food was a bottle of water, cookies and another treat. Not what you expect in business as breakfast on a 6am flight."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Mrs. Darryl McDonald Glebelhouse,Buyer beware if you ride on this Airline and you have a disability the people of the airline will make you walk in Charlotte Airport they will not give you any assistance both going and coming I was not offered any assistance none was made available to me I suffer from COPD asthma and I have a pacemaker I was made to walk very long distance from one plane to the other while pushing my wheelchair this is very uncomfortable for me and it made me sick on my flight I and very upset with this Airline they have lost in my business and will not be fine with them ever again! When called to talk to the lady she said there is nothing I can do and said we're sorry that you weren't given I am very disappointed with this Airline not giving me the assistance so much needed!!
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terrible booking experience - liars!,"Booking with a travel credit, couldn’t do online - the website said “call us”. The line was 4h long to the Customer Service. Then a Customer service representative on the phone did confirmed the booking was made and the seats booked.I never received an email confirmation. Two hours later the booking was showing “on hold”. I had to call again to clarify. Another 4h wait.Turned out the booking was never made. And now the price has gone up!Worst behavior of the Customer service. Irresponsible."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Stealing flight credit and evoucher,"American Airlines is the worst. During Covid you idiots cancelled my flights, would not give me a refund, and only issued flight credits. Now you will not take my evoucher and flight credit and used my credit card. Bad customer service, bad system, terrible flights, terrible employees, ridiculous rules, and no integrity. After this last flight, I will NEVER will fly with you again. You suck!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Horrible,If possible do not ! Fly with this crappy airline!They have no customer service! They take for ever to help you (2 hour wait in line)  and when they do get to you....they don't try and help you at all. They just give you attitude! Stay away and use your money with another airline!
Date of travel: October 2021,10,The company  cancelled my husband ticket and requested double payment and differed  date.,"absolutely terrible and fraudulent activity, full review and will file a complaint with  FAA is coming."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Great flight,"Great flight, no problems.  Crew was wonderful, seats comfortable, well organized, clean, and safe.  I would take this flight again."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Complete failure,"It’s not my first rodeo with American and how awful their delays and cancellations can be. Yesterday was actually impressive. Fayetteville to Dallas to ohare to LaGuardia to Nashville. When I lived in Dallas and American was the only option, I put up with it. Now, I’m done. Never again. Complete insanity."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst Flight Experience Ever,"Delays, delays, more delays. Most didn't care. Like another day at the office. Is this a reflection of what it's like to work at American Airlines? Customer service agents speaking about wanting to go home after just starting their work day?  One person gave excellent service - Christopher in Austin.  No one else seemed to care that this Friday caused is to miss our flight home. Having to layover in another city - with no empathy for those of us asking for our luggage at this unanticipated overnight stay. Wouldn't it be prudent to build into customer service procedures to pull the luggage on the side for those who have to stay overnight. It's been 1.5 hours waiting for luggage. Still waiting. No seats at this airport"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Robbery,I would never fly AA ever again. I paid 30 dollars for my checked bag was 8 pounds over they charged me an additional 100. I think that's damn wrong of them. Would never fly or recommend my family to fly with them ever again. Just robbery in these hard times with covid. I understand your over weight but if 50 pounds is 30 dollars why is 8 pounds over cost an extra 100. Ridiculous. You pay to learn. AA sucks
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Basically the worst airline ever.,"They are terrible at accommodating anything. I spent an hour today getting them to rebook me for a flight that I missed because of them, and they spent the majority of the time telling me what options were available that would basically take me the longest time ever. Any communication as to how to go about booking that would make and semblance of sense wasn't there. It's as if they cannot possibly humanize any part of air travel, especially as everything else has become more complex."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Airlines  that doesn't show care for their  customers  should be Out of business,"I usually don't like to do Negative reviews, but you need to hear about this experience.  I always always use Delta. I flew from Atlanta to Las Vegas in Delta my sister Book my flight back to Atlanta in AMERICA AIRLINES, I said, are you sure?  Ok, let's give it a try.  We had a great time on our vacations Tour but on the way back we were supposed to fly at 3:30 pm once we check-in when we're told that the fly had over 3 hrs delay, then at 7:30 PM then we were informed that the flight was canceled. we were 4 adults and 1 minor, one adult was 83 years old and 2 o the others, had some medical conditions,  and at that time we weren't prepared for anything but just get on the plane and fly to Atlanta.  after hrs and hrs of waiting in the line of Customers service spot, there was nothing they could do,   they offer us a possible fly 3 days later, with the risk of more delays or cancelations, No hotels available in the area and no rental cars, so we decide to rent a large SUV for 2 days,  and pay 3600 dollars for a local pick up and out of state drop off,  not to mention the gas when have to use along the road, so I had to drive 27 hrs straight to  Atlanta. we had a great driving trip, it was better to what I thought, Thanks to American Airlines. so... if you want to experience something similar, go ahead and buy a American Airlines ticket.  or Frontier, or Spirit. I was so sorry for customers seated there at the departure gate waiting for a good answer. they had no clue what was going on. now the truth is that you know what happened this Monday at the southwest airport, I'm rating American Airlines with 1 star, or should I Rate your President Biden with cero stars for situations like that? but, please don't forget to get your covit 19 vaccines."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terror in the skys,"We were scheduled to fly from Hilton Head to Cleveland (connecting through CLT today, October 14th.  Our flight was scheduled to leave at 2:38 arriving in Cleveland at 6:25.  Our nightmare started when our flight from HHH to CLT was delayed 30 minutes, then 60 minutes, then 90 minutes….they never went past 90 minutes, but in fact we finally got an airplane and pushed back from the gate at about 4:00 OM, nearly 2 1/2 hours late.  We were able to book a later flight to Cleveland leaving at 6:10, arriving at 7:40….not too bad.  When we pushed back, the morons at the gate counted the passengers wrong, so we sat on the tarmac just outside the gate for 20 minutes while they tried to figure out where 2 extra passengers came from….total morons….clueless.  That 20 minutes delay put us on the ground at 5:45.  Then we started rolling to the gate…still had a chance, but there was a plane parked at our gate, so we sat for another 25 minutes on the tarmac at CLT.  By the time we got to the gate, our second flight was gone.  Now our only choice is to sit at the airport in masks for 6 hours waiting for a midnight flight, and there is no first class available, even though I paid for first class. Talking to customer service…nothing we can do, if we get you home within 24 hours of your scheduled arrival, we pay for nothing.  And I am out the cost of the first class tickets.   Sitting here right now.  We will be lucky to be home by 1:45 AM and I have meetings at 8:30.  And we were blessed with an $82 dinner of 2 crappy salads.  American Airlines does not give a crap about their customers.  In addition to losing 7 hours of my life and the crappy $82 dinner, I will have to pay a cab double because it will be after midnight.Avoid American Airlines at all costs. They suck beyond words and they DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU!!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Passenger,Very rude and unprofessional staffHad better experiences in 3rd world countries Please avoid American airline at any cost
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Waste of time,Never fly with American Airlines again! Everyone thats complaining in the reviews are real. Do do not fly with them. We waited 4hours in the plane and then they canceled our flight. Had to reschedule all of the flights. Now we in the plane again about to leave then the captain said we have to come back for one person. After being late for an hour already. Pay the extra dollar. If you are on leave i suggest do not take american airlines. Cause its a waste of time.

Date of travel: October 2021,50,Customer service,I had the absolute worst time booking these tickets I couldn’t do it online because things were not working it was awful. I spent over three hours on the phone with multiple customer service reps and nobody would help me properly. Then I got one rat who was absolutely amazing! Her name is cinnamon and she finally help me she did what all the other reps told me they couldn’t do and I hung up happy. I told her I would take a survey after the call but the call disconnected so here is my go in with you a cinnamon and customer service
Date of travel: October 2021,30,Just fly delta,"I’m military and was taking a trip home for leave and decided to go through American because it was the cheapest with the least amount of stops. Flying from Japan can get expensive and my flight wasn’t to long, and was decently priced (compared to others). I just selected random seats because typically I don’t care. But when I went to get on my flight first they pulled me to the side and rechecked my bags/swiped my hands and feet causing me to be the last person to board (I’ve had stuff done to me at security but never as I was boarding). I get on the flight which had quite a few people and was stuck in the middle seat in the back.. wouldn’t be a big deal if it was a full plane but it wasn’t.. I asked if I could move to one of the five back rows they had blocked off and they said no it’s for the crew members/they were trying to keep them sanitized.. i was confused but asked if I could just move anywhere so I didn’t have to sit in between two people on a 14 hour flight. They did move me which I was thankful for. When it was time for food or drinks or snacks I got skipped twice. I wasn’t asleep or anything just got walked passed. I had to ask each time if I could get water or dinner. The staff was okay. Slightly rude but Honestly that didn’t bother me. I didn’t really have a comfortable flight and I hate asking for things and being a bother. Just fly delta lol. They’re always nicer, they have no issues moving you (I’ve been upgraded a few times since I’m military. But I don’t ever expect to be upgraded.) I never feel like an inconvenience. I never get skipped. Even if I’m asleep they just drop the snack off at my table for when I wake up. The flight wifi was 0-10. I couldn’t check emails, send messages, do honestly anything.. I don’t get why aa claims free wifi if it won’t even work lmao. (I’ve had this issue on my flight back as well). My flight back was wayyy less packed and I did have the row to myself. Again tho I was skipped for drinks once, and while I was asleep they handed out snacks. And instead of asking if I needed anything I asked if I could have a snack and they responded “didn’t you get one” and I said “no I must of been asleep” and the lady rudely says “oh well usually they sit it at your seat if you’re asleep… i guess I’ll give you an extra.” And extra what lmao. I never got one 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ I will not be flying American again.I didn’t bring up the delays because those don’t really have anything to do with the flight and I didn’t mind sitting there just waiting. I knew that wasn’t their fault but my flight was delayed about an hour and a half."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst ever! Please don’t book,Worst airline!  Company decided last min to change aircraft so we didn’t get seats!  Had to cancel our whole trip
Date of travel: October 2021,10,No better than budget airline!,"Aircraft are old and worn out. Technology is behind the times. Cannot connect wi-fi and no infotainment TVs in headrests. Plug in for phone is USB only and will not work with most up to date phones. Took two aircraft. 1st one was dirty and cramped. Second one smelled like a toilet, was dirty, and not worth $1200 for 5 people. Will be taking Alligiant Airlines next time. Much more friendly, clean, on time, and a third of the price. I forgot to mention checked bags are an additional $40. Don't waste your money on American junk airlines."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Customer Service is TRASH!,"I paid for premium economy tickets. I changed my flights and was told by an agent that I would still have said premium economy tickets. When I checked in at the airport I received coach tickets and didn't get any money back for the premium I paid. When I tried contacting customer relations for American Airlines, they routed me to refunds. When I contacted refunds they told me I need to contact customer relations. PATHETIC."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,American Airlines owes me money!,Horrible experience. I fly frequently and I only have issues when I fly with American Airline. Currently Ive been trying to get a refund on baggage for a flight that was canceled about 6 months ago. I've sent multiple emails and have been told that someone will get back to me eventually. Well it's been 6 months and I want my money!Not to mention that our flight experience was canceled multiple times and eventually we had to fly with a different airline. It literally was delayed for two days. Literally went back to the airport 3 times to be turned away and have to come back later. And no one at the desk cared at all!THE ABSOLUTE WORST COMPANY!!!
Date of travel: October 2021,40,"1st leg of trip from New Orleans to Rochester, NY 10/07","Although crowded, everything was on time and the attendants were pleasant.There was room in the overhead for my carry-on bag, the second leg to Rochester had no room and had to gate check my bagIt appeared all the passengers were were complying with wearing masks, so no issues there."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst Airline,"Trip advisor:This was a second attempt to use American in the last two years.  The first was so incredibly bad but this trip I needed a quick direct flight.  Today’s flight was delayed, delayed again—bc of a busted toilet which ultimately they couldn’t fix it, finally got another plane and we actually boarded, pulled away from the gate and were told they were over their “duty time” and could no longer navigate the plane.  20 minutes on board until they could return to the gate.  I’m now on a two and a half hour flight that should’ve arrived over 8 hours ago.  In airport for 12 hours, voucher given for $12 toward food with no open restaurants.  There are 7 ppl on this flight.  7.  No compensation for this.  Lost my hotel and car reservation bc of uncertainty if this flight would happen at all.  If I could give all zeros I would. The staff—that they do not deserve—were gracious and apologetic.  First flight under Covid and Covid had zilch to do with what is clearly lousy infrastructure and management.  To boot, it wasn’t cheap: $600+."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Double-charging of checked luggage.,"If you are going to take advantage of curb-side check in, do NOT choose the option to pay for a checked bag. They will make you pay again curbside or they won’t check your bag. Then, unless you want to spend hours and hours trying to get in touch with a customer service rep, forget the refund. Just another big company making hundreds of millions of dollars by screwing its customers."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Lost bags,Do yourselves a favor do not travel American Airlines.  Very disorganized at Vegas Airport.  Then we get  to Philly Airport but our luggage is still in Vegas . To make matters worse our car keys are in our luggage.  We live 2 hours from airport.  Will never travel this airline. Will read other reviews on what ever airline I choose.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Poorly run,Garbage. Delayed flight 3 times because they have run down planes. Finally switched the flight to a new plane. Poorly maintained planes. Fly with another company.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Their mistake cost me,"We're flying from New York City to Palm springs, bought our tickets, paid for a flight change on the return trip. Got the Palm springs, no problem. 10 days later I'll return back was not allowed to board the plane with no explanation given. Panicking, since we could get no response from American airlines, we purchased new tickets. After frustrating 12-hour wait we got back to New York and I contacted customer service. They told me that we will considered hidden ticket passengers and that's why they canceled our fight. When I explained that we had paid an additional $98 for each ticket to change the time I was met with the same response. After many emails back and forth with Adrian Treet, she she made what she considered was a huge gesture of good faith by returning the unused portion of the tickets we had already paid for. Without any apology for the heartache and ordeal that they had put us through, they gave us back what they took from us illegally. The last time I checked when you pay for something you're supposed to receive it. As a service industry I was treated poorly and they made no effort whatsoever to make me feel like a valued customer.I wrote to The CEO of customer service, and never even received the courtesy of a response. They literally couldn't care less about their customers."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,I bought business class,"I bought upgraded seating for my flight but when I when to the desk they said I was in economy still, I was put in between 2 people and I'm a pretty big dude, I wasted 70 dollars on upgraded seats that I didn't even get"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Total rip off, do not trust for business","Booked a direct flight, checked in over 2hrs early, and paid to check in 2 bags. One bag made it...the other they never even bothered to put on the plane!  I travel a LOT and typically very laid back.  Kind of surprised that in Miami, the American baggage agent could have cared less and tried making excuses right away.  ""Must have lost the tag off the bag"", ""All airlines loose bags"", etc..  Funny....62 flights/segments on Delta in the past 9.5/months, not a single lost or delayed bag.  This was the 5th flight on American and they couldn't even get one on my bags from the ticket counter to the plane...really?Fast forward...the bag was located, and arrived into Miami at 10:08am the next day.  Called at 6pm and was told the bag was out for delivery, I ""(you) should see it around 7pm, +/- 30 minutes.""  It was FINALLY delivered at 9:26pm.  No call, no updates, nothing...but it should be noted that the original bag tag WAS on it...so yeah, they couldn't even get it from check-in to the plane!  Now, if I want to even request a refund of the ritual baggage fee, I'm told I'll need to submit yet another request.  Seriously???  They failed...and continue to fail their customers.  Had to spend $185 in new/extra tools just to start the job I flew here for.  Businesses beware...if you value YOUR customers don't count on American!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terrible,"Terrible, horrible, not recommended. They offered a complimentary luggage check in so we checked in two bags instead of one. Both bags were checked TOGETHER. One was lost. If you want your luggage kept together and not lost by a bunch of idiots then I suggest you look elsewhere. It is the better thing to do. They turned what was supposed to be a leisure vacation for the family into a stressful and difficult experience. We lost electronics, shoes, and an irreplaceable item. We didn't want the money, We just wanted our stuff back."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Only goes down to 1 star.,"Can’t use AAL anymore. I haven’t gotten anywhere on time this YEAR and it’s not uncommon to be at least a day late to my destination, sometimes both ways. Staff is clueless. Do not check your bag unless you have to. Sometimes you’ll be stuck in your connecting city for 2+ days and they won’t get your bag (they just send it to your final destination, even if it’s days away from your arrival) so you’ll be unable to change, get toiletries, etc.  Last weekend they messed up all my vouchers so I had to go all the way back to the “help” desk and wait another 2-3 hours for them to fix them. This is not because of the weather or staffing issues. This is commonplace for AAL and has been going on as long as I can remember. They underbook several flights, and then bump people back all day and whoever doesn’t make the final flight is used to meet their client quotas with their preferred hotels. Take this how you will. I’m just trying to give you fair warning. If there is ever any other option, even if it’s much more expensive, go with that if you’re on a schedule. Or drive. The stuff these guys pull is absolutely criminal and they should have gone bankrupt long ago, just like any other business that performs so unbelievably poorly. This company is an absolute joke, and I suggest you save your money and look elsewhere when seeking transportation."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Incompetence and arrogance at it's best,"(1 - We were continually lied to)We had a 1 way flight from DC to LA scheduled well in advance on 10/11/21 and 30 mins before boarding the airport flight status boards in the American terminal stopped showing our flight. After checking online we found that our flight was being rerouted to Memphis, TN so we asked the American service desk and were told that was an error and not to worry. We tried to confirm by calling American airlines service hotline but there was a 1 hour wait (of course).  Flight gets delayed - not an unusual thing - and then 15 mins before boarding (which at this time is about an hour after our originally planned boarding time) we were all told that the flight had in fact been rerouted to Memphis, TN for 'refueling' before it would continue on to LAX... 3 hours after we were supposed to arrive.  And of course, by now it was too late to switch to one of the non-delayed flights.. curious. According to the pilot, American airlines overbooked the flight for the airplane they scheduled well in advance and it couldn't take off from DC's runway with full passengers and enough fuel to get to LA given the engine size and other aircraft specs, so landing at a mid-way point was always the only possible option for the flight. (2 - Aircraft was poorly maintained and service was terrible)In addition to the delays and intentional deceit on American's part, the plane they had us in was in terrible shape.  The outlets or usb charging ports in many of the rows simply didn't work (including ours) and the wifi could only handle about 3/4ths the passengers online at a given time (kept getting ""gateway full"" error when logging on or after getting booted from the WiFi mid-flght).  To make matters worse, they told us over the loudspeaker that there was no alcohol service during the flight due to covid reasons (except for business class seats, who still had full meal and drink service) and they were 100% unwilling to budge on that given the above circumstances, delays, and terrible experience until that point and throughout the rest of the flight. Of course they didn't let's us off the plan at Memphis so total flight time went from 3.5 hours to about 7-7.5 hours... About double what it should have been without any apologies (except for the pilots who seemed equally frustrated), without any additional accommodations, or without functional amenities. Oh, and when we get to Memphis it turns out that America airlines simply didnt call ahead and inform the airport we'd be doing a touch and go to refuel so the pilots had to coordinate all of that once we landed which added another 30-45 mins to the flight time. The only good thing about the flight were the pilots and their communication to us, which was timely and consistent with what they promised.Never fly American airlines if you can help it."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Classist company,"Initially I was impressed with the ""free"" wifi and kicked in board, along with the space compared with spirit. However, the wifi, depending on the flight charged me 9-14$/hr, the access too movies were nice but I was given the impression that it was free. Then, after traveling from 8am with a three hour layover forward by a four hour second flight I realized that only first class were allowed to purchase alcohol or beer. I understand complimentary drinks for first class (I guess) but not being able to purchase a beer at all in the main cabin while first class is allowed you drink whatever they would like is absolutely ridiculous and very classist. If it weren't for my miles paying for this trip I woulda not fly with this airline again. 👎"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Bad Service,I am really dissapointed in this Airline im a frequent traveler and I usually go to United Airlines but American Airlines had a better deal so i decided to try something new. I can't tell you how much I regret my decision. I am really dissapointed in the service i was provided. I would rather not go to details but its worth paying $200 dollars more on flights if it means not using American Airlines ever again.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terrible! Don't Fly,"American Airlines cancelled our flight the night before we were to leave and rescheduled us for 2 days later! This was ridiculous and unacceptable. This would have caused us to find and book another nights lodging, two more days of expenses and miss 2 days of work and appointments. We will never fly with American Airlines again and tell everyone we know not to fly with them!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Horrible Customer Service and a Rip off,"American Airlines used to be great but it has completely lost its class and their workers are miserable and not helpful at all. I purchased a ticket that gave me the options to choose my seats and there were no seats available except for an extra $30-80 charge. What a bunch of scammers. They then separated our seats and when we called customer service, they told us they can't do anything about it until the airport desk. The man on the desk was so rude and cut me off before finishing what I have to say and said we can handle it ourselves inside the plane and switch with another passenger. How stressful. I have been a loyal customer for 15 years and there is no value or whatsoever. Why even have a customer service hotline if their hands are tied and can't be of any help. All they wanna do is take and take your money."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"If you like delays and overbooked flights, look no further","Of my many flight experiences, only American consistently delivered an astoundingly terrible experience. My partner and I scheduled and paid for our seats together specifically so that we could sit together. To our surprise, when we obtained our boarding passes we found out that nearly every seat that we originally booked was changed so that we'd be sitting across the entire plane.Every flight also had issues with overbooking and lack of space for carry on luggage. There were two times where the gate attendants forced us to check in our carry on luggage. Checking in carry on luggage is ridiculous and a waste of time when we specifically planned to only bring carry ons for a short weekend trip.Due to the ridiculous amount of time dedicated to trying to negotiate with passengers, not a single flight left or landed on time. We nearly missed our 1.5 hour connection because a flight left a whole hour late. Next time, I'll just pay a little more and fly Delta."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Shady American Airlines,"American Airlines is the worst airline out there. Changed my flight time when I was initially taking the red eye and had to use a personal day because it got changed to 6:35 am the next morning. Also got about 4 emails that my seat had been changed. The final straw was they didn’t even have my transfer flight fixed kept me stuck at the middle destination. When I asked at the counter to at least have my window seat “THAT I PAID FOR” back; gate lady wanted to up charge me $49 for a seat change to the emergency exit row. United doesn’t charge a bag fee and neither does southwest use them and you will be happier. I hope this helps I won’t be doing business with them again and will have the companies I work with use a different airline as well. That’s around 20k a month which Is probably nothing to them, but I refuse to give shady businesses my respect or money."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Imbeciles,"Your stupid automated phone system isn't designed to help customers, it is designed to keep them going in circles until they give up. Use some common sense, pay PHONE agents to solve customers problems and watch your business revenue grow. Both my flights were delayed, ended up spending $$$ and time in a terminal like Tom Hanks waiting for American Airlines to show some glimmer of professionalism or competence. Utterly horrible, I am ready to start my own airline."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Delay Or Cancellation Is Guaranteed,"Best Airlines at cancelling flights. My friend told me that if a book with AA, My flight will get delayed or cancelled & I told him No its fine, it is just a coincidence it happened to you multiple times. Guess what, that same flight i book while talking with him got delayed 6 TIMES, LOL.I should have listened to him but the least i can do is tell others."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Absolute morons run this airline,"My company has its own travel agent so it’s not my choice to fly with this joke of an airline. Twice now, I’ve gotten stuck in DFW, lack of communication from AA’s, this time we get onto the runway to depart, just to be told we don’t have enough fuel. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to my worst enemy."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,You suck!!,American Airlines delayed all flights coming out of austin to DFW and then our connecting flight took off ten minutes early. Next flight is in 24hrs. The staff can careless. They told me just make sure you here early for the next flight! Horrible service
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Trash ass company,Delayed two hours then sat us in the plane without moving for over an hour!! Wtf is going on with American Airlines now a days
Date of travel: October 2021,10,AA? How 'bout: Absolutely Abysmal!,"Coming right out of a delayed/missed connection with AA that left me sleeping in the airport, I got off THAT trash pile of a trip to realize my upcoming return flight from a foreign country had been cancelled without notice and yet my connecting flight after it remained. I had a flight to Rome, but none back, and then a ghost connection flight I had to way to make. What was the plan?? I get to Rome and AA is just like, well, walk to Philly?? This airline sucks, their customer service is too overworked to help (had a chat person accidentally give me someone else's private info because they were in multiple chats). They don't care if you're sleeping in the terminal because they let you wait in a 2 hour line to tell you there were no hotels - they'll go ahead and run their lawn-mower-loud industrial cleaning equipment and yet somehow still have the grossest gates I've ever had the displeasure of even sitting in. Do not fly American."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Not recommend,"S**t company, s**t services… Don’t waste u time! From the check in to boarding… Also don’t lose you time teying to call then, 4,5 hours wait time Lol b*ll Sh*t"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Pure insanity,"This airline will drive you absolutely insane.  Our experience was very surreal in the sense that I could not have imagined it to be worse.  Our plane was 45 minutes late to the gate.  No big deal.  Wait, it was sitting in a hanger across the tarmac the whole time?  Not that big of a deal.  Kind of strange though.  We finally board and the pilot states we will be underway in 15 minutes.  Thirty minutes later we have not left.  Still finalizing some paperwork.  Still seems odd.  I received a notice on the AA app that the flight was then canceled.  I walked to the front of the plane to ask the flight attendant, who said ""oh God I hope not"", who then asked the pilot in front of me who also had no idea.  Long story short, the flightbwas canceled.  The next 11 hours in the airport was full of false promises to catch new flights and constant running from terminal to terminal to only realizebathe flights are already overbooked and there is no chance we are getting on.  There were 34 standby passengers for one flight.  Constant rude and nearly insulting responses by ""customer service"".  Our bags are in Miami and we had to cancel our trip and drive three hours home that night.  They basically made us give up and the sad thing is, we spoke to so many other passengers who were in much worse situations. Just avoid American Airlines.  They really do not care.  0 out of 10 and we have little hope of getting our bags back."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst airline EVER,Worst airline ever!!! Less than poor service! Paid for seats together and since there was a change in flight times (from AA) we no longer are sitting together. Nothing they can do. They suggested we ask the passengers in our seats to change!! What nerve they have. Never ever fly AA. Stick with southwest!!
Date of travel: October 2021,10,They can't,"This trip has been the worst travel experience i have ever had.Booked through travelocity originally, cancelled due to COVID-19, rebooking 8 months later, no refunds offered, nobody at American was able to refund seats originally purchased. Then the icing on this Mudd cake was when AA did a last minute change and now my wife and I are no longer sitting together. Ticket agent said she couldn't help without charging us again....I said no way am I paying 3 times for seats. She said the gate agent 'may' be able to help, or WE could ask another passenger to swap with us.... I hold no hope of that happening as the gate agent said it's already a full flight and to come back in 15min. Common theme here from each AA person we have talked to-'sorry, I can't do that...'Never ever again...."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Another Awful AA Experience,"I don’t know why I continue to let AA be an option for air travel.  First flight since Covid and AA continues to disappoint.  Mechanical issues in both directions, to and from Reno.  Both ways, the delay caused us to miss connections. In both situations, they had to call a mechanic to come in to check out the issue, resulting in at least an extra 45 minutes of sitting and waiting for someone to get there.  Oh, and the first connection we missed, we were at the gate 12 minutes before takeoff but they wouldn’t let us on (knowing we were coming from a delayed flight). I will always despise this airline and will avoid ever booking with them again."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Would give 0 if possible,"Just fly literally anyone else other than AA. Terrible service, bad customer service, and overall terrible experience every time. 0/100 do not fly american"
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Only Flight on time was the one taking off while our connection was landing.,"The service and actual flights were fine; however, every flight had some sort of delay. Our connecting flight on the way back from our trip was delayed after we got on the plane. As that flight was finally landing, our other flight was taking off. We had no time to get to the gate. American Airlines has no problem making you wait but heaven forbid you make them wait for any reason. Will not be choosing them again if I have the choice"
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Pleasantly surprised,"Flew too and from NH to MD in early October.......... layover in Philly for each trip.     No issues with passengers on the four legs of the trip; Flew on small puddle-jumper jets - cozy, but managed to be able to sit 'alone.'Sanitizer packets on way out; not on way back.   Planes appeared to be cleaned.   Short trips so limited in-flight service to passengers.      Attendants were friendly; gate attendants were patient with the traveler who has not flown since Covid hit.      Schedules were able to me - we had good weather and no breakdowns.    The Salisbury airport is very cute.      A nice alternative to driving from NH to MD - instead of 10-11 hour drive, I was home in 7-8 hours."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst Flying Experience I've ever had,"I've never had an issue with American Airlines until now. This experience from customer service and gate agents left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I will never fly with them again. I received a total of SEVEN EMAILS of flight changes to waste six hours at the airport:1st Email: Flight is delayed from 6:35pm to 6:55pm (I wasn't upset by this, things happen and I'm reasonable person)2nd Email: Flight is changed from gate K1 to gate K33rd Email: Flight is changed from 6:55 to 9:15pm4th Email: Flight is changed from gate K3 to gate K15th Email: Flight is changed from 9:15pm to 9:35pm6th Email: Flight is changed from 9:35pm to 10:10pm while I with other customers are already waiting at the gate about to board7th Email: Flight is canceled while all the customers are already sitting on the plane.We were told that the flight was delayed because of weather that was in Tampa where the flight was coming from and storms that happened in Chicago (rain happened hours earlier and was no longer impacting flights). Then we were told that new crew had to be found because the crew had worked too many hours. They decide to board everyone on the plane so that once the new pilot and crew came on the plane we would leave quickly. Waited an additional 20-30min on the plane to be told that the pilot was too exhausted to fly and the flight was canceled and we were told to go to K8 to get rebookings. All the customers waited in a massive line to be moved to K5 for customer assistance where I was told that I needed to fill out a refund online which I had attempted to do but it told me I wasn't eligible for a refund because the airline JUST CANCELED the flight and it hadn't processed. I was then on the phone with customer service and immediately greeted with ATTITUDE and BLAMING when THE AIRLINE WAS THE ONE THAT CANCELED THE FLIGHT. I was finally allowed to submit a refund request  and I'm hoping I get a refund but based on other reviews it doesn't look good."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Maintenance Issues - Delayed - Poor Service,"This is the worst airline to ever fly. Take American out of your name because that’s a symbol of excellence… your airline is a symbol of garbage. They’ve offered no reimbursement for causing me to push my wedding back a day from their inability to get me to Aruba on October 2, on time. They transferred me to United, but not my bags - therefore I had to wait one extra day to get my belongings to attend my own wedding. Here I am trying to leave Aruba to get back to ATL and the flight has been delayed to 9AM October 10. I’ll have to stay over night in CLT. I’ll never fly this airline again. DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE until they fix their malfunctioning planes and live up to the airline standard of excellence for on time flights. I want my money back and/or a voucher for the full amount of my flight to be used with Delta or United airlines."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Due to mechanical problems flew me to wrong city!,"I fly a lot, both domestic and international for work. AA is the WORST! Ive received better service from 3rd World airlines!I had to fly up to Providence for my mother’s funeral. I remember when airlines gave you special treatment fir that.They put us on an old jalopy of a plane in Wilmington. We were delayed on the tarmac for so long, I got a notification in their app that I wouldn’t make my connection in Charlotte. When I tried to book to Providence, I couldn’t! I ended up having to fly to Boston and getting there late at night.The app wouldn’t let me book a seat wo an upgrade charge, and told me to go to the desk. They said all they had was a middle seat.I told them I had an aisle seat on the flight they caused me to miss. I advised the agent I was traveling for my mom’s funeral. Still wouldn’t put me in an aisle seat wo coughing up $30 even under the circumstances.Seems the out-sized bonuses of the AA executives  would be in jeopardy if they treated their passengers more humanely than cattle.The whole time the gate agent remained completely expressionless. I swear AA sends them to special training to ensure they exhibit absolutely no signs of caring.This is the second horrible experience with AA. The problem is, for the dates I needed to travel, there were no alternatives. Only Delta still treats you like a person"
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Genuine Personal Interest and Service,"Fantastic Personal Service, Alayda Mendoza at check-in thank you. We are VIPs with a number of airlines and this was only our second flight with AA. Previously we had tested United to compare as we have relocated to the USA. Due to covid the documentation required is confusing and varies from country to country. We incorrectly completed the paperwork and this amazing young lady Alayda showed genuine personal interest and patience with us. Well done AA for your staff training. and thank you Alayda"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Never fly with them,Our flight was originally scheduled for 9:00pm and they pushed us back twice until our flight went off at 5:45am. They would not let us cancel for a refund despite the issues on their end. Delta had a much better flight that we would have loved to buy but american forced us to keep our very delayed flight. I will never fly with them again.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Cramped Older Planes,"We just returned from Los Cabo and flew on American. The plane from Louisville to Dallas was so small we barely had room to move both trips going and returning. I am not a large person only 5’3” and I could not move my legs because the seat in front on me was broken and leaned way back. On returning through Dallas we went through customs, back through TSA to our gate. I got a call from an unknown number stating “All international passengers much pick up luggage and recheck. We ask 3 separate gate agents and they told me the call was a scan. But when we got to Louisville we did not have our bags. There was 30-49 people with the same issue. We all had to file a claim and I’m still waiting for my luggage. This could have been prevented if the stewardess or pilot would have made an announcement telling us to recheck our bags and not assume everyone knows to do this. I’m still waiting for my bags. Never again on American Airlines. There Are too many other airlines to put up with this nonsense."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Rude to Military,"I would give zero stars if possible. My husband is US Military and got treated poorly. The lady at the counter was very rude to us when our bag was 7lbs over (we paid $100 extra so it was ok) - she then saw me standing next to him and asked if I was military and took my boarding pass and removed ""priority boarding"" which I had due to my husband being military. She said mine should not be priority and moved me back to Group 7. It was all unnecessary, she had no reason to take my boarding pass other than to be picky and rude. Cant believe American treats their military and spouses so poorly."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Too Good To Be True,"I feared that my last 2 experiences which were hassle free were outliers--well things were back to normal on our last  flight. Delayed flights, gate areas disorganized and a free for all, packed planes and a shortage of overhead bin space.  Flight attendants were doing nothing to assist other than loud announcements over the intercom telling people to hurry up so they could depart!!! Snacks/lunch in the forward cabin were inedible!!! Flying American is worse than public transport these days and worse, they don't care!!!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Needed to cancel.,I spent $650 dollars on tickets plus picking our seats. My dad caught covid and unfortunately passed away before the trip. I called customer service and they claimed they couldn’t do anything for me. I was just out a father and $650. Their website claims due to covid they could work with you on these matters. Apparently this is false advertising and I think it’s very sad and unfair that they wouldn’t do anything to help me in this time. The woman was rude and honestly inhumane. I’ll never book a flight with this air line again.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,AA review,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  NEVER FLY AGAIN! 0 out of 5. Unreliable!!!!  Cancelations last minute without accommodating clients. Flight attendants and counter clerks with terrible attitude. Look like robots.  Horrible customer service both in person and on the phone.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Thanks for ruing our tip American Airlines,"We booked a red eye flight with a toddler because it was the only time we could make it after having to reschedule our original trip due to Covid. We drove 4 and a half hours to the airport and waited in their check baggage line for 2 hours. We finally made it and were so thankful because we had a half hour to spare. We were told we missed our check in window and that we would have to go to the end of a much longer line to reschedule our flight. We were heart broken as we had trip plans very dependent on this flight time. We had already rescheduled the trip and lost a lot of money. For us to do everything correct and plan accordingly only to be so rudely told to go to the back of the line and figure it out without any sympathy offered was absolutely ridiculous. We tried to remain patient and waited for the full length of their line, another hour and a half. We got up to the window and were told the last flight for the night would leave in 20 minutes and they were not going to get us only that one either. I asked when the next flight was and I was told it wasn’t until the following morning. So my family has to pay for a hotel which was not budgeted into our plans, we have ruined plans for a very long and thought out trip, and I was told (YELLED AT) by Tiffany that if I wanted assistance I would need to “bill American for my hotel because TIFFANY can’t do anything” Why do you have Tiffany working for you American if she is not capable of helping customers or making a call to someone who can? I asked her several times to call someone above her and she refused. I asked what her employee ID was and she refused. She said she’s the “only Tiffany here” so I encourage you to find the only Tiffany in American Airlines, and ask her why she thought your company couldn’t afford a hotel bill after ruining my families vacation? I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ANY AND ALL TO BOOK ELSEWHERE. No matter where you’re going, or how desperate you are, don’t book. I will walk, swim, or hop on one foot before I ever step foot on one of your planes again. I stayed at your airport for hours and hours with a miserable 2 year old on my hip and THE ONLY TIFFANY THERE couldn’t be bothered to work with me on a cheap hotel to help My family with these issues. What a pathetic waste of my time this airline was, and what a sad excuse for a customer service representative Tiffany is. I also witnessed her yelling at a lady who’s wedding was ruined by this same pathetic excuse of an airline. I would like to be compensated as I believe every person in line tonight should be.  I will continue to reach out by any means necessary."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,They closed the doors on our faces AFTER scanning our boarding passes,"American Airlines have always been the worst airlines, but this experience has pushed it over the edge. We had an international flight to catch (booked via Qatar as I would never willingly book AA) and as we arrived in the DIA terminal we went to our gate. 20 mins or so before departure we realized our gate had changed- no announcement, just a change on the monitors. We made it to our new gates with 12 minutes to spare. American Airlines scanned our boarding passes and in less than a minute we would be at the door of the plane. My 60 year old mother was the first to make it to the door of the plane- it was wide open and a white male pushed her to the ground saying the door is closed AS he was actively closing the door! Then he proceeded to yell, ""Leave! Go!"" I'm in complete and utter shock that they would resort to physically shoving us. Thankfully my mother hadn't suffered any physical injuries, but the emotional trauma was enough.Not only did those scanning our passes fail to inform the captain and crew 5 other passengers were on their way, they scanned our passes to save their asses. We are currently in process of filing a claim. Fly with caution."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,All four connections we're late by hours over a two-day stretch,The flight on Wednesday out of San Antonio my wife had to be moved to a different plane and got to Dallas where the original flight was late by two and a half hours. Then leaving Richmond they were late over an hour and a half when getting to Charlotte plane is over 2 hours late it's a shame that they can't operate it like it did years ago we will probably look for an alternate way of traveling especially on our next Hawaii trip in a month
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Cancelled my flight,They cancelled my flight several hours before departure. I'm beyond livid right now. I had an engagement to go to and now I'm unable to make and on top of that my money will not be refunded until 7-21days the latest. Never will book with them again.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,They overbooked and we had to go back the next day…twice,"This is why I hate American Airlines Cancelled flight to Aruba w a friend  and had to go the next day in April. They happily gave me a voucher because the flight was overbooked.Three months later…Went to check in w another friend 2 hours early this evening because we couldn’t get the tix w early check in last night.Put in my confirmation #…”We appreciate your early check in, but you have to wait till 24 hours!”They moved us to the same flight tomorrow and told us to go home. I tried to check in early again….wouldn’t let me download tickets until I paid 27 to upgrade to priority.Huge scam.😐"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worse company don’t fly,If 0 was on here I would select that option. So disappointed this was my first time flying with y’all and last. Not only did two flights get delayed!! We paid $100 extra for bag that was 4lbs over bs limit and every one in customer service was not helpful and rude like they do this to everyone. I will not recommend AMERICAN(more like Chinese) AIRLINES to no one!!!!
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst company,I used to think spirit airlines was bad but I guess American Airlines tops it. I book a flight with them first off they don’t have straight fight so I have to get a connection they decide to push my flight and tell me I’m gonna miss my connection but oh well we can put you on a flight for tomorrow. So the only comprise I’m given it’s either arrive at destination 4 hours later or spend the night where I’m taking my connection or come back another day when I’ve taken time off smh. I take option A of course better that than tomorrow now I go from window seat to middle seat cuz they are booked 😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬. Never flying with them ever again.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,No compassion!!!,"Traveling to Reno for a wedding, trip had to changed, one w/only a 39 minute layover. Brought a carry on to avoid luggage possibly not making it and once in Reno we had no time to wait at baggage claim. We were on a very tight schedule.First leg they throw away my expense hair product that was not an aerosol product. Again I didn’t want to check bag so had to watch it be thrown away.Second leg, out boarding pass disappeared from mobile checkin so had to go to the desk to have printed. They printed the wrong one so had to go back. Then we were told we had too many carry on bags. My daughter explained the one extra bag was a breast pump/cooler & that she checked to be sure she could bring that additional bag on board. So then the lady comes back to us just as we’re about to board and said there was no more room for luggage and I had to check my bag. I tried explaining we had no time to wait at baggage claim upon arrival at our destination- they did not care in the least. Just took my bag and handed me a ticket.I’m not sure what that was about as there was plenty of room left in the overhead bins when they closed them for departure. There are other options for flying American Airlines  and I will be using others in the future!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Steph E,"In 2021 American Airlines has botched all my travels. From having to go the next day to being delayed 4 hours due to plane equipment.   Furthermore all reassigned seats were the worst. From non reclining to right next to the Bathroom.  Will not use this airline anymore except as a last resort. Jet Blue, Southwest, and Alaskan airlines will be my first options for traveling from now on."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Lost Bag,"I checked in a bag to American Airlines, It had more than $1,400 worth of clothes and electronics inside of it . When I showed up to baggage claim my bag was missing. I asked for help several times, i received help but none of it actually helped me. One gentleman helped me from AA, he talked to me and helped me the best. Because of this experience I don’t plan on flying through this airline ever again!"
Date of travel: October 2021,50,60th BD Cruise,"The boarding both going and coming back was very pleasant and streamline, however my bag was left in Miami when I I got to baggage claim in St Louis.  I was very upset and disappointed but a representative by the name of Janella not sure how it's spelled, reassured me that she would advocate for me and get my bag to me the next evening and that is exactly what happened.  I appreciated her engagement with me and her professionalism.   Even better, everything was inside.  I was nervous because I had jewelry stolen from my bag at an airport once.  So all's well that ends well"
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Great flight more often than not,This was our last flight of a 40 hour international trip.  Late at night.  Was on time.  Very professional.  Very good customer service.  Food not great but ok.  Lounge at Philly airport very good.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Fly with any carrier but American Airlines,"My husband was a hospice patient when we flew on American Airlines in late July and early August, 2021.  Because I needed as stress-free and comfortable of an experience as possible for my husband, I made our first-class reservations over the phone, informing them that my husband required wheelchair assistance, and that we would be traveling with our 9lb Yorkshire Terrier. Because we were traveling with the aforementioned Yorkie, we were not able to do online check-in. For the same reason, curb side check-in was also not available. While this makes absolutely no sense to me, we dutifully stood in a very long line to accomplish this task. Then we were told that a wheelchair was not available, and that we could sit and wait for one, with no guarantee that one would arrive in time for us to make our flight. Opting to walk, my 57 year old (once strong and 200 pound) husband had to rely on me, his 120 pound wife for assistance, nearly falling three times.  At our layover in Charlotte, a wheelchair WAS available, but the elderly woman who was supposed to assist us told us she was too busy to push the chair and that I would have to do it  myself (while lugging my carryon and the Yorkie).Our return flight was canceled and I had to wait hours to reschedule it for the following day, forcing us to miss a medical procedure that had been scheduled for my husband.When we landed once again in Charlotte on our return trip to Austin, an announcement was made that all wheelchair assist passengers were REQUIRED to remain in their seats until all other passengers had deplaned. This, and the fact that our wheelchair assistant spent nearly ten minutes chatting with the other assistants, gave us no time to use restrooms before boarding the plane. Being an AAdvantage member, and having spent close to $2,500 for our first class tickets, I decided to reach out to customer service to share our horrible experience. It took them close to 60 days to respond to me, and the response was basically a ""cut and paste"" lecture in economics (I never complained about the price of the tickets, I only said that for what we paid for first class tickets, we did not receive first class treatment.), airport policy regarding wheelchair assistance, and the ""operational challenges"" that American Airlines faces in trying to adhere to regulations pertaining to flight crews. American Airlines assured me that while they did absolutely nothing wrong, they wanted me to maintain a favorable impression of them! To accomplish this, they issued two trip credits in the amount of $150 each - one for me and one for my husband, who is now deceased.Because I do need to return to Cleveland for my beloved husband's funeral, I am entertaining the thought of using the trip credit and taking my chances with American Airlines once again. When I called to see if I could use the trip credit issued to my husband toward my own ticket, the ""customer service"" representative quite rudely informed me that it was just a trip credit, and anyone could use it. I cannot even put into words my disgust with American Airlines, and their total lack of care for their customers."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Passenger,Worst airline I’ve ever been on in my entire life. And if you do anything and I mean anything out of the line Like raise your voice just a little they will absolutely do nothing about it and just threaten to call the cops on you for basically doing nothing and just exercising your Right to speech I will never fly this airline ever again in my life.
Date of travel: August 2021,30,"Moved seats, packed in seats un necessarily during covid, cancelled flight with terrible overnight inconvenience","Just horrible to see that we are packed in side by side yet plane not full and we all know covid is dangerous- why would a caring airline leave the premium seats (exit) empty except for greed as they are an upcharge, right? Seems analytics at American Airlines work to bump seats and alert people to oversold planes. There has to be a way to arrange spaced out seats especially on the flight where my pre- selected seat was moved by the airline to an inferior seat automatically on this same flight. Last flight a bunch of us got bumped because they cancelled a flight last minute (not weather, not mechanics) and we were stuck being bussed to a hotel far from airport overnight and rerouted way out of our way to get home next day causing two in the party to miss important work commitments."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Do not fly American,Do not fly American Airlines. I had three flights canceled within  two weeks. These cancellations were announced within hours of the flight taking off. I missed my brothers wedding. Then I decided to fly my brother out and both of his flights were cancled-resulting in missed days of work and multiple trips to the airport for both of us. American Airlines is very unprofessional and I would recommend upgrading to Delta to ensure your flight is not canceled.
Date of travel: August 2021,30,Late,Flight was late... not happy about that.  Otherwise a normal flight.  The live news on the TV didn't work... not sure why they advertise it if it's not ready for use.  I like having live TV... at least it may come down the road.
Date of travel: October 2021,20,First Class =-Third World Class Just Horrible,"After 3 disappointing flights I review here. Todays flight: Almost vomited from the unclean toilet smell. Toilet (first class) wreaked of urine 15 min into flight. Asked attendant to do something about toilet - she said- nothing I can do. Asked for water (nothing provided upon seating in first class) was told service would start soon. Waited 15 min no water. Had  to get up- begged for water as I needed to take my pill- attendant was just standing doing NOTHING in first class. I was in row 3, took forever to get first drink service. No sanitizer wipes offered entire flight, but I did find two USED wipes in first class seat pocket. Got  cheap snacks (1 offer) and 2 drink services entire 2 hour 45 min flight. Main cabin people using our stinky bathroom one after another. Attendant disappeared during 30 min of flight of first class Last 20 min of flight same attendant cleans stinky bathroom with Door open- was so close vomiting in row 3- By the eith 2 MASKS on. So 2 hours prior same attendant could Do nothing for bathroom? Huh?. Poor service A to z. Covid is No excuse America. You should be ashamed of your name."
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Poor service dirty aircraft,"All those computer generated messages that say how American cleans their aircraft and how important health ans safety ofpassangers is are FALSE.The aircraft arrived late, and no attempt was made to clean anything: Dirty seats, dirty floor with steped on M&M's, armrests with some kind of pudding, and soiled napkins and wet wipes in the seat pocket in front of us,Lucky for me the man seated next to me had clorox wet wipes which he shared with us"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terrible Customer Service,"I flew through American twice within two weeks and both times my flights were cancelled within 15 minutes of boarding the plane. The second, most recent time we were given no explanation, but the rude worker just yelled to us to go deal with it at customer service. After voicing my opinion multiple times, I got no reimbursement on either cancellation and to even hear back from a representative took DAYS. My luggage was taken to Charleston without me, and I was unable to find it for hours. Would not recommend flying through American to anyone."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Dirty and awful service, mean stewardess",Some stewardess tried bullying me about wanting to switch the overhead bin where my luggage was since my front main cabin seat and no under the seat. She made me stick me personal item in the over bin in front and forced me to stick my carry on four isles back when there was more than enough space to stick it in the same bin. She tried removing me from the flight over it and told me “don’t tell me how to do my job. You don’t just get whatever you want.” The carpet and bins were very dirty and the plane smelled musty. No snack options for people with food intolerance. MY SEAT BELT WAS BROKEN. So much for safety! I will never take this airline again.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Rude flight attendant,"So I was in flight with my 2 children and my mother in law, and my son 3 months needed to change his diaper, so a flight attendant helped me to set up the bathroom so I could change. Later my 3 old son needed to go to the bathroom and I went to the same bathroom that I used first and a flight attendant leader screamed at me in front of everybody telling me to leave that area, because it was the first class bathroom, but I had used it before, and I didn’t know that. Just that my son needed urgently to use the potty. After she screamed at me I told her that I would report her because the way she screamed at me and my son, she screamed again saying that she didn’t care! So I left that area and looked for another bathroom. After when the airplane was landing, we were putting the seatbelts on and she came and screamed at my mother in law saying to put the seatbelt NOW! My mother in law told her that we were putting it on, and she screamed again saying NOW! Like we were a dog! In no moment we treated her rude or disobeyed her, my mother in law told her that we would report her, she answered saying that she didn’t care and that she was very good! Never in my whole life I was treated with such disrespect for no reason! I tried to get her name but she hid her name tag, I didn’t get her name! I sent an email to American Airlines, and they didn’t do anything about it! So the fight attendant was right! They can treat everybody like garbage that no one will do anything to her!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Stolen money, Stolen seat!",I paid for preferred seats and was moved twice. They refused to fix it or refund me. Not worth it at all.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Absolutely terrible. Do not fly with American Airlines.,"This was by far the worst experience I've ever had flying. Our flight was from Boston to Florida with a layover in Washington DC. The flight was supposed to leave DC at 8:50 am and was delayed due to cabin pressure system failure so while maintenance failed to fix it for over 4 hours they just changed the departure time a half hour later every half hour with no update other than sorry we don't know anything else. We finally boarded, got up in the sky about a half hour and the captain said over the intercom we are turning around because the cabin pressure system failed again. He said we will switch the plane when we land because we have spares. Why tf wouldn't they just switch it in the first place instead of delaying 180 people 5 hours and potentially endangering people. This is an absolute joke. I am still sitting waiting for this plane to board. If I didn't have a bag checked in the plane I would walk out of this place and not even bother trying to get a refund because of how incompetent these people are. Don't ever fly with this airline unless you want your plans ruined."
Date of travel: October 2021,30,Narrow aisles and uncareful flight attendants,"Same experience on this return flight. Uncareful flight attendants constantly hitting my seat with their service cart. Aisle of economy middle section.  after a few bumps the FA finally apologized. That gave me the opportunity to once again compare AA with other 777 carriers. Delta Airlines (recently retiring their 777s) have a 3-3-3 configuration in economy. AA has 3-4-3. I mentioned this to the offending Flight attendant. know what he responded with?  ""Then why don't you fly Delta."" How's that for customer service."
Date of travel: September 2021,30,MIA to MAD Economy cabin like a Sardine.,Sitting in an economy seat middle section (4 seats in the row) I was aisle. All night long the flight attendants (particularly one) bumped my arm rest and me. You've crammed in too many seats in economy with a 3-4-3 configuration. She never apologized once. your aisles are too narrow. This is part one of two reviews.  The return flight is another review. Your flights attendants need to be more careful. They and the carts hit my seat all night long. With never an apology.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,"American Airlines, The worst","Here's and example of how American Airlines treats it's customers. We had our flight booked from Myrtle beach back to Dallas. We got to the airport early, like they said. The flight looked to be about 1/3 full. The plane was late getting in by only about 10 minutes because of weather. They told us we would board fast and not lose time. Then they told us it would be delayed by 20 minutes because they ha to do a ""visual inspection"" of the flaps??? whatever they means. Then they came on and said the flight would be delayed another hour. Then about 10 minutes later American sent us an email saying it would be ""delayed: until 6:00am the next day. Then, the gate crew told us the flight was cancelled and we had to call an 800 number to rebook. When we asked for clarification from the gate attendant, because the email said delayed and she said cancelled, she got rude and told us in a condescending tone, ""did you not listen to my announcement"". we called and rebooked for the same flight the following day and luckily my sister was able to return to the airport and bring us back the following day. we weren't given any information about our luggage other then to go down to baggage claim. In baggage claim there were was no posted information and no one there to tell us where to pick up our bags. after about 15 minutes, a baggage handler came out and asked us our name and how many bags we had, they were going to bring them up 1 passenger at a time, then realized how bags were involved and decided to put them on the conveyor belt. We returned the next day, got on the plane about 5:00pm (dinner time). On the flight back, in first class, we were given a can of soda and a small bag of mini pretzels, and that's it, while the flight attendant stood up in the galley and ate a subway sandwich, you know, because it was dinner time. I believe that American knew they had a flight booked at only 1/3 capacity and 2 flights the following day at half capacity and decided to move all of us into the planes the following day to save money.Bottom line...at American Airlines the paying customers are just a nuisance to them. They demonstrate that in their attitudes towards their ""customers"" every time anyone question anything, even the simplest question. We will NEVER fly American Airlines again and they couldn't care less."
Date of travel: October 2021,30,Not as good this time,"A few minutes late boarding but the worst was once in the air, it literally felt like someone crammed on the brakes, if you will, the difference in acceleration was totally felt as a passenger. It felt almost alarming like something was drastically wrong. Then as we were approaching Charlotte, it was hardly a gradual descent. Felt more like we were heading for the airport head first and the cabin pressure was awful. Had to constantly clear our ears and actually felt it in my head like a headache. Also as it felt like we were free falling, they finally came around to check the cabin for trash, tray table.being in the upright position, seatbelts, etc when the captain said we would be landing in 18 min. God bless the attendants standing up as we were beelining it for the airport. Felt more like a thrill ride than a professional airplane ride."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,"Traveling for my mother’s funeral, American couldn’t even fly me to the right city!","I got on the plane in Wilmington NC. We were notified by theaptain that they summoned maintenance to look at the aircraft (an old jalopy Airbus) The captain informed us that American did not have their own mechanics at that airport and summoned the contractors..Turns out, nothing was wrong! But the app instructed me if miss my connection to Providence.  Turns it off hey couldn’t get me to Providence at all and instead sent me to Boston! 🤦🏼‍♂️I couldn’t book a seat from Charlotte to Boston as the plane was full. The app referred my to the gate agent. All they had was a middle seat, when I had an aisle seat reserved for Providence on my previous flight.The gate agent told me the only way I could get an aisle seat was to cough up $30.I advised the gate agent I was traveling to my mother’s funeral. She could’ve cared less. I think American actually trains their employees not to care. I’m old enough to remember when the airlines DID care and didn’t try to fleece their customers every step of the way.But they’ve been taken over by greedy, selfish, grossly overpaid executives who simply want to abuse their passengers and leech off their customers and very step of the way.How else can you explain the CEO of American (Doug Parker) making $10.6M while their planes are filthy, suffer from poor maintenance, and don’t even attempt to provide decent passenger services?TERRIBLE AIRLINE and TERRIBLE BIARD OF DIRECTORS for paying such outsized compensation that only a narcissist would accept, for running such an inferior airline!"
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Buckle up for this,"Lets start with the Admirals club at DFW.Pretty bad.  I do understand that covid has reduced the class of service you get, but dang. This place was terrible,   food choices, service, selection.  oh well, we chalked it up to covid.  Theme starting here.....outbound flight.  Boarded on time.  Sitting in Biz class wife and I.  Maintenance on board as things not right.  Good job to the crew for identifying the issues.  But, 2.5 hours later we are still sitting on the plane, NO SERVICE.  nothing, finally a half, and i mean a half cup of water, no ice.  passed around.  Then, we are told, not by anyone on the plane but by text notifications that we are delayed, Maybe 10 or so texts that we are delayed, then....a text saying we are switching planes, ....most laughed as we were getting info via phones but not from ground crew.  So.......off plane, back to sub par lounge, another hour and half delay, then on to next plane.  So, 5 hour delay total  and we are off.  Then we are told that the reason it is taking so long is that they are bringing our food over from the other plane.  Oh, thanks for the 5 hour old crappy chicken.   And I am now thinking that my loyatly in AA is about over.  By the way, wife and I ordered our food before hand and were told they didnt have it......Crew is great tho.   dont get me wrong, its not their fault these things happen,,,, ITS THE AIRLINE>    Finally take off, lousy food, very slow in serving drinks BTW.  Never offered any drinks.   Is this a thing they are doing....to try and curb the alcohol drinking even in biz class.   Hey, not even a bottof water the WHOLE FLIGHT>  Ok, enough ranting.    H=When you pay for ""a higher class of service"" you should get it.  Not even close.   Bags out first?   nada  both ways.  Admirals club,  Not worth the expectations, or money.  The flight back a bit better.  crew and staff exceptional.  got bottles of water, even drinks.  Food was hot, and pretty good.  But dont expect your bags to come out first in any case.   All in all, worse overseas flight going to Germany we have ever had.   And we like to go.  But not any more on AA.  Bottom line, when you pay for a higher class of service you should expect it.  Pitiful AA.  just pitiful...."
Date of travel: September 2021,30,"Last minute cancellation, otherwise fine",We had a last minute cancellation before flying out for a wedding and had to reschedule for a much earlier time out of a different airport. Our experience otherwise was fine.
Date of travel: September 2021,40,Technical problems caused misssed flight,"Our flight left the gate on time, then sat on the ramp for about 10 minutes, then returned to the gate.  We were told it was some minor problem, and would be enroute shortly. About 25 minutes later we pushed back, and on our way.  Unfortunately, due to this, I missed my connecting flight (it was a tight connection, but legal) American helped out immediately, getting me a great room, meal, new flight (the next morning) and taxi to & from.  They were very professional and acted in a smooth, ""not a problem"" manner.  The only problem was the taxi, which will be addressed in another review."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Ableist Policies Regarding ESA’s,"I have a disability and have an emotional support animal- a cat- who I take pretty much everywhere that I can without causing her additional stress. I did not want to leave her in DC this weekend because boarding her would be too expensive for it to be worth it (total about $150 for her to stay in a private room for three nights and get fed on a schedule and private time with a cat-sitter). When I tried to call this morning to ask about my ESA there was a 16 minute wait- from experience I knew this would end up being much longer- so I just got to the airport early- 6 am for a 10:30 flight. I was told I would have to pay $125 each way for my cat (my ticket was around $300 round trip). I tried to register her as a service animal because if she was a dog, she would fit every definition of a service animal under the Americans with disability act. But since she is a cat I sat waiting for three hours waiting to hear back only to get the answer that the only way she could come with me is if I paid $125. I did it because at that point I was going to be late for my flight if I tried to fight this ableist policy further. And then I found out when I got to the gate that my flight is delayed two hours. I ONLY bought this ticket because it was in the morning and was cheap. I have plans in Boston this early afternoon, but now will miss them, paid way more than if I just got a direct flight to Logan with another airline. The people at the desk tried to help me, but because American Airlines and the US gov’t does not keep disabled people in mind when making policy about disabled people, I am now sitting in the terminal writing this review instead of en route to seeing my older sister the day before her belated 2020 graduation. And the less time I can spend with her before having to go to a celebration for my best friends father on Sunday. I WILL cancel my ticket back on Monday if I am not reimbursed in some way for the financial, emotional, and physical toll that this whole ordeal has caused me. American Airlines you need to do better. I have been stuck in this same exact airport multiple times because you don’t understand how to treat a disabled person with the respect and consideration that i deserve and am now demanding."
Date of travel: September 2021,30,Flagship First is now a total joke.  Don't waste your money,"In previous reviews I've tried to stick up for AA's international First and Business class, but I just can't keep it up any more.  International Flagship First has become a sad joke.Now... if your opinion is that all you are buying with an F ticket is real estate (room) you will find my review harsh.  If though, you think a bit of customer service might be a good idea for a $15,000 ticket (what AA was asking for my RT seat at one point) then you will understand my disappointment.What wasn't bad: All my flights were on time and crew were pleasant and courteous.  Not always a given on AA international flights.The Flagship lounges are still closed in DFW.  The Admirals' Club in DFW TD is one of the worst at DFW, with inedible food, really snacks.  No chance to eat before boarding since in-flight food is never the best, which was a pity as.....There was no pre-departure service at all. Not even water.  Once airborne we got drinks in flimsy plastic cups.  The reason given was the airline couldn't find dishwashers.  The cabin crew might believe it, I don't, since AA was finding someone to wash the cutlery.  I was told I should be grateful we got nuts back.  Speaking of which…I've posted a picture of the single-tray meal service.  About as close to a Coach meal as I've seen in any long-haul First or Business seat ever.  The sad thing is somebody, somewhere, thinks this is OK.  The purser told me they had been told in meetings that a better class of service would not be reinstated.  As a consequence I am now looking for alternatives for my international travel.Not lost on me that there used to be more crew in First too, so AA is saving money on these flights while having the temerity to demand top dollars for them.I know we've had a global pandemic but I am past the point now where that is a valid excuse for most things. My message to AA is, if you can't be bothered to provide the service, don't bother.  My message to you is, don’t waste your money on AA First.  I now doesn’t even meet normal Business Class expectations."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Why American Airlines, why?","So unfortunately, this trip never actually happened for me but I thought I would leave a review for you all the beware of how terrible they are from booking to just simply, speaking with customer service. I booked my flight almost 2 and a half months prior to my departure. Within a week, I had already gotten an email that my flight had been changed. Eventually even my returning flight was canceled and they had to ""find"" another for me to get home on the day of me return.. in which I paid extra to ensure my seats?I called customer service because I couldn't find my ticket number, the first woman I spoke to was great. She found it with my last name and whatever else information but I decided to try to continue to go. End of story, couldn't. Called and the ATTITUDE I received was just unacceptable. Even question about the card used being inactive as I lost it, was too much of a hassle to be answered. I understand they may be going through a lot with other unruly customers, but I had NO attitude. Not sure why I was treated this way but I'm glad I never got on that flight. Can't imagine the customer service all around."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Never again,"After 1 delay, 1 canceled flight, lost bags and a total of 6 hours on hold I WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER FLY THIS AIRLINE AGAIN!!! They don’t GAF about anyone!!! And the CEO banks 11M a year!?!!! For the garbage service his company provides?!??? Ridiculous. Laughable really."
Date of travel: September 2021,30,"Great Flight Attendants, no alcohol for us peons in coach","The flights were on time and comfortable. The staff both at the gate and on board were friendly. There was an issue with the wifi and entertainment. I wasn't told until the plane was way out of cell range that I needed to download the app before taking off in order to watch movies. On my next flight, I did this and followed the instructions exactly as written. No movies. I thought, well I will just have a beer to take my mind off the flight and funeral I was on my way to. However, I soon found out that American Airlines only serves alcohol to First Class passengers. On top of that, They announce that it is illegal to bring any alcohol on board. I realize that with mask mandates and the polarization of our country that some people have gotten unruly on a flight and they are usually in coach. But am I the only one that sees this policy as even more polarizing. American Airlines is basically saying to us, ""You can't drink on the flight because you are too poor to sit in first class."" I don't see myself flying American for a long time. If you don't mind a dry flight, again, the flight attendants and gate staff were wonderful. If you think you are going to have a beer on your way to your vacation, you are not."
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Need to do Better Job of Scheduling Crew,American Airlines Flight 2516 was scheduled to leave Philadelphia at 1906. First delay was lack of pilots. They finally arrived about 1900. Nothing was said about boarding until 1915 when they announced we were now awaiting flight attendants. Advised to check back about 2000.  Shortly thereafter they posted that the flight was postponed to 2115. We finally boarded our flight at 2140 and took off at 2219 for our 3:30 hr. flight. Landed in Denver at 0141. We were too late to get a bus from Union Station and had to take a taxi home.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,DONT FLY AMERICAN IF YOU DONT HAVE TO!!!!,My husband and I were supposed to fly to Aruba yesterday.  We were to fly from Pittsburgh to Charlotte and from there to Aruba.  We were meeting my bother and sister-in-law there.  As soon as we got through security I received a text from American Airlines that our first flight was delayed and we would not make our connecting flight in Charlotte.  Since we were flying to Aruba we had to have a  COVID test 72 hours before we got there.  I went to our gate and ask the attendant to please help us.  She told us she was too busy.  We had to go back out of security and back to the main ticket counter.  When they found out why we were back they told us to go stand back in line.  Their shift was over and we would have to wait til the new shift started and they could help us.  They could not tell us if we would make a flight that day or even the next.  They would not help us at all.  We had to cancel our trip because we would not make it to Aruba in the allotted time for the COVID test to still be good.  The only good think about it was we had booked through Apple Vacations and they were great making sure we received a credit for our canceled vacation.  i will never fly American again.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN,I booked a trip and took PTO so that I could leave on Thursday evening and spend two days with family. My flight was cancelled and now I have to spend my PTO just getting to my destination. 2 stops. This happened to my partner too when she was flying American and was stranded at DFW for 2 days. My time is precious just like everyone else! I wish they would do more to solve these issues. I am not seeing this with other airlines…
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Moving pets,Spoke to 9 different people trying to make a reservation for my pet. After being transferred multiple times a reservation was finally made. When I got to the airport I was told my pet couldn’t fly. The employees were rude and wouldn’t even let me show them the reservation their company allowed me to make. Thankfully my brother that was dropping me off is able to keep my pet until I figure something else out.
Date of travel: September 2021,30,International Travel,"I wish the flight attendants were friendlier and they would allow them to dress more casually.  I think if they were allowed to be more there own personality and dressed more comfortable they would be more relatable as human beings and not so stuffy and snobby acting towards the customers.  Also, I get that the airlines have no control over the current mask rules in place, but again just be more polite and kind towards your paying customers when requesting they follow rules.  Please & Thank you go a long way.  We need more kindness in this world and it has to start with big corporations because you all make a big impression in the world.  The pilots were amazing and all flights were very uneventful."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,The worst attention ever,"I am a nurse and I can see people think that when they are sick they think  we have to take care of them, but when we need the attention from them is a disaster. I really hope they remember this type of things when they want attention."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Never again!,"Our flight from Philadelphia had screens for information and entertainment. When we called to alert them that one of our party had a gluten allergy, we were told there would be no food served in first class, but snacks would be available. Turns out there was food served. The stewardess told us we should have called. We did call!  The next leg of our trip was from LA to Kauai. NO entertainment devices were available. It’s a 5 hour flight!  We were told to use our phones to download content. Just can’t imagine watching a movie on my phone for hours. Again, food offered to first class, but not to our gf member. Again, we were told we should have called.  We did call!  The staff was very professional. It is not their fault that the AA board members decided that entertainment and food was unnecessary, even in first class. Never flying this airline again !!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible cancellation practices,"If you book a flight with this airline and cancel it, you only a get a credit, which is then virtually impossible to use, unless you rebook another flight within a year and spend hours booking it over the phone. You are supposed to be able to use the credit through their website, but don't get fooled, at the end during checkout your entire new flight gets billed. Horrible practice."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Horrific Service,"Service in the Philadelphia airport with American Airlines was absolutely awful from the worker standing at the beginning of the lines guiding people to check in to the airport in Miami where there was no notification of delayed flights overnight and a nine hour wait in a line for a re-booking. The woman at the front line in the Philadelphia airport was the rudest person I’ve ever encountered in an airport. The service continued when we went through security where the woman at security actually got out of her chair and pushed a person who was next in line Rather than politely asking him to step back. He was standing behind the gate waiting his turn. While obviously flights get cancelled and delays occur, the rudeness in their staff is absolutely unacceptable. I had a recent flight with United and it was the complete opposite in every airport that I was in. From this point forward my family and I will only fly with United. We have canceled future flights with American Airlines due to the customer service."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Stole my money !,Even after sending medical documentation they will not refund me my tickets that cost 825.00 total i will NEVER use this airline ever again!
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Horrible Service,Today I went to drop off my daughter who is in the United States Navy. She came home on leave after a year and a half from being overseas. We went to drop her off and we made it in time for her be on the plane but apparently not for her luggage. We were five minutes late for her luggage to be put on the plane. We got there late due to a wreck on 465. It is just shameful for someone who is serving our country overseas had to be treated this way. It was five minutes. Do better American Airlines.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Company solely for itself,"Flew in September on AA, and although they sent me around the country on a 15-hour trip to go 3.5 hours away, they got us there. However, I booked for Jan to Viet Nam. So, this airline decides to cancel my trip. Not just reroute me like they did in September, but completely cancel my flight. I plan it out a year in advance, we're talking hotels, events, inter-country travel, and now, 4 mos prior, AA decides they're not going to honor the ticket. It's cancelled. I call them and get, ""Sorry for the inconvenience."" That's it. Really? So when I make a change to a name, a date or even a time, you charge me $200+ dollars. But when YOU completely cancel my family vacation, I only get a ""Sorry for the inconvenience?"" The AA Execs must just be rolling with laughter at the stupidity of their customers to accept this. That's right, we'll rob our customers every single chance we get. But when it is is OUR fault, they have to take the responsibility of that as well. hahahahahahaha. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she said, ""I already said I'm sorry for the inconvenience."" Then consistently blames their codeshare company AND keeps correcting me mid-sentence when I ask why they cancelled the flight, ""Sir, sir, we cannot cancel the flight until 2 hours before it, so your flight has not been cancelled."" I get tired of this after 3 times, and say, ""OK, so if is not cancelled, then what time does it take off?"" These employees are playing company word games. ""Cancel"" and ""Delayed"" are played with. My flight is currently considered ""Delayed"" because there is no take off time (BECAUSE THEY CANCELLED IT). I hate them. They try to maintain control over you by correcting you with nonsensical lies. This airline only seems to hire sadistic people. You can almost hear the joy in their voice as they turn the screws tighter. Muwhahaha, ""it's in the terms and conditions you agreed to"" the power feels so gooooood. Well, you've lost me as a customer for good, and I hope this review costs you other customers as well. If you have a choice, choose ANY OTHER airline. We shouldn't have to deal with their complete apathy, complete lack of concern, pure, cold-blooded nonchalance and the absurdity of their statements living in a world of their own, apparently believing the drivel coming out of their own mouths. It's like a cult of delusion in the AA organization. The sadistic nature of the policies infer those in charge will only continue in the same vein, hiring the same type of people and training them to be as cold as possible to their customers. WHO else can hate their customers so bad and still have a job? These people probably get raises. Oh and American Airlines, if I do cost you a few hundred tickets (hopefully thousands), ""Sorry for the inconvenience."""
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Omg,"Booked previous trip through Expedia that was changed to next day. Hotel and car rental was refunded with no issues.  American airlines refused refund. We were informed that we would get air credit only. My husband, who doesn't like to fly, was not going to lose 600 bucks. Vegas is close so we decided to fly before we lost the credit.  We flew to Phoenix 45 min. 4hr layover.  Board next plane. Mechanical issues. Put off plane 40min later. Waited 4 them to ""find another"" 2hrs.

By charging prices that were raised during an oil crisis and never lowered, by making your flight something you must endure instead of enjoy, by priming people to behave badly by squeezing them in seats until they suffer crowed-rat syndrome, by lowering the benefits of the frequent flyer program until it's not worth using, by overworking and overwhelming their staff, and just by making you feel like you deserve some kind of punishment.  At every turn, and in every instance, they are going to extract their pound of flesh."

Date of travel: September 2021,20,Horrible seating,We are American Airline card holders.  We paid for main cabin extra seats.  They are small and if this is considered 6” extra leg room I cannot imagine the regular seats.  The seats also were changed and no longer have screens and are very thin and hard.  Never again will we fly American Airlines.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Mandatory checking of carry on bag,"Horrible operation. American Airlines made me check my carry on bag, against my will. I had fragile and expensive items in the luggage. I was assigned the last bording group, and they made everyone check their carry on bags in my group without consent. When I told them I had fragile and expensive items in the luggage, the lady told me she is happy to book me with the first flight out tomorrow morning. (I was on the last flight out)I had to get back to work the next morning, and it wasn't an option to fly out the next morning. I had to get on the flight. Upon boarding, I saw minimal 15-20 empty spaces in the overhead compartment. They could have easily fit everyone's carry on luggages there!I would never fly American AIrlines again."
Date of travel: September 2021,30,Mask mandates,My wife and I enjoyed the service that American airline offered the flight was very smooth and seats were comfortable. The mask mandates for the (less than 1% death rate per CDC) are absolutely ridiculous and need to end. As for my family and I we will not be flying until something does happen. I understand they're backs are against the wall with the federal government. These large airplane companies are the exact corporations that we need to push back on.. They will be screaming at the government if nobody gets on their airplanes because of ridiculous Draconian measures. Same goes for Delta leaving them a review as well. It was embarrassing landing and leaving the birthplace of American freedom surrounded by puppets. Yes American Airlines and people we are talking to you.😥🇺🇲🙏
Date of travel: September 2021,40,Excellent Flight,"Terrific flight back from LHR - my first overseas trip since Covid started.   AA staff on board extremely nice, thank you Kristen!  Took great care of me and helped me to figure out all the extras in Business Class since I don't often get to fly in anything but economy.  AA flight attendants tend to get a bad rap but they have been excellent on my flights to and from England in September.   Very pleased indeed with the great flight and service on board.  Also an excellent choice of movies, including some new releases.  The flight attendants were on top of the mask situation but not overbearing and luckily everyone behaved themselves on my flight!"
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Extra fees Coming your way...,"hello here is my Experience:I had originally booked and purchased the tickets online through American Airlines' website. I had placed clearly on the search options: 2 adults and one minor under 2 years old. the system made me confirm the above.When I try to do the check in online. the system directed me to the counter since I was traveling with a minor.At the counter in Miami. Myrna explained the minor needed a ticket and charged me $136.75 for a child that did not occupied a seat and was supposed to travel at no charge.   Not only that but the counter charged an extra $45 as a ""service fee"" just because.    $181.75 unexpected and definitely uncalled for.If a child is support to pay taxes for trips abroad why no charge it at front?   it waited until the very last minute to do do.   a $45 for a service fee???? at the horrible service an attitude provided at the counter. made the whole experience and dealing with the counter even worse!to top it up, upon returning the counter in Colombia made us pay an extra $47.19 for a checked bag that had the specifications as a carry on on American Airlines Website. The very same bag that has travelled as carry on on many flights, including Miami- Cartagena. Overall the only bad experience of the entire holiday was the counter ""service"" at American Airlines going and coming back. and an extra $228.94.   if this is the way American is trying to ""recover"" at the expense of losing passengers for life. It is a very bad strategy. What   American Airlines should do is to be very clear at what all the fees and taxes are involved from the get go, as opposed to last minute. The app and the system knew I was traveling with a minor under 2yrs  but failed to inform me of the extra charges coming my way!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Never again!,"My husband and I came out to NY for our wedding and brought our son with us. We booked our flight at the same time as our son and were told the seating option would be available at the airport: it wasn’t. We were all seated separately and decided to try and fix the problem at the gate. At the gate we were told the flight was totally full and the option for changing seats would be between us and our w passengers. This is UNACCEPTABLE. The ineptitude of this airline knows no bounds. Not only will we Never fly with this airline again, we will also be telling everyone we know [which is quite extensive] how rude and uncaring this airline is. Toxic people. Horrible to non-existent customer service. Take my advise: fly with ANYONE else. Just an FYI to anyone reading this who may be wondering if our situation is a one off, or maybe I’m a person who is unappeasable, know that this is the first negative review I’ve ever written."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Worst Airline in the Entire World,"Flights cancelled all  time, oversold ! If you don’t agree to join the  “Volunteer Flight List” even if you have a confirmed check in boarding pass, they just move you around whenever date is open so what’s  that list for ?  Who can respond to that simple ?What a circus …A Total SCAM. Flights full, no open seats , Full body to body contact . FDA and all Gov Docs :This Airline is the worst Covid incubator , mortal steel capsules  . Seats worn down and filthy. People praying to not get a miiddle sandwich deadly seat.Seems they didn’t need the taxpapeyers (We the People) to make it better. It’s more than obvious our money must be in shareowners pockets by now. Your bad, Congress People giving out free money from our pockets to these filibusters that only insult and abuse naive everyday citizens who require a paid flight service. Shame on you All!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,American Airlines has terrible customer service!,I had to book a ticket for work to fly to New Orleans for a jobsite issues.  The day before I had to fly out Hurricane Ida hits and shuts down the city for a week.This was the only time I could go on the flight and American is refusing to refund me my ticket!
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Does American Airlines get any flights correc,"Was told 30 minutes before our trip that it was cancelled. Received a text that there was great news that they booked me 2 days later so I had to fork out a slew of cash to fly one way on another carrier. Then on our return flight they delayed our first leg to Charlotte so long that we missed our connecting flight to Norfolk. The app then told me, great news we have a new flight in the morning going to Newport News Virginia, not Norfolk. After standing in line for an hour we were booked on a Norfolk flight in the morning and received a $12 food voucher, a cab voucher, and a hotel voucher around midnight. There was nowhere open to redeem our food voucher. So we went on to another long wait for the cab since it seemed like everyone was in the same boat. Then onto another long wait at the hotel to be told by the clerk they are jammed with American Airline passengers checking in with vouchers all night, every night. We were settled in our room around d 1:30 am we woke up at 4:30 to catch a 7:15 am flight and that was delayed 3 times before7:30. By the way, the weather was perfect. Their customer service is horrible and associates are rude but American Airlines puts them in a tough situation as well. I will avoid flying American Airlines at all costs in the future. I’d rather drive 15 hours than be subject to their inability to keep any type of schedule."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Late connecting flight with no notification for next morning flight,"I do understand that weather can provide delays, however, when you are not given a new flight for the next morning at 10PM, I had to booked a flight for $311 on my own. AA gave me a $67 credit and Barklys credit card would not delete the charge. Cost me a hotel for the night plus the difference $245. I canceled my AA Barklys card and will never fly AA again. PERIOD"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,-,Boarding from my hometown at Chicago they noticed I wouldn’t fit in a regular seat so they gave me an emergency exit seat without me even asking (I am 7’2”). On the way home from Dallas the next morning they wanted to charge me to sit in the emergency exit. He told me it’s premium seat and then he proceeds to tell me I have to agree and help people in case of an emergency. He was very rude and kept ignoring my questions. I’ve never worked with someone as unprofessional and rude as him.
Date of travel: September 2021,40,"On time, arrived early, great flight","Started boarding right on time, large overhead bins for suitcases, took off for a fairly smooth flight until we ran into a few rain clouds, flight attendants were professional yet friendly, and best of all arrived almost 30 minutes early. Knock on wood, all went really well."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Poor customer service,"We got to the airport the morning of our flight and found out our flight was canceled, without any kind of notice. We had booked and pair for seat upgrades and paid for our luggage already and upon calling American Airlines to get refunded, I was told that I couldn’t be helped over the phone and that they only do refunds online. I tried calling 4 times after the site wouldn’t work for me. The last  gentleman was short with me. I asked what they would do if this was an elderly person that couldn’t access the refunds online and he said that it’s  “basically just how it is” and it’s 2021. I definitely don’t recommend flying American Airlines especially if their customer service can treat customers like this."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Disgruntled employee,The flight attendant was disgruntled and was throwing her props on the floor every time she needed something different during the preflight safety demonstration. I nearly had a seatbelt hit my feet!!

Date of travel: September 2021,50,excellent customer service,"I don't fly often but when I do, I always hate it. Delays and rude people always cause me stress. I recently flew with AA with a broken ankle. The agent at the gate arranged for me to have a wheelchair at every connection. When the plane wasn't full, they moved me to a seat with more leg room, there were no delays and everyone I encountered seemed genuinely happy. This is the first time that I have had such a pleasant flight and I hope it continues."
Date of travel: September 2021,40,"Good experience,  except bags","Great service, friendly, clean aircraft. Bags tool quite awhile to come out, but otherwise,  a good flight experience."
Date of travel: September 2021,20,This about management,This is not about staff as I found them all to be working hard and doing their best. This is about management and is not related to any one flight rather airline service overall. Especially in these days you would think they would be doing their best to get customers but instead it is the same old same old of overbooking then expecting the passengers to save their behind by taking a different flight or put your luggage in check bags because they have too many people on board. This is unacceptable and needs to be addressed. They just keep abusing the passenger.  Let's not even get started on the boarding process - really? After all these years you still cannot figure out how to properly board a plane? It is simple back to front - board from the rear of the plane to the door that way the line keeps moving and nobody is in the isle trying to put their luggage away while others are waiting to go by. It is very simple people. This is really about all airlines but American was the latest flight I took.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Horrible and disappointed,"I had been traveling for over 12 hrs. from Greece, I had a flight from Philadelphia that was scheduled to leave at 10 am we got pushed back due to weather. This was supposed to be a 1hr flight, our gate was changed over 5 times.  Each time we changed gate I inquired about my luggage  because I had valuables/ irreplaceable gifts that I purchased for my family from Greece.Each time I asked  I was reassured that my bags were going to reach my final destination  and I had nothing to worry about. I finally got on a flight that was scheduled to leave at 4 pm by this time I had been traveling over 24 hrs. I was so exhausted my feet were swollen and all I wanted to do was get home shower and relax. I arrived at Norfolk as I approached baggage claims I received an e-mail that my bags were delayed. My fear became a reality, I immediately felt sick to my stomach I thought my day could not get worse and it did. I went ahead and scheduled for my luggage to be delivered. I was told it was going to be delivered at 6 am  I didn't get it until almost 11 am. I  immediately noticed my large suitcase was unlocked and reached to open it and once again my fear became a reality!I had several items missing 2 louis Vuitton bags,  2 Vanilla Diorama perfume, 1 Hermes perfume, 8 necklace sets, 1 Rouge Trafalgar perfume I started screaming and was shacking I have never felt so violated and invaded this is not acceptable. I summited a claim along with my receipts after my initial shock and awaiting their response. This was a horrible experience and not a good way to end my lovely trip."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,American is the worst!!!!,"My first flight from SAP to MIA was grounded because of mechanical issues ok I understand. AA put us in a hotel for the night however I had to wait 24 hours to get on another flight. I take off from SAP to MIA no problems, my connector was from MIA to CHS, well guess what mechanical issues again, at this point I was feeling uncomfortable so I exited the plane. I go immediately to the ticketing agent to get assistance for another flight she literally was rude and walked right away from me. I asked her for her name and she covered her badge really?????? Then her supervisor came out to say I was irate and he called the police who came and laughed at him. I then had to buy another plane ticket and get a hotel room for the night, AA is the worst do not fly with them."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Bald attendant man goes tyrannical on everyone,The man was a bit of a tyrant.  He was looking to cause trouble where no trouble would be found.  He was telling people to pull mask over their noses even when it was indeed covered.  Other flught attendants were great.  This man makes me not want to fly with american airlines again.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,you suck,"AA booked me to Boston, my final destination was Spain! Knowing I would get stranded there! I had to get hotel room and arrived at my destination 1 day late! Which is 1 day less vacation! That happens only once every 2 or 3 years for me, so 1 day is a big deal! AA denied any wrong doing! When you buy an expensive plane ticket and expect the airline to get you there, you are completely in the hands of the airline! My advice is to never book through AA, get a travel agency that got your back!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,American Airlines will leave you hanging,"Aside from rude service that we paid close to $600 for, the first flight has been delayed so I missed my connecting flight and will miss out on work due to this airlines negligence. The only way they could get me back to my home state today was to send me to a different city than the airport where my car is parked. If time is important to you I suggest you use a different airline"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Consistently the WORST!,"Garbage. The only consistency with American Airlines is delays. Oh, and their year after year ranking as America’s worst airlines.

Date of travel: September 2021,10,Don’t Fly With American,"A round trip 1hr 15min direct flight turned into 3 cancelled flights after extended delays due to mechanical issues on each different plane. The customer service counter was completely under staffed. Took 3 hrs to wait in line at the airport, which I had to do even after re-booking flights via their 800 number… because I had to check in at the counter to get my voucher for the hotel room since I got stuck overnight. Apparently, they are not able to do that via phone or website. Makes no sense, and the customer service rep on 800 line was rude. Do yourself a favor and pay a little extra for any other airline… it’s well worth avoiding dealing with the $hit show that is American Airlines."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Horrible costumer service,"I don’t really put an effort to just write a bad review. However this I have to! My original flight was leaving Las Vegas @2pm and arriving @11:46pm at Louisville Kentucky. Contacted AA to change my time flight flying out @9:55am - arriving @7:30pm to Louisville Kentucky they charge me $364 for both my husband and I. 6 hours later I got a notification stating that my flight got canceled and now I will be flying out LAS @2pm arriving @11:46 pm Louisville Kentucky (back to my original flight) but they still took my $364 extra charges. I called AA costumer service and waited for 1hr 30mins (which is normal wait time). Spoke to someone she already not happy with her job already giving me some kind of attitude. But anyways I am trying to think positive and still being nice to her and ask her how’s her morning, and she answered “fine, how can I help you”. So I explain to her my situation. She then always cutting me off while I am trying to explain my situation, she keeps saying i can’t help you, you have to contact costumer relations via email”.  And I said to her that “I don’t really want to email them”. She then said well you don’t have a choice, so I cuss as a gesture. Horrible horrible costumer service!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,No excuse for the treatment.,Most horrible experience with a Airlines. The Ametican agents in Denver Airport paying more on United.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible.,"I paid for 2 first class tickets, sadly my wife was forced to sit in coach as the flight attendant rudely disregarded us as we argued we have 2 first class tickets. Sadly,  10 minutes earlier, I listened to the people in line behind us upgrade thier flight to 1st class.. the man sitting next to me, his wife was also sent to coach. The 2 men sitting behind us were upgraded as our wives were sent to the back. *I PAID FOR 2 FIRST CLASS TICKETS!*Customer service there, also terrible. I called to get help with this issue,  a woman gets on the phone and says she can't help me? I have a live rep on the phone saying she can't do anything for me so if i want to write an email, then they will respond eventually (it took almost 3 weeks)Then they send me 2- 150$ credits for my next flight. Im sorry but your disconcerned staff made it more than clear we will never fly AA again.Whats the point of paying for first class if they dont even honor it, I could have paid less than 100$ a ticket, instead i paid alot more.Lesson learned, never again American Airlines!"
Date of travel: September 2021,30,Ran out of meat containing meals,An otherwise nice flight was turned to average when meal planners didn’t include enough meals containing a meat. It was also annoying to scroll through all of the social justice warrior content in the entertainment menu trying to find something that was just plain entertainment.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,STAY AWAY… Avoid yourself the headaches,"Goodness, where should I begin? Hmm, oh yeah, let’s start with the fact that the flights can never leave on time!! First it was maintenance issues, then the flight was completed cancelled because the problem couldn’t be fixed, causing chaos in the airport. Even my rescheduled flight was delayed twice!! And it took me to a whole different route. The nightmare doesn’t stop there unfortunately. About 2 hours before my returning flight starts to board, tell me how my whole flight was delayed from late PM to early AM… almost a whole day??? Y’all, it really took a whole day (both ways) just to get to my destination. And here’s the kicker, they didn’t even offer me a hotel voucher so that I could be a little less inconvenienced, and so I could have a bed to sleep on while I wait for my delayed flight (since none of the other flights were viable). Nope, none of that. Just a “well what you gonna do about it” attitude. Not even a sorry. So as I sit here in the airport venting online as I have nowhere else to go and couldn’t find a room to stay in, please please PLEASE stay away from this airliner. They are nothing but bad news. I hope and pray that the  company will run itself into the ground and will lose everything they built. They don’t deserve it. They don’t deserve any credit either. Even a single star is too much. They deserve a big fat zero. Save your money, and make your way to true professionals. Delta has been phenomenal quite recently. Read the other reviews and you will see that American isn’t worth a single damn, and I mean it in the most disrespectful and spiteful way possible from the bottom of my heart."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Never Again,"The worst. Flights always delayed, chaos at the airport by terminals. They flew me last minute and left my bag behind! Hideous service!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Do not fly with AA,Absolutely disrespectful and unprofessional crew.I’m so disappointed on how the crew use the back room to mock and gossip about the passengers. The crew members were also taking pictures of passengers from their cellphone.DO NOT FLY WITH AA
Date of travel: September 2021,10,"Terrible flight, terrible inflight service and absolutely lousy after sales service","I would rather travel on a Wells Fargo coach before I ever flew with AA again. This added a new dimension to terrible and had it not been the only direct flight to LAX that was available, I had never been on American Airlines. 30 years ago, this was a fine airline, with a fine premium product. Now they offer the worst product in the industry paired with absolutely indecent service and staff. They totaled (no exaggeration) my brandnew RIMOWA aluminum suitcase ($1200 value), which is now ready for the dumpster. The AA ""damaged baggage person"" in LAX could not cared less or could be bothered at all. Ryanair and Easyjet are 5* luxury airlines compared to what you get at American nd why we bailed them out with our taxpayer money a few years ago is a miracle to me. But, if you like lousy service or have a masochistic faible, if you enjoy being treated like garbage and if you want to be served a meal which yells ""salmonella attack"" you are quite right here. Oh did I mention the lavatory? It was so filthy, that I did not even want to take a picture and post it here. Yuck"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Took $350 from me,I booked a flight 2 months in advance on my return flight they rescheduled my layover mid-flight knowing I don't have service mid-flight and then when I missed the flight proceeded to charge me $350 for a new flight I have screenshots of everything and they've tried to sense tell me twice that I never had my original flight date thank God I had screenshots and now they will not refund my money
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Bad Customer Service,Spent more than  hour on hold with @americanair after they lost my golf bag. Most airlines offer you the option to cover your lost business not them... Not only did I loose my work tools and clothes. Their customer service offered no consolation for my inconvenice except a simple shuttle to my location. I spent half an hour trying to locate their number on the website. #AmericanAirlines can do better. If you do fly with them do not fly through @flydfw.airport on connecting flights. Apparently this is a pattern of behavior. 😔 #BadCustomerExperience no #CustomerService
Date of travel: September 2021,10,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,"Appalling customer service!! Rude staff! Terrible dog policy and they blame YOU for every issue THEY have! They don't care about your pets, your or your time! And they will absolutely get snippy with you if THEY are in the wrong!!"
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Inconsistency with Staff,American needs to train their staff on their own policies.  I was told three different things on what their policy says.  The carrier I used for my 15 lb dog  had a collapsible top to make it conform to the space under the seat and all I heard is that it’s not going to fit.  Even after I showed them it fit comfortably in the allowed space they still want to give me crap.  A terrible airline if you are flying with a pet.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Absolutely disgusting behaviour by staff.,"I will never in my life use this airline. The multiple sets of video footage filmed over the last while and shared about the disgusting behaviour towards multiple parents with children under the age of 3 and masks is gut wrenching. Absolutely disgusting. They should be ashamed of their mistreatment towards these parents and there babies. Medical exemptions are 100% in place with masks, also at least in Canada, under the age of three, masks are not mandatory. So they have multiple double strikes in my books. Disgusted does not even begin to describe how I feel. If I could put a negative for how likely I am to recommend, I would. They also pay to have reviews removed; many are taken down that don’t break review guidelines at all. They wouldn’t have anywhere near a 3star rating if real reviews were kept up."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Horrible service,"My last review was removed , however I am writing again . This was a few months ago. We purchased flights from New Orleans To O’hare non stop .   American Airlines , not only changed the times but they scheduled us for 5:00 AM. And a layover .  The flight was delayed for 3 hours . Of course we then missed our connecting flight.  .  In September 2021 , we purchased tickets to fly out of New Orleans to Missouri . Our flight was canceled 3 times !  We just decided not to even go .  Trying to talk to customer service was horrible !  There are plenty of other airlines . I have no idea why American Airlines does this if they can’t follow through .   So this is my review that has nothing to do with COVID. …"
Date of travel: September 2021,40,WOW!!! No problems,"Wow, no problems two travel days in a row!! Flights were on schedule, on time departures and early arrivals into CLT and TPA. Boarding for both flights was orderly and issue free. Was all this just luck or are things beginning to settle in to a  more enjoyable travel experience. The latter I hope!!"
Date of travel: September 2021,40,Hassle Free,"In contrast to recent experiences, our flights were relatively hassle free. Received timely notifications, flights were on schedule and  on time departing and a bit early arriving for both legs. Boarding and disembarkation were orderly. Lounges in TPA and CLT were clean, conveniently located and mask requirements enforced for the most part. Snacks were generally healthy and refreshed quickly. Bottom line--a hassle free enjoyable trip for a change. Let's hope AA continues to provide that kind of service in the future."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Lost loyal member,"Flights are continuously delayed, and our flight today was canceled. We lost the first class seats that were purchased well ahead of time. On our delayed trip here, our baggage was lost, costing hundreds in an unexpected shopping trip.  These things are becoming all too common with American Airlines.  I had always flown with American but will no longer do so.  I thought maybe it was just me, but their ratings say otherwise."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Disgusted,My round trip was delayed both ways and last time I flew they canceled and made us stay in Dallas overnight im just ove American airlines never flying with they they can keep ny miles
Date of travel: September 2021,10,flight to hell,"This disaster was too lengthy to type here. Here are the highlights. A/C did not work on the ground. Entertainment center did not work in the air. They lost our luggage on the way to a cruise ship in Barbados,. , which meant that we had to hand wash our clothes every night, and no formal clothes. Stranded us in Dallas/Ft. Worth for 36 hours due to no available flight crews. Refused to reimburse us for meals and lodging, but offered us $600 in credit toward a future flight. i told them that I would rather fly with Wilber Wright than with American Airlines again."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Stranded me in LA for 5 days,"This goes back a while and can be atributable to any US airline. My advice is, pay more and stay away. AA stranded me in LA for 5 days and I eventualy bought a new ticket to reach my final destination.Do not touch"
Date of travel: September 2021,40,Not too bad,"The flight attendants are friendly and they pass by to pick up trash and they also pass out snacks and drinks. Leg room is normal considering I’m 5’4, but if you’re on the taller side it might be a tighter squeeze. Only issue I had was that there was a cookie and some dirt/grime on side of my seat (picture attached). So cleanliness could definitely be better."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Absolute worst experience flying,"Where to begin.no customer service at check in, manager destroyed our reservation and flight missed."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Worst airline,I’ll never fly with a flight that forces a 2 year old to put a mask on. It’s not even safe for a child 2 and under to wear one. This world is despicable for allowing our society to get to this point and American Airlines is evil for doing what they did. Disgusting. I hope people boycott your airline
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Changing seats,I paid for my boyfriends and i ticket 3 months in advance for the seats to be next to each other and 12 hours before the flight they changed our seats. At the terminal we asked the women working and she literally said “i don’t have time”…. very unprofessional unsafe to be changing peoples seats who are traveling in two….
Date of travel: August 2021,30,Actually on time,"First the positive; there were no delays. However, the checking in process was a bit chaotic. Make sure that you are sure of the requirements for the country you are going to. The staff were walking around asking for a barcode which was required for my country when no such thing was required. They too so long that eventually they had to pull persons out of the lines and speed it up where the flights were close to boarding. This of course left little time to pass through TSA."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Baggage disaster w golf clubs,"Several weeks ago I was returning from an amateur golf tournament in Costa Rica.  I fly American 10-15 times per year and consider myself a decent customer. About 1/2 those flights I bring my golf clubs. When I returned home and unpacked my clubs I discovered the driver shaft was broken. I go on line and make a claim. It’s about 10 days I get a call from Simone, a Central Baggage Specialist from an overseas call center. She asks 2 questions and based on my honest answer they will do nothing. She claims since my bag was not hard and was not damaged they could not have caused the damage. Basically calling me the customer a liar and having made this up. I sent them photos of the broken club. I offered to settle for half the cost to replace. No no no. Not our problem. I ask to speak to her supervisor. Given a run around. American Airlines broke my club FactWasted a lot of my time and paid me back for being honest my telling me in effect, to bad customer. It’s on you Simone was horrible American is an insensitive company who in this case disrespect a good customer Alan. Frequent Flyer"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,literally booked a transfer flight that I couldn't make,They literally book transfer flights that you can't make and them won't even give you a refund if you ask I mean i'm paying for this they should treat me like a god but instead your basically a lion in zoo run by homeless man midgees by himself.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Don't use American vacations,"In 2020 we booked a trip through American vacations to the Caymen Islands , just a short 5 day trip , well we all know what happened in 2020 and we where not able to travel , so rebooked for 2021 , The trip is coming up shortly in October so i checked with Caymen visitors website to understand the regulations currently in Caymen islands. low and behold you have to quarantine for 15 days upon arrival. So that being said we called to cancel the Trip , after trying for 2 years who knows when we will be able to go now.American airlines advises me i cant cancel only rebook and it must be used by March of 22 or i will loose it all. I paid approx. .2,500 dollars for the trip  and cant re coop any of my money now and don't really have any place to go before March of 2022 that i know of. American airlines has had my money for nearly 2 years now and refuses to even offer a credit when cancelling the flight. I have flown with American over 35 flight alone this year with American but it will probably be my last. I am executive platinum member as well  and if this is the way i am treated i will find other airlines that will appreciate my business.Robert Burns 5n40tx2 no longer"

Date of travel: August 2021,20,The price looks good at first.,"I wasn't going to write a review because it looks like AA doesn't give a S*** about their customers, looking at all the bad reviews, but then decided, if I can get 1 customer to not fly AA, it would be worth it.  The price of the flight looked good at first, then I had to pick seats.  In order to get seats together, I paid an additional $100.  We found out at the gate that our plane was delayed, which would have delayed the next flight, so we changed our flight and pay for seats together a 2nd time.  Now I won't get a refund on the 1st seats I bought because they said I changed my tickets, it was not their fault.  This is probably why AA is still in business, taking all this extra money from customers for seats.  I would have left a negative review, but the employees were super nice."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,I regret flying AA every single time,"American Airlines has single handedly ruined traveling for me. One time our bags got lost and they returned them to us the next day soaking wet from being in the rain all night. I cannot remember the last time I have had a flight be remotely on time. American Airlines should cease to be  an airline; their system is abominable. They don’t even deserve one star; I fly with them if it’s my last resort, and even then I regret it."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,"If there is something that can go wrong, flying AA with guarantee it will.","I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve been delayed, shoved on to another flight that causes me to miss the entire event, spent a night in an airport, had more than a six hour layover.  When things go right I’m cramped into a teeny seat, rubbing shoulders with my neighbor, bumping my knees against the seat in front of me, enduring less-than-welcoming attendants.  I now hate travel, and I used to enjoy it.  But the flying process is now torture."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Will never fly American again,"From how the employees treated my family and I, as if they couldn’t be bothered to actually try and assist us at all, giving away our flight to standby seats while we stood and watched because we weren’t early, yet they could make these people tickets but not accept ours. We were shocked. Customer service couldn’t care less, and to top it off, they lost my bag but refuse to contact me back anytime I speak with someone and request an update. This business is run so poorly at the customer’s expense. My company will never book American again."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,My home airline,"I fly AA as my home town Phx Airline since America West then US Airways now American Airlines.  I usually fly Economy and then pay to upgrade to a Premium leg room seat.  However, on recent flights from Phx to Mia to Gua and back I booked a series of First Class/Business Class flights and they were great!   I typically take a red eye from Phx to Mia and have a layover in Mia.  Having lounge access make the time fly by.  My only regret is that I spend all my time in the lounge and missed out on a La Carreta meal.  The board and flights are a delight not having the tension of waiting and getting to your seat.  I am not a big eater or drinker but its nice to be asked if there is anything the FA can get you.  The two things that make air travel acceptable for me are noise canceling headphones and seats with width and leg room.  Add the airport lounge and not having to check to see if the restroom is open is that much better!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"When you subsidize a failing business, you get a sub-standard product","I have 1.7m butt in seat miles on this airline, many coming from America West and USAir over the years.  I have to say, this is as dark of time as the days when AWA was faltering.  The customer service is garbage even if you are an ""elite"".  Try making a complaint when something goes awry.  You get someone with a poor grip on English that is probably compensated on how little they can give you.  The default option being ""GFY"".  There is no appeal, and there is no customer service.  They will get 300K more miles from me to hit the lifetime status and literally very little after that as I will have an okay status for life an the incentive to fly this airline is literally gone after that.  I will fly SWA into Islip as the Piedmont (aa subsidiary) guys are either incompetent, or flat out liars, neither is good.  So AA, enjoy the business I pretty much have to give you, but know you have someone out there that will campaign against you at every turn.  You cost me an extra $400, I assure you that I will cost you more, starting with this review.  Also, people,  there is a far better alternative on the west coast called JSX, if you are not familiar with them, look them up.  The experience is light years better than this dinosaur airline that should be allowed to suffer the consequences of their failed leadership."

Date of travel: September 2021,10,Worst airline ever,"We were supposed to fly Cancun-Dallas-Reno on 07/31/2021 but got stuck in Dallas because the flight to Reno was cancelled. We received a text message when our plane landed in Dallas saying they can rebook us for 08/03/21 on a flight to Reno, which we of course didn’t accept. We went to an AA counter in Dallas and when we heard we couldn’t get to Reno that night, we decided on a flight to Las Vegas to drive to Reno from there. That flight got cancelled too. After an hour on the phone because the lines at the airport to get service from AA were incredibly long, we were booked on a flight to San Francisco that ended up being 30min delayed. We were assured multiple times that our hotel and rental car to reach our destination would be covered. We landed in SF at 12.36am and then found out our bags didn’t make it after being assured multiple times by AA they’d follow us automatically. We filed a claim at the airport for the bags to be forwarded to our house in South Lake Tahoe. After a night in a hotel in SF we took a rental car home to then find out our bags were sent to SF that morning. No notification about it to us though. We didn’t hear anything till 08/03/21 even though we were told we’d receive them within 24h after filing the claim at the airport. We finally received our bags on 08/04/21 at 12.42am. We are now sitting on the cost of the hotel in SF and the rental car even though we were told it would be covered but there was no way to book it through them and it’s impossible to get anyone on the phone to see where we can file a claim to get reimbursement for those costs. I filed a claim with BBB but AA says we accepted SFO as our final destination when we changed our flight, so they won’t reimburse us, even though if we hadn’t booked to SFO instead we would’ve been in a hotel for 3 nights since they wanted to change our flight to August 3rd. We are a family of five (kids ages 3y, 8y and 10y) who were put through hours of running around at the Dallas airport while on the phone trying to figure out how to get home, to then end up 3.5h driving away from us in a hotel we didn’t reach till 2am and then having to drive home without all our belongings and then wait another 72h to finally receive them. We didn’t receive any refund for the hotel, rental car and extra food we had to purchase because we were stuck at an airport for hours. Shame on American Airlines."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Could Have Walked To Milwaukee Faster,"Arrived in ord 30 minutes late but okay 3 hour layover anyway (?).  3 hours passes and aa is blaming a thunderstorm (typical, short lived thunderstorm) for no flight! Pretty sure planes can fly through petty weather.  Everyone at the gate is confused, no response from aa. Go to ticket counter and attendant makes up a flight that I know they don't have because I checked b4 I left and tries to give me boarding passes???? Asked many questions and still passed off to gate workers (wow, watch your back if you work for aa)!!! Will not fly aa again and know they won't care until the customer cares and stops flying with them. We all have to expect respect or we are never going to get any!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,"Awful service l, unacceptable schedule changes","Absolutely awful experience. Booked our tickets months in advance with a 10pm departure time. Our trip was planned around this departure, which included reservations to an expensive restaurant we had gift certificates for and plans to visit with some friends and see the sights. American Airlines decided to move up our departure time by 7 HOURS to 3pm and failed to notify us. This forced us to forfeit our gift certificates and cancel our plans to see the sights and visit with freinds. AA refused to do anything to make it right. They couldn’t put us on an evening flight since they didn’t have any. They blamed the lack of communication on the third party booking agency even though they had emailed me and texted me multiple times about upgrades and checking in. They didn’t offer any compensation or good will gesture to make up for the issue and only gave me excuses for such an unacceptable change in schedule and lack of proper notification. I will never fly American again."

Date of travel: September 2021,10,Nanit pro stolen out of checked bag,Had a nanit pro baby monitor (that requires no batteries) taken out of our checked bag with no notice nor reasoning or explanation.

Date of travel: September 2021,10,My American Airlines Experience Reminder,"On a recent trip my wife and I took to California we used up a credit I had left over from a cancelled visit to DFW to visit a friend. Had it not been for the credit we’d have likely flown United or Delta as past experiences with American had always been poor. Ok, let me pause and explain that the trip to DFW was originally booked on American because the fare was too good to pass up. I also figured that it was due time to give A.A. another chance. I got the same lackluster experience as my past encounters.The trip started with a flight connecting in DFW to catch a 2nd plane heading west. The pilots didn’t do much of anything in the way of communication with passengers. I bring this up because we taxied continuously for a good 5-8 minutes from landing toward the gate. We then came to a stop for another 10 minutes or so and no announcement or guidance as to what was going on. We got moving again and made it to the gate. The next time I heard anything from the pilot was climbing off the plane, “thank you for flying with us!” was tossed my way routinely.Things would surely get better from there, right? Sorry, my mistake. We got ready to board the second flight and my carry on bag was targeted for “bulging a little too much” so on we went with a gate checked bag. Wonderful. I’d have shrugged this off if not for the two other bulging bags I passed in the overhead bins near the more premium seating or the additional person that got on behind me with the same size and style bag in maroon. Yes, it was bulging more than mine. Ok, ok. You’re probably thinking “wow this dude is a whiner!” and as I stand on my soap box, I’d probably agree but stay with me here. We sat down in our seats to wipe things down with the sanitation wipes I got from UNITED the weekend before. Dropped the tray table and had pretzel crumbs land in my lap. That shouldn’t happen on a plane that should’ve just been cleaned based on COVID-19 protocols, should it? Wipe it off and move on. Got it. Then we noticed the spilled drink residue on my wife’s tray table and, the ceiling?!! Wait, and we look out the window to see that a “chip” of the flaps is potentially missing from the wing extensions for take off and landing?!! Ok, same old American Airlines that I remember avoiding. Appreciate the refresher.Be better even though experience tells me you can’t."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Don’t waste your money,Literally worst flight to San Francisco nothing special about first class by regular ticket because first class issue worst decision
Date of travel: September 2021,10,I should’ve flew spirit,I paid over $400 just to have a delayed flight due to maintenance and to miss my next flight due to that delayed flight and spend an extra 3 hours waiting for the replacement flight but it took forever to get ready because they had to replace a window for over and hour. I wouldn’t recommend this to anybody who has somewhere to be in the same day. I should’ve flew spirit for all this chaos. Unorganized and unethical if you ask me.
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Best flight attendants ever!,I flew on AA 3521 sep 8 from yyc to Dfw. The flight attendants Jodie and Abby were amazing! They were so welcoming and truly let us know how much they appreciated us flying on American Airlines. Their announcements were warm friendly informative and funny. American is lucky to have them! Service was great! Hi
Date of travel: September 2021,40,Veterans,Hello and to whom ever reads this review. I am a combat veteran and I have a job which requires me to travel often. I was sent a survey from the airline and for the most part I have had good interactions with American. Ticket agents very helpful and gate agents the same. One day I was sent a survey and jokingly I put why when you call military you don’t mention us combat veterans. We paved the way for these young soldiers today. I sent the survey and about one week later I received an email and in so many words told me to board when military is called as long as I have a valid ID. So I have been doing that. Lately twice I was told I could not board. I mentioned the survey and email I received. Still was not allowed which is jo big deal because I am in group 3. I just can’t believe this is how American would treat veterans. Oh well I guess this is how it is. Soon I will be in group 1 as I mentioned I travel often. God bless American Airlines it’s staff and customers.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,HORRIBLE!! Book elsewhere!!,"They literally delayed us 1.5 hours with clear weather and no one flying. Additionally, they changed our gate like 5 separate times!! no money back!! absolutely terrible service do not book."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"When I tell you to stay away I mean it! My flight was canceled in 2020 due to COVID. I requested a refund via online since that is the only way. Well fast forward to 2021 and I have yet to receive anything after multiple attempts to contact the refund department btw its only via email they have no in person ( from what they say) . The first response I got was that the money was refunded ( which was not) after asking multiple times for proof they replied with actually it was sent as a E Voucher to my email. (which was not) when I requested the email to be sent again since I need a PIN to be able to book a flight. I have gotten different responses from them multiple times and everyone seems to be set on telling me they can't do it and to wait. Well let me tell you I'm tired of waiting. Their customer service and how the handle situations is HORRIBLE.  The level of COMMUNICATION between each department is zero to none. Every time I have to speak to a representative its repeating the whole story asking for assistance and so forth,"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Horrible Service,I understand flights get delayed and things happen. Every company is going to have an issue now and then. Its how you handle it that matters to me and thats where American Airlines really failed.  Very disappointed with my most recent experience. Would advise others to look around before booking a ticket with this company.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,WORST COMPANY!,"Do not fly American, the staff is rude, the service is laughable, the WiFi didn’t work after paying for the service, the drinks and threats were a joke to its passengers.  I was asked by an American associate  to ask the flight attendant for an upgrade since I am military and her system wasn’t working.  I spoke to the associate kindly and was told that I’m not special and those seats are for paying customers only.  I was yelled at to get off my phone is an aggressive manner while we were delayed for an hour on the plane.  Never fly with these Military hating, low class people."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,“Bad experience.”,"bad services,I will not be flying American again. Agents and stewards were rude. Agents were unorganized and frustrated"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Bad experience.,"I will not be flying American again. Agents and stewards were rude. Agents were unorganized and frustrated with flight delay.  They lost one piece of luggage because agent didn’t secure the baggage tag.  Their delay caused us to miss our international flight, so we were stranded in another state for 24 hours.  When we asked agent for help putting us up at a hotel they replied, “you’re on your own”.  Overall, it was just a bad experience and it caused us to miss 1 1/2 days of our cruise."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,"Late-late, horrible service","Plane from Lubbock to Dallas was 2.5h late (tech reason), we were not checked in proper way by AA personal to their partner British airline. We made it to gate  running through the Dallas airport, just to find out that Our check in was not completed correctly by AA staff and staff in Dallas didn't have time to check our documents. We missed all our three connection international flights by minutes at the gate. In general impression that people don't give a d... about passengers starting from check-in desk and personal waiting for the plane ( plane was late and we were waiting for someone to open connection to the exit for 10 min) to relationship with their parents ( British, in our case)."
Date of travel: September 2021,30,Sub par trip!,"Despite being reminded constantly over PA system about wearing masks and potential penalties for not doing so, passenger in front of us never tried to comply and was never even reminded by attendants. Still, I am getting emails from AA telling me how safe an environment AA is providing. Better just to tell passengers, “You’re on your own!” Same passenger, same situation at AA check-in."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Worse,"Will never use them again… not even in another lifetime. Terrible experience and the customer service, 2/10. Spoke a lady this morning, her tone was quite rude. WILL NEVER USE AGAIN !!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Assault, Privacy Violation, and $200 more than my ticket cost. Never again.","Let me start by saying I’m not a first time flyer. I’ve been flying for years, at distances from 100 miles to 3000 miles, and have used several different airlines. American Airlines is ALWAYS the worst customer service of all the airlines I’ve flown, ALWAYS has the worst delays, and 90% of the time they manage to *severely* lose my luggage. Any other airline I’ve flown I can make a quick call to customer service, explain any delay or baggage problems I’m having, and without me even asking, they offer some sort of compensation, ranging from a meal voucher, to a hotel voucher, to a check to replace my damaged luggage ($300, just for the luggage! I never felt more valued as a customer. S/O to Delta).I know that American Airlines Customer Relations (different from their Customer Service) is basically impossible to reach, so I’ve never bothered before. This past trip was the final straw for me. I selected their airline over others because it was the only flight (covid sparsity) that would get me home in time for work. Long story short, the customer service was crappy (one employee verbally abused my grandmother, which was a new low, even for American), and my flight home was delayed by 24 hours. I spent $100 on food during that time, and I missed a day of work, costing me over $100 in lost wages. They put me in a hotel, per the standard, and they gave me a meal voucher. For only $12. After finally getting home, I contacted Customer Relations, after waiting a very long time for a reply (during which time, they violated the privacy policy by emailing my updates to other people) before refusing to give me any further compensation than a $125 gift card. They wouldn’t even put that amount into a check instead. I will NEVER be returning to this airline knowing that this is the respect that customers get and that I am literally worth less to them as a customer than a day of my wages."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Very poor customer relations.,Why cancel a confirmed ticket by your staff after selling out my previous ticket to a last minute passanger.. Awful customer relations especially to visitors and/or foreigners.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Hire real mechanics,We sat on the plane for 2 hours while so called  mechanics try to fix a air conditioning issue that they found the night before.  After deboarding plane waited another 2 hours before they cancelled flight.  9 hours late for final destination.  Never again flying this garbage airline.  Delta is the best carrier
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Good service,Good service nice and curtious flight attendants loved the pilots I got the best service from the people that assisted  me  wrote up on first class on the way home I loved that then economy I didn’t know how the WiFi or any of that worked
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Dripping Plane Called Normal by American,"In my seat the plane dripped on me non stop and American said it was “normal” when I complained.  Also, American is known to have tons of delays. Here is their email to let me know it’s normal."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Awful Business,You know how they say American Airlines is an awful way to travel. Well I had to find out the hard way with horrible customer service and poor professionalism. Just take my advice and fly with someone else. They are not worth the hassle.
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Very accommodating,"I realized I had 30 minutes between landing in Charlotte and getting to my connecting flight.  When they close the door 15 minutes before leaving I knew I had a short window of time to get from one gate to the next.  At the gate, I asked if I could be moved to a seat closer to the front as I didn't have much time in between flights.  I was moved from row 33 to 16 which was an exit row and much closer to the front.  On the plane I noticed some open seats closer to the front of the plane.  I explained to the flight attendant that I didn't have much time between flights and the closer to the front I could get the better chance I had to get to my connecting flight.  He informed me that I should stay where I'm at as there was more leg room and when we would get closer to landing he would move my luggage closer and place me more up front.  He sure held to his promise.  When the pilot announced to the flight attendants to prepare for landing he came to me and moved my luggage and placed me in the row right behind first class.  I made my next flight without any issues.  I was very thankful for American Airline flight attendant, Jerry for his assistance and follow through.  Thank you much."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Cancelled flight leads to 22 hr layover!!!,"Hey American, ‘I'm sorry to hear that you're unhappy with the change of schedule on your flight to Key West.’ is not an acceptable response when American cancels my flight home, after flying from Rome, Italy to Dallas and puts me on a flight 22 hours later without offering a hotel voucher, even though I requested a voucher. So yes unhappy with American.I was able to get a flight to Charlotte and then only have a 10 hr lay over after American cancelled my flight. So now I have flown from Rome, Italy, to Dallas, TX, to Charlotte NC and still I am not home!! I request expenses be reimbursed; all expenses incurred after American cancelled my flight to Key West:Hotel: $85Taxi: $17Food: $20Also requesting the $147.50 spent for a seat upgrade as I did not get an upgraded seat."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Human Resources Manager,American Airlines is racist. Please fire all of them and shut this airline down. We will never fly again.
Date of travel: August 2021,30,Pretty Average,"Flew out west for a vacation. Chose the ""economy plus"" option for seating. Honestly even that seating option lacked the legroom I was looking for. It was relatively worth the extra money, but compared to the ""plus"" options on other airlines, it was really lacking. No in-flight entertainment for a multi-hour flight was pretty disappointing as well.Overall though, the flight was a pretty average flight. The captain was very professional, with great communication throughout the flight. The attendants were also friendly and professional. The flight was smooth and uneventful, which is always a plus."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,"What in the literal hell, American?!","Cannot say enough negative about the overall experience with American.  Late flights, poor customer service, jam packed planes, no luggage space.  Will spend hundreds of dollars more if necessary to avoid ever flying this airline again."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,American Airlines empty Promisees and lazy workers,"I was traveling to see my family for the first time in over a year and had over 6 delays and 2 cancellations just flying home. I had to stay overnight in DCA while I waited for my next flight at 5 in the morning. While I was waiting in PHL my connecting flight was canceled and when I went to the help desk the lady tried putting me on a flight that had another 2 connections when there was a flight that was a direct flight the next day. Then while flying out of CLT before boarding the plane we were told the plane wasn’t plugged in and didn’t have lights, another poor excuse from American Airlines causing the flight to delay and many miss connecting flights out of DFW. I don’t recommend ever flying this airline avoid it at all costs."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Trash,I paid first class it was trash and they lost my bags sent them to Chicago I didn’t even fly through there it’s annoying and I do not recommend this service at all don’t waste money find a different airline
Date of travel: September 2021,10,The worst airline in business.,"I will never fly AA ever again, constant delays, rude staff. Will tell everyone not to fly with them."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Miss,Do not fly American Airlines. Customer service is essentially nonexistent. Planes are usually old. Delays can be expected.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines Absolute Garbage and a Scam!,"First, it is with a heavy heart that I file a complaint with the AA Customer Relations Dept., as I have been a Loyal Client my entire life and my airline of choice during the last 32 years of Honorable Service to Our Nation with the US Marines. I will attempt to convey my Horrible Disappointment with the First-Class/ Business service, the unsatisfactory condition of the seats  as AA makes False Claims of Enhanced Cleaning and extra precautions due to the ongoing Pandemic. The seats were extremely dirty with trash from the previous flight. On a 5:31 hr flight, all that was offered was Yogurt! Regarding your so-called Premier First-Class Flight from DFW to London Heathrow, I Respectfully feel that AA should be Ashamed of this Absolute Scam. The power connections were out of service. The food was lacking, Cold.  The Flight Attendant’s Unprofessional Behavior, I pride myself on being extremely friendly and overly polite, nevertheless don’t care about the “Flight Attendant’s Personal Crude Sex Life on the Plane with other Colleagues, Pilots or Derogatory Remarks about the other Unsatisfied Passengers”. But worse, she ruddily called me, and I quote “An Idiot” when I asked for assistance with a Defective Chair/Seat belt. Yes, you heard correctly! Apparently, she misunderstood my kindness. About flight 1570, I did hope for a better experience but sadly it was the same, Dirty Chairs, No Inflight Entertainment, or WIFI. Defective Electric Outlets, Damaged Bag on arrival."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Will never book with American Airlines again,"Me and my son brought our tickets since May and since all passports are now taking a huge delay to get ready, come August my son passport was here and not mine on time for our flights.  I know they weren't secured tickets but so was our return tickets with JetBlue, but they understood and gave us a full credit for both tickets. Comparing the American Airlines who wouldn't refund a dime. We will be travelling a lot starting next year. JetBlue all the way baby. American Airlines can declare bankruptcy and close down as far as I'm concerned. You guys are just ripping off people that have been loyal to you and are putting money in your pockets. Never no more!!!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,American flight 805 Phl to Cun/Cun to Phil.    8/30 auto 9/4/21,"Terrible stewardess on flight down to Cancun from pal, and also on the way back.  Very snippy to my daughter just asking for a wipe because the guy next to her sneezed without a mask.   I am sure I won't fly them again..Pretty bad when you notice crummy attitudes from stewardess on both trips!!!   won't use them again. ...Shes lucky I wasn't sitting with my daughter or I would have commented about her crappy attitude!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Not good,"I would never take American Airlines again.   They got rid of all that TV screens.  All you have is TV shows, movies, and music that you have to stream on your own device. And of course we couldn’t get a signal throughout the whole flight so it was absolutely useless. On top of that unless you’re flying first class they will not let you purchase any alcohol drinks which is really a bummer. It’s nice to enjoy a glass of wine when you’re going on vacation."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Had great flight to & from Waikiki,"During Covid, we've adjusted our reviews for airlines, hotels, restaurants and other venues, as we SO want them all to survive and realize the numerous challenges they are facing.  So excellent during these trying pandemic times.So, we have no problem if things were not as great as before Covid. We were able to be upgraded on our way to HI and only my husband got upgraded to 1st class.  No problem at all.  We feel SO blessed no matter what the circumstances to be able to fly to various cities in the US, while we've lost friends and colleagues to this pandemic."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Horrible,The mask BS makes us laugh. The flight attendants love threatening to kick you out if your mask even comes slightly under your nose. Not sure how most people are happily complying with this. Just carry your fast food and eat during the entire flight and you can keep that mask off..just for your “Health” and safety. They should change their name from American to CCP. Pathetic!
Date of travel: September 2021,10,The ticket didn't exist?,"My sister bought a ticket from Palm Springs to Chicago to visit our family this Labor Day weekend. American didn't have a ticket for her on her first leg of the trip. They told her it didn't exist... Their desk clerks and phone customer service agents could not get her on the plane even though she had purchased the flight, had a confirmation number and itinerary. They could find tickets for the remaining legs of the trip, but not the first leg. They left her with no options but to buy another ticket that day when the prices had risen greatly. She was unable to visit. We are incredibly disappointed in American Airlines."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,American Airlines is the Worst,"American Airlines is completely inept. That, in itself, wouldn't be so bad if their customer service wasn't equally terrible.Delta puts them to absolute shame. Someday I will learn my lesson, and avoid booking with them. The results will be the same...as I will still end up not being on one of their planes or successfully reaching my destination with them."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Worst flight ever,Idk where to start the fact that I had a layover or that my flight was delayed 3 times with a hour increments each. Maybe if this wasn’t my first flight I would be a bit more understanding but no unacceptable as much as I can’t wait to fly my daughter on a plane I’ll be sure to drive a damn boat before using this unorganized company not to mention my TV isn’t working 😩
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Terrible baggage service American,There are no other American Airlines flight and it has taken over an hour and the first bag for anyone hasn’t arrived.
Date of travel: August 2021,40,Comfortable International Flight,"Transferred to this flight in DFW.  Routine flight, not too crowded, was able to lie down on three seats in the middle of the plane.  Good selection of movies and TV shows on the seat back entertainment system.   Several food and drink services.  American's website works well, booking the flight and seats was easy.  One advantage of flying American to Madrid is you land at Terminal 4, the nicest and most convenient terminal."
Date of travel: August 2021,40,Routine Flight,"Comfortable flight.  Check in was easy, a friendly and capable agent was available to make sure all our documents were correct, since we would be changing planes for an International Flight.  Good selection of movies, with screens on the seat backs.  Appreciated being able to choose our seats at the time we booked the flight.  I found the website easy to use."
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Gate agent set the tone….AA2839,"Demanding all bags, starting with group 5, be checked to final destination without investigation very poor service.  Tone, approach of gate agents rude and uncalled for. We paid more for a non stop flight.  Flight changed and routed thru Dallas per AA.  9 hours travel turned into 14. No refund for addl funds paid for nonstop.Then to mandate your carry on be checked to final destination from Dallas to Paris  - no toiletries, change of clothes or contact items very inconvenient.  An assessment of final destination would have been most appropriate; more so, the tone and method for collection unnecessary. The agents with Allegiant more friendly….I’m sure those with final destination of Dallas would have been than willing to check their bags first…perhaps a reason to service United."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst airline ever,"I was booked to depart from Philadelphia to Rochester aug 27 at 930pm. The flight was delayed multiple times till we are finally told that the plane coming in around 1am will be cleaned and will get us out of there. The plane lands and then right when we think we are about to board we are told we have to wait till 8am. No hotel accommodation, no refunds, even if we wanted to leave we couldnt because our luggage was aboard and there was no one to get it off for us. I ended up sleeping in the terminal...well...i didnt really get much sleep but i was there. They lied when they told us the reason so the delays they lied about the pilot being ""fatigued"". They made sure to have armed police guarding the place when they broke the news knowing what they were doing was wrong. The manager came out only to repeat the same useless info we already had. They were nice enough to give us snacks from the plane but not nice enough to do thier jobs. I ended up sitting in the terminal for over 11 hours.Ill never fly with American Airlines ever again. Those ""fatigued"" pilots sure had enough energy to literally run out of the airport away from all the people they screwed over."
Date of travel: August 2021,40,Good flight from LAX to SFO,"This was a regional jet from LAX to SFO.  It departs from a remote terminal.  You present yourself at Gate 52 and then need to take a bus to the remote terminal.  Oddly enough the remote terminal is more attractive, more comfortable, and less crowded than the main terminal.  If you have a large carry on you will check it as you get on and pick it up when you get off.  Its a long walk from the arrival gate to luggage claim, but my bag was waiting when I arrived.  No cabin service on this flight."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Never again,"Last minute flight to visit my sick mother, so I needed to have a connecting flight in Dallas.First flight was delayed...and delayed.... and delayed... No information given.Other flights had already left for Dallas, but no attempts were made to help anyone switch.  Our flight was finally cancelled.  Only 2 people were at the desk to help everyone find options even thought there was an AA service desk right next to the gate.  Finally, after 2 hours got set up on a flight to Dallas.Flight in Dallas was delayed.... Eventually told we needed to switch gates.Everyone standing waiting to board.... 30 minutes  I have 2 herniated discs Boarded the plane.  They forgot the luggage at the other gate.  Took 1.5 hours sitting on the plane, no service.Even the pilot had no explanation.Will never fly AA again"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,American Airlines,"I flew American Airlines from St Louis to Daytona Beach. This trip had a layover in Charlotte, NC. The initial flight from St Louis to Charlotte was delayed 3 hours, and the flight from Charlotte to Daytona was outright cancelled. I was forced to spend the night in Charlotte. I waited for my checked bags in Charlotte until 1AM to find out that all staff able to retrieve my checked bag had left for the night, so I missed my shuttle to the Charlotte hotel and had to pay for an Uber to the hotel. I insisted I needed my checked bag since there were prescriptions inside of my checked bag, but American Airlines staff refused to retrieve my checked bag. I was given 1 meal voucher and one hotel voucher. However, the hotel voucher did not cover the total cost of the room in Charlotte. American did not cover the cost of the Uber either. In summary, the airline appeared to be understaffed with disgruntled employees littered throughout my experience."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Mr,Delays coming and going.  More concerned about masks than anything else.  Tmwirst part of our trip was flying aa
Date of travel: August 2021,10,STAY AWAY!!! Go to another airline..spend the extra money.,"STAY AWAY!!!! Pay more money with another airline, it’s NOT worth it! I had $1900 out-of-pocket expenses American is refusing to reimburse me for.   I have been a customer of American Airlines (AA) for many years; I hold a Premium AAdvantage Card (with over 110K points) and I also hold an Admiral's Club Card as well.  On 8/14/21 I was on vacation with my family (wife and two children) returning home.  It started off with the flight from Savannah to Charlotte. We were supposed to depart at 12:43pm, with a connecting flight to Boston at 3:02pm. The flight kept getting delayed (and terminals moved) and we did not take off until almost 2:45pm (Already missing connecting flight). On top of that, the aircraft had a poorly working ground Air Conditioner (87 degrees outside; did not work well in the air as well). We were then diverted to Willington NC due to a ‘pop-up’ storm. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 HOURS with no ground A/C. Finally, they moved us to a terminal; where we sat for another 3hrs.  We then attempted to get a secondary flight home (since we missed our connecting flight) and we were given the “OPTION” of flying back to Boston 2 ½ days later, which would be the ‘earliest flight’ for four people. To make it home on-time for work, we booked with another airline (4 tickets). We finally took-off and got back to Charlotte at 10pm. American Airlines gave us no information when we landed, nor was there anyone to give us direction after landing so late. We rented a hotel room and paid for an uber to/from the hotel. (We also had to pay for additional day of parking and a day of kennel for my dog after finally making home).  This mistake of American Airlines cost me in total $1,900.00 because of the original delay of flight (weather was fine up until our LATE landing point).  I filed paperwork online with AA Customer Relations. I was THEN contacted by AA customer relations (after two weeks after putting in a ‘complaint’ and request for reimbursement) and they informed me that “Only the hotel would be reimbursed; we do not cover other ‘out-of-pocket’ expenses, since they offered me a flight home 2 ½ days later…SERIOUSLY???  I went as far as speaking to a Supervisor at AA who also reiterated the same information. Their new logo should be “AMERICAN AIRLINES, SOONER OR LATER WE’LL GET YOU SOMEWHERE...”"
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Being a member DOESN'T have any perks,"Where to start..I had finally earned enough miles to cash in a trip for my husband and myself.  Going to vacation, not an issue, but the trip home was a total nightmare.First, they moved us from the initial flight home to one 3 hours later.  When I called to see about changing to another flight, I was told I would have to cancel that trip/flight and either pay out of pocket or wait for my miles to be restored to use them.  It was the day before we were flying home so we just left it.Then on the actual day home, our initial flight got delayed twice-no reasoning why but we could still make our connector.  When we arrived in Charlotte and reached our gate, we were notified that this flight was also delayed.  Again no reason.  This flight went from leaving at 730pm to after 4 delays, 1041pm.  We went from getting home initially at 7pm to 1am.  Now I understand stuff happens, but there was no communication.  We were all sitting at the gate and no one was telling us anything and the plane was there, we got alerts that our luggage was on the plane but yet nothing.  We just sat.  The airport workers could have cared less as well.  They were obviously just waiting on our flight to leave because at one time there were 15 of them sitting around on their phones.  None of them offered us any water, snacks or explinations."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Things get stolen they don't care.,My parents were on this flight. At the door of the plane they asked to check my moms very small carryon because there wasn't anymore room. She didn't think about it but realized that other people with bigger bas were not being checked. She had a gold bracelet in her carryon and didn't think to take it out once they checked her bag. It wasn't until she was unpacking that she realized the bracelet  box was in her bag but the bracelete was gone. A brand new bracelete. Why did they not ask the people after my mom to check their bigger bags. She was singled out. I reached out to the Airline and spoke to the most lathargic individual to which I have ever spoken.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Denied hundreds of dollars in flight credits,"Words cannot cover how frustrated we feel right now. In May 2021, American Airlines cancelled our flight home and instead of refunding us, gave us flight credits for the return portion of the trip that was cancelled (amount around $321). In July, I had to cancel an American Airlines flight for $608 and was again given this amount in flight credits. Total, we had over $900 in flight credits to use within the year.Yesterday, we tried to use our flight credits to purchase a ticket for $474 - this was the amount VERIFIED with me on the phone - and we were told we had $838 in flight credits to apply; seemed close enough to what I had expected. After speaking to the ""help desk"", our representative told us we still needed to cover $64 because our flight credit didn't cover the ticket entirely...somehow the $838 didn't cover the $474. When I expressed confusion over this, the representative said there was nothing she could do about it and ""do you want to book your ticket or not?"" I went ahead and booked but called back this morning because we knew we were missing a large chunk of what we should have had. I was given SEVERAL explanations for what happened, ultimately being told all of the following: 1) The flight went up to $903 while I was on the phone last night and the person who verified $474 with me forgot to mention the increase...2) The flight back in May should have been refunded in cash, although we were given flight credits...3) That the help desk calculated everything correctly, it was because we didn't use half of our trip back in May (that THEY cancelled...and didn't give us a refund for)...4) Lastly, and perhaps most confusingly, they took our flight from May and put it into a multi-city trip for our upcoming trip to use the flight credits, resulting in a ticket over $900 (despite the fact we paid for half the trip back in May, THEY cancelled the other half of our trip, AND our receipt from the ticket booked just LAST NIGHT was $474 total, not $900 like they were claiming). I'm beyond disappointed that we have given this company so much of our time and money. We will NOT be booking with them again. Would not recommend booking with them, even if their prices are cheaper - they are cheaper for a reason."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Allianz Global Insurance,"This review is about Allianz Insurance, not about the airline, but I purchased the insurance through the AA website.  I cancelled the flights over a month ago for flights that are still 3 weeks from today, so I cancelled the flights well over 2 months out. I tried to cancel the trip insurance and the contact numbers for Allianz Insurance had me on hold for over an hour... twice. I emailed them the cancellation request with no acknowledgement from Allianz. Beware this travel insurance company... no customer service, and once you sign up, you can't cancel. I would suggest never getting travel insurance from this company until the day before your flight departs."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Well…,"Our experience with American Airlines was not the best as we thought it would be. This was the first time that American Airlines has charged us 90 dollars for each checked bag and we could’ve used those 90 dollars for a taxi because that was our only source of money that we had for our trip. On our first flight to our layover wasn’t bad but disappointing because of the fact that the seats weren’t cleaned at all, the airplane was an old airplane, and they only offered us some cookies to eat on that 4 hour flight! On our second flight once again the seat wasn’t cleaned and they have only gave us cookies and water which was very poorly of them to do when they charge us a lot for our flight ticket. I believe that they should start thinking of upgrading their food options because they have earned/have enough money to give passengers other things than just cookies like com’on. They don’t even offer a tv for economy class and they just mostly charged us a lot of money for almost everything. Very disappointing American Airlines. If you are doing this for people to pay for buisness or first class, big mistake American Airlines and you will eventually be on the number one worst airlines"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,I fly every month AA is horrible always an issue,Done with American Airlines always an issue when you fly American Airlines used to be good it was convenient because they are the largest and they have flights to go everywhere the problem is they don’t have anybody to work anymore. it’s always late there’s always a pilot missing or crew missing or a mechanical issue or something on every flight guaranteed - you cannot count on them for anything and they don’t care about your problems there is zero customer service.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,American Airlines = bad experiences,Flight was delayed several times. Had trouble getting my checked bag even though we specifically asked about this issue before leaving the airport. Had to spend the night in Dallas airport. I will NEVER fly American Airlines again. Terrible customer service and attitudes.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Totally disappointed with American Airlines
Never/ever again",Beware of American Airlines:  they seam to have at least 30 passengers on standby on most flights!We were scheduled to leave Athens at 12:45 on a Saturday they told the waiting area it had been delayed - ok - after 2 more hours we boarded!  We were on the plane about 1 1/2 hours and then ask to get off the plane and when we returned to the waiting area we were told the plane fuel gauge was not right and they needed to shut the system down and reboot - so another 2 hours at this time no water or food was offered!! About 4:30 we were to reboard -so here we go back on the plane after about an 1 hour or 2 we were told the the flight would be delay or canceled until 8 am the next morning and that we were to collect our luggage and go back to the waiting area!  In the waiting area we were told that you should go to luggage area and to collect all check luggage and someone from American airline would stay with us at all times!! Down in luggage we were told that they were trying to find a hotel for 250 people at that once we got our luggage we were to go outside for a bus and that American Airlines would get use all scheduled to fly and make all our connection the next day! So we get on these buses not knowing we’re we are going! Get to a hotel and we are told we are to be back in the lobby in the morning at 4 am to get a bus back to the airport!  Next day get to the airport at 5 am and there is not one American employee to greet use!  We have to line up - my daughter and I were in priority and we wait 2hr in line because they did not reschedule anyone!!!! They gave use our ticket and we were first/business is what we paired for and we were in economy!  I put it a claim and American Airlines gave me $29.00 for me $29.00 for my daughter!I am soooooo not happy with American Airline and would never suggest flight them!!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Want to be delayed on 3 consecutive flights, end up somewhere you didn’t plan, and have a generally horrible time?","American significantly disrespects their customers and does nothing to address it, ever.  Would take more energy to type out how poorly they’ve handled the last 4 flights I’ve booked with them than I have blood pressure to handle but suffice it to say - friends don’t let friends fly American Airlines."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Flight Got Rerouted 5 Times and Canceled Twice,My first flight got canceled and then rerouted 5 times with barely any assistance. Flight got canceled mid way through the first flight and had to call to get another flight same day. I kept getting lost because I was put into unknown airports and was offered zero assistance with getting flights to connect to where I was trying to go.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never again.,A six hour trip turned into a 13 hour trip that didn’t even get us to our final destination. ALL THREE flights were delayed and they kept screwing us over harder each time with no apologies or even a warning. Horrible customer service all around - except for the ONE flight attendant who gave us two packages of graham crackers after sitting on a plane for 2.5 hours without moving. We hadn’t eaten all day but they wouldn’t let us do anything. YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Terrible, Terrible, WILL NEVER/EVER FLY THIS AIRLINE.","On 8/7/21, my two sons flew AA to see their mom for vacation.  They flew from Hartford to Miami then to change planes and go onto  Pensacola, Fl.  They departed 1-1/2 hours late from Hartford which caused them to miss their connecting flight in Miami.  They had to rebook (which took more than two hours).  The rebooked flight was to leave the following morning very early about 6:00 am.  The two of them only had about two hours sleep.  The new flight was to go from Miami back to New York (couldn't believe it)!  They connected in New York with a flight to Pensacola.  On the flight to New York, there was a medical emergency (my son is a Respiratory Therapist) in which he was asked by the flight attendant to assist in the emergency.  This almost cost them to miss their connecting flight to Pensacola.  Their return flight was supposed to be on the 15th of August.  At midnight my son received a text that this flight was cancelled.  He called to rebook (another two hours) but was rebooked for a flight at 2:30 pm. that day.  Later that morning he was notified that the rebooked flight was also cancelled and that nothing was available until the following day.  The weather was clear, but tropical storm would be hitting the area the following day so it was clear they wouldn't get out that day either. A rental car was purchased and they drove back to Hartford (1300 miles) as they both needed to work the following day.  My son contacted AA for a refund for the return flight as well as the charge he paid for luggage to no satisfaction!  They would NOT refund the return flight monies.  This is disgusting!  If I could give them a minus number for a review, I would.  My family and I will NEVER/EVER fly American Airlines.  Buyer Beware!!!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,WORST AIRPLANE TRAVEL SERVICE EVER!!!! DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!!,"absolutely worst experience ever had on a plane. Have been flying for over 20 years and never had such an awful experience. Will never fly american airlines again. Stewardess was rude, obnoxious, and nasty. Asked to speak to general manger. She was absolutely horrible. She was more rude, and beyond nasty. Never had a problem on any other airline. American Airlines should check into there staff. This manger and stewardess such be fired! Absolutely horrible, awful experience. Do not fly American Airlines!"
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Logistically a nightmare,"The flight was delayed due to weather...not airline's fault but the reason I missed my connecting flight was that it took 20 minutes to get off the plane because they didn't have gate agent to meet our plane and when they finally showed up, they could not get the door of the plane open. I haven't flown American in a long time and I will not fly them again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,No customer service or compensation,"Was cancelled and delayed many time initially because it f “weather” even though there was no bad weather8 hours before my flight. Cancelled and delayed again because of crew problems. Was given so much bad attitude by employees who treated all the delayed as if they were plagues. Not sure why. Offered no help and no compensation. If you are delayed or cancelled because of some AA issue, they will not help you out or offer any compensation at all, just an email that says sorry."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst customer service,I’ve flown with my pet dog inside the plane on various occasions previously to this experience. I was going to visit my wife that is 5 months pregnant with disease that has her that has her grounded in Puerto Rico not being able to fly anywhere. I was called over to the counter as I approached the counter I was greeted by a nice lady in the computer and was asked for my ticket. Behind her there was a Lady with a grin on her face. She leaned over the lady in the counter and asked for my ID in a rude way. After that she shift her attention to my dog. Saying that I can’t fly with my dog cause it was too big. I told her that I’ve flown with my dog on that airlines in many occasions and never had any trouble. She said I’ll go get the supervisor. She went into the back and came back with a supervisor. You don’t need to be a genius to know that he was coming with a story and his mind made and in an arbitrary way said that I couldn’t fly with my dog. I asked him that what options did I have. And he said well leave it with someone. I told hi. The same that I have flown with my pet before and didn’t had any problems. He just shrugged his shoulders and left. While this was happening the lady with the grim went back and forward like trying to hear what I had to say. They left me without my emergency flight to visit my sick pregnant wife clueless and with no options. Oh yes they gave me a paper with a number for a refund that will take seven days. I put number one on the likeness to recommend because I could not put a zero or a negative 5000.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Awful,"Avoid AA at all costs. Rude employees, canceled and delayed flights with no alternatives offered. The literal worst flying experience ever"
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Nice flight but nightmare logistics,"Between delays, cancellations and rude employees the only good part of the flight were the attendants. Had to fight and beg to be let on a flight after mine was delayed just to be scolded about my luggage not being checked in as if they hadn’t just heard what I was begging for. The attendants and flight staff were great but after speaking to customer service about the incident they told me to go screw myself and choose another airline if I’d like. First time flying after starting college and likely the last it will be with American. For a company that prides themselves on the name of the worlds greatest country they sure know how make us look bad. Couldn’t be more satisfied with the flight staff, couldn’t be less with the rest"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"bad services. Waited 9 hours,  changes from flight to flight and yet they cancelled the last. Same leg 1. Bad airline.",Worse airline ever. Hpn to DVa waited 4 hours. Dca to hpn canceled after waiting for 7 hours put on a flight to Jfk 2 hours to my hone waited another 5 worst experience ever. It will be a long time for me to go with American airlines
Date of travel: August 2021,10,American airlines screws over customers,"I am traveling from Alaska to Pittsburgh and my first two flights (Alaska to Phoenix and Phoenix to DC went fine. But that all stopped matter ING when I got into DC and found that my last flight to Pittsburgh was canceled, and was moved to the following day. I get it the weather is bad can't take a flight but what is unacceptable is stranding all of your customers in a strange city without providing any form of accommodation, or shuttle or even partial reimbursement. The customer service was actually suggesting people wait 13-18 hours in the airport. I've never flown and airline that handled a situation this poorly. I would not recommend American Airlines."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Our wonderful flight attendant- Clifton!!,"I got on the plane needing to use the restroom but I thought I could wait till we took off. For some reason, it seemed to have taken a lot longer than usual. Then it came to a point where I couldn’t hold it anymore so I called up the flight attendant to see if I can just go quickly. But, the plane was already in motion and was told if I went then we needed to tell the pilot and stop the plane completely. I said nvm I will do my best to hold it till we took off. Let me tell you I was fighting for my life and tears started running down cause I was scared that I was going to make the entire plane smell like piss. As soon as we took off, my life flashes before my eyes and Clifton the flight attendant ran up to me, held my hand to rush to the restroom, and saved me from being put on the no fly list 😭 so I just needed to send a shoutout and give this airline a 10 star review. Thanks again AA and especially CLIFTON!! I hope you see this message ☺️-Jessica ❤️"
Date of travel: August 2021,40,Supervisor Compliment.,"Ms. LauraLeigh, M., Supervisor, Myrtle Beach airport, had the chore of asking for 10 people to give of their seat due to weight restrictions. She worked diligently to get us booked on another fight the following day. Hats off to her patience and kindness for accommodating us greatly.  Best wishes to you LauraLeigh, M.!"
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Best airline if you want to be late.,"I travel for work multiple times every week and I avoid American at all cost. They use to be my go to airline but after multiple delays (for no given reason) and missed connections I switched to delta and never looked back. I had to book a flight through American because it was the only one out of FLL the night I needed to leave. Might as well waited until the next morning to fly Delta because guess what? Yup you guessed it, sitting on the tarmac for no reason waiting for take off. Not sure if they need to expand their terminal (at every airport apparently) because I feel like there is ALWAYS a line for takeoff."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst airline company ever,"My flight to Cincinnati OH  from Jackson WY got delayed because a pilot didn’t show up. The flight was supposed to leave around 3pm, we boarded the plane, and then they made us deboard the plane. The flight got rescheduled for 9am the next morning so the airline crew made us schedule our own hotel rooms and said they would fully reimburse us as long as the hotel room is under $700 a night and provide us food vouchers for any restaurants we go to as long as we don’t put alcohol on the bill and keep the receipt.The next morning we were told that they actually would not be getting reimbursed for our dinner and that they only provide food vouchers for the restaurant at the airport (there was only a single restaurant there and after waiting in a HUGE line to get checked in we didn’t even have time to go get food from the airport restaurant). The customer service representatives at check in also gave us a link to american airline’s website to get reimbursed for the hotel (even though they said we would get reimbursed the next day). It is now almost a month later and the american airline’s customer service finally emailed me back about the hotel reimbursement and they didn’t even fully reimburse me, they only gave me 3/4 of what I paid for the hotel. I told them this was unacceptable and that I needed a full refund because that is what I was told I was going to get while I was at the airport. The representative got back with me and explained that I was misinformed and that they could not provide a full reimbursement to me but yet gave me a $125 trip credit to fly with them again. I WILL NOT EVER FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN!!! They are extremely disorganized and completely let me down."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Bad customer service,Worst airline ever!! Worst customer service from cabin crews!! Not worth to spent $ in such a worst worst airlines!!!
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Great Service in the Air,Staff was so friendly and attentive but not bothersome.   COVID protocols were enforced with friendliness.  I have flown between China and America many times but this was my first with AA… will definitely book again.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Delays,"Bad delays with no heads up on how long delay would be. Had round trip flight to my destination and back both flights delayed. Missed my rental appointment, upon reaching my destination. Don't ever fly American airlines if u wanna be there on time. 5hr delay going and 2hr delay coming back. They suck! Period!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Bad Airline,Delayed baggage outbound. Lost baggage inbound.  Received notice plane from DFW Delayed so bad that we would miss our home flight so they put us on United.  United got us home. American washed their hands of us. Baggage showed up 2 days later. This was only after going to the airport to track our baggage.  Never fly American again...
Date of travel: August 2021,10,By far the worst airline ever,"Apparently American Airlines doesn’t have enough staff, enough gas or enough pilots. All fights that I have been on for the last couple of months have been delayed and instead of them switching the times delaying the flights by hrs they do it in 15 min increments and have everyone standing around looking stupid! Trash ass Airline"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible Delays,"Both going to San Diego and coming back to Phoenix, my flight was delayed by 2 hours. They do a terrible job at updating reasons for the delays. They just keep increasing the delayed times at increments. I can understand a delay maybe once, but once it's consistent, this is unacceptable. This is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed and improved."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Like a train trip to a death camp but less fun,"Since it was my birthday we decided to splash out for 1st class. What a waste of money that turned out to be. Cabin crew were rude and one woman was extremely aggressive, waking me up by firmly grabbing my wrist. Since when are they allowed to put their hands on customers. My crime? Apparently whilst asleep my mask slipped down. Oh the horror! I wanted to return the favor of wanted physical contact but I would have ended up in handcuffs. She just stormed off as free as a Harpy. Never using this airline again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Big Delay,"Our flight from Indy was delayed. We arrived at the Philadelphia gate, only to be told by one AA employee the door was closed. Another employee wasn't sure if it was closed. After spending 5 minutes with that, the decision was made it was closed. So we missed our connecting flight. Even though the plane was sitting there for 15 minutes. We were placed on a flight to our destination (Norfolk, VA) that was leaving 3+  hours later. Keep in mind we are trying to get home because my husband is in the process of planning his Mother's funeral. Of the 2 employees we dealt with, one displayed optimum customer D laCruz. On the other hand the other employee Ms. Aravella displayed the worst customer service. She threatened to tear up our boarding passes. The woman should NOT deal with customers in any manner. We asked to speak to her manager and was told everyone was in a meeting. Also, someone would come see us after the meeting. It's poor customer service at it's worst. Hopefully this is just the Philly way and not the American Airlines way."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS,"Do not take this airline. They are very unprofessional and don’t accommodate to your needs. We had to stay the whole night at the airport due to a delay caused by them. They didn’t give us flights directly to New York when there was space and told us to purchase another set of tickets just to get on the flight. It was utterly ridiculous. We asked for hotel vouchers, but got none. We had to have 3 layovers just to get to our destination. Extremely infuriating. The staff also shows attitude when asked questions. The management needs to be improved immediately. This is unacceptable!!! Customer service does nothing. Take your money elsewhere if you want to avoid a headache."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,I give American credit,"Although I am not happy that American canceled our 12:12 PM flight on Sunday, Aug. 22 and switched us to an 8:40 AM flight without ever notifying us (we only found out the day before when we tried to check in to the canceled flight) we were somewhat surprised that they didn't cancel the morning flight due to the stormy weather associated with the hurricane which passed us as we were flying.  As it turned out we arrived at PBI about 10 minutes early, so we were quite pleased overall.  We were served a rather filling breakfast in First Class, something we hadn't seen in years."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Canceled our flight and never notified us,"Very upset with American, scheduled to go out on a morning flight. I check the day before my emails and they cancelled our flight which we booked thru Hotwire. I immeditely called Hotwire and they stated that American called us and sent an email on this canceled flight. Told Hotwire that never happened. So someone is not being honest. Hotwire spoke to American and  was able to get us out back to Islip on their last night flight, which was great, but screwed up our schedule."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Bad service,"The staff ,food, handling missing luggage is terrible No welcome stuff don’t care about clients time In general I regret traveling with American Airlines They changed my return flight to the worst connection you can have My husband they canceled his flight without notice Calling the customers services for hours to solve the problems no one cares they leaving you on hold Than hung the phone My luggage is missing since 8/9/2021"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Ridiculously irresponsible,"American treats 17 year olds as adults and guess what?! They are NOT!! My daughter got stuck in a foreign country due to American’s negligence and lack of information. As if that wasn’t enough I got yelled at by the customer service rep AND on top of that I was told that there would be a $300 fare difference charged to my card and they charged me $400 instead!!!  Most stressful, horrible, expensive experience for me and for my child herself. RUDE, EXPENSIVE, AND USELESS airline. Worst summer for my daughter yet for sure."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst and the most irresponsible airline ever,"This is worst airline I have ever used. They take no responsibility for their actions and give no answers to their customers. It has been more than 10 days that my bag has been lost and they do not even answer my calls. This was my first trip to America and I came to chicago, I had a layover about 12 hours and took my bags to the recheck center but when I got to state college and one of my bags was missing. I am an international student and all my stuff was in that baggage, some of my jewelries in that baggage handed down through my family and I got depressed after this event. You cannot even imagine how irresponsible all the staff, managers and head courters are. They have no respect to their customers and I am really mad at them and I will absolutely never flight with this airline forever. I will surely sue them.I hate American Airlines."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,DO NOT TAKE AMERICAN if you are not rich.,"I’m not sure if anyone will see this. But American Airlines is one of the worst airlines you can ride. They have no customer service. I had the blue service light on for a full hour and no one noticed. The leg room is literally bare minimum, I wasn’t even able to bend down to reach my bag, my head was stopped by the seat. On one of my flights the entire plane was almost empty snd they still wouldn’t move people up to empty first class seats. They are basically telling humanity that people with money are better and deserve better than people who don’t have money.  I was also on a 8 hour flight during the night. They do not serve food whatsoever. It’s all snacks.If I could give them negative stars, I would. Their pilots are adequate. It was a good landing."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Will NOT help ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY,"Booked a night flight, the last one out, less than 2 days ago to go to visit family and friends over a weekend. Was informed that I would be able to leave work early so I figured I'd try to change my flight several hours earlier since there were so many going to my final destination.  The rep said I'd have to pay $291 to change my flight a few hours earlier. I looked at the flight and half the plane was open... They wouldn't even do anything to help Active Duty Military. This airline is not so American after all. Other airlines will gladly move those who serve this country if there are open seats on another flight. Everyone tells me never to fly American and I thought I'd give it a try...turns out everyone was right!  Can't cancel now because I'll only get refund (fingers crossed) and have to rebook on American. Learned my lesson the hard way. PLEASE JUST TAKE A DIFFERENT AIRLINE."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Very nasty crew members,"The crew members didn't let me eat because they wanted me to have a mask all times, and during eating they told me that i need to have my mask on and cant eat so long, prior to arrival they gave me a notice of dangerous people don't fly, even i had a mask all time of the flight"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Multiple Flight Cancellations (several DAYS!),"American Airlines cancelled my flight less than 12 hours in advance and repeatedly cancelled subsequent flights they put me on for multiple days in a row!!!No reason was provided for the cancellations. I ended up booking a flight from Delta because it was impossible to get a hold of American Airlines call wait times were HOURS and they did not call back when I asked to be placed on a callback list.  After I finally got a hold of AA, they refused to refund me for the flight I had to find on my own and they still have not refunded me for they flights they cancelled. (it has been one month). I dont think I could ever justify flying with this company ever again and I definitely do not recommend anyone else do the same."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Will never fly with American again,I was GREATLY disappointed in American Airlines services and customer relations. The mobile boarding pass does not specify boarding ends 15 mins before the flight leaves and SIX passengers were turned away 12 mins before the flight was scheduled to leave. The manager did not help in any way and would not let us pass. No refund or voiture was given for being turned away from our flight. I WILL NEVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN. I have never had a problem like this before and i have never been so angry with how I was treated by an airline.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,filthy plane,"Our plane was delayed 4 hours going home(Philadelphia).  I understand this happens, but the changes were coming in constantly. Our 6:00pm flight never boarded until almost 10:00pm., meanwhile Charleston Airport being very small shut down all food places around 6.  They gave us the chance to book another flight for the next day but most of us got rides to the airport in time for our regularly scheduled flight.  We were the last 20 or so people left at the airport.  Our plane was gross!!! I had dried blood on my arm rest which I cleaned off with several wipes.  My seat and the cracks between the seat were so skeevy and gross I wrapped my sweatshirt around my arms and legs and put it in the wash first thing at home along with my backpack.  Unsanitary and totally gross."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Unwilling to compensate,I had to go my entire vacation without any of my clothing or sanitary items because they were lost as I checked by carry on luggage and now American is being difficult about giving me the money I spent. Replacing my basic items that they lost. Never again will I fly American.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible,They managed to lose my carry on and though I made multiple calls though their automated service I spent the entire trip with no clothing. Do not trust them. Do not call them. Do not fly with this airline.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,AA OFFERED TRAVEL VOUCHER DAY PRIOR FOR ANYONE WILLING TO CHANGE FLIGHTS- MYSTERIOUSLY FLIGHT WAS CANCELLED LAST MINUTE,"AA stranded us in Chicago. Airline was offering travel vouchers the day prior to anyone willing to change their flights and then mysteriously our flight got cancelled before boarding. No hotel voucher for being stranded in Chicago. When we wrote to customer service they said flight was cancelled due to weather - that is crap! We had to pay for our hotel room in Nashville for the night we got stranded in Chicago and for our last minute hotel in Chicago. Seriously, American Airlines may seem cheaper when booking, but they aren't! AVOID THEM IF POSSIBLE!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Dr,Bad airlines horrible service horrible legroom bogus charges true many hidden fees borderline scam I would not recommend this airline to anyone
Date of travel: August 2021,10,The absolute worst airline in the world. If they’re the only airline flying. Just get a rental car and drive.,"They’re the absolute worst, airline in existence. I booked a ticket from Savannah to Buffalo. Not only was my flight delayed due to a pilot scheduling error. But when I missed my connection, they treated it as if I’m at fault for a plane flying 3 hours after intended takeoff time. Then they left me on standby for 9 HOURS. And when I finally got on the plane home. They lost my luggage.  After I tracked them down and spoke to them. They were able to recover only one of them and I’m still waiting on the second. I warn you. Do not do any business with this company. They have no respect or decency for the customers. They charge prices like they’re Delta or United but give service worst than even Allegint or Spirit. Their operation is incompetent from top down.  If you value your time, money, or sanity. Do NOT FLY with American Airlines. They’re a disgrace to the American identity they cling to"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Recommend different airline,"I pre-checked and still in line after an hour to do a bag drop. Haven’t even made it through security yet. Always get to airport 3 hours early if you decide to go with American, even for domestic. Then got on plane and there was no overhead storage for my luggage. There is already no leg room and I guess they allow people to use my overhead storage too. Maybe this is common but for now on I will try to find a different airline. I travel a lot and never had such a miserable experience."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"If you fly with American be ready for delays, cancellations and horrible customer service.DO NOT FLY AMERICAN","American during Covid has been a disaster but even before Covid American was a company that thinks their crap doesn’t stink. If you fly American this is what you will experience currently. They are canceling and delaying flights everyday when they cancel or delay they will give you zero accommodations if they cancel and you spent $800 on a flight and they rebook you on another airline where the flight would cost $200 they will not refund you any money. When there is problems it will take multiple days to get a hold of customer service on the phone or by email that’s not an exaggeration it takes multiple days. If they cancel the flight by law they must refund the flight if you request it, I highly recommend getting your money back and using any other air line you can get better service from low class airlines. On top of all that the airport staff and customer service support will give you zero apologize and also some will be rude and condescending when you give them zero disrespect, I was nice because I thought this isn’t their fault and the airline attendant was rude and acted like I inconvenienced him by having him book me on another flight. If you travel for business and need to be places on time and even the same day as you planned do not fly American. I don’t travel a ton but I went on maybe 20 American flights in the last year and they where horrible and extremely unreliable. I went on about 50 flights with other airlines in the last year and none of them had anywhere near the problems, disrespect and unreliable service as American. Maybe 2 flight where delayed."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,CANCELLED FLIGHT WITH NO SUPPORT,"American Airlines has been canceling a bunch of flights at this airport. They canceled my flight yesterday, they sent us to a gross hotel with no rooms available after I wasted a long time on the line. My flight is only at 3pm, there was no way to wait at the airport. I called them requesting an early flight and they didn’t do anything to help me."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Great customer service!!!   Would definitely recommend them.,"I booked non-refundable tickets with American for travel to attend a Memorial service.   Subsequently, the venue changed the date to outside my flight timeframe so I cancelled my flights.   I called American and explained the situation.   THEY GAVE ME A FULL REFUND!!!  Bottom Line: I highly recommend American Airlines for excellent customer service."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,AMERICAN AIRLINES fails AGAIN!  Wheelchair bound and my petite wife had to push me from the plane,"Returning from my recent trip to Guatemala with my wife and with me still in a wheelchair do to  a recent surgery, I was amazed that upon arrival in the U.S. there were only 2 men trying to help what seemed like 15 or so people needing help off the plane. Thankfully one of them was able to get me up the ramp but from there we were on our own. Two carry on bags, a broken foot and my petite wife trying to get us at least a quarter mile to customs and then downstairs to claim luggage.  American Airlines knew we were coming and needed help. It’s on my ticket! They were able to help on the outbound trip and at the airport in Guatemala. This seems to me one of the MOST simple tasks and a true need for anyone traveling with a disability. Thankfully mine is temporary, but I don’t know what the rest of the passengers needing help did.If you see someone needing help don’t hesitate to ask if you can step in. I know I won’t after this ridiculous lack of humanity on AA’s part. I’m ashamed of what was once the leader in so much of air travels history. Customer Service is dead, at least with American Airlines"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,First Class my A** : American Airlines no longer cares about customers,"Unbelievable that an American Airlines MOST loyal customer, an Airpass Member and Executive Platinum Member and AA customer for more than 40 years, is forced to say AA is a disgrace! American Airlines has lost their way. And if I hear someone say “its due to COVID” one more time I might throw up. NO EXCUSESAfter a surgery required me to need a wheelchair to get on board my recent flight, I was amazed that there was NO pre boarding for anyone. In fact the gate agent called groups 1-4 at once. All the ground crew cared about was getting everyone on the plane so it wasn’t late departing. Thank God I was in First Class so I didn’t have to get further back in the plane amid the line of passengers with my crutches and baggage. Even once on board the new 737-800, I was amazed that the First Class seats have so little room, no padded arm rest any more, very little recline and such hard seats that my back was killing me after the 3 hour flight (shorter than most I have to take). I am 5’10”, 155 lbs and even I didn’t have much room. And what happened to the preflight drink? COVID, yeah right, because as we all know a drink of water OR alcohol before flying increases your chances of catching the nasty illness. Then when I tried to log on to AA Inflight the system was down and stayed down for the entire flight! Ridiculous! First Class meal: a disgusting choice of dry sandwich or a pimento cheese sandwich. Really? On an international flight? First Class prices and a hard seat with no head room, no leg room, no recline and lucky me (because I get food at all) a sandwich that even the staff said they wouldn’t eat. BTW, the one plus on this flight was the crew. They were great. This has not been the norm on many recent flights I have taken but this crew was excellent. And upon landing and trying to retrieve my luggage, I faced an issue that has been ongoing for years now. Priority tagged luggage is supposed to be first off the plane. Clearly NO ONE has any training on this anywhere in the world. Why am I paying Extremely High Prices to travel First Class? I dont know. I am definitely not getting my moneys worth.Between problems with AAs new “enhanced account management platform” that isn’t setup for use on phones and tablets (that’s right, upgrading technology so it no longer works on the most widely used platform in the world), not being able to make online reservations as an Airpass member, not being able to see the cost of flights I reserve until AFTER my flight when I get my statement, and ZERO response to requests for help, I am amazed at how they treat the most loyal customers. I was recently stranded half way through a trip when the “ enhanced account management platform” erased me from Americans system. Before that I was stranded in Eastern Europe with my wife and kids because of flight cancelations and the fact that Airpass offices were only open weekday Central Standard time. REALLY!!! I must be missing something because I get emails from AA all the time telling me how much they appreciate my loyalty. Where are the leaders of this once great airline who actually care about its reputation and the care of its customers?American Airlines clearly doesn’t care about their customers and if they are not careful we will seek out alternatives and they will be out of business."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Terrible check-in, baggage lost, incompetent agents SHANNON & DEBRA","I want to share with everyone our terrible experience with American Airlines. I´m requestion a compensation for the major errors and disrespectful approach committed by the American Airlines check-in agents Shannon and Debra on August 14th, 2021 in the airport of Denver, Colorado.As a member of Iberia Plus Level Golden we approached to the priority check-in desk where we were attended by an agent Shannon. He was very slow and disrespectfully told my husband that he could not find his membership card and that we should go and make a non-priority line. My husband showed him his membership number but he still was struggling with the computer for at least 20 minutes. It was his first severe mistake that led to the fact that he charged us an extra 100 dollars for the additional luggage to which we had the right with the golden status. For every detail he was asking for help to his colleague Debra who was also absolutely helpless y demonstrated her anger and impatience to us. It was obvious that both of them had no idea of what they were doing, i believe it was their first day at the desk.The time was ticking and Shannon was not advancing with the check-in process. All the passengers who were doing a non-priority line were already enjoying their coffee with the family meanwhile us were hoping that this man would finally wake up and finish the check-in correctly. Another mistake was that he never asked for a COVID test that makes part of the obligatory questions at the check-in. But he asked me about the expiration date of my German passport, weird though. His next terrible mistake was that did not want to accept our baby car seat. He is not aware that each ticketed customer is allowed a car seat to be checked free of charge. This point made us loose other 15 minutes. Finally he accepted it but claimed that it’s oversize and should be placed to a special oversize luggage area. His final icing on the cake mistake was that he printed only one ticket on my husband´s name from Miami to Madrid justifying himself that me and my baby had to go the registration desk in Miami and request their tickets there. It was absolutely useless to explain him that my baby has the same european nationality as my husband has and this is completely non-sense what he was doing. Consequently, all the 3 luggages that were on mine and my son’s name were not registered correctly and we never received them in Madrid.To sum up, i want you to have a clear image of the errors committed by your employee Shannon:- Shannon did not recognize us as a member and demonstrated disrespect- Shannon charged us 100 dollars for the luggage to which we had the right- Shannon stole 1 hour of my time with my family and ruined the last moments with my family members who stayed in Colorado- Shannon has no idea how to register luggage and carseat- Shannon does not know that he needs to ask for a COVID test- Shannon did not print our tickets from Miami to Madrid Now I’m ready to share with you the consequences of the actions of this unprofessional and rude agent Shannon:- We lost 1h of our time at the check-in desk - Arriving to Miami we had to run to different desks in order to get our tickets to Madrid (the ticketing desk was not working, the American Airlines desk was overcrowded) So we had to go to our departure gate and wait for one hour for an Iberia agent. We could have spend 2 hours in the lounge area peacefully with our baby but because of SHANNON we stayed 2 hours in the departure area full of people and no place to sit. - We had to make a 30 minutes line on order to get hot beverages in Miami and waste money- Arriving to Madrid we spent 2 hours of waiting for our 3 luggages that never arrived and were lost because of SHANNON- In the lost luggages there were all our personal things my corporate computer and all the chargers. I could not work! And to add that the famous carseat never arrived, so because of SHANNON’s terrible mistakes my baby had to take a taxi unprotected. 4 days with our luggage, hours lost on the phone trying to get a human but they have an automated replies that absolutely drive crazy!Lastly, dear American Airlines, Shannon and Debra should not be working at the priority check-in desk. There are so many talented people in search of work who deserve this working place much more than these two un professionals."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible,"They should change their name to Tardiness airline. Can they ever ever be on time?Clear weather, middle of the day, flight was delayed and I lost my connection. Arrived 4.5 hours late to DC. Transportation from airport was closed then and uber charged me 100 dollars to get me to town.I specifically choose time to avoid this and minimize my wait at the airport but I should have expected this….Really embarrassing… I will never fly Tardiness airlines…"
Date of travel: August 2021,20,American Airlines Flight Attendant says CARES Child Harness isn't allowed on flights,"Recently my wife, our 12 year old daughter and 2 year old son flew American Airlines from TUS to AUS.  The final leg of the trip was DFW to AUS.  We boarded the flight and our 2 yr old was sitting in the middle seat next to me (aisle) and our daughter (window). We have been flying with a CARES Kids Fly Safe Airplane Harness for years without an issue.  The Harness is FAA approved and authorized on ALL US carriers.  After securing our son in the harness (which acts similarly as a car seat for small children), a flight attendant walked by and took an interest in the harness.  She returned a short time later with another FA who abruptly and rudely told me that the harness was not allowed on any American Airlines flight because it posed a safety risk.  I advised that it was FAA approved and she said she didn't care - it was not approved on American Airlines aircraft she said.  She ordered me to remove it.  I had the distinct impression had I argued the point, I could have faced legal ramifications or arrest for interference with flight crew.  I was furious.  But, I relented and removed the harness.  Flight was delayed.  The FA came back a short time later and told me she was on the phone with her supervisor and asked to see the FAA label.  I showed it to her.  She returned a moment later and told me that while AA forbids ANYTHING to attach to the seat, they would allow us to use the harness ""this time"" but only in the window seat - as if it was a huge favor.  While the FA eventually relented, the fact is that it is a definite issue if a seasoned American Airlines FA didn't know that the only FAA approved child safety harness was authorized for use on this flight.  It is on the FAA website, the AA website AND in the American Airlines flight manual.  Yet this FA - argued with me that it was not allowed.  And, when she finally allowed me to use it, she still refused to admit that it was allowed.  So either she still didn't know, or she allowed me to use a device she believed to be restricted on AA aircraft.  Either way, its not reassuring.  Long story short - if you use a CARES Kids Fly Safe harness, make sure to go to the CARES website and print off all the FAA paperwork.  Also, check on the AA website and print off the AA policy.  Apparently their employees are not clear on them.And if this wasn't bad enough, American does not allow early boarding for those of us with young children.  DO none of them have toddlers and understand it takes extra time to situate kids on a flight?  This makes no sense."
Date of travel: August 2021,30,Connecting Flight,The flight was good from Boston to Phoenix but our connection to Fresno was delayed. Ugh. I have had good luck with them in the past but….
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Employee causes us to nearly miss flight,Employee named Ellary at the check in counter told us that we required a negative covid test to board despite being vaccinated. We proceeded to sprint to a rapid test center and paid $330 for a negative test. After we arrived back at the check in counter 4 minutes before missing our flight and we were told that we after all did not need the test due to us being vaccinated. Now I am out $330 and nearly missed a 10 day trip due to Ellary.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Due to previous expensive airplane tickets, my wife and I went to both Mexico and Hawaii with American Airlines, on our Mexico flight, there were 18DELAYS!!! we ended up staying the night in the Airport due to there only being 4-5 hours before the morning flight, we were given no hotel discounts or some kind of discount on the food. On our recent Hawaii return flight, they made a mistake with our luggage and I had to correct it myself as they were too inept and lazy even though they made the mistake. we were on a 6.5 hour of flight with nothing to eat BUT A SINGLE COOKIE, they only came through once with water/pop I notified the staff if I could get more water, and the whole time they were very annoyed. This is very basic stuff especially, in a customer service role.The ""entertainment"" is an app you personally download on your phone and if flying to Hawaii there are times the service gets disconnected, other airplanes I've been on had actual MEALS and screens on the back of every seat.American Airlines FAILS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE customer service and accomodations for their own issues,Had to stay overnight for the second time in my second trip with American Airlines this year. Both times they blamed weather which is significant because it means they are not legally required to provide any sort of hotel accomodations or food vouchers. Both times I had to pay for expensive hotels and all food out of pocket.  Even worse they don't try to work with you to get earlier standby flights because they don't care to take an extra minute to help stranded customers that are stranded because of the airlines own ineptitude.   If you have any other option do not fly with them.  I will gladly spend a few hundred more flying a different airline because you'll end up paying the same amount anyway for the hotels and food you have to buy when they inevitably cancel your flight or cause you to miss your connection.  I would only recommend American Airlines to my worst enemy.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,I could have driven there faster...,"It started off OK - only a 30  minute delay which they said we could make up in the air. We did - except that Chicago wouldn't let us land on schedule. So we circled for over and hour. When we were in need of fuel, they sent us to St. Louis. Once we landed, we sat at that airport (on the plane) for over four hours. NO food. Nothing to drink. We even ran out of toilet paper, but someone went into the St. Louis airport and got some for us. Once we were ready to take off, they gave us a 10 minute window to get seated and back on the tarmac. We missed the window and sat in the ""penalty box"" for another hour. Did I mention that I missed my connecting flight? A three hour flight ended up taking nearly 10 hours.  Got into Chicago at 1am and my husband finally just drove down and picked me up instead of waiting TWO DAYS for the next connecting flight. Unbelievable. Drive if you can - or take another airline."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Absolute Disaster,"This was a terrible experience. Our plane arrived late, so we were already missing our connections. When I did get on a new flight, the plane had engine trouble. After we sat in the plane for an hour and they couldn't fix it, we had to deplane and wait for another plane to arrive. A trip that should have taken 7 hours took 21. Slept in the airport. Nothing about this trip was pleasant. Just wondering - maybe it was every employee's first day on the job?"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Missed 2 days of work due to delays and cancelations.,"Will never book American Airlines again. Flight delayed then canceled. Wait time for customer service almost 2 hours to make changes.  At airport a new flight was booked for next day.  Extremely long layover in Dallas and yet another delay. 2 days work missed because of all this. After reading other reviews here and on American airlines Facebook page, this is a common occurrence that they have no interest in fixing or accommodating people for."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,never again,"the absolute worst experience i have ever had flying. my husband and i are finally about to take our honeymoon. they changed our flight numerous times; then 20 min before boarding cancelled the flight all together. we were instructed to call a phone number to get the tickets transferred .,. then charged us 325 to go onto the next flight 7 hrs later. when speaking with other passengers who were to board the same flight this morning and had transferred; they weren’t charged. i am literally writing this from the plane right now. once i land i will be calling corporate and if i’m not refunded the money i will be taking it up with the bank. terrible service, expensive, and spoken to as if it was our fault the flight was cancelled. cannot stress enough- NEVER AGAIN WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES. have absolutely no problem with jet blue."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst customer service I've ever had,"If I could give less than one star, I would. We had to wait for our Covid results at the San Jose airport in Costa Rica. We were prepared for that (made an appt, arrived four hours before our flight, etc.) but the lab was extremely delayed and despite our repeated calls to them, we didn't get our results until almost an hour exactly before our international flight left. We hustled to the counter and were ""helped"" (if you could call it that) by J. Castro. He informed us we couldn't board this late and was extremely rude and condescending. My husband is much calmer and more patient than I am and even he was at the point of losing it. J. Castro said we had to board much earlier and that it was posted everywhere and we should have planned better. Not only that, but our connecting flight was flat out cancelled and delayed an entire day. That was literally the worst customer service experience I've ever had. I won't be flying American ever again.Now we're in a hotel overnight even though we did everything right and were completely condescended to and talked to like we were idiots by the only agent at the counter."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Awful flight, never flying AA again","The plane was half empty, and they wouldn't let me move to a seat in the same section but with more legroom.  ""If you want those seats you have to pay"".  After I paid $35 for Wifi they told me I'm not allowed to use it to call people.  ""It's illegal to talk to the ground"".  Utter nonsense!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Don't do it,"They're really bad. Flight got delayed 3 times. Wasted half day just waiting at the airport then waiting. It took them even longer to play the plane so we all had to sit inside for a very long time as well. They overbooked the flight and ended up giving my seat number to 2 people at the same time. I ended up no having a seat and was moved from one seat to another 4 times until they found me an empty seat. I shouldn't have had that happen to me when I already paid like everyone else and had my seat selected. The staff didn't was very dry and I didn't even get an apology for the inconvenience. Don't do it, stay away of this company."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,You’ll never get to your destination.,"When I arrived at the airport I was informed my plane was late I would miss my connection. The rep changed my connecting flight to one 2 hours later. When I got to my gate I was informed that the plane that was originally running 20 minutes behind would now not leave for 3 hours. My flight was officially delayed in 10 minute increments although we were told we wouldn’t leave for 3 hours which resulted in everyone making a connection missing their connection. I called to find another route. The representative found me another route then would not book it for me saying my original flight is my best option. I then had to wait in line for 2 hours to get rebooked for a flight at 6 am the next day. I am now in Dallas, awaiting my connection to Portland. With 30 minutes until boarding, I was notified of a delay. I asked why…. They are missing a flight attendant and don’t know when they will get one. The rep has now disappeared. The first leg of my trip to Dayton was cancelled 10 hours before departure with no reason given. This is the worst run airline I have ever been on. Ever. Find another way to wherever you are going."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,The worst sevice of my life,The worst airline ive ever flown on! The worst customer service i have ever encountered! I would recommend never flying with them. I even bought flight insurance which is worthless. I ended up buying a different ticket with united. What a complete waist of time and money. I hope they go out of business!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Cancel flight then blame weather!,Stranded at airport for more than 12 hours because they cancel flight and blame the weather. Both Phoenix and Omaha had sunny weather at the time of the flight.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Awful, every which way! Avoid it like the plague!","Awful, every which way! Avoid it like the plague!  They delayed/cancelled the flight for no apparent reason, at least none was really provided and we had to scramble to find a different airline to fly home for an emergency.   They didn't want to refund us, trying to pass the buck on Priceline who ultimately said American Airlines is responsible."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Delayed 3 times and cancelled after 6 hours,"Worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Flight was delayed from Paris to Dallas, and then delayed 3 times for flight to San Antonio that was eventually cancelled leaving dozens of families stranded in the airport. No rental cars were available and the airline refused to provide hotel or transportation accommodations. Customer service was extremely rude and unhelpful. Stood in multiple lines for hours."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,THE WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"AA cancel flight the night before. Will not answer the phone. Requested call back. stated 1hr to 1 hr and 30 mins 4 hours I am still waiting. I understand Covid , lack of employees blah blah!! Don't book flights and take the money if you are not able to meet your obligations. At least answer the phone or return the call so you can make different travel arrangements!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,They cancelled my fight at 4 AM for a noon flight and tried to reschedule me on a flight 24 h later for a 3 day trip.,"I was able to secure tickets at 5 times the price from Delta 100 feet from the AA desk.  It cost me an additional $300 extra that they will not reimburse me for.  Here is the letter I sent them:WOW!!!  I will accept your gesture as it is clear that is the best you are willing to do.  I suspect your airline will have serious problems with trust in the future and may affect your ability to continue to do business successfully if you are treating all of your customers that you have had to cancel flights with recently the same as you are treating me.  I will be sure that when I use my vouchers, (hopefully in the near future, before y'all have to claim bankruptcy) that I will schedule my departure an extra 2 days in advance so that when you reschedule ( possibly multiple times) I will make it onto one of your aircraft to make it to my destination on time without having to spend an additional $1500 unexpectedly at the last minute and then only be reimbursed $500 ""for my troubles.""  It is still unclear to me how I was able to walk 100 feet to the delta counter and purchase coach seats but YOU were unable to secure these seats on my behalf so that I would not have to incur additional astronomical expenses.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Not that you cancelled the flight, but that you are so unaccommodating in righting your wrong.  THIS IS NOT THE AMERICAN AIRLINES THAT I USED TO BRAG ABOUT.GOOD DAY.AA  will definitely be last choice in the future.  I expect it from Spirit but not American.  VERY DISAPPOINTED."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,As bad as Spirit now,"They cancelled our flight last minute and blamed it on""weather"" (not true).  Then they refused to issue us a refund at the ""help"" desk.  Nevermind hotel accomodations.  I understand they are short staffed but that's no reason to lie and treat your customers like garbage.  Now their refund website site is telling us they'll only issue credit for future flights.  Why on earth would I fly with this company again?  We're having to get our bank to dispute the charge now.  This airline is going down the toilet fast, don't go down with them."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Poor customer service, poor communication, Lots of issues!","Where to begin. We get through security to find our flight is cancelled...due to mechanical failure.  Although we had given our text info to American, we never got notification. The agent at the airport booked us on standby for the only other flight heading to ORD that evening. We were told the extra we paid for our seats wouldn't be charged as the flight was cancelled. We waited for 3 hours for that next flight (5 hours in total) to find that American had oversold the flight by 8 seats. Needless to say, we did not get on, missing our event in Chicago.  We had booked through their alliance with JetBlue. JetBLue was AMAZING and refunded our flight immediately. JetBlue also said, unlike American, they do not oversell seats.Our credit card bill shows up...American had charged us for seats on that cancelled flight. It took me over 60 minutes today to get that resolved. Why is that on the customer to resolve? Shouldn't that have happened automatically? I sent an email to American, as we were out $ due to American's failure. Their response was that although they valued me, they wouldn't do anything. JetBlue, in contrast, said American probably wouldn't do anything (they were right), so they gave us a credit toward a future flight. JetBlue's customer service was A++. Really taking responsibility, even though the fault lied with American's faulty aircraft. Hotwire was also amazing, refunding most of our money. In a time when customer service really matters, I know the next flight I take, I will be eager to take JetBlue and do everything I can to avoid American. I also think it would be best for JetBlue to not tarnish their reputation with this alliance."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Outstanding flight attendant.,Our flight today had a wonderful flight attendant. Her name was Michelle and she was so sweet and outgoing! I told her about my flight attendant future job and she gave me really great advice and I will never forget her for that. I hope to see Michelle again one day out on the line. American Airlines has always had great customer service as well. I will always use them.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible,Do not waste your time with American Airlines they are the absolute worst airline company!!!! They put everyone on an international plane from Phoenix to Dallas after arriving to Dallas they did not have room for that size plane to land so the had us go in circles for almost 2 hours around Dallas to see if any room would clear up.  After flying in circles they decidedly fly us back yo Phoenix!!! All because the boarded is on a plane that was too big. Then they tried to blame it on the weather which was a lie !!!!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,American Air lines are trash and they try to scam their scustomers.,"The worst airline to I have ever seen. The flight I choose was booked. And they offered people 200 dollars to switch flights which I rejected. While waiting in the airport, they started delaying the flight until it was 2 hours late. And they added a new flight that is not delayed and offered a free change in flights. Once I have changed my flight. They canceled the second flight and moved the original flight back an hour. When I spoke with them, they refused to give me my spot back and gave me a flight that is 6 hours late.They are nothing but liars. Never take their terrible airlines."
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Trip to Reno,"The flight out was great. the service and seating was better then expected. There was plenty of leg room and the seats were a good size, very comfortable flight."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst Flight experience EVER!!,"My Husband and I left for our honeymoon on August 9 from Charlotte flying to Key West via American Airlines. Our travel there was a breeze. Returning from Key West was not so pleasant. 40 minutes from Charlotte, the pilot advised all travel into Charlotte was ceased due to bad weather. We delayed in Wilmington, NC until approved to proceed to travel. The pilot said no one will be deplaning. Then he said those who were departing to Wilmington could de-plane. Then the pilot came back and said the time for take off has expired and everyone would have to de-plane and await for a new crew to fly the plane!!! We were delayed at the airport for 17 hours, overnight!!!! They ran put of hotels so my husband and I on our honeymoon had to sleep in the airport overnight in Wilmington NC for 17 hours!!!We will NEVER EVER fly with AMERICAN AIRLINES EVER AGAIN!! They were giving away 60k miles each on our outgoing flight, now we see why. Never ever again ever!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Canceled other than from weather,"On August 2, 2021, my flight was canceled due to the inability of American Airlines to fill an entire plane.  My wife and I were left stranded in Charleston with no direct flights back to Chicago.  We booked a connecting flight through Charlotte NC, but the flight back to Chicago (AA689) was also canceled, at the boarding time of 12:45am, when a flight crew was unavailable.  My complaint was met with the response that “weather happens”.  Other airlines were not disrupted by weather on August 1-2, 2021.  How an airline communicates with its customers is important in retaining customer loyalty, which American has failed miserably.  I will now be flying the friendly skies."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,I'm done with American Airlines!,"This flight was so stressful, we came from a beautiful vacation, very relaxing to only find out our flight was canceled, we rebook our connecting flight to MIA through the phone, the agent never explained the full detail of me leaving the next morning at 7:00 am to LGA, until we arrived at the airport. The agent than told us, we were going to receive a complementary stay with a meal at a hotel for the night. When we arrive to MIA, we wait on a huge line until 11:00 pm, to then get told that there system was down and there unable to accommodate us with our stay at a hotel with a meal. And the other option was a reimbursement for future flights. Beyond frustrated as they never told us the reason of the canceled flight, and that they didn't know how to strategize to accommodate their passengers in an event of an interruption with their flights. I knew their were lying on us with regards the system was down. All in all, super annoyed with American Airlines, and will never book with them ever again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,AA check in kiosks don't work at any airport,"AA is the worst airline experience I've had. Completely overcrowded check in areas, short staffed, and NOT A SINGLE KIOSK WORKS. Why bother having technology there just to trick people into wasting their time using them when they don't work at all?? Every check in experience with AA has been awful."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Better service comes out of my dog's butt!,"By far the worst airline I have traveled with! They cancel so many flights and then leave you hanging. My one flight was cancelled, and there was no one to help, I had to personally push an old lady on a wheelchair to the exit. Give yourself a favour, never fly with American Airlines."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible experience,"American Airlines has provided terrible flight experience.1) <10 min prior to boarding a small airport, they indicate that they did not plan for the fuel necessary for the flight and will need to stop at another airport to accommodate all the flights they cancelled 1 day prior which caused many people on that flight to miss their connection. This left minimal time to figure out alternative flight options to change if needed.2) With the <10 min remaining, the employees at the airport reported they are completely unable to make changes to flight reservations, and all had to be booked by another service or just get on the plane. She boldly announced this over the loudspeaker to the entire airport lobby.3) After missing the connection in a major city, the best option was a standby for another connection to another large hub. Alternatively fly another day (despite it being mid-day on a weekend in a large city airport)4) After barely making that flight to another hub (4th airport of the day), my planned flight was cancelled.5) The lines for customer service were at least 2 gates long to try and get to another flight.6) The customer service representative I spoke to indicated he is not privy to any information that could indicate whether a scheduled flight has any risk of being cancelled. When asked if factors including weather or another incoming flight could impact it, he reported he was not given this information.7) The customer service agent reported he could not identify if the flight crew for a flight was going to be delayed or not. I quickly was able to identify this with the application and the flight status feature. This strongly suggests the customer service agents are either not trained properly or prefer the customer evaluates each factor8) The miles for the original flight were not even credited, and the online service claims that none of the connection flights (therefore, less than the flights paid for or flown) are eligible for miles, despite this being a 12 hour flight for what should have been a 1 layover domestic flight. There is no system that allows for explanation of this process to be reconsidered or reviewed by a person.9) The website reports there is a system for filing complaints, but as you go through the process, it re-directs so none are able to be madeIt's a beautiful system that seems to avoid clear mechanisms to allow customers to voice their concerns. With this system that does not easily allow for filing complaints, how can American Airlines work to correct errors?While writing this, I unsuccessfully waited on hold to reach a customer service representative for >45 min without success.#americanairlines please fix your system and work to reduce cancelling flights, particularly mid-way through active same-day flights where weather is not limiting (ex: DFW to MSY segment this trip). I would also appreciate receiving the total number of points I would have received for the flight I purchased (despite flying through additional cities), rather than the partial flight. Please note this partial flight recognition was only due to rearranged flights resulting from American Airlines' original poor planning. A few-hour drive with fuel could have solved the re-fueling issue overnight when the previous flights were cancelled and moved to the following day. It does not seem fair to reduce the mileage credited due to errors outside the customer's control when these would have otherwise been recognized and handled early to avoid most of these problems in the first place."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Save your money,Our flights were all delayed not because of weather but because of preventable mistakes like waiting on a co-pilot for 1 hr in the plane during covid with the plane entirely full of people we were lied to repeatedly by staff and they don't seem to care about there jobs or appearances I saw there luggage handlers literally slinging peoples luggage off the conveyor belts it was not pleasant and we wouldn't recommend American Ever. The staff on the plane was very rude is what it looked like.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Thieves,"I used vouchers from a cancelled trip in 2020 to pay for this trip. Somehow, our tickets got put on a different locator numbers. I have one of those credit cards they hawk inflight one of the benefits being that it pays for the first checked bag but, although she was on the same locator number on the cancelled trip, her bag wasn't paid for since she ended up on the different locator number for the new trip. Bottom line: American Airlines are thieves. This isn't the only problem with this card by the way. You are better off with a travel card from anywhere else than with this flimflam group."
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Baggage Claim,"Shalonda at Newport News/Williamsburg airport was a lifesaver!!!!!! Before she waited on us I overheard her talking to a lady in a wheelchair apparently she missed her flight. The lady was visibly upset but Shalonda assured her she would be taking care of. I even heard her give her phone number to the lady for her to call because she wanted to make sure she knew she got to her destination safely. Moments later I wouldn't have imagined that my husband and I would be in desperate need of her help. We didn't know that we had to a QR code or download the Verifly app before boarding at this point we were frantic because nothing seem to be downloading correctly. Shalonda would leave us momentarily to go check on bags but she would return to check on us. That morning started off very rocky on top of us missing our flight she spoke with the representative behind the counter to get us on the next flight leaving from Norfolk. The world needs more Shalonda's (caring, compassionate and going above and beyond)"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,The most DEHUMANIZING experience,"As with all busy airlines, we were herded through the terminals and gates like cattle, and packed into the plane like sardines.  This is how they make money; I get it.  My complaint is with the return flight.  Our return  flight on Sunday was cancelled at the last minute, and rescheduled for the next day on Monday.  Everyone in our party had to work Monday, so we had to scramble to try to book another flight on Sunday.  Due to the last minute arrangements, we were forced to pay top price in order to get home on Sunday.  We were unable to find a flight in any combination of stops to get all the way home to Detroit from Tulsa, so we booked a flight that would take us to Chicago.  In Chicago we rented a car and drove to Detroit.  We called AA to get a partial refund and were treated so rudely by agents, and no refund or voucher was given.  We ended up paying almost $1,500 more for our travel due to last minute bookings and car rentals.  These last minute flight cancellations occur daily and are habitual with this airline, leaving hundreds stranded and at their mercy.   If you want to be treated as a human, book your flight with another airline and avoid American Airlines at all costs."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Regional.Manager,AA customer service call.center is awful. AA Customer Service Supervisor Tracy is Rude and very disrespectful.  They are so unhelpful and I hope the overall stock of this business drops.  Their service surely is.  Please do your research before you travel.  Any other carrier would be better.
n/a,10,Damaged luggage,"The flight to Montrose, CO our luggage was very scuffed and peeled off some of the outer lining to the luggage. I was okay with that because of wear and tear. I was not okay with the treatment my luggage received on the flight back. My one suit case was creased in the corner very badly, and my big suitcase the zipper ripped and a piece ripped off the side. We paid 30 dollars for 4 bags on the way there and back. I left the Airport without reporting because I had to get home. O called the next day to report the issue and I got an automated statement saying I needed to go to the airport to show them the damage. Who has time for that. We paid 250 dollars to have our luggage boarded on the plane for 4 bags. We should have fedex'd, may have been better handled. They don't care about your luggage or you too much from what I have experienced. I have never had so much damage from an airline to my luggage, even on the cheaper airlines."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,no COVID precaution,"the old man flight attendant in first class kept pulling his mask down to talk to passengers. i was in isle and when he leaned over to talk to the passenger next to me, the attendant pulled down his mask completely and started talking. i asked for come and it came with a cup of ice. the attendant grabbed the cup with 2 fingers with one finger inside the cup touching the ice and other finger outside coup at the area where i would put my mouth to drink… WTF? this should be reported to the news."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Customer representative very rude and too worried about a break, to answer a question.","I went to the American Airlines desk at gate 4, PVD, to ask a question about my connection flight in Charlotte. A flight had just taken off a few minutes prior, so I waited while the woman walked away (Pat) and took a 25 minute break. The man was busy helping get the flight to Philadelphia off. So when he finally was done I asked my question and he began to look up the information. In the meantime, Pat returned and rudely told me that they just got another flight off and basically told the man to not answer my question. Then she walked off and took another half hour break. No customer service here. Just, “poor me, I didn’t have enough of of a break!”Not flying AA again. We paid a lot for first class tickets and can’t even get a question answered!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Fly someone else,Every time I fly American there is some kind of issue of why they cannot be on time. They delay your originating flight and do nothing to hold the connecting flight and then are rude and don’t apologize or are even nice about it. We pay good money to fly with these A holes and they could care less. A normal thing with American is RUDE employees.  Too many other options and I plan on using any other airline next time.
Date of travel: July 2021,20,PHL Terminal Embarassing,"The terminal and gate areas for AA at PHL are an embarassment--they are dirty, overcrowded, tired and in dire need of a major overhaul. The rest rooms are filthy and look as though they hadn't been cleaned in hours! This is unacceptable given today's COVID issues. Gate areas are filthy, seats insufficient to handle full or oversold flights which is the norm today, floors/rugs littered and stained and I can go on but you get the message!!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Airlines  Don't fly with them.,Got to the airport in plenty time to check in and the lady at the ticket counter said our bags won't make the flight so we have to fly stand by on the next flight. She said we have to fly with our bags company policy. Ok get on next flight and get delayed by weather and get to destination 8 hours later. We get to car rental they had no cars had to go to different rental and more expensive truck. Got to hotel and didn't get the room we deserved because we were late. Now back to flying with your bags (company policy) my bags made the original flight and flew alone. What happened to company policy. The lady at the ticket counter was rude when I tried to ask questions about it. I contacted AA customer relations and basically was told it's not there problem. Big slap in the face. Won't do business with American airlines anymore.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible customer service and tracking abilities,"I start my travel from Beaumont to Dallas then right as I get off the plane, all my next flights cancel. Well, this is way to much for American Airlines to handle. They loose my luggage and are unable to locate it. One system is saying one thing and one system saying another. You can sit on the phone for hours and never speak to anyone. Chat through the app is also useless. If you can take another airline, DO IT!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible Service,"My trip out of the US was ok and everything went as planned. However, my return was a nightmare. First flight was cancelled because of “technical difficulties”. We boarded and de-boarded after 5 & a half hours they announced cancellation. We were awarded vouchers for taxi and hotel. The issue is the flight from Antigua was to Charlotte so I had a connection. The flight hovered the air for more than 30 mins before landing due to weather. No clue as to why I had to grab my luggage to recheck for connection flight and security check so my connection was missed not even by 5mins on which the app still read boarding 20mins later. Unfortunately, my luggage made the flight smh. The next flight was full. In my opinion, AA should have communicated with one another knowing they have connection guests stuck on a flight, out of our control. I mean what makes one flight more important than the next to be delayed by 5-10 mins knowing there’s multiple security checks!! All of this, I sat in airports my entire birthday and missed my son’s fifth. Thanks to AA !!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Awful customer service. 4 hour call back that didn’t work,I have tried to contact American Airlines after they downgraded me from a first class ticket that I paid for. I used their call back system and it failed 4 times. I’m paying for a first class ticket with one of 4 legs in economy. Not happy. Will never use them after this flight   Awful customer service
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Horrible, every time","On a clear day with no weather issues, we sat at the gate for hours, with another AA flight waiting to go to Los Angeles from the same gate at the same time. Employees had no idea what was going on, no announcements were made. To make it better, they continually delayed the flight by only 10 minutes at a time, and even that was late - at 5:00 when nobody had boarded the screen said departure scheduled for 4:50. At 5:05 it said scheduled for 5:00. And so on, over and over and over.The last 4 or more flights I've taken with them this year have been the same. It is the most horrible service I've experienced, and they make it impossible to plan around the delay, or even have a rough idea of if you have time to go and get a meal to ease your inevitably horrible mood."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible experience!!!,Worst flying experience ever! Customer service is non existent. Takes over 7 hrs to get customer service on the phone. Their verily app is useless. Cannot order any special meals u less flying internationally. Rude flight attendants. Passengers with no mask were allowed to fly for the entire flight. Planes are so dirty that the passengers were cleaning their own trays. Absolutely revolting. Will never fly with them again.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible,We got our flight canceled twice. They offered us standby and didn’t  make it. Our rebooked flight has a layover of 9 hours. We’ve been waiting in the rebooking center line for 5 hours. This is ridiculous!!!should get a refund!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Absolutely the worst airline you could book a flight with.,"Booked a round trip first class tickets and tried to go online to change which they suggested I do.  It then told me to call customer service as it could not be done online. I have been on hold for 3 hours, they are so bad they cannot give you wait times and or even a system that gives you a call back time. They will soon be out of business with this type of service. I can only imagine how poorly their planes are being kept up. The CEO should be fired! I will never fly them again!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Joey Cena,"Worst airline available!! On the way into Mexico a carry on bag was no issue. On the return, the bag was ""too big"" for a carry on item. It was the same airline as last week and the same bag. They made me pay $32 to check it. Very inconsistent within the company. Never going to be flying AA again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible Service,Booked and paid for round trip first class tickets.Flight from Tampa delayed despite aircraft having spent the prior night in TPA.Delay caused by no crew available yet major hub (MIA) only 45 minutes away flying time!!!! They tried to reroute us through Chicago or Dallas arriving Portland around midnight instead of 1:40PM in afternoon meaning couldn't get my rental car and no way to get to hotel 1 hour away from PWM. I went on line and found flight to PHL and connection to PWM arriving Portland 1PM same day!! Called platinum desk and booked it BUT only economy available. Representative said I had to call for refund for difference in fares (1st class vs. economy) but not until travel was completed. I called this AM and was told by the system that wait times for a rep was over 4 hours and to arrange a callback!! If this is AA's idea of customer service they should give up and shareholders and Board of Directors should fire the entire management team and hire a new group who truly care about their customers!!!It is blatantly obvious the BOD and executive management don't care to read the feed back or if they read it they don't care which is even worse!!! I will use budget airlines in the future as they provide a better level of service at significantly lower prices!! I would advise others to do the same!!!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Nightmare Continues,"I posted yesterday thinking our delayed flight would be ok. However, the flight was cancelled. We had to stay overnight in LA without any compensation from AA for hotels or meals. They said it was because of the weather but the weather was ok in Dallas. This is all about cost saving for AA as the flight did not have the number of passengers to make it profitable. Again, if I requested a change in flights, AA would have charged me for each ticket. They can change a flight, even if it bumps you to another day and you have no say. Done with AA."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,I thought Frontier was bad...,"...traveling with AA was an absolute nightmare. The first flight was delayed over an hour all because their FA didn’t show up on time. Then we waited on the tarmac for an hour after landing at DFW because AA can’t manage their business properly and there were 20 planes waiting for a gate to park at.  Our connector was also delayed because of the cascading failure of the system, and to top it off our bags somehow still didn’t make it to SF. I will NEVER be flying with American Airlines ever again, even if I were given the ticket for free."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Epic Failure,"There was some bad weather in Dallas, which caused a 3 hr delay in Lubbock and all flights from Dallas to Milwaukee to be canceled. I spent the next 12 plus hours being delayed. They  sent me to Charlotte Nc only to be routed to Philadelphia, to send me to Milwaukee. The whole process took over 24 hrs. They couldn't or wouldn't compensate for a 2 hr shutdown.  Epic Failure of operation control.  The complete lack of assistance to get us to our destination in a timely manner."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Don't waste your money and time,Sat on plane at gate for 3 hours in Denver.  Told by pilot American Airlines needs the gate so we will push off and park.  Sat another 2 hours parked.  Finally had clearance for take off.  Then pilot announced the plane is too hot and therefore too heavy for take off.  We sat another 45 minutes running engines to cool off plane.  Missed 2 seperate connecting flights at dfw due to late departure. Had to stay at airport Hyatt (not the Grand Hyatt.  Horrible separate experience)  Online for 40 minutes with Andrew of American Airlines just to see if they booked us on another flight.  He couldn’t answer me.  Long line at AA customer service desk.  Poor travelers.   Absolutely ridiculous.   Poor customer service all the way around.  Customer service is every thing. They failed miserably again.  Done with AA.  Find another carrier.   Paying more for AA isn't worth it.  Have to provide at least one circle rating to submit or it would be -5!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,AA takes the L,"American Airlines cancelled 50% of my flights with no explanation. I was able to rebook, but without the help of anyone because the line at DFW for customer service is the same length as an entire terminal. If you do get to talk to a Customer Service Representative, they are lovely. Anyhow, I will now be avoiding AA like the plague."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,They stink,"They are the worst.They changed our departing flight THREE times.Then they changed our return flight.THEN 12 HOURS before we were departing, they CANCELLED our flight.Gave us they option of a late flight the next day.We were going to Vegas on vacation. This would have made us loose TWO DAYS.Plus we would have needed to change the rest of our itinerary. I don't care what their excuse was. We booked 6 months in advance and they gave us 12 hours. Never ever ever ever would consider flying American again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible Airline,They canceled our connecting flight after waiting 5 hours to continue on our trip.  We ended up paying for a hotel at our destination and at our layover.The employees in Dallas are very rude and not willing to help.
Date of travel: August 2021,20,"Delayed, delayed, delayed.....","I was traveling with my family and the flight was delayed more than 5 times, waited over 6 hours in Texas with no explanation from staff, no reimbursement or food credit. My kids were pulling their hair out waiting. The worst thing is that it was not just my flight while we were waiting and walking around the airport we saw multiple flights from this company going to other areas get delayed too. This is not acceptable."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Run as fast as you can.,"My clients just left key west headed to Charlotte.  I understand weather and it was delayed. Then diverted to NC. Sat on tarmac for over 1 hour. Then told to get off plane. Then they are told they have no idea what is going on and will not unload luggage, provide food, hotel, or even answers. They said its the weather's fault and they are not responsible. But I can't call the airline was on hold for 4 hours no answer.  So they are stuck at a diverted airport, no answers and currently no way home. So I'd strongly suggest to not use this airline. Oh just told as writing this they don't have any pilots either. Smh. I feel so bad for my clients. And since they went to baggage claim they are not allowed back on the plane."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Spend extra and fly with Alaska and Delta Instead!,I had two connecting flights within the same month delayed/cancelled with American airline. Terrible overall experience it just doesn’t make any sense when you cancel the flight due to weather but other Airlines manage to fly in at the same airport and not cancel any of their flights. Best solution to this problem is go with a consistent airline like Delta or Alaska that actually value their customers time.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,American Airlines is the worst,Avoid American Air if at possible.  We have travelled on three American flights on our trip and they have all been cancelled or significantly delayed.  My family is extremely disappointed and will avoid American on future flights.  It’s possible Spirit is worse - but at least you know what to expect with Spirit.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Delays with rude employees,"After 5 consecutive delays lasting 5 hours, they announce that the flight is completely delayed to the next day (flight AA4991). The AA employees at PVD airport gate were uncooperative and rude, getting frustrated at customers trying to find best alternatives."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,What a joke,"They board us on the plane as it starts raining and immediately tell us we have to wait out the storm on the plane.. so why board us? We have now been waiting for over 2 hours for the crew to get some damn cookies loaded onto the aircraft. No one moves with a sense of purpose because this airline does not value your time. The cookies tasted like a waste of time, 0/10 would recommend."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Do Not Fly American Airline Code Share,"I booked American Airline which uses Air Tahiti Nui for my return flight from Paris to Los Angeles. Air Tahiti Nui sent me an email informing that my flight has been cancelled because of ""restrictive travel/ border closures.""  Nothing has changed regarding vaccinated Americans ability to enter EU or return to US between the time I bought my ticket on May 23, 2021 and the date I received notice of cancellation on Aug, 11, 2021.  I was offered a refund with no mention of amount or I can rebook for travel up to Dec, 31, 2022 with a fare adjustment depending on my travel date. Upon researching, I found American has other flights leaving Paris for Los Angeles on my date of travel. I called American to have them rebook me on one of their scheduled flights.  First I was told I had to pay more,  When I said ATN cancelled on me, I was told ATN is not American Airline. After I said I booked ATN through AA and have the booking number issued by AA. I was told I can change to an AA flight but on economy instead of the premium economy I originally paid for because no premium economy seats were available.  I reminded the agent that he had offered me a premium economy seat before when he wanted me to pay more.  He then said premium economy is available via NYC but not via Dallas and that premium economy is available only for Paris to NYC, not for NYC to LAX. I accepted.The moral of the story is Air Tahiti Nui  will cancel when it wants to and lie about why.  Another moral is to beware of American Airline code share flights. Third lesson is even after your ticket is paid for American Airline may try to squeeze more out of you or shortchange you if it can and if you let it."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible Airline!,I will never fly American Airlines again. This is the worst airline out there. They delayed both flights for 5 hours. They charged me $60 for checked bags that weren’t checked. They changed my seat on both flights without warning. They staff is extremely rude and doesn’t seem to care about anyone flying with them.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,I Could Have Drove...,"I left my house at 8 AM to get to New Orleans to catch my flight.  It was already delayed from the night before.  Had it not been delayed it would not have been stuck in the weather that left us on the tarmac for an hour and a half.  Our flights were rearranged while we were in the air and I arrived at a closed flight in Dallas that was still on the ground (I could actually see it) and told it was full in spite of the flight number on my boarding pass.Now that I have been transferred to the next flight out of Dallas to Seattle, the time keeps getting pushed back 5:02 -> 6 PM -> 6:32 -> 6:52 -> An announcement that ""it will take 15 more minutes before the right official can inspect the maintenance"".  And we just got an announcement NOT to ask about the next flight out because it is ""oversold."" (Quotes are actual words over the intercom.)I could have driven from Lafayette to Dallas and caught the correct connecting flight to get me to Ketchikan by 7:08 PM (four hours from now).  I did not yet mention, I won't be in Ketchikan until tomorrow morning because I did not catch the right connecting flight - spending a night in Seattle. (This one was originally scheduled for 5:02 PM, the right one was scheduled for 3 PM but may not have made it in time anyway as it didn't leave until 4:05 PM.)On my way home from Ketchikan, the last time I flew with AA as well as the last time I flew.  A maintenance problem delayed that flight and the next one south wasn't until the next morning - slept in Seattle airport, first time since I was 16.AAmerican  isn't my only bad flight XP.  The whole system has been declining.  I have been flying since 1990.Flight cancelled - there are no more flights (AAmerican) to where I am going.  Girlfriend's family trying to find me a one-way for tomorrow.  Will never fly AAmerican again if possible unless it is booked thru by another airline."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never ever fly with American airlines,"They are worse airline I have ever seen.My flight was canceled 5 times , according to them due to the weather but other airlines were flying just fine. My family was stuck at the Chicago  airport for 3 days after coming back from a 15 hrs flight from Dubai.My 6yr old  daughter was sick and in pain  they did not even care. When I asked the AA member if they could accommodate us they said no it was not there problem. When I asked about my refund  so I could drive, I was told it would take 7 days to process. I told them I was fine with that as long as they also refund the money I paid for my bags ( $500) . They agree to refund me that too but when I went to claim my bags I was told that they already shipped them to Kansas City. How did they shipped them while all the flights where canceled?  We were finally sent to Charlotte, North Carolina, were we stayed for 7 hrs at the airport before flying to Kansas city. I will never fly with American airlines ever again. I hope someone do something about this ."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,AVOID AMERICAN AIRLINE AT ALL COST,"This experience has been the worst experience in my history of flying. I'm a regular flyer, normally use united airline but due to a hic up, I had to use AA to return from ORD to MCI. The flight back depart at 8:30pm at ORD and arrive at 10:20 MCI. The flight got diverted to Omaha Nebraska due to MCI ""weather"". We sat waiting on the plane for an hour and 30. It was at midnight when they finally announce that we will be staying at Omaha NE for the night until they can figure out a flight for the next day. They made us wait on the plane for another hour. We didn't leave the plane until 1am.NO ACCOMODATIONS for any of the passenger. The flight attendance had the audacity to say ""Omaha is a  small airport but there is sitting area and it is carpeted "" when someone ask her about accommodation. Are you expecting us to sleep on the ""carpeted"" floor??? We didn't know when our next flight was going to be! They kept saying they don't know so we got Uber, book a hotel for the night (didn't get set until 3am!!!!), and wake up at 7am to figure out when the hell our next flight was. They STILL didn't know. We showed up at the airport early, and find out it would be at 10, then it got delay till 12. I am STILL at the airport and I don't know if they are going to keep delaying this flight to MCI. The communication is non existent, and they don't give a single sh1t about their passenger.I will never ever use American Airline again.This trip has been completely terrible. Dog crap experience with this airline."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Could not care less,"My recent experience with American Airlines was horrible. We got to the gate 20 minutes before the plane departed. The person in front of us got on the plane (a white male). The 7 of us left (5 black females, 1 asian female and 1 white female) were instructed that 18 people were late to boarding time and they had to ""draw a line somewhere"" so they refused to let us on. Come to find out the plane did not depart for another 45 minutes. They told us there was another flight in 45 minutes but we would have to go through security again to a different Terminal to make it. They did not give us a gate number. They told us not to worry that they would call the gate and let them know we were coming. After we ran through the airport, we found out we were not checked in and they never called. They were called over 10 times and American Airlines NEVER PICKED UP THE PHONE. Do not book through American Airlines in London. They literally could not care less about you and get their kicks out of holding what little power they have over your heads."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Unbelievably horrible airline--  3 days to reach Texas destination from Wash DC,"Booked flight in April for son returning to college in August.  In May, had to rebook to a farther (DCA) airport after AA bumps up the departure time from 12 pm to 7 am at Dulles.  Placed on hold for 2 hours for that privilege.  On the day of departure, after arrival at DCA, the flight time is pushed from 1:30 to 3 pm for unknown reasons.  Son finally boards the plane, then has to de-board due to mechanical issues.  Son gets rebooked for an 8 pm flight, which is later cancelled. Son then has to wait in the customer service line for another hour and half to rebook yet again (2 hour wait to call to rebook).  AA rebooked him for the next day for a  5 pm flight though he asked for an earlier flight.  He does not get his luggage back because that's another 3 hour wait.  Son returns home late that night  (we live 50 miles away).  Next day, I bring my son back to the airport.  His flight is delayed yet again, this time 2 hours.  Much of that time he was on the plane but there was a long delay loading luggage.  My son winds up missing his connecting flight in Dallas, which was the last flight of the night.  AA refuses to issue him a hotel voucher, saying it was ""weather related.""  Really???   At 11 pm, he had to find a hotel and transportation.   AA has total disregard for its customers.  I will never fly with American Airlines again.   I regret not using United."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Brutal delays,"I flew with American Airlines from Dublin to Philadelphia with a connection flight to Indianapolis. My first flight was delayed for 4 hours, and as such I missed my connection flight. My rebooked connection flight then got delayed 4 times before I was informed it was cancelled, leaving me stuck in a country I’d never visited before. While they did book me into a hotel to stay, my flight the next day was also delayed 2 times. Meaning I arrived at my destination over 24 hours after I had initially planned to and organised transportation for. The constant delays are exhausting, especially saying as my first flight was a long haul flight that put me in a completely different time zone."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Amazing customer service - Susie at American Airlines,"We had an excellent experience with Susie at the American Airlines customer service desk at Charlotte International Airport! We were stressed about having an unnecessary layover in Miami, alongside other issues, and Susie was amazing enough to change us to a direct flight to Orlando (without us even having to ask). She gave us seats next to each other, saved us hours of wasted time, and did it all with a smile on her face. This is exactly what customer service should always be. Thank you so much Susie!!! :)"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worse Airline Ever,They canceled our flight 30 minutes before it was time to leave. Sorry MF! They don't have any consideration for no one! They need a new CEO
Date of travel: August 2021,10,NEVER FLY WITH AMERICAN,"I got to the kiosk to check in 1 hour before it was supposed to board and it said my flight didn’t exist.  They told me to wait in line to speak with a representative, so I did for 2 hours until I got to the desk and the lady said my flight had just been delayed. Frustrating, but not the end of the world.  I waited at my gate for 3 hours past the “delayed” boarding time, and finally at 2:00 in the morning they canceled the flight.  Hundreds of people walked to customer service where there were only 2 concierge workers. The line was not moving, and people were leaving after meeting with the concierge reps saying that there are no hotels available in the area and the next flight isn’t until tomorrow night.  So I just left and had a friend pick me up from the airport at 2:30am. I called American and the phone rang for 4 hours.  No one picked up, so I called again in the morning. They booked me another flight for that afternoon, but then it was delayed by an hour and a half. The lady at the counter announced over the intercom that they had not found a plane, a pilot, or flight attendants for the flight, and once they found those things we could board.  They’re clearly grossly understaffed and are selling flights that don’t exist.  I had to miss a hole day of work because of their negligence (which I’m not salaried, so ever day matters money wise). When I communicated this to customer service they didn’t care.  They offered me a discount on my next flight with American, but at this point it’s not even worth it to try and fly with them again. It’ll just get canceled or delayed. Don’t waste your time."

Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never fly American Airlines,"Whether you are in Burlington Vermont, Washington DC, or Boise Idaho AA consistently delays flights and abruptly cancels them. I will never fly them again. If you fly with AA you are putting your journey at significant risk compared with other airlines. There are actually a lot of articles about how poorly they perform and I have three experience that can verify that everything bad about them is true.Just spoke with customer service, wow, I actually know more about their flight schedule than they do…also, they do not care at all that they just cancelled four flight that I was on today. Really the worst airlines out there."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,American is Free!,I fly American every week!I was so excited to see that they are living up to their name via the recent CNN article. They believe in giving their employees a choice and that’s something to stand for! Thank you American Airlines!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Customer Service,"My experience with American Airlines was horrible, on my way back home yesterday, I was highly disappointed with the customer service. As a person of color and a Muslim, I felt targeted as the Flight attendant was being very unnecessarily rude. I was traveling with my family, and as we were sitting in our seats we made a minor mistake as we had to share the row with another person. The stewardess approached us with a rude attitude, and was causing an unnecessary scene. All she could’ve said was “Move over a seat” but instead she was practically yelling at us to double check our tickets when she was literally holding them! She also had rude interactions with the other passengers, she had a nasty attitude and was very short tempered. This lady literally left the overhead bins open  in the middle of the flight. Anything could’ve happened, the luggage could’ve fell out but she didn’t care. Later she came back and slammed the cabin door very loudly. She also threatened to call the pilot on another passenger for listening to something out loud. I felt very uncomfortable throughout the flight and don’t plan on flying with American Airlines again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Would give 0 stars if possible. The worst airline I’ve ever flown.,American Airlines is hands down the worst airline I have ever flown with in my life. I’ve flown with them 5 different times in the last few months and almost every flight has been delayed. On August first I got stuck in Dallas as they canceled dozens of flights over a 20 minute rainstorm. Every other airline was flying and half of the other American flights were even flying still. They had a pilot shortage due to them firing pilots during covid. I got stuck there for 48 hours in the airport and they are still trying to blame weather so that they don’t have to issue anyone a refund or anything. They are ridiculous and have no customer service.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,COMPLETE JOKE,I paid extra for a seat in the front of the plane.  With no warning or explanation they moved me to the back just a few hours before the flight.I canceled the trip in protest.  Southwest Airlines here I come.American is a horrific company.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Delay after delay and rude management.,"After a flight delay and change from IAH to CLT, the flight from CLT to ROA was delayed multiple times. The announcements stated the flight was delayed due to lack of a crew. After waiting somewhere from 1 to 2 hours for a crew and assurance one is getting ready, they announced the flight was now delayed from the current delayed time, 11:04 pm to 7:15 am the next morning. The passengers where instructed to go to customer service to seek any arrangements needed. When with customer service the group of passengers was told no accomodations would be made for hotels or cars. More or less we where all told we will have to just deal with it.  Passengers asked to speak to the manager to question what exactly is going on and why are we not given any kind of relief. The manager, rudely, stated nothing could be done by policy bc the last delay was due to weather not a lack of a crew. It was a blantent lie the passengers knew right away. We can all check the weather reports and detuctive reasoning from the previous announcements made it easy to see through. When the manager began to be questioned she quickly became increasingly rude. Passengers began to film her. The manager then walked away threatening to call security on anyone who filmed her. Passengers began to ask for her name. She would not give it and the AA staff at the desk stated they did not know her name, another obvious lie. The manager finished walking off with saying security can through everyone out if needed."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Will never use American again,"American Airlines is awful in many ways, but most noticeably in how they treat their customers. My mom and I flew from Alaska to Chicago, where we were supposed to be on a 7:15 pm flight to Oklahoma City. Our layover in Chicago was 12 hours long, but around 6 pm Chicago began to have rain. Understandably, they had to delay our flight due to the weather. They continued to delay our flight with little to no communication until midnight, when they finally proceeded to tell us that our plane was inbound and it was not expected to be cancelled. Well, 45 minutes later they cancelled our flight. Rather than be apologetic, understanding, and attempt to solve our problem, they were extremely rude to all of us while trying to reschedule our flight. This is now a Tuesday, and they were simply trying to put all of us on Standby for future OKC flights, which would’ve required us to stay in the airport until literally Thursday. While none of the customers got belligerent or overtly rude, they continually told us “well we can’t control the weather” and “I’m putting you on standby”, rather than hearing our concerns. One employee simply refused to offer one customer any sort of hotel discount or other flight option even though he was pulling up OKC flights that he could book himself. She ended up walking away from him, hiding behind the manager, whose name was Jen, and then Jen proceeded to yell at him and walk away rather than trying to help or talking to the employee about how unbelievably rude she was being. Instead, the manager proceeded to tell us that all she has to do to remove our records from their system was check one little box, literally threatening us just because we wanted more than standby when they cancelled our flight. It was truly appalling. I understand that this is not an easy job and there are a lot of factors, but the employees teaming up against concerned passengers who are stuck in an airport for at least another 48 hours is horrific. At my job, if I had spoken to a guest that way I would be immediately fired and told not to return to the premises. Truly, this is all I can say because it would take too long to name off all of the problems that we have had on this trip, which is very disappointing. All in all, American Airlines offers little to no communication or accommodation for their passengers. It became very clear to me tonight that they do not care about their customers or even any human decency at all. ps: their seats are the most uncomfortable of any planes I’ve ever flown in. Back pain galore."
Date of travel: August 2021,30,We got there on time - but were bored and hungry en route,"We traveled from San Francisco to Miami then on to Quito.  The good - our flights arrived on time and little turbulence.  That is important - plus our bags arrived.  The bad - no food service - a coke and a cookie for 5 1/2 hour flight to Miami and the same for 4 hour flight to Quito.  Fortunately we went to Trader Joes and packed up on all sorts of goodies.  But arrived at our destination at 10 am hungry and starving.  Maybe an entrepreneur can be a food vendor on American flights and sell stuff like poke, samozas, fried chicken, and lumpia - cause American sure isn't willing to od it.   Plus bring a good book or a crossword puzzle because the inflight entertainment on your device will not be working."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"AME,RICAN TRASH",American airlines is Pure Trash.  Since when do you hold up a plane because a flight attendant is missing? Why is this poor excuse for a airline still in business?
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst domestic airline,"I've traveled extensively in Africa so I know bad air travel, but AA is hands down the worst in the US. That includes notoriously poor airlines like Frontier, Jet Blue etc. From endless lines to grumpy counter staff to hours spent on the customer service hotline to poor maintenance. Hard to believe management hasn't been dismissed en masse by the board. Never again!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The American Airlines First Class/Business Seat Scam,"First, it is with a heavy heart that I file a complaint with the AA Customer Relations Dept., as I have been a Loyal Client my entire life and my airline of choice during the last 32 years of Honorable Service to Our Nation with the US Marines. I will attempt to convey my Horrible Disappointment with the First-Class/ Business service, the unsatisfactory condition of the seats AA makes False Claims of Enhanced Cleaning and extra precautions due to the ongoing Pandemic. The seats were extremely dirty with trash from the previous flight. On a 5:31 hr flight, all that was offered was Yogurt! Regarding your so-called Premier First-Class Flight from DFW to London Heathrow, I Respectfully feel that AA should be Ashamed of this Absolute Scam. The power connections were out of service. The food was lacking, Cold.  The Flight Attendant’s Unprofessional Behavior, I pride myself on being extremely friendly and overly polite, nevertheless don’t care about the “Flight Attendant’s Personal Crude Sex Life on the Plane with other Colleagues, Pilots or Derogatory Remarks about the other Unsatisfied Passengers”. But worse, she ruddily called me, and I quote a “%$&^%! Idiot” when I asked for assistance with a Defective Chair/Seat belt. Yes, you heard correctly! Apparently, she misunderstood my kindness. About flight 1570, I did hope for a better experience but sadly it was the same, Dirty Chairs, No Inflight Entertainment, or WIFI. Defective Electric Outlets, Damaged Bag on arrival. I wasted all the Advantage Miles earned through my years of Loyalty, including my AA CITI Advantage Card. I please hope AA Refunds me the Difference in Miles from Economy to First/Business Class/Purchased miles. Unfortunately at this point, all I am expecting from AA is the Typical Generic Apology that Promises False Expectations of improving their services. Nevertheless, the other Flight Reviewer (Seat A-2) and I will do our Absolute Best to make others including Our Service Members Aware of this Scam."

Date of travel: August 2021,20,They abandoned a handicaped traveler!!!,"We flew in from St Lucia, West Indies to Dallas and had requested wheel chair service for my husband at booking. When we arrived in Dallas we were a few minutes early so the WC and porter had not arrived yet. The crew told us they would be there shortly. We only had a one hour layover in which time we had to go out of secured area, get our bags, re-check bags, go through security again, then customs before heading to our next gate that was on the other side of the airport. So my husband suggested I go ahead and get our bags and he would meet me at the next gate.  When I got to my next gate with only minutes to spare my husband wasn't there. I called him and he informed me that AA sent ONE porter to transport TWO individuals in wheelchairs PLUS an unaccompanied minor!! The Porter took the minor to her parent and left both customers in wheelchairs stranded at baggage claim, on the other side of security and customs. I couldn't go back to where he was without going outside of security and then having to go back through security and customs again which would make us miss our flight. Plea's to the airline brought no help. We were told there was nothing they could do. The only thing that saved us was our flight was almost an hour late leaving and by that time the porter returned and pushed my husband through security, customs, and delivered him to our gate 20 MINUTES AFTER our flight was supposed to leave! If not for the delay we would have been stranded in the airport overnight, IN A WHEELCHAIR!! I have filed a complaint but as yet have not heard back. Next time I'm flying Delta."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Airline,"Please avoid this airline completely. They WILL delay your flight by days and then cancel it and leave you stranded because there is “no crew.” Then when you are forced to rent a car in order to DRIVE home, you are not compensated because “American Airlines are not the ones responsible for compensating.”DO NOT FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible Experience,On the last flight coming from Dallas to Colorado Springs the flight was overly bumpy from the time we got in the air all the way to when we landed. I do not know if the pilots did not know what they were doing or what but it wasn’t any bad weather and the sky was clear. Not saying that there still couldn’t be a small amount of turbulence if the sky is clear and there is not any bad weather but the flight was overly bumpy the whole time. The pilots never turned on the seat belt sign and they never came on stating it would be a bumpy flight. Poor service on the pilots behalf. Even the flight attendants were all looking like why is this flight so bumpy! That lets you know that they were wondering what was going on too!! Whoever the pilots were on flight AA1284 they need more training and do not need to be operating a plane if they do not know how to do their job or are unable to do their job. This makes me not want to fly with American Airlines anymore!! Everyone felt like the plane could drop out of the sky every few seconds!! That’s a terrible experience to have! Review the pilots so this doesn’t happen on other flights!!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,All around terrible,"Normally I don't complain being a seasoned traveler that's accustomed to the unexpected. With this airline I was not impressed in the least. I was delayed 4 times having to wait 13 hours in Dallas fort worth airport with the aircraft changing 3 times leaving me running all over the place. The aircraft itself was also disappointing as the AC was broken. We were on tarmac for 3 sweaty hours workout any consolation from the crew. The worst part is their policies are ridiculous! You can't cancel hardly for anything even if it is covid related! Also you pay for check in bags and don't get any free where as other airlines do? That was disappointing, nor on the flight are there any freebies drinks, snacks, or anything offered. They charge for everything... I've had countless great experiences with other airlines that have been seamless even during this unusual time. Needles to say I will not be traveling with them again if I can avoid it."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Trying to get home!,"While trying to get to Turks and Caicos (home) I was humiliated, ignored, belittled and literally told to shut up by the surpervisor at CLT airport. I was traveling with a two month old and a six year old trying to get home. The supervisor came and told me that I could not travel based on the documents I had for the baby. I flew from Orlando with the said documents, same airline. I asked to speak with someone else she told me no. I was talking to one of the ramp agents she literally told me not to talk to him because he worked on the ramp (basically he was nobody). As I was speaking to her she immediately told them to pull my bags from the flight and send me back to Orlando. She was very rude and abused her powers as a supervisor. People like her should not be in a workplace dealing with people. I sorry I did not get her name. I was so angry I cried. I was unable to make it home yesterday so I am still stuck in Orlando until further notice."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,horrible experience,"It is so difficult to understand how British airways (BA) can be partners with this awful airline, American Airlines. (AA). Our flight from LHR to JFK was operated by AA, without us realising this as we booked a BA flight. From the crew people (day and night with the kind and warm BA crew) to the cleanliness of the plane, everything was just disgusting on board of the AA plane.  We got a blanket inside a plastic bag that was stained with vomit!!! In compensation they gave us 2 vouchers that we could never use as the process is tedious. You need to pay with your credit card and then send the vouchers in the mail and within 3 weeks if received they are credited to your tickets and the tickets are issued. Who has that time and life ( I guess if you are retired) to go through all these uncertainties. You can't even book a hotel if your airtickets are not confirmed. Very risky! and shows their modus operandi: they give vouchers that can't be used. Win win situation for AA but for a short time. AA donot underestimate your passengers/clients.I will make sure that none of my future JFK/LHR flights are operated by AA even if booked through BA."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Just avoid American Airlines,"Very bad. Please do not choose  this airline. It cancelled my flight at the last moment and even changed the airport. My flight duration was only 7hrs long with one layover earlier but later they only left me   one option that was 12 hour long with two layovers. Even in that one, the flight got delayed and they did not want to take the responsibility. I got ticket early morning only because I had some stuffs to accomplish there in the afternoon but I could not make it because of them. They do not value your time. Please avoid."

We stood and watched while they got their bags checked in for the same 6:15am flight, that the American airline team members claim we missed. We asked to have our flight rebooked and expressed our disappointment. The customer assistance crew canceled our flight, called the police on us and banned us from traveling with American Airlines for that day, just because we expressed our disappointment. We are a decent educated  couple, we don’t cuss or use bad language in case you were wondering. I am still in shock at the behavior of the American Airlines Ontario airport, California crew. But then what can I say? We are just black folks and can get treated anyhow. God bless America and have mercy."

This organization should be ashamed of themselves and simply closed their business."
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Obtaining boarding pass,When leaving Salt Lake City I went to retrieve my boarding pass from a kiosk next to American Airlines.

AA canceled my flight home on 8/9 without any explanation, forcing me to miss my military duty tomorrow morning.  They rescheduled me for 14 hours later to a flight leaving tomorrow morning.  I called a few times and when I spoke to the representative she said that the cancellation was due to weather/traffic control so they would not give us any hotel voucher or compensation.

I didn't learn from that mistake and so the same thing happened on my most recent trip except this time was even worse. I've flown all over the world, farther and longer to more difficult to reach locations and I've never see such abysmal service. It was the worst I've ever seen and by a huge margin. Learn from my mistake(s) NEVER fly American if 1) you actually want to get there 2)if you want to get there on time 3) want to deal with a company that give's a rat's ass about anything but your money. Of course if you are a masochist and/or just generally enjoy your life as a traveler being made harder than need be then this is the airline for you.I need to add this caveat; the pilot of our delayed plane to Cozumel from DFW, Army vet Capt. Chapman, is the gold standard. Without him, we'd still be sitting on the tarmac in DFW. This guy is a great pilot and a stand up guy!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible,The staff is not professional at all. Semi-friendly but no professionalism. Seats aren't trash but could be better. My entertainment screen did not work which made the trip even worse as there was nothing but my phone to keep my attention which the wi-fi wouldn't stay connected. The young stewardess kept bumping into me and was so clumsy and annoying. Yet the older much older stewardess was so much better at her job and able to balance herself. The carry-on policy is a scam. I watched them check bags that definitely met the size requirement for some and others they let through that were definitely too large. The only good thing about my flight was arriving safely which I credit God and the pilot. But the small amount you think you're saving os NOT worth it!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,NEVER fly American Airlines,"Warning: NEVER fly American Airlines. I don’t care how much cheaper they are. They canceled our flight on our recent trip and told us they could not rebook us until the next day. I pointed out that they were still selling flights for that day on the website, but they refused. They promised to reimburse us for all expenses, but now they are refusing to pay for those expenses. I spoke to two representatives that promised expenses would be reimbursed, so I guess they instruct their employees to lie. Also note that if you call their customer service, the agents have no authority to help you at all. All that they can do is tell you where to send a message using their website. NEVER AGAIN American Airlines!"

Definitely was a bit anxious though since so many American flights have been cancelled. Grateful mine was not one of them."

We tried to re-route on another flight going to Philadelphia leaving at 12:03 AM. 14 minutes before boarding, they delayed flight until 8:00 AM the next day. AA claims both airplanes had mechanical failures. Comforting. They offered no hotel, $12 meal vouchers, and completely incompetent customer service. One attendant couldn’t print out boarding passes, while others laid stupefied by the volume of passengers who needed help to find lost bags. Elderly and persons with mobility challenges were left to roam the airport from one part of terminal 3 to another, sleeping on chairs, with no way to get home. My husband and I vowed to never use AA again, and I suspect with how many passive aggressive late delays and no shows they racked up today, they have lost thousands of future customers. American Airlines: unprofessional. untimely. incompetent.Stay. Away."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Delay Airlines,"My trip exemplified what others have said regarding delays. On a trip from OKC to PHX via DFW, I experienced all of these, each prefaced with the captain announcing “Uh, folks, we are currently...-returning to the apron because we have an external door for the air conditioning duct that was left open by the ground crew...”-waiting for our gate because the plane in our gate is waiting for a first officer...”-waiting for a jetway pilot to move the jetway at our new gate...”-unable to depart because the ground crew left the aft cargo door open...hopefully they will close it shortly...”Each of these delays cost us 20-30 minutes, with many passengers sweating tight connections. Why is it that getting a plane out and in on time is like climbing Everest for AA?Southwest makes it look easy..."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Flyers Beware!!,"I honestly don't even want to give AA a 1 star. Worst customer service and very unprofessional!! Flight was canceled last minute because staff needed to rest?? So inconvenience everyone on the flight because your company does not know how to schedule correctly? We missed a day of work because the next flight wasn't for another 24 hrs. Ridiculous!! You pay an arm and a leg for what?? Then when you call for customer service the managers are useless and tell you to file your complaint online. Which that is another frustration!! It took 4 attempts to submit as the page is on some timer?? And ends the page!! Its been almost a week and still no response from AA! On top of having to reschedule our flight then the new flight had delays at departure, lay over and arrival. So what would of normally been a 5 hr flight turns into 10 hrs.. We never learned our lesson by flying with AA. Every time we use them something happens. Well this time enough is enough!! We will never use them again and will be loud about how awful they are.

Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst Flight Experience Ever,"I booked a flight from LAX to ALB which consisted of one stop/layover in Chicago. Due to there not being enough crew on the plane, my flight from LAX to Chicago was delayed over an hour. Once we boarded the plane, the flight was delayed further due to the luggage sitting on the ground next to the plane while numerous employees strolled by. Because of this, I missed my layover and was stuck in Chicago overnight. After getting off the plane at midnight, alone, lost, and confused in an airport I’ve never been in, I had to stand on an hour-long line to speak with customer service. They did accommodate me with a hotel room and transportation, however, the line for a taxi (transportation) was another hour-long wait due to the fact that the people with transportation vouchers were put at lowest priority after those paying with cash. This was genuinely the worst flight experience I’ve ever had and I will not be flying American again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Wasted money on ""preferred seats""","Wasted money buying ""preferred seats"".   The original seating chart had seats that looked better so I paid a little extra for ""preferred seats"".  They changed planes and reassigned seats at the gate.  The seats we received appeared to be plain coach.  I even asked the stewardess and she agreed.  When I asked for a refund they flatly denied saying those were preferred seats.  I will not fly AA again if I have a choice.  They nickel and dime you and they don't care about your business."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible management horrible customer service,"This makes the 3rd time that A A messed up our trip. The flight attendant was late and caused us to miss our connecting flight to Bahamas,  the only flight for the day. Now we are stuck in Miami.  We will never spend another dollar with this mismanaged airline. No wonder they needed a government bail out"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Business owner,First Class 3 flights across country. One good flight. Other 2 flights were horrible and were a joke. They were Glorified coach seats. Also Dirty and small. 2.5 hour flight and 2 hour flight for these but crammed in an overpriced effort to pretend it was really at first class. They also Made me check a brand new small leather carry on because it had wheels on it and they scratched it up horribly. A beautiful travel bag ruined in one trip. Basically American has eliminated its quality first class experience if you fly domestically. It is Shameful and I would recommend every other airline before them.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Don't bother with AA they lie that its weather related instead of being honest,"We were very excited to take AA this trip as we thought they were more reliable especially travelling with kids but it seems they are below average. At Laguardia our flight was delayed by almost two hours and we subsequently missed our connecting flight to Los Angeles.the agents were also not that helpful or on top of it. Also, they honestly could have asked the connecting flight to wait a bit as there were quite a few passengers travelling to LA from this flight and in the end we arrived 5 minutes after the connecting flight left.  The reason AA gave for the delay was weather issues, but there was nothing wrong with the weather as it was clear and perfect including further east. Apparently they use this excuse in order to not have to reimburse their passengers. A new trick they have come up with taking advantage of people. We not only lost money on a hotel in LA but also had to pay for a hotel in Nashville. They also do not answer their 24 hour contact phone number. We are rebooked to fly out tomorrow but have heard from other passengers that delays and cancellations have been going on for some time now. AA has lost staff and instead of being honest about the fact that they are understaffed like Spririt airlines they lie about the weather so you are stuck sorting out your loss because of them. The staff at Laguardia was also not super on top of things considering this has been going on for a while. Very dissapointing. We would rather fly with Spirit, eventhough they had issues because at least they were honest and trying to do the right thing unlike AA."
Date of travel: August 2021,30,One bright light,"I booked two tickets for myself and my son. I was dropping him off to college.  We had an early morning flight scheduled for the day prior to reporting day. Our flight was canceled. Had to reschedule.  This is where the nightmare began. After being on hold for over an hour I finally got a representative who was unable to book us on the same flight. We agreed to separate flights an hour apart. (JOKE WAS ON ME). Son flight left timely. Mine was delayed an additional hour. Touched down for connecting flight only to find that AA had changed our flights mid air. Son's flight was rescheduled for 2 days after the day he was to report to school. My flight was leaving timely so I was expected to leave my son in the terminal.  Not happening.  If not for Mr. Flemonds, the AA agent, I think I would have lost it. Even with all the discord and chaos going on due to the extraordinary number of flight cancelations he remained cordial and helpful. He helped resolve the flight issues. We arrived to our destination late but we were together and still in good spirits.  So, although it was an experience I can say it was resolved to my satisfaction.  Thank you sir!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,If I could give 0 out of 5 I would,"Parents of dumb children rejoice - your kid has a bright future ahead of them as a manager at American Airlines!  Twice on this trip, a supervisor or above thought it was a good idea to load a plane full of people AT LEAST a full hour before the plane was cleared to fly. The first time on a flight from Miami International to Belize City International, they delayed us at first by half an hour to load because the plane's air conditioning wasn't working, but then they loaded us anyway.  Once loaded, we sat on the tarmac in the stifling plane FOR 2 HOURS before they decided to deplane us and make us wait another 2.5 hours before we could finally board again.  The worst part about that?  The flight from Miami to Belize is 1 hour and 49 minutes - so in the time they made us sit on the tarmac at Miami, we could've reached our destination. Obviously, every single person on that flight missed their connecting flights, and the compensation we got after sitting on the hot non-moving plane for 2 hours was a warm glass of water.  On the way back home, they once again decided to load a plane a full hour before it was cleared for take off, but then had to wait another 30 minutes once cleared to get a new flight plan because the original one had expired in that time.  We then had to taxi at Charlotte for another 20 minutes because we were so late other on-time flights had arrived before us, and because of this, us and half of the flight missed our connecting flights home (which of course was the only of the 4 AA flights on this trip that was departing on time).  We got to the right gate while the plane was STILL ATTACHED TO THE BRIDGE THING, but they would not let us or other travelers on - yet they loaded all of our bags onto that flight.To ""compensate"" us for the missed flights, they gave us a $12 meal voucher (which isn't enough for a meal with the jacked up prices at airports, the only place its valid) and booked us a night in a not-so-nice hotel 5 miles away from the airport.  The distance wouldn't be bad IF they gave us a taxi voucher that actually covered the distance back to the airport - they only paid for 3 miles.  Truly horrendous service and management, and if I can think of a phrase that describes this company better than ""hopelessly incompetent"", I'll let you all know.The only time I would recommend traveling with American is if you have plans in a different city that you really have no plans on attending.  If American is the only choice you have, maybe you should try another destination."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Horrible customer service,"While yes, the plane flies, the customer service is horrible.  If you call, expect to wait 2 to 3 hours... seriously.   By that time, other flights you're looking at have changed price.  Also, make sure you about up at the correct time.  While one agent may tell you you can check in at a certain time, verify.  You would hate to be stranded at the airport sweating in Hawaii because of this, not able to check your bags"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Worst service ever, delayed flights, they gave away my mom's first class seat to another passenger, rude employees","I booked first class ticket for my mom who is 75years old for obvious reasons, i want her comfortable. Her connecting flight which is also American airlines got delayed and she was just in time for boarding but late for the 15 mins before departing time. The attendant bumped her ticket down to economy and paid no attention to my mom. she was rudely ask ""Do you want to board or not?"" When she reach her destination, her bag wasn't even there, the people in customer service was rude and was of no help at all. We called their customer service phone and no one was answering.

Date of travel: July 2021,10,The worst airline,"From beginning to end, a nightmare. Apparently American Airlines is fine with providing zero training for its employees. We flew first class, which was a complete joke. From the ticket agent (who knew absolutely nothing about flying internationally to South America) to the flight attendants having no clue that we had pre-ordered meals based on dietary restrictions, to receptionists at Admiral Clubs who didn't know that first class passengers were allowed admission. Misinformation about everything, zero service.... we could not have been more miserable."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Airlines is the worst,"Recently my family and I flew to Mazatlán for vacation. All was going well until we arrived at SFO for check in. AA had changed the departure time by nearly 2 hours with no notification whatsoever. We ended up missing that flight and I was told the next available flight was the following day and that I would have to pay an additional $240 each in order to take that flight because according to them, wasn't their fault we missed the flight.We take the flight the next day, no discount... Nada! That ended up being and additional and unexpected $960 tacked onto the vacation bill.On the way back from Mazatlán, AA staff stated that the Ellume Covid-19 home tests were not accepted by their airline despite me calling and verifying that AA DID in fact accept the results from that test for return flights to the US. It took 2 supervisors, 45 minutes and a few phone calls to finally get checked in. Once on the plane, we sat on the ground forever and finally took off nearly an hour late. We arrived late to PHX, and it took 45 minutes before they started letting passengers deboard the plane. With only ONE HOUR to get through customs and security, then make it all the way across the airport to catch the connecting flight. Needless to say we missed that flight. Speaking with the attendant at the AA Customer service desk, he scheduled us for a flight from PHX to LAX then a connecting flight to SFO. But no seats were assigned on the LAX-SFO flight. I was told to check in at the gate for seat assignments.THAT flight was nearly a disaster... We had plenty of time to check in and board. But the same problems started. The plane sat on the runway for 45 minutes before taxiing. On arrival to LAX, the same delay in letting passengers deboard. The connecting flight was again, way on the other side of the airport. We hopped on a shuttle and arrived at our gate and the gate attendant said ""We were JUST about to close the door!""  The ONLY saving grace for the last leg of the trip was we were given the last 4 seats in business class for a 45 minute flight.We were originally supposed to touch down in SFO at 5:30 PM on a Friday... We ended up finally arriving at 1:15 AM on Saturday.American Airlines schedules flights and connections too tight!!!! Then charge you for THEIR MISTAKES!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Vacation,Worst flight ever. Straight put us on a hot ass packed plane when the plane was not even ready to take off. Just had us sit in the heat for no reason saying it would only be a few minutes.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Airlines will take your money then leave you stranded for days!,"American Airlines stranded hundreds of us in Puerto Plata with the next return flight 4 to 7 days later.  No reimbursement for all the expenses.  No attempt to book on another airline.  We had to drive 5 1/2 hours to Punta Cana just to get a flight out within 2 days.  Many elderly folks on this flight without enough medicine to cover the extended days.  No regard to passengers health or safety.  I am amazed how effective their system is at taking your money and adding baggage fees and service fees.  Yet their system is completely ineffective for efficiently rerouting or compensating passengers.  I TRULY HOPE THE ENTIRE UPPER LEVEL MANAGEMENT OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GETS STUCK IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY FOR A WEEK DUE TO A MISMANAGED AIRLINE.  WHILE THEY ARE AWAY, AMERICAN CAN FIND A COMPETENT MANAGEMENT TEAM!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Poor customer service with damaged luggage,"Damages luggage but don’t take responsibility. After they required receipts and proof of purchase for the bags, which luckily I still had, they first say the damage is not caused by them, and then saying they don’t refund this type of damage. Then they just stop communicating. Don’t fly American Airlines. For comparison, a few years back we had damage to our luggage with KLM, and they refunded after a much shorter conversation with customer service. Should have known better than booking with AA, we’ll steer clear and stick to KLM/Delta"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst airlines on earth!,"What was supposed to be a 12 hour day of travel ended up taking me 3 days!! No customer service available ( unless you stood in a mile long line for 6 hrs only to have them go home and left 100s without any assistance) even a phone call would take 5 or more hours! Once I was on hold all night, woke up to still being on hold! I ended up having to pay out of pocket for lodging and a new flight! I'm still fighting them for reimbursement yet they play games don't get to the point and still refuse to pay for actual flight. They canceled my flight. Then they canceled another one. Then they delayed it. And once I finally got to the airport three days later for another flight they changed the gate three times in 2 hours! My app was not updated in a timely manner, and even the airport arrival departure boards had the wrong gate listed. Nobody knows what's going on. All the staff seems like chicken with their heads cut off. They're stressed out angry airports are hot, and all the customers are furious. It's been one of the worst experiences of my life playing with American Airlines this past year. Avoid it like the plague if you can.They also lost my luggage. When I arrived to Guatemala I did not have my bags. It took them almost 3 days to find my luggage and finally get it to me. Of course one of my nice new hard case bags was broken. It looks like it was dropped off the plane for the amount of damage that was done to it. I am also now trying to get reimbursement for the bag. You should see the form you have to fill out if they destroy your bag or any of your belongings! They expect you to have an original receipt for every single thing that you're asking for. I don't know who keeps all the receipts for years of lost clothing shoes etc. #americanairlines"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst experience ever,"Got a BS run around and a bunch of excuses. Had a flight delayed 3 times then canceled, American grounded more than 300 fights, they have no crew to fly and still selling all this thicketes.There was more then 2k people waiting in line for more then 4 hours to reschedule a canceled flight. NO ONE TO HELP, WAIT MORE THEN 9 HOURS WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER, NO ONE TO HELP. After told that it was finally canceled and had to wait 4 days for next flight I was told by their agent to go to a hotel pay for it and try to get reimbursed online at AA.comThis is unacceptable, I am a frequent flyer on American air. Never seen so many people upset with them at the same time. No respect for its client, elder people or small children. Do not buy a ticket now if you have to fly in the next couple days, if you do have to fly look for a different air line."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Stay away from AA,Cancelled flight due to flight crew delay.  The plane and pilots were available.  Really bad communication and rude/unprofessional customer service agent.  I will stay away American Airline as much as possible.  They ruined my vacation.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,DON'T FLY,They just give you the run around and will not assist.  I was trying to cancel a flight and they just keep giving me the run around-  extremely limited time to reschedule so they basically keep my money
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Flying was OK but there were problems,"Full planes in post-pandemic days made it a bit uncomfortable. It is disappointing that food & beverage are not yet available. Servers were friendly. My walker got left behind in Sacramento, but somehow they flew it to me in time to catch my Nassau cruise ship. Delivered to the ship. Bravo for that!  Changing planes in Dallas,  there were problems with loading luggage. Poor planning caused a two-hour delay. And we got home after midnight."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"FAA REGULATIONS BROKEN, 30+ PEOPLE SUFFERING, NO WATER HOT TARMAC 3 HOURS.","To Whom it may concern:I’d like to share my experience on American Airlines flight 3838 , 9:40 am, out of Chicago O’Hare on July 26, 2021. I sat in aisle 9 with my husband.Our flight out in the a.m, was delayed due to “maintenance’ issues is all we were told, and then loaded onto a new plane. Strangely, the first thing I noticed boarding the plane was the attendant not dressed in your AA uniform but a man dressed in a women’s shirt (very skin tight a sliky). There was a blue skirt and some women’s Mary Jane shoes included in the uniform. Strange.You may recall, sitting on a sitting on a stationary plane has brought tragic results in the past, prompting new rules and regulations in the FAA as to how long you can let people sit on a hot plane, boarded--and instead of doing this (letting people be indoors for the loading of luggage, fueling and whatever else)—for the safety of the passengers and young children. But sitting in 80-90 degree heat –maybe more once all bodies were packed in--with no water (we begged for it), but instead the flight attendant cared more about my mask position than if I was going to faint or not.  I hope by the day and time (9:40) you can identify this attendant. (only helps identify) and the protocol that was followed. When we began yelling for water from the back, we waited almost 40 minutes until it even was offered to us. I watched an elderly woman really struggling and she came up at the baggage claim, along with others, to thank me for speaking for everyone on the plane (I’m very shy, but I cannot stand to see humans suffer) They thanked me for saving their lives.If I faint with a mask on in 90-degree + (humid) weather after asking for water and being refused, what do you all do? I’m sitting on the flight right now as I write this with WORD because we have no WIFI. I will send it when I get home.NOW, IF WE WERE DOGS IN A CAR AT THIS TEMPERATURE ALL PACKED IN HERE THERE’D BE PEOPLE CRASHING GLASS WINDOWS AND CALLING 911!!! And there would have been criminal charges. I know this—we work very closely with the division of dog law in Harrisburg, PA.So I’m appalled at how you treated humans worse than dogs. What does that mean to your company and reputation?  When a plane has to BEG for WATER??? I work very closely with government writing dog law and we do it so their conditions are HUMANE. We are inspected, graded, and our dogs are treated better than we were today. Heck, we FEED our dogs. Do you know dogs cannot be without water at ANY time in any kennel or home situation??? If caught you can have your dog taken away, be fined, or jailed.I’ve been flying since I was 2 years old (more hundreds of flights than I can keep track of all over the world, but have never seen a flight attendant treat people so badly on a flight. He  (I think it was a he—sorry) would not speak if you spoke to him ( I could not see a name tag—we tried).  When people did, I would observe as he rolled his eyes in annoyance behind them when they turned around. “This person” would not look at us, but in fact “hid” in the area where they serve from, the entire flight. Passive aggressive man here (or woman?) who really cares less about the feelings and health of people on the flight—isn’t that their JOB??? He /She/They hid somewhere, no one could find him until I finally, when I found him,  I said, “People are begging for water back here—really struggling!”  He ignored me and told me adjust my mask. Great. I’m going to faint. (“go ahead and die or faint, but be sure about your mask!)  One of the most absurd statements I heard, and people around me in aisle 3-6 shaking their heads. (You can interview anyone around my aisle 9 or aisles in front to get testimony) The elderly lady was in 8A on that flight. I mean, what about the elderly woman beside me? The nursing MOM? REALLY???? If people have health conditions or had them—your company is going to be in a tough situation. Especially if you get other letters from that flight. I’m sure its reflected in your reviews onlineNot only did AA truly ruin our entire trip (4 days) as 2 days or more were taken up with waiting in airports, cancelled and postponed flights, then sitting people on the tarmac for over 3 hours. I thought the news covered this enough years ago. Do we have to go through this again? More lawsuits to get people to be treated HUMANELY by American Airlines. To at least be treated better than dogs?? SITTING PEOPLE ON A HOT TARMAC IN A 30-SEAT PLANE for over over 2 hours WITH NO WATER IS INHUMANE. You will not and connot convince me otherwise. I think the airline should at the LEAST refund the money of the people who SUFFERED (ALL) on the plane and now missed other flights and are going to suffer financially from THAT too. (What about those that don’t have $1,000 to “re-route”??)I also think this flight attendant should be fired. He does NOT give a good face to your airline. Everyone on board was appalled. I think I was only one of over 30 people brave enough to address the situation of people suffering onboard and stand-still plane on a tarmac for hours. I know this as the elderly women said “no one else was going to approach him.”We will be disputing the charges of our flights and if we do not get satisfaction you will receive a letter from our lawyer, then we’ll have to bring up all the other crap of how you treated us like a mack truck load of third world rescue dogs  I’m disgusted.

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible First Class Experience with American Airlines!,American Airlines should be ashamed of itself with its in-cabin first-class service! The lazy flight attendants did not even offer us a cup of water flying red-eye from  Hon to LAX!  Their new A321NEO first-class seats are extremely thin and uncomfortable for long flights. The so-called first-class seats did not have a TV and their WIFI was extremely slow. Good only for texting! We could not sleep at all in those stripped-down seats all night long. Delta Comfort+ seats and service are far superior to AA First Class.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,DONT FLY,This airline is a bunch of theives!! They are the absolute worst!!!! DO NOT FLY WITH THEM! They ripped my 18 year old son off and left him stuck and stranded. They don’t care about you or your family
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Cancelled flights and not accommodating,"The flight was cancelled, I called customer service and the representative was really helpful. I was traveling with a group of 6 people and they couldn't accommodate us staying together. That was the first big inconvenience. The second was, our original flight left at 9am, and they couldn't get us all on a flight until 10:30 pm. So we went and asked if we could get a voucher for food or a hotel as we had been up all night on the first leg of our flight. We were told we couldn't get a hotel, but they did give us a couple of meal vouchers that only worked at *certain* restaurants in the airport. They also told us we could try for standby. Standby was frustrating. They wouldn't let our group fly together and they wouldn't let us choose who in the group could have priority. A few people had to wake up early to work the next day, but they wouldn't let us trade spots. The names of the 6 people in our group were all over the standby list and they wouldn't let us change that. We were never emailed confirmation of our new flight, even though we were told we would be. So between the lack of help, communication, and running from gate-to-gate all day trying to get on standby... AND their lack of willingness to provide accommodation or refund the flight... I'll do my best to never fly with American Airlines again."

Due to hotel-provided transportation, arrived 3 hours early before my scheduled flight. I took a chance and as the earlier flight home was boarding, awesome gate agent (Monica) got me on the earlier flight. She was swamped as the flight was boarding, but took the time to help me.  Got a roomy emergency row seat, and was welcomed by a lovely flight attendant (don't recall name) whose daughter is a plebe at the Naval Academy.  Another kind flight attendant (wish I had her name) helped me stow my carryon since I didn't have under-seat storage. The pilot was focused on getting us airborne to beat a storm headed our way and apologized for his delayed welcome.  I needed to write this review because there are hard-working professionals in this business who will keep me coming back.  Awesome job, crew of 1262 Cancun - Philly."
Date of travel: August 2021,30,masks,While mask restrictions are in place and I'm  100% in agreement. I was disappointed that flight attendant did not take notice that 2 people with their masks down under their noses. Safety needs to be priority and clear observation need to be followed.
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Mask Enforcement,"Even though I am fully vaccinated, I was traveling to visit my elderly, chronically ill grandparents. During my flight, there were too many people with masks below their nose and/or mouth. This included the rows around me. When flight attendants did what were supposed to be “mask checks” I didn’t notice anyone correct behavior. Some people had masks off or not over nose and mouth the whole flight. As we went to land I watched a flight attendant tell a man to put his tray up, completely ignoring the fact his mask was below his mouth and nose. I’m disappointed in the lack of enforcement of health and safety protocols."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Pitiful,The worst… this is the second time they stranded me. They sent a message that my flight was delayed and I would miss my connecting flight. They gave me an option to change flights… ends up not the connecting flight but the entire trip. The only option was to book on another day stranding me in Wyoming. I tried calling for help when the virtual assistant didn’t go anywhere. The automated system said all agents were busy and they would call me back…. In over 4 hours! When I tried to cancel and get a refund I got nowhere.If they make a dime profit it’s too much. They spend nothing on making it right for their customers. No excuse for not helping us get home. Just automated nothing… if your going to spend your money on automation then do it right. And ultimately spend some of that billions in profit on helping the customers that pay for a service. I’d rather walk then fly AA.

EveMy flight was delayed 2-1/2 hours from Orlando to Philly, the captain held us in a plane which we could get out to get fresh air or stay inside the airport. Seating is horrible, very uncomfortable.Unbelievable, after sitting in 2-1/2 hours, our flight took off at 7pm from Orlando to Philly and my connecting flight from Philly to PVD supposedly at 8:45pm, we landed in Philly at 8:40pm and missed my flight to PVD.I was upset, I was so exhausted from being delayed in the first place. I went to AA customer service, I talked to a  white lady at gate A17, she told me there are no more flights to PVD at night so I have to stay at the airport until 2 pm the next day. I was in tears and I told her that I have health issues and I need to take my medicine. She said that I should have them in your person. She was rude and not sympathetic and she said, these things happen. The other two black women heard my conversation and I was short of breath and they told me to sit down and they are helping me to get  an early flight which is ""stand by"" for 11 am the next day. I wish I had their names to thank them again. They offered me a hotel to stay in and a $12 food voucher for that hotel. Most of American Airlines staff and Philly staff are not helpful to the travelers. I hope I never have to connect in Philly again. I will never fly or recommend this airline ever. A lot of angry travelers so I won’t fly cheap anymore, lesson learned, Jetblue, Southwest or Delta all the way. Paying the extra it’s worth it. I'd rather walk than fly Frontier Airlines or American Airlines.  My ticket to fly was cheaper than my bags. They make you pay for even a carry-on and that's ridiculous.

They had pilots but nobody to work the cabin.  Ticketing agents were overwhelmed and rude due to quantity or people in line. They cancelled about 12 other flights at the same time. Ticketing agent refused to look up other airline options and told me the only way to get home was to take a flight to Philadelphia in order to back track all the way to L.A, with my small dog in tow. They refused to give me a direct flight the following day though they were showing one on their website with seats available. I was told since I was being ""demanding"" the only way to get a direct flight home would be to remain in St Louis for 48 more hours than planned, resulting in missed work days and lodging costs. Took reservation line 18 hours to call me back to work out details.Finally flew home on 48 hours later with the rudest flight crew and abysmal gate agents. Went to request a refund or some sort of simple customer service gesture and was told if I needed that, I should have cancelled my return flight and requested it. Absolutely unapologetic and rude during the entire process."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,AMERICAN AIRLINES IS Worst Airline EVER.,It's the worst ever they never refund any money. Can't get anyone on phone.But in Charlotte they have monopoly and do what they want.
n/a,10,51st Anniversary trip,I booked a round trip to Miami for my wife and me for our 51st wedding anniversary due to last year's covid pandemic. I decided to upgrade to first class for this trip. The flight down was great on July 30th. My wife is a NY Yankees fan and I  had tickets at the two games in LoanDepot stadium on the 31st and the 1st of August.  During the game I got a message that my return flight on August 2nd had been canceled.  I tried to call the airlines to find out what had happened and was put on hold. Because I could not hear with the game going on and could not get through to them I had to wait until the game ended. I then called back and was put on hold again for 4.5 hours before I got through to ask them what happened. I was told that I had cancelled the flight and that it was a nonrefundable flight. I explained that we were at a ballgame and I could not have canceled the return trip but they said that there was nothing they could do. After about 30 minutes on the phone the operator told me that she could get me on a flight back to Charlotte at 5:30pm on the 2nd but it would be economy coach and that was all she had authority to do.  I asked to speak with her supervisor and she put me through to a person who identified as a supervisor named Julie. She told me that if I did not take the lesser seats that I would have to rebook my flight and it might be two or more days befor I could get a flight. Also it would be full price for the trip. I asked about a refund of the cost of the return flight that was canceled not by me but the system and she told me that it was a nonrefundable and it I didn't take the flight I would loose the money I had paid both for the flight and the $200 upgrade to first class. Then she said that is all that they would do. I took the flight under protest but we had to get back home. I feel the system or someone in American  Airlines canceled my flight back because of overbooking or something else. Why would I  cancel my return flight the day before then try to get it back the same day? As for the help they offered it was almost nothing. They were not sorry or helpful they refused to believe that there system had caused the problem. I am fulfilling the promise that I would leave them a review of my ✈️ and that I would tell the truth about what happened. I was told that the upgrade charge would not be refunded and that I would have to take it up with customer service and try to get a refund through them. First-time I have ever gone first class and the last time I will purchase the upgrade. I feel that they overbooked the flight and canceled my return trip because it was not refundable and they knew I would have no choice to do anything. Thank You American Airlines for a memorable 51st wedding anniversary I will never forget it.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,THE WORST AIRLINE THERE IS,ABSOLUTE WORST is you could rate zero stars i would!! Number 1 we were suppose to leave at 12:00PM we however got delayed and delayed and delayed. When we got down to the screen saying we had 15 minutes left till boarding they made an announcement that our gate was switching to one all the way on the other side of th airport. When we switched gates the time was 6:10 PM.An hour later we finally got onto the plane after everyone boarded and we got settled they made and announcement that our planes cockpit AC was broken and maintenance was working on it. It was about 9 when this happened when the intercom came on again the flight attendant said they fixed the AC but something in the lavatories wasnt working. We ended up having to get off the plane and they would not give us a hotel room after flight attendant said we would all get a hotel voucher. When we deplaned the worker as we were coming off was very mad at us when we asked her to repeat what she had just said because we just came off the plane very rudely she repeated it. The next day when we were at the airport we finally got back to our gate and they delayed us again because the pilots weren’t there so once two pilots were there they made another announcement that their would be a second delay because we needed a third pilot for the length of the flight when he finally arrived we FINALLY made it on to the plane and took off over 24 hours delayed. NEVER FLYING AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN!!!!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never surprises me how bad they can be.,"Just an absolutely terrible airline. From customer service to flight service, it’s as if they strive to be one of the worst of the major carriers. I’m a platinum member and I get treated terrible every time I travel with American Airlines. There are so many more better options out there."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,From the hard marble floor at 3 am DFW,"I spent the night on a hard marble floor on hold with AA trying to rebook from flight that should have left at 6:50 pm August 1. I had landed at DFW at 2:30 pm August 1 and expected a four hour layover so I didn’t carryon what I would need if I planned to spend the night. As my flight was getting delayed and gates were changed I approached the AA gate agent to find out if the flight would actually take off. The airport at our destination closes at 10 pm typically as no flights land after 10. She said that they could request that the airport stay open. Is that possible? When they finally boarded us, it was 11:30 pm with an estimated 1:30 am arrival. This didn’t seem possible but they did put us on the plane. The pilot arrived after we were boarded and announced that there was a maintenance issue and we should take off after it is addressed. Apparently, the toilet was making a funny noise which sounds vaguely like BS. Well, the issue stalled take off for about 45 more minutes when the pilot announced that he ran out of time and had to go. Somebody said he is running off. No more announcements for 15 minutes. We received text messages informing us that our flight was canceled. After a few more minutes the flight attendant said we needed to get off the plane. It is now 1 am, hotels are full, no rental cars are available and Uber is charging people exorbitant amounts to get to a hotel. On top of that, we no longer have valid tickets and if we leave the airport, we can’t get back in. The AA gate agent who had assured us we would get this flight out said we should go to another terminal - from terminal B to A gate 21 because there is a shorter line there at the customer service station. It turns out that station had been closed for a while and every employee I found and asked about when they were going to open said 6:30 am and everyone knows it is not open all night. Yes, the gate agent sent us to a closed customer service station to get rid of us knowing we would be stranded all night in the airport. Hold time to call AA was 4-7 hours at this point. AA only offered a Wednesday flight to me online when flights were available for Monday. I ended up having to purchase a ticket for $400 to fly out on Monday. I was on hold for 3 hours. On Monday, our gate was changed 3 times and we were delayed for hours. At the second gate, the AA gate agent was purposely setting off the alarm and announced that there was a maintenance issue. I wasn’t the only one who noticed that AA employees were actively sabotaging flights and stranding passengers. I hope they understand that they endangered the health and safety of thousands of people. Staff and AA failed to care. I seriously recommend taking a different airline and do whatever possible to not fly through DFW. I called for help on the white phones and they didn’t help at all even when I told them there were infants and small children sleeping on the floor. They didn’t even offer water. I have never experienced anything remotely like this. AA can do more to manage disasters like this. DFW should have procedures and supplies at the ready for emergencies like this. And Dallas should step in."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,On hold for 1.5 hrs no answer 2hrs before delayed flight scheduled to leave.,My wife and I were scheduled to fly with one stop. This is for our wedding.  a flight was delayed 2hrs before we were scheduled to leave. The delay Caused us to miss our connecting flight. We were on hold for an hour and a half before the first flight left trying to change flights. No answer from American Airlines. They only offer services on their app apparently. We could not afford to reschedule our marriage. We will likely have to pay $1400 to get a flight the next morning. Other times I have flown with them it has been fine. But if you have an issue good luck resolving it in a timely manner.
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Barely Average,"For this trip (there and back) most of the flights were decent. However, on the flight from Charlotte to Tri-Cities, there was a really hateful mask nazi on a power trip as the flight attendant. She was so rude...I hope she steps on legos."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible Airline,Today was the second time in less than two weeks that they canceled this flight at the last second. When I called to see if they could get me on another flight they could not have cared less. I was supposed to be attending a funeral today. They don't care. Two weeks ago I was offered a meal voucher for my inconvenience. I am not even able to use it because they don't serve food in economy. Are you kidding me??? They gave a lousy food voucher and I can't even redeem it?They have a lot of nerve. Steer clear of this airline unless it's you absolute LAST resort. I WILL NOT FLY WITH #AMERICANAIRLINES AGAIN!!!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Terrible customer service, shocking experience","While boarding flight AA2534 on August 4, 2021, we faced unprecedented rudeness and unacceptable treatment from the shift clerk and supervisor.We were seeking for help and assistance as well as some clarifications on COVID-19 requirements, but received absolute indifference and  shocking rudeness.We have never experienced such a humiliating treatment.The supervisor refused to listen to us and shouted in a rude manner.That was the biggest disappointment for the last 25 years, which completely ruined our 42nd wedding anniversary trip."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Entering the thresh hold of hell American Airlines,I honestly won’t give the time of day in this review but I have nothing nice to say about American Airlines. I didn’t know they had some bad reviews so booked a flight with them and my family bit mistake. Everything from messed up flight plans to over the top rudeness. Don’t fly with them please just pay the extra few hundred dollars to fly on another airline. Charlotte staff super rude. Leaving Aruba super rude. It was horrible because you could nothing about anything and if you start making a fuss people will consider you a threat.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Absolutely terrible,My flight was canceled due to covid. they gave me a credit but keep putting deadlines on it. I bought 2 tickets with my debit card but im not allowed to change the names or anything on my tickets. Their ticket insurance 100%worthless. I will never ever use American Airlines again. trash company.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible Service with American and Funjet,"Had clients at airport delayed because American & Funjet merged their e-tickets. The airline was rude, the clerks were nasty and unhelpful.  They threatened the client with you better hope the TSA doesn't want a COVID test! Since they were flying to PUJ they did not need one!  Once seated on plane, every comment made by the airlines was I don't have time to help you.  Attitude for doing your job! I won't be booking AA or Funjet ever again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible customer service and ethics,"I had canceled a trip in 2020 due to covid. I received a flight credit for canceling which was expected.. here it is 2021 and I was ready to use my flight credit for an emergency flight back home from another airliner who had last minute canceled me. I was trying to book my flight on aa.com and use my flight credit to do so, and then received an error message explaining I could not use my flight voucher online and had to call customer service. Meanwhile I call customer service like I was instructed to and they put me on hold for 2 hours.. I couldn’t wait 2 hours to book my flight because the American Airlines flights I needed to get home were booking up rapidly from other customers needing to get home from their canceled flights as well. So I had to spend MORE money on a flight I should have gotten for half the price with my voucher. I called customer service after I had bought the ticker, explained my scenario and instead of empathizing with me she bluntly told me I couldn’t use my voucher on the flight I just booked with no explanation of why. I already bought the ticket since it was an emergency but I will not be flying American anymore because there flight vouchers are hard to use and unable to book online. Having to call someone and be out on hold for 2 hours to book a flight isn’t reasonable when MOST people book online."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Never, never, never again flying with American Airlines",Thank you SO much American Airlines for the 3 cancellations in the same day. You really know how to treat your customers. After 18 hours of delay and loving the Dallas Forth Worth terminal. You genuine suck.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,American Airline sucks,"Not organzed at all. Bad time to spend my birthday. I had to wait 2-3days. First they delayed my flight from Durham/Releigh Airport , NC. Then they canceled my connecting flight in Dallas. Im totally going to file a claim with my travel insurance."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible Airline,"No Star at all if I can. I traveled with 2 minors (6 and 9 years old). They seated my kids far away from me. I called 1 week in advance to ask them put us sit together. They refused to do so and asked us to pay. The manager even said ""We don't accommodate minors."" That is terrible statement and service. Never flight from them again."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Average airline,"I was surprised to see the way people entered the airplane. It was a massive flight, crowded and being in Businness class didn´t make a difference aside from the seats and the food. Sharp departure and landing schedules.Flat seats, average screens, food and beverages were ok, but not outstanding. Very poor entertaining options. Polite flight attendants attitude. Nice beauty kit assortment."
Date of travel: August 2021,30,poor customer service,"American Airlines is my preferred airline.  However, service centers in airports are badly staffed.  I waited in line, not with a complaint, but a need to change to an earlier flight. My wait time in line was 1 hour, 5 minutes and I was 6th in line.  3 unhappy customers held up the entire process for 3 agents in the Richmond airport to handle these changes.  Then instead of issuing me a seat, they put me on standby for a flight that only 2/3 filled.  Then I had to wait in line again at the gate to get a seat assignment.  All of this could have been handled one time by the customer service agents.  I do understand all of these folks are overworked, but the government gave them money to keep people employed.  Where did that money go?JLH   age 75"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never book this airline,"I would never book this airline again let a lone  recommend it to anyone. There was no entertainment in this day not having a tv is a big NO NO not to mention the rudeness of the flight attendance. I was traveling with my child didn't pay attention to setting I was separated I had to leave my kid few seats behind it was so hard made the flight even longer. When I told the flight attendant about it he just pointed to my boarding pass and said "" because of the section 8 "" I know I didn't book first class but I paid $906 for it round trip it's not like it was cheap or free. First time in AA Air and I know for sure it was my last."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,No Service - No Care - Can't Schedule ETC.  Poor Operations,"American Airlines can't and nor will they even try too provide help for their customers. Again getting a run around from this poor performing organization who daily show they do not care about us. Even as a member of their rewards club and Platinum Elite Card holder, they just take your money, throw you around wherever they want, pick and choose who is grounded even when they make the schedule, and then make monetary offers then don't follow through? Not to mention the Relations department taking over 2 weeks to not resolve an issue that should have been resolved in 24 hours. This is just an embarrassing operation at this point. I don't know if we should use tax money to bail out companies like this that would never left a finger to help any of us? Time for me to have our company take a look at the other airlines out there that may actually want our business and at least act like we are valued. By the way a Bryan Artz was the last person who failed to elevate my issue as requested twice via phone or email, so they can't even do that correctly."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Experience Ive Ever Had With a Company. THEY DONT HAVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"Ill try to make this short, but american airlines screwed up so bad it cant even be explained in an essay. So i live in CT, and tried to take a trip to NC because i had an important appointment made over a month in advance, that cost $175 to make. My flight was scheduled for july 11th with 1 stop. Well, at midnight july 11th, hours before my flight, i was notified my flight got cancelled. Called american airlines to find it took from MIDNIGHT TO 8PM TO GET OFF HOLD. Literally 20 hours on hold. The person told me that they had no flights going out the 11th, and that the next flight was on the 12th. Great, just missed the appt i waited a month and paid for. Now my entire trip has no value or meaning. Well, i paid for 4 Choice Window seats so that i get the seats i want, and guess what? That $35 per seat isnt refunded or transferred to the new plane. They just decided i dont get to choose my seats anymore despite paying for them. First flight went down, landed in WA, then of course the 2nd flight was delayed THREE AND A HALF HOURS. Got to NC over a day late tired as hell and didnt even have a reason to be there anymore. Whatever. So, my return was scheduled on july 16th with one stop in philly. Of course, i drive 2 hours from Murphy NC to Ashville for the airport, and IN THE PARKING LOT i get a text saying they cancelled my flight to philly, but NOT the one to CT. Wow. So their plan was to fly my to philedelphia, leave me there, and not even take me to ct. Tf? Call them again and wait 7 hours for them to get off hold, and they tell me theres no flights to CT until the 18th. I looked and found southwest and delta airlines were both flying from NC to CT with no issue, and was told that only american airlines cancelled. Are you kidding me? So, they rescheduled my flight for the 18th, and i had to pay for a hotel for TWO DAYS in NC as well as tell my boss at work that american airlines abandoned me halfway across the country and refused to take me home. He wasnt happy. I also had to call my grandfather and tell him for the next two days, id need him to drive an hour to my house to care for my animals. Great. The return flight finally comes, and i dont have choice seating that i paid for because once again the flight i paid money for never took off. Well, i sit down in my assigned seat that has 0 leg room and is insanely uncomfortable (the planes were literally so small there was only 3 seats per row and you had to duck not to hit your head, worst flights in history) and what do you know? ""Sorry sir but this side of the plane is too heavy we need someone to move."" Well my 140 pound ass had to get out of the seat and move. Then guess what? ""Were sorry but a component of the plane has broken and were going to need a new aircraft, please wait as we reboard you."" Are you actually kidding? I had to stay ANOTHER 5 HOURS in the airport waiting for a new plane to come so we could take our flight. I get back to CT 3 days late, to find those extra 3 days also cost me $70 in airport parking.My original flight was $670. I paid $35 x 4 for choice seats. I didnt receieve a single one of those seats. I paid to leave on july 11th, i was forced to leave on the 12th. I paid to come back on july 16th, i was forced to come back july 18th. I did a quick online booking, which led to 28 hours on hold on the phone. After contacting American Airlines, they were INSANELY RUDE to me, literally would compensate me even for the choice seats they wouldnt provide, wouldnt compensate me for the two flights delayed days,wouldnt compensate me for the 2 extra days i had to pay for a hotel, wouldnt compensate me for the 3 days i was FORCED by them to park at the airport, and couldnt even have a good attitude. Seriously, American Airlines is the single worst company i have EVER had to deal with in my entire life. Is there any legal action i can take to get my money back? They literally cost me nearly $1400 and didnt even give me a PIECE of the service i paid for. I paid for 4 plane seats, and didnt end up on a single one because of them. I lost over a thousand dollars and i have to RESCHEDULE THE ENTIRE TRIP BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO GET ME TO MY APPOINTMENT. What the hell do I do? You couldve offered me $1500 to take that trip and i wouldve refused because of how bad it is. I will never touch american airlines property again, nor will i ever use expedia again. I pray that both companies go bankrupt."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Original flight canceled with only an hour's notice. Worst travel experience I've had.,"Flight canceled with only an hour's notice before needing to go to the airport for my original flight. I was automatically rescheduled from a Sunday flight to a Monday flight where I would've needed to take an extra day off. Had to re-route my flight from Hartford, CT to Providence, RI, and my new flight was supposed to land at 12:30 am Monday. There were about 3 different delays to the first leg of my flight and one delay to my 2nd leg. I didn't land until 1 am and didn't get home until 1:45. There was no follow-up survey or way to leave feedback so I'm leaving it here. I already had another flight booked or I would be avoiding flying again on American any way possible. I don't recommend them at all."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible experience,"Just experienced the worst flying experience of my life. We arrived in Tampa 3 hours before our flight. Checked in and went through security. Received a text from AA that our flight was delayed by an hour and a half. We were flying with a toddler, that's a lot of time to kill, but ok. American Airlines then proceeded to delay our flight in tiny increments of 15 or 30 minutes at a time for the next 9 HOURS, no explanation given. One employee mentioned mechanical issues but that's it. Eventually the incoming flight was scrubbed and they got us a different plane from somewhere else. About 1110 pm they announce the plane that was arriving at 1120 needed to be unloaded and then loaded and take off before midnight or the flight would be cancelled. The mobile boarding passes stopped working slowing the whole boarding process. Eventually we took off at 1204 am on an old ratty Airbus that looked like it should have been retired years ago. Several small children who had had enough proceeded to cry most of the 4 hour flight. NEVER flying American Airlines again. NEVER."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Horrible Check-in process,"I recently flew international.  AA join with something called VeriFLY.  It is the most clunky, non user friendly check-in process I have ever seen.   And the kick is you have to go to the counter from them to check all that you uploaded manually.  So why the process? What is it that you seek to accomplish? I am definitely travel international with some other carrier.   VeriFLY process is trash."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Pick Another Airline,"Getting home has been the most soul sucking experience of my life thanks to this airline. I was supposed to be flying home yesterday and working today, but my flight was running about 2 hours late yesterday, so that would cause me to completely miss my connecting flight. They had the majority of the passengers rebook their flights, and the soonest available was today at 7:20. I had to call my work and tell them I’d be out another day, which I’m sure is going to go just swell for me when I get back. So, today, I get here at 6am. I’m waiting in line to recheck my bag and there are only two people working this line. One of which is helping someone who they should have had just step aside while they figure things out so they could move other people through. The other lady just decides to up and walk off and not come back for about 30min. Which means this line was at a complete stand still for 30min, causing most of us to have to rebook our flights. So now I have to board a flight at 10:40. I just want to go home and this company keeps slacking. Which brings me to realize that all of my really bad flight experiences have been through this company. Never again. I will avoid this airline at all costs from now on."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Book elsewhere!!!,With less then 12 hours before departure our flight was canceled. No explanation was provided. The only option provided was a new flight 4 days later or flight reimbursement. How can this be considered acceptable. My family will never do business with American Airlines. I would recommend the same for anyone else.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Pick another airline,"We were supposed to fly out of SA @ 2:39, didn’t actually get on the plane till after 5. Connecting flight in Phoenix was cancelled when I got there. Went to customer service and there were about 10 people in front of me and the lady comes out and says this customer location was closing and we’d have to find another one. Checked to see the next flight they offered and I wasn’t going to make it to my destination till after 8pm the next day. Booked a flight withSouthwest from my phone to make it to Vegas in time for work."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN,"First time flying American, will be my last. Not only did they not notify us that our 6am flight tomorrow would be canceled, but they have left me on hold for over three hours with international fees increasing as I write this. Thankfully had enough time to book another hotel, but I have every reason to believe our new flight will also be canceled. “Weather?” Yeah I’m sure, considering the entire staff has quit in every airport that’s having this same issue at the moment. At this point I just want to be home, as do the THOUSANDS of people stranded right now. NEVER flying with American ever again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Unbelievably bad,I got tickets with American Airlines and the flight was canceled. Ok it happens. They gave me full credit - fine. I booked another flight and that flight was also canceled !!! Waited the whole day on standby and still didn’t make a flight. It was awful. I hate this airline. I don’t recommend it. Use United
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst Airline,"First of all , they cancel our flight , change the date to the next day in the afternoon with only 12 dollars for our breakfast, dinner and lunch. After that , we went in to get our bags and one of them is missing . The guy in the baggage service helped us a lot , but he couldn’t find it . Worst service ever . We don’t have our bag and we are leaving the next day"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,EPIC FAIL,"August 2, 2021, a day that shall live in infamy in the American Airlines Legacy.  That is the day American Airlines lost me, a million miler with AA and (of course) initially USAIR.  I will tell you that USAIR was a customer centric organization and I gave many KUDOS to management because delivering a true service to consumers day in and day out starts at the top.  The lack of delivering a truly excellent service day in and day out is the fault of management for the same reason.  The post COVID American Airlines experience is terrible if not consistently terrible.Today started out by our getting up at 5 AM to get on a direct flight from LAX to Boston.  The 405 north was unusually light and I thought this to be an omen of good things to come with our trip.  This was not to be the case.Let's start at the gate.  Gate agents for our flight 2455 were overwhelmed to say the least.  Several flights were being moved between gates, and the voices of these agents were at once condescending and harsh.  There were a couple of hispanic women at the gate waiting area that were clearly not from the US that were caring for an infant.  They asked me in Spanish for help.  Their flight to Dallas/Ft. Worth  was to depart at our gate (42B) seemed to be in a state of flux (I went online and there were no updates, gate TBD).  So, after my flight was cancelled (we will get to that in a moment) I agreed to help the women translate with the gate agent.  I asked the gate agent for guidance as to where the flight would depart to Dallas Ft. Worth for our new lady friends and the agent fumed ""why are they still here?  I told them where to go!! Why are they coming back to this gate.  I can't walk every person to their flight. "" I told her that her anger was misplaced, these women did not speak English and were frozen in their fear to be alone and in need of help.  I demanded that she disclose to me the terminal and gate number that the flight would depart from and the agent lost it.  I took a page from the Germans and asked her what her name was.  She did not tell me but calmly wrote down the terminal and gate number.  I wrote instructions for the ladies in Spanish and sent them on their way.  Ok, now to my personal American Airlines debacle (made a little better by the fact that I was able to take some stress out of the day for our new friends).  Our flight gets cancelled, my wife's confirmation code was  inadvertently changed thus taking her off of my itinerary.  Two confirmation codes.  I try to rebook online, I have status, now she does not.  Could not book fast enough.  Every time I booked my flight and went to put her on, the flight sold out because of the number of flights cancelling, and so on.  I call American Airlines customer service and agree to a 2 hour call back.  I get the call back and the automated system hangs up on me.  So I call again, getting an hour and a half lead time (this time) to talk to a human.  Well guess what?  A human called!!  I told the agent about what happened and that I wanted to cancel the return leg of my flight.  She did it, I asked her to send the bags to my home and what did she do?  She placed me into an endless cue to speak to baggage claim.  Now, she committed to stay on the phone with me until the call connected to baggage claim but that didn't happen.  So where am I now?  Sipping cocktails in the Delta SkyClub (they allow AMEX Platinum card holders free access).  My wife has a platinum card as well so we are both in here enjoying the Delta Hospitality (making the best out of this disastrous day).  Where are my bags?  American says they are still on the plane (the flight that was cancelled).  American Airlines is playing the COVID card like so many other weaker management teams are doing around the country (my partners and I call this failure under the cover of COVID).  While American makes up excuses, I will make sure to make my DELTA Airlines challenge miles to maintain status with them as I will no longer fly the airline I have flown 1 million miles plus on.  Today, I started out planning on getting home safely and on time from my (former) choice airline, American; instead, I am on a Delta red-eye.  I guess my golf clubs will get to my home sooner or latter...."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,American Airlines 2021 is a dumpster fire,"When I say I have never experienced a bigger circus show- I mean it. American Airlines couldn't care less about their customer service, I've been here almost 8 hours and they do not have WiFi, customer support, ticket counter attendees, or sympathy. Your flight was cancelled five minutes before boarding? We don't care. You had to sleep overnight with minors? We'll get them out, not you, quit complaining. I am honestly floored by the lack of empathy, staff, and overall general management in an airport that LITERALLY brought many companies here for its superior supply chain. Yes, if you're buying a nail file off of Amazon, it's a dream. If you're a human being trying to fly, forget it and go somewhere else."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Avoid American Airlines Trans Atlantic,It is quite possible that American Airlines have replaced United as the worst airline in the US!The list is too long with issues. The simple advice is to do what you can to avoid flying American Airlines transatlantic.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worse Airline!,"Already expected it to go worse, so my hopes weren’t to high. Despite it being cheap (sometimes), don’t risk it! Don’t book with American Airlines! You will guarantee get delays and canceled flights!!! Their honestly the dumbest airlines. Period"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible,"Terrible terrible terrible. My flight was cancelled. After waiting in standby for two hours I noticed that almost every other gate around me was experiencing cancellations, delays, or some sort of inconvenience..."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Airlines,"American Airlines canceled our flight from Charlotte, North Carolina to St. Thomas due to lack of maintenance on the aircraft. Not only was our flight canceled but also a flight to Denver. I find it amazing that needed maintenance was discovered on the preflight check! Many people were disappointed as vacation plans fell through. Given a voucher to hotel will share later. Disappointed I was given a $12 dinner voucher. Rescheduled for tomorrow to fly out with poor seat selection. Extremely disappointed I am missing part of a very expensive family vacation!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Cancelled Flights twice and had 1 agent checking in bags...,"Yeah so we showed up 3 hrs early at SLC airport and there was a giant line with ONE AGENT checking in everyone and their bags. Could you not have at least 1 more agent helping out??Anyway, my wife still missed her flight and American Airlines cancelled her flight TWICE. Next time we are flying Delta."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Government bailout on its way!!!!,Canceled flight from PVR to Dallas due to weather.  Next available flight 2 more days.  2 more hotel nights and meal expenses for family of 5.  AA says no refund for using another carrier or hotel.  Why?  Because the 15 min storm in DFW was a natural occurrence not mechanical.   Maybe it’s because your staff didn’t show up due to your crappy corporate structure.  Don’t buy American!!!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never again...American Airline!,"The lack of accountability and leadership is extremely apparent, as it pertains to taking care of paying customers... We've had scheduled flights continuously being delayed and cancelled since 2 August 2021- forced to stay overnight after waiting in the terminal for over 10 hours ( e.g., initial departure was 2 PM) with no communication or guidance. The second day more of the same, scheduled flight was 10:50 AM- in true fashion we've been dealing delay after delay. Be advised, we scheduled the days we could travel- we didn't give you the right to  dictate anything beyond what we purchased. The airlines should be legally responsible for loss wages when they change flights without providing immediate options for changing to alternate and available airlines!Not Sorry,Regi#neveragainAA"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Cancel/Delayed Flights,"My wife and I tried to have our belated honeymoon to Colorado. Flight @ 7:44 PM on Sunday got canceled, next flight Monday @ 12:30 PM (canceled), next flight at 6 AM on Tuesday. I had to just cancel the whole thing and book with United. I’m never doing American Airlines again. Too freaking stressful."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Pretty useless,"Cancelled two flights in a row. The first was because their staff didn’t show up and the second was for an unexplained problem. The actual service is hard to rate since it didn’t happen but if their staff is so lazy that they don’t show up, I doubt they would do better during the flight. I don’t know if this is a common problem around the country or if it is just the dfw airport, but going off of my experience with them I can say that an airline that doesn’t fly is pretty useless."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,The worse Arline ever!,They cancelled my flight without a reason. The wants me to rebook the same  fight for 300% more. It is fraud. DO NOT BOOKED WITH AA. STAY away!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Never again,"Was supposed to be returning home Saturday from MSY to SAT our flight was pushed back in 30 minute increments which started at maintenance issues then changed to crew issues. We missed our connection to San Antonio at 7 and was told there were no other flights that could get us to SA not even with another airline, by 10-11 our flight was eventually canceled and we were told we would be compensated with stay and food vouchers. Five minutes later everyone was told there were no hotels and no one received their food vouchers we had to sleep in the airport with no food. It is now Monday and we’re still not home. I know AA employees don’t care to work but I’m now having to put in personal time at work and still haven’t gotten an answer on a refund or some sort of compensation since it’s their fault 48 hours later and I’m still not home."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Don’t lie,They say they are canceling flights due to the weather.  Don’t lie: we heard it’s because of staffing problems.  Money spent on our trip for reservations is being wasted while we sit.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,They don't care about you - AT ALL!!,"Bad weather in Dallas caused delays. Instead of reorganizing the flights, they just canceled them. This resulted in thousands of people stranded. They had THREE customer service reps to handle a line of over 500 people that never decreased. I was in line over 3 hours and made it about 1/3 toward the front. They didn't answer their phones. Their website and app were no help at all. I even called my Chase card travel agency, and they tried to help but AA wouldn't allow them make any changes. Supposed to be home Aug 1 at 830pm. AA solution was to book me on flight for Aug 4th. Like... just wait an extra 3 days, no big deal right? Meanwhile, the representatives were literally yelling at customers and refusing to answer any questions."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst airline,The worst airline ever.  Always canceling flights. Canceled flight 2 days in a row with out trying to reschedule tickets. Will never use or recommend this airline again.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Cancelled flight, poor customer service",Received text message at 2:30AM that my flight at 7:59 AM was cancelled and would be rebooked. At 5AM received email with my rebooked flight for tomorrow afternoon. No option to fly today was provided. Attempted to speak with someone at AA. I was on hold for well over an hour before I gave up. This is the second time AA has done this to me.  No reason for cancellation was provided. Will never book with them again.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Cancelled, delayed a day, 2+ hour hold time, & no hotel accommodations","They cancelled my flight and delayed it over a day, so I missed picking up keys for my new apartment and had to book a last minute hotel for an extra night. On top of that, I was on hold for over 2 hours.Pretty inconvenient and expensive, compared to any of their competition, especially the ones that provide lodging if they strand you in a city."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst airline EVER,"Got delayed over a total of 10+ hours, on and off flights without EVER leaving the airport. After being there for more than 10+ hours waiting, we get cancelled at 11 pm. Rudest AA employees and they ONLY offered a $12 voucher after it all. By far the worst airline. Never Again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,HORRIBLE SERVICE,This is my 3rd and last flight on American Airlines.  They are an organizational joke! Most rude customer service associates I have ever encountered.... in any organization.  Good riddance!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service! They don’t let us redeem our points online and they won’t connect us to a representative as well, we’ve been waiting on call for over 3 hours!! So so so frustrating."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never again,"I have never been in a situation like this … my mom and I were going to New Orleans for my 21st birthday we were at Phoenix and flew in to Dallas after that we noticed that our flight was canceled we were a little bit frustrated but we were OK … we got a hotel and got a flight to leave on 1st of August everything was going well we arrive to New Orleans. The thing that frustrated us even more was that we were waiting for our bags for about two hours the Communication was so bad we didn’t know what was going on we were running around like a chicken with our head cut off finally I received my bag but my mom didn’t receive hers they told her that they will drop it off at our hotel which was fine hours and hours went by and they haven’t dropped anything off my mom has medicine in her bag and needs to take it every night she is with no clothes underwear or has her personal belongings she has nothing she had started having problems with her stomach all because they wouldn’t give her , her bags so they basically lied to us telling us that will get our bags and that it was on the way but really it wasn’t they will tell you anything just for you to get out the line and leave them alone they really don’t care save your money and your time and go to a different airline they don’t care at all."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Airlines Diaster canceling flights,Delayed flight two times before finally canceling was moved from gate to gate to rebook hundreds of people in line then closed that line and moved to another line with even more people worst airline on earth ...If you can don't fly this Airline
Date of travel: July 2021,10,On hold forever,"This is the 3rd time in 2 months that there have been significant delays or cancellations to my flight and when I try to reach a customer service representative I have had wait over an hour to speak to someone to make flight modifications. I normally prefer to make changes online but all of the preset options are unacceptable  (for example, a day after original itinerary). I understand cancellations and delays happen but why make your customers wait on hold over an hour EACH TIME. Terrible!! I'm trying to grow my business and can't keep my customer appointments because American can't keep a schedule and then has insufficient customer reps to handle the rescheduling. I'm currently on hold AGAIN it has been an hour and thirty minutes and counting. I have no choice but to wait. I will never book with them again."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Terrible Service,They cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Put my on a way worse flight. I waited on the phone for over 4 hours to talk to a representative.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,DO NOT fly American Airlines unless you like spending the night in the airport,"We were supposed to fly out at 7:01 on August 1, 2021. There was a storm that rolled in around 4:30 and I totally understand the flight being delayed due to rain. Our flight was cancelled at 7:45pm after being delayed several times. After the storm passed, we were able to see other planes landing and taking off, however our flight was still cancelled. On top of that, we talked with several other patrons flying to various places in the US whose flight were delayed starting at noon, way before the storm came in. Based on the number of people needed in line, this is more of a management issue than an “act of God”. As I write this. I continue to see planes take off and land. I absolutely would not recommend flying American Airlines."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY,"Purchased our Business class tickets almost THREE weeks in advance. They called us within twelve hours of our flight to tell us we had been kicked to coach. Our option, wait on hold for over FOUR HOURS for some poor hapless phone-staff who has zero authority to support clients. Why fly this airline unless you have some urgent need to fly N/S on the east coast? Even then, only as a last, last, resort. Covid isn’t gone yet, sure. The post Covid recovery is in full swing and American Airlines is way, way behind the power curve. Still waiting on hold BTW…."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Poorly Organized,"American Airlines is so unprofessional,  they are horrible at what they do. I have flown with them 3 times this month and had delays on all my flights,  non based off weather. We have been sitting on the runway for an hour, because,  the pilot said we had to redistribute the cargo weight,  yet no service vehicles have approached our plan. The thing is its always something with American and other airlines just seem to manage to operations better.  How one airline can have some many issues so frequently is beyond me."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Never again,"My husband and I were suppose to be on our flight home, but our flight got canceled on the way to to airport. They rescheduled our flight for 4 pm the next day. They kept saying “it’s due to a malfunction, there is nothing we can do.” We asked for a transfer to another airline and they claimed “they are all booked.” We looked, and there were plenty of seats and flights available on Delta, so I called them out. Still, “nothing we can do.”  Second, they weren’t going to offer us anything until we hounded them to at least pay for a hotel for the night and transportation since we were stuck here. I had to be on the phone all day to make arrangements for my kids who will be another day without their mother, and I have to miss work when this could have been easily handled. Another passenger who was suppose to be on the same flight said they didn’t even get their cab rides to the hotel paid for, just a meal voucher. This is ridiculous. I’ll never fly American Airlines EVER again. Cheap, selfish, and inconsiderate of its customers and their time."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Will never fly AA again,"Where to even begin. We have had more flight delays and cancellations in the last 48 hours than I’ve ever had in the combined 3 annual trips I take combined. Delay after delay, missed connecting flight over and over because initial flight is late going out. Their customer service is so awful their employees could care less that your flights are impacted and no one wants to help you find what you’re looking for. Will never fly them again as I drive 12+ hours home from my connecting flight location because they had no options for us and we were supposed to be home over 48 hours ago. Absolutely no idea where our bags are either l. Just an absolutely awful experience and won’t recommend them to anyone."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Mahalo to American Airlines Flight 102 Honolulu to Dallas….,"Our flight from Honolulu to Dallas was packed and I know it was extremely busy for the crew.  However, I would like to send out a special thanks to Dennis Flight 102 who took time out of his busy schedule to have members of the crew sign my son’s book of  memories of all the places we visited while on the Island of Oahu. Their messages were encouraging and will always be treasured by our family.  One of our favorite messages was from Kristina:  “A mile on the road will only take you a mile, but a mile on the runway will take you ANYWHERE in the world. Mahalo for flying on American Airlines.” Thanks Dennis, Kristina, Remi, Chris #10 , Renee#5, Debra #4, and Tailu #1.  Your messages made our day!  We look forward to our next flight aboard American Airlines to Fairbanks, Alaska in December.  Mahalo!!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,HORRIBLE!  American won't earn another single penny from me,"I had a flight with my daughter from DFW to RIC on Sunday August 1, 2021 (today).  I purchased our tickets weeks ago.  When we arrived at the airport (2 hours early) in Dallas I upgraded our seats at the ticket counter from coach to First Class. The ticket counter employee put my daughter and I together in seats 2A and 2B.  However, when we went to board the flight, we were told that we were not on that flight.  That was a huge surprise seeing as I had booked and paid for the tickets weeks in advance, and oddly enough I was on the flight 30 minutes earlier when the ticket guy sold me two upgraded first class seats.  Regardless, we were not on that flight.  So when I asked what in God's creation had happened in the last 30 minutes, the gate agent, who was the most rude and unprofessional woman I have ever worked with, said ""that's not my fault.""  Well, regardless of whether or not it's your ""fault"" it is your problem and I expect the problem to be fixed.  Now, mind you, I had already paid full price for the tickets, THEN I paid even more to upgrade them.  Regardless of me having the tickets in hand, my receipt in hand, and my online banking statement that all showed I had purchased the two upgraded seats.  NOPE!  She (the rude gate agent) found us seats together in coach.  The funny thing was, when we boarded the flight, there were TWO American Airlines flight attendants who were sitting in our two first class seats THAT I PAID FOR!  The rude gate agent (who's name is Darieal Johnson, by the way), told me she ""didn't have time"" to issue me a refund for my first class tickets and even if she did it ""wasn't her job.""  Wow.  American...I have flown you for years.  I have hundreds of thousands of miles flown and dollars spent with you.  It ends today.  I'm now stuck in Richmond due to a ""maintenance issue"".  Awesome!  American Airlines, I would love to see your company go out of business for good.  I will say this for absolute certain...American will not get another dollar of my money.  They could be the only airline option and I would walk."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,This airline is HORRIBLE,"If you want to spend your vacation at the Dallas airport, then feel free to use them. They have canceled many flights and have dropped reservations. Moms with babies had to stay the night at the airport, without a bed without their bags. No hotels rooms were available. They did not offer any food vouchers. Their customer service sucks, they could careless if they canceled your flight and your pissed off. They straight up do not give two craps about you, just about getting your money and making you stuck and the airport, while they play you like a puppet. Have you running from one terminal to the next, just to run back the other direction. This airline straight up sucks!!! I will never fly them again, I will never recommend this airline either. This has not just happened to me, but to many and has been happening for months now. American airline stop booking trips if you can’t take us to the destination!!! Use your heads!0 is my rating. But had to put a 1 , as they would not let me pick 0People looking to book, loom for videos and pictures on social media or the web. It will tell the story."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Airlines don't care a out their Customers!,Awful experience with American airlines. I had a trip planned to New Orleans with a layover both ways. The fight leg of the trip we got rerouted to Washington and should have gone to Charlotte. This flight should have left at 7:30 am but we didn't take off till 2:30. Customer in the airport was lacking. We asked for help to find a different flight and or status of the current flight and we told its not my fault the plane we are waiting for had mechanical issues. Not so much as a apologize or a sense of compassion about the situation. The plane finally came and the previous passenger got off the plane and we boarded with in 10 minutes. This tells me the plane was not cleaned even though there are signs in the gate area posted by American airline on how their passenger safe is important and they keep with the highest standards of sterilizing. That's a joke. There idea of sterilizing is handing the boarding passages and alcohol wipe as they got on the plane but yet I'm still required to wear a mask that I can take off to eat or drink and expose myself and other to sickness from touching something on their dirty plane. This isn't the end of my adventures. Leaving New Orleans our plane boarded 45 mins late and there was no communication from American airline at all and the same cleaning issue occurred. Thanks for the alcohol wipe American airlines. We were also layer over on the way home . Our flight out of Charlotte also left late and still no cleaning procedures in ace but the small 2x2 alcohol wipe provides. I called the customer service number and schedule a call back since hold times were over 4 hours ( I kid you not) One I finally got someone on the phone I was told I have to reach out to customer relations to file a complaint. Um well who was I calling them? I was directed to the aa.com website. Here guess what you only get to send an email and are limited to the number of characters you can enter regarding your complaint. So let me get this straight American airlines you are available to talk to customers when you are scheduling flights ( or taking money) but when you have gotten paid for a service regardless of the quality of this service the you claim to care so much about or at least that is what you on hold recording says you are no longer available to help. I work in customer service and this is unexpected treatment of your customers. Never again will I give my money to American Airlines and I will make sure I tell others.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Charlotte Airport Awful,"It was pure pandemonium on a SUNDAY at 7am.  The terminal was absolutely packed!  American Airlines had NO people to help advise where to go and NOT enough people to help check in.  I was flying to a small airport with two flights...if I missed the first I was pretty much screwed.  The belt to take the luggage downstairs kept braking down & jamming.  Absolutely awful experience.  You can keep expanding the airport but if you don't have the customer service or enough people doesn't do any good to expand the airport.  E terminal HAD NO food vendors open except for ONE bagel shop...ONE open!  You can't being your own water, but can't wait any on E concourse."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE EVER!!,"It was my mother’s birthday yesterday and we were excited to go back home but we had a connecting flight to North Carolina. The flight ended up getting delayed by two hours meaning we would miss our flight back to home so we spoke to customer service. We asked about options and none of them were sufficient. We could fly and stay in NC for 24HOURS which is ridiculous because we were supposed to get home on the same day we flew there. They gave us no money or hotel to stay in because we were “local” when it was their fault anyway. We paid for our seats and all the lady said was “go online to REQUEST a refund” dumbest thing ever. All in all, don’t fly American. We have family in Philly but we had to run to catch the train at such a late hour, we were sure we were gonna miss it. They did nothing about our luggage and it’s now stuck in Houston for the next day meaning we don’t have any clothing to change into so we had to buy. When flying Southwest, they have us $100 to use for clothing and other items we may need while being stuck where we were but American gave us nothing. Horrible airline and will never fly again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst experience ever,Have been waiting in line for over 2 hours and everyone infront and behind us missed their flights as well. Horrible customer service.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Bad service,"We pay for tickets, we upgrade our rickets and they change out tickets every time.  We had a 1 hour layover, now 3 hours.   We are senioi citizens and you have us getting home at 1 am.  I have been trying to reach American Airlines for 2 days now.   We are a credit card holder  and still get treated badly.   I wanted to open up a savings account with AA but I will not now."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Rude Employees,"As soon as we arrived to the gate we got attitude from American employees just to ask a simple question. Then we noticed our flight was delayed and then again delayed and still got attitude when asking questions. We kept asking questions because the ladies working the desk was not giving any updates. We found out through the app each time the flight was delayed and then canceled. Then we ounce again tried to ask why and she laughed and said your flight just canceled....half the people waiting had no clue the flight was canceled bc they wasn’t giving no updates over the intercom. Finally she makes an announcement bc people were pissed. And she chuckled hey guys your flight has been canceled. Seriously!! How is this appropriate customer service?!?! No updates and no sympathy for us after sitting ALL day in the airport with a TODDLER... and now it’s midnight and we need to figure out what we’re doing... my phone is dead, so we had no choice but stand in line for good hour to get a new flight booked- we paid NON stop. Everything they was offering us was crazy connecting flights with 7plus hour delays. There’s a reason we paid NONSTOP- we have a TODDLER! Anyways we got the flight that had the less layover. Then we needed to stand in line AGAIN to book a hotel- another 30ish mins. Get to the front same young girl that chuckled was booking our hotel. I asked what our options was.. she told us. I was talking to my husband and thinking but the girl already booked us. I was like wait we didn’t even get to pick... she said to bad I can’t change it now.. This point I was done- get our stuff and go find a taxi. Taxi or any transportation in Savannah Ga is hard to come by... no shuttle was working for the hotel that they offered us so we needed to wait forever for taxis. We almost missed our flight the moring coming back to the hotel because we couldn’t find a taxi!!!! So we finally get back to the airport. Once again EVERY American Airlines employee we encountered was RUDE!!!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible Service,"Sisters flight was canceled, pushed new flight time 3 different times. Wouldn’t allow refund at the front desk. Horrible service, go with Southwest people."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Not ready for prime time,"Really lousy experience with AA.   All airlines experience delays, I get that.  But no one at American at ANU wanted to help anyone.  They only wanted to work on the one flight they were trying to get out despite a long line of us needing rebook due to their supposed ""mechanical delay"".  There were lots of flights from AA delayed today.  The hotel I'm at alone told me the airline sent them 154 people.  If this is all ""mechanical"", we should be terrified to fly this airline at all.  At my hotel, the flight crew just waltzed in giggling like they are at a frat party.  I guess they werent inconvenienced by having to stay overnight like the rest of us.Seriously why did the US give this airline bailout money?  Why did the CEO get a $10 MILLION bonus if this is the best they can do?A shout-out to the JetBlue guy at ANU today who was polite and kind even if he couldn't help me.  Marked contrast to the experience with AA.  I know which airline I will fly next time."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Canceled international flight last minute,"American't Airlines canceled our international flight less than 3 hours before takeoff, with awful reschedule options as early as 3 days after our canceled flight. Several other flights got canceled at the same time because they did not have enough employees. Don't book flights that you can't finish American't Airlines."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Stranded our Daughter in Chicago,The absolute worse service I have ever experienced from and airline. They stranded our daughter in Chicago after canceling two flights. The only other flight they offered was two days later. Nor did they offer to pay for lodging. Finding her luggage was also a nightmare. She was in line to try to resolve it for two hours and I was on hold on the phone for nearly two hours before I gave up.We had to buy a new flight through another airline and find a hotel for her. We will not be flying with AA again and I would discourage anyone else from doing so.
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Dietary accommodations definitely not their forte,"Dietary accommodations are definitely not their forte.I couldn't choose mine during the online reservation.It had to be done over the phone and at least 24 hours in advance, and I only knew this because of a previous poor experience.The employee herself had a hard time finding how to enter the request.I couldn't choose a meal that was both gluten free and dairy free, even though intolerance to dairy is correlated to gluten intolerance.I chose the gluten free option, but even that didn't matter because someone made a mistake and the crew hadn't been notified nor provided with the meal.On top of it they had no spare special meal, even though it was a pretty large flight.When I called customer service about the disservice they didn't know what to do and told me to fill out an online form that does not exist.This is not a small company without the means to do a better job. The crew on the aircraft tried to accommodate with what they had but it was not enough. The blame is at a higher level."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Misprinted tickets,Their policy’s suck and they don’t care to work with you.  The time printed on my ticket to be there was wrong and they’re trying to tel me it’s my fault.

Date of travel: July 2021,10,WONT FLY THEM AGAIN,"Had an immaculate flight up to Fairbanks Alaska. However on the way home, it took 30 minutes over departure to leave, which caused me to miss my connecting flight. Was booked on as a standy for one flight and for sure another. So far I've been at O'Hare since 7 a.m. CST. IT IS NOW GOING ON 2 AND MY BAGS HAVE ALREADY BOARDED TO MY FINAL DESTINATION AT 11. I will NEVER fly this airline again. Started off wonderfully, then turned in to wasting what little time I have to return home for work.Be smart, fly with another airline. This one is a joke and unprofessional."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Trash,"Horrible customer service numerous delays, pilots showing up after the departure time. A/C broken on the plane.  It’s pathetic to think $400 is being wasted on unprofessional acts.  Never will we use AA for business or leisure again. Just be honest and say there are problems. No need to extend delays 4 times. Get the pilots on the plane before the passengers too…"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Lost my bag and 0 updates after a week,"They lost my bag and are doing nothing about it. I have to call and ask for updates and they just say they don’t have any info. Their baggage tracker is showing an open case but no progress. It’s been 5 days now with zero help. I submitted a delayed baggage claim and they said they need to review it for up to 45 days before they can determine if they’re going to reimburse me or not. ( and need receipts for any item over $100. Like they expect me to have receipts for my shoes, coats, and suitcase all bought years ago) I have no bag, no reimbursement, and no insight as to what they’re doing at all. Won’t fly with them again on this basis alone."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,worst airline everrr,this is my first time traveling in 15 years and they lost my carry on luggage because “they had no more space in the plane” so idk where tf they took it once i handed it to them & they constantly lied about where it was for FOUR DAYS until we went off on them that’s when they suddenly decided to drop it off at my hotel. they didn’t even apologize and when we were flying back home they delayed our flight 3 times until they actually cancelled it and we waited TWO HOURS in a long line just to rebook and now they have delayed our new flight 3 times already with bs excuses
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible Experience,"Every point of contact with American Airlines has been absolutely horrible. The gates were crowded with people not on the same flight. I checked in 15 minutes before departure and they said boarding was closed. The flight had been overbooked. I was given a different flight, but was not provided the information for the connecting flight. Arrived and ran to my connecting, after waiting in an empty customer service center. When I arrived at my final I was unable to locate my bags, as they never transferred them. I was assured they would be there when I arrived. I checked the next day and they had sent them to the final destination; however, I still have not been contacted by an agent. I have been unable to get a hold of anyone at AA all day."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Airlines is TERRIBLE,"American Airlines is terrible. Flights were delayed hours at a time, customer service was awful. Didn't even get a measly $10 food voucher after our hours upon hours of delay. Contacted American Airlines customer service and they didn't do anything. I'm an AA member and will never return."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst experience,"Being in the military I do fly a lot. My first experience with AA was this year in May. I flew out of SLC to ELP. Our flight had one 10 minute delay. No big deal. Fast forward two weeks. Leaving El Paso to SLC we my flight had three delays. I still made it to my connector In Dallas, but has to rush. Now I am here in July. Had a flight for my wife to come and see me for the weekend. Flight was scheduled to leave at 3:53 PM. She gets an alert that it was delayed by 20 mins, then another delay of 45 mins, and then another delay of one hour, then they moved her onto a flight the next day. I contacted the customer chat which and asked for help after 45 mins I got a responses that were.  3 mins apart. My wife was given a flight and two connect flights, but both the  connecting flights left before she would land in DFW. I asked the agent over chat to change that and she said she could not. She said that there was a glitch in the system. I then asked her if my wife could get on a later flight that day because I was looking at open seats on a later flight. She then said she could not see those flights and said it must have been another glitch. So asked her why two glitches had happened to me. She said sorry for the inconvenience. I then called customer support, and the agent who helped me over the phone was able help me out and upgrade my wife to better seats. It was the only redeeming experience I had with AA. Do not fly with AA, pay the extra money and go somewhere else."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Unfair and Unethical practices,"My experience as a consumer purchasing AA service has been concerning.  It is my understanding that American Airlines covers itself with fine print and legalities to have the ability to conduct its business in unfair and unethical manner.The average consumer usually wouldn't be able to pursue anything legal because of many factors so AA uses this as an advantage to continue its practice. I am not going to change anything with this review but I would like would-be travelers to know. I booked a flight 1 month ago with 4 seats on a 2 hour direct flight to Knoxville TN from Miami FL. Due to medical conditions and a 1 year old I do not travel longer than 2 hours on anything. Without my consent or being told of a possible change while paying it was just changed. It is now a 4 and 1/2 hour flight with a stop in another city. Why was I not told about the possibility of this while I was paying? I have had to cancel our small family vacation all together since I am not able to make AA forced new arrangement. I have lost non refundable $1,500.00 in the hotel deposit for the days of stay as well as the money paid for the flight and car rental deposit. I am 2 months away from the flight which has been canceled with NO REFUND. I have made the attempt 3 times so far to call and fix this with no hope, NO in American Airlines helps. Sounds like this stuff happens a-lot which is why AA has established its policy's to protect itself and its interest. I would love for someone to contact me to correct this experience but I do not expect it."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst experience ever,"This was by far the WORST travel experience I have ever had. Avoid this airline!! We got back from Costa Rica and had a layover in Dallas. Because of the long customs line, we missed our connecting flight to Sacramento. The agent was rude and uncooperative, telling us that this was not the fault of American Airlines (who we booked through) and that we had to figure it out for ourselves. Unbelievable. This happened to a lot of our fellow passengers too. I have never been treated so badly by an airline, and will never take American again if I can help it. I've been to 20-30 counties and traveled extensively, so I know what I'm talking about. AVOID."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Never buy their credit cards,"Worse credit card ever. I closed my account, after 1 year and 6 months got a fraud on my card. They are trying to collect debt for a fraud to an account that was closed for so long. Than you can never reach them. They literally make it impossible to reach them. They transfer you from department to department. They make you wait hours in the phone. They don't have a way for you to send an e-mail. They ask you to send a fax (who has fax these days). The worse experience ever. I've been trying to solve this for 6-months already and doesn't get anywhere. So disappointing. They make a mistake, I have to spend hours trying to solve it. I also live abroad now and have to pay for my phone call to them (they have a collect call number but doesn't work for frauds and it makes you wait for hours).Basically if I was to charge for the time I had to spend so far, they would be owning me thousands of dollars for my time."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE IN THE SKY,Orlando to DSM to THREE DAYS due to cancelled and delayed flights.  Downgraded from our First Class tickets to Economy and only reimbursed us $150.00 per ticket when they were $900.00 a piece.  Refused to comp hotels/meals/Ubers even though they moved our flight to a different airport!!!  We went from Orlando to Miami to Ft. Lauderdale to Charlotte to Des Moines.  Then they sent our bags to BRAZIL!!!!  We have already notified our Amex Black Centurion Team that they are forbidden from booking another flight on AA NEVER AGAIN for us or the business associates.  I dare you to try and reach a live person at their 800#.  4 hour plus wait times on hold.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"I mean, seriously? This is what you call an airline? 🙄😂","I oddly didn’t receive the survey email after our flight… lucky you AA! But here I am anyway ;) - First thing first, it appears Covid prevents American Airlines to wash their blankets on a long haul… but not in first. Does it mean that you never wash blanket? Does it mean first class have dirty and contaminated blankets? - When you ask a flight attendant to then add a couple of degrees in the cabin because EVERYBODY has either goosebumps or is paralyses by the cold during the long flight, and the stew just answer « put your jacket on ». WOW. That’s what we call service! I was so cold that I put two sweatshirts on and I had to put my jacket on my legs. That’s why I couldn’t wear my jacket in addition! - 11h flight and you don’t serve meals? I mean seriously? Was it too complicated to tell people to anticipate and buy food to eat something? At some point one disgusting vegetarian sandwich came, and I have to say I LOVE veggies. But this wasn’t veggies at all. Couldn’t even say what it was made of. Then on the return flight, one turkey sandwich… a sandwich that even a child can prepare better than that. - On our way to Honolulu, only one hot drink. I asked a tea randomly at some point, being too cold. The hostess came back 20 minutes later… with a coffee! I mean, is it really that complicated to serve ONE tea in a 11h flight? - My husband didn’t get the “breakfast”, maybe the stew was too lazy to serve the 3 rows around his seat. I did get one: a simple and single Lotus biscuit. Nothing else. - Hopefully the ground staff from American Airlines is great, because the inflight one is terrible. $1800 in tickets to not even one hot meal, the drink we asked for, or even a blanket. There is no word to describe how bad it is.Do I will recommend this airline to anyone? NEVER. I didn’t pick this one on purpose, I knew it was bad before COVID. Now it’s even worst."

Everyone, staff, taxi drivers in Phoenix, and postings, say how AA lies about their excuses for delayed, canceled and inability to fly out as scheduled,I.e. mechanical trouble in plane is not always the case. It is their excuse, for lack of staff, or company not willing to pay extra to staff. I was stranded, with no food, no accommodations bcuz all hotels full during a bad storm. Oh, by the way, they don’t care if you are handicapped."

Date of travel: July 2021,10,First and LAST time flying AA,"I have used a lot of different airlines, This was my first time flying American airlines and I will avoid it in the future. I had two flights one was bad the second got cancelled. First of all and the most important thing, I didn't feel safe traveling in their airplanes, the motor overheated (they told us it overheated), after that their staff is the rudest staff I have ever dealt with (specially the DFW airport staff). In the plane they were rude, our second flight got cancelled because they didn’t have the crew to fly the plane. The supervisor was arguing with a customer over them getting their flight cancelled while we were all waiting, terrible customer service. They made us wait hours to get a resolution, gave us vouchers that didn't work, had a terrible attitude for a problem they created and all of my interactions with their staff were a nightmare. At the end I spoke to my friends and family about the issues and they knew I was flying American airlines before I told them the airline so this is a recurring problem.If you can only get one thing from my review please be careful and look out for your own safety, aside from the bad service the overheating of the plane was unsafe and an accident could have happened. keep you and your family safe and think twice before using this airline."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Literally the worst airline,"I usually don't write reviews, having previously worked in customer service. However, I have never had a worse experience. My journey started in Minneapolis where my flight to Dallas was delayed by 2 and a half hours. At this point, I realized that we were not going to make our connecting flight in Dallas. Knowing this information, I simply asked the American Airlines agent at the desk what my best option would be. He responded that we could make a flight from Dallas to Miami that very night and that we would be able to get seats right away in Dallas. Having this information, we boarded the flight to Dallas. Once we landed, we made our way to the customer service representatives for American Airlines to find our that the agent in Minneapolis full-out lied to us and the flight he suggested did not exist. We instead had to call a 1-800 number and talk to someone for 2 and half hours until we could find another flight. We didn't get to our hotel until 2 am, and it turned out that the airlines sent us to the wrong hotel. This morning, we got to the airport at 12 pm for our flight at 7:10pm and realized that we had to re-take our COVID test because the ones we previously took in Minneapolis expired. We were then informed that the Walgreens and CVS surrounding Dallas airport did not take our insurance and that to take the COVID test at the airport would cost $300 per person, resulting in $1,000 for our group. Obviously, we are incredibly frustrated at the situation and asked the airlines if we could be refunded for the test. We were then told that it would be a 50/50 chance and we would have to submit a claim after our trip. To be honest, I have never seen an airline that so blatantly doesn't care about their customers. This trip has been planned for 3 years, and we are now going to be 2 days late to our destination and at least $1,200 out of pocket. If I were to talk to a friend about this airline, I would tell them to run the opposite direction. Again, do not fly this undependable airline. If I could rate them with 0 stars, I would."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,2 flight delays,We booked first class as it was our wedding  anniversary.  On our flight back we were delayed over an hr due to no air in plane.   We take off and one hr later are told we are coming back to Dallas as there is a problem on the plane.   We get to Dallas and sat at airport with no direction for over 3 hrs.  Not even as much as a glass of water.  We bought first class as sacrifice and it was a horrible experience.  Finally we finally boarded at approx 9:30 pm and got home after midnight. We asked repeatedly for info and they kept telling us they had no ideas and no crews.  It was a horrible experience and will never fly this airline again.  0 stars
Date of travel: July 2021,20,American Airlines does not care about the customers.,Had a reservation on hold and when I tried to buy they said it “wasn’t available” because I reserved it to be paid with points.

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Spending money to get given the middle finger,"Would have been quicker to walk with how many delays there are. I’m currently on hour 3 of what was supposed to be a 1 hour layover and this is just one of many delays. Missed my connection on the way there because of a delayed flight and then had to wait until the next day for a flight. Legitimately going to drive from CA to New York next time. Not worth the hassle, money, customer service, or time this takes. Also I’m 6’5” and those seats just aren’t even close to enough. My knees still have deep marks from being jammed into the seat in front of me, even though I haven’t been on the plane in over 3 hours. Would recommend designing and building your own plane to fly rather than take American Airlines as it will be quicker and easier"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,NA,"Absolute worse airline I have ever flown. Why? On one trip it broke down in mid air, made an emergency landing and then kept trying to repair the same plane. They finally got another plane the next day. They gave us an ~$800 credit. We went to use it and they said that amount does not count and we can only use ~half. They hassled us for two days and finally said they would not charge us $200 on the half they were going to let us use. I will say the girl we finally dealt with on day two understood how to treat customers.Another time I had a carry on that I used on every flight for years and a bag lady at the plane hatch told me I could not take it on because it won't fit and I said it would, its under limit and has my work and meds in it. She said if I did not agree I was banned for life and became very nasty with me.Another flight you could not hear the boarding call over the din in the gate areas. They closed the door two minutes early of last call and would not open them for us. The plane then sat there for 45 minutes.Overall the associates are rude, uncaring and will threaten to ban you for life  at the drop of a hat. They bully you like gestapo and act put out at the slightest request.Fly United or Southwest. Take a bus or hitch hike. Just whatever you do dont fly American Airlines. Oh, I almost forgot. They cannot serve refreshments to coach because of COVID. However, if you fly 1st class they do. I guess there is no COVID in 1st class."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Airline ever!,"This has been the most unprofessional experience I have ever had on any airline including SPIRIT!!! How are you worst than Spirit???Here is a summary of my trip with this unorganized airline.1. I am a young woman traveling with 4 children. Ages. Once I reached my gate I was told that due to weather the flight was delayed. I was not given any assistance in figuring out an alternative option. I was advised to stay on the flight and find my own hotel accommodations in the connecting city. I ON MY OWN found another flight in the same airport to get me to my connecting flight in time.2. Once I reached my destination I was told that my 1 year car seat was never boarded on the flight. I checked the car seat at the check in counter. My son could not commute on our vacation without a car seat, therefore neither could I. Huge inconvenience!!!!3. On my return flight, it was delayed again and there was no option. I had to leave the airport with children after I've made it to the gate and return the next morning.4. I get back home to find that my car seat ($240) is missing. !!!!!This has been the worst experience. To make matters worst, not only does this airline not care about the safety of children, they could care less about my concerns. I have emailed the customer service department twice with no response. I will not recommend this airline for any family."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"First class flights are delayed, cancelled, and unrefundable....","I paid for my first ever first-class flight with american airlines. The trip home was to be 11am to 3pm. Delays and cancelled flights lead this to take off at 3pm and arrive in st. louis at 8pm. Flights were not compensated in any way. If you're looking for quality flights, DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER- THIS IS THE EMAIL I WROTE TO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"To a customer service compensation manager at American Airlines, It is with deep regret that I am writing this letter to explain the series of misfortunes we had in our experience with your airlines. On July 23rd, my wife, 4-month old daughter and I were scheduled to fly from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv with a connection in Miami. You can imagine the anticipation we felt to fly a long-haul international flight with an INFANT child. Our experience with American Airlines seemed to begin on the wrong foot much before the actual flight. We were astonished to learn that parents with an infant were prevented from selecting seats online and especially via a representative. This seat selection blunder ended up getting us the worst seats on the plane, which  might have been the least of our problems with American Airlines. On our way to the airport we saw that our flight was an hour delayed. As we did the check in, your AA representative said this would not be a problem and we will still make the connection from Miami to Tel Aviv. So, we proceeded with the check-in and went through security. After an hour waiting for boarding, we saw that the flight was delayed for an additional hour. This of course meant we would miss the connecting flight to Tel Aviv. The staff at the gate told us to speak to the staff at the customer service booth at LAX. The service at the AA booth had us waiting for over an hour in line, and almost made us miss our INITAL flight!  After waiting for almost an hour, we were only told by customer service representative to go on the flight and the staff in Miami will have to guide us on what to do next.  When we boarded the flight, they told us we needed to check in one of our carry on's that contained all of our baby stuff for the flight and when we said we needed it with us - they told us we are the last ones. And said, that it is our fault we needed to check in - mind you, we were only late because we were standing in customer service line for an hour. This lack of foresight, care, and empathy for a family traveling with an INFANT child is beyond me. And is a true reflection of the character of this airline.   When we landed in Miami around 9pm, we got off the flight and immediately were sent to re-booking without our luggage. When we tried to find our luggage we were told it was on hold because we were supposed to have a connecting flight which we missed due to the delay. We were in line to re-book for over 2 hours. When we finally got to rebook a flight to Tel Aviv, we were told that since all American Airlines hotels are full they were unable to offer us any accommodation and we need to pay out of pocket for accommodation, transportation, new covid test and food. As far as we know- by law- the airline must provide accommodation and food vouchers if a flight has been cancelled or delayed due to the airline's fault.  We ended up paying $350 to rent a car so we can get to our hotel, we paid $400 for 2 nights for accommodation, we had to do a new rapid covid test which cost us $150 ($450 for the 3 of us), in addition to $300 for food cost, and an extra $100 for clothes and diapers since we didn't receive our luggage. Our total expense sums up to $1600. This $1600 is an extreme setback. And would have been a prevented loss had AA customer service had the foresight to look out for our best interest and expedite our wait time for re-booking….That is all to say, this could have started with getting us appropriate seats on the plane, rather than having us wait in a pointless line at LAX and getting the worst seats on the plane. After finally arriving at our hotel at 2 in the morning, we needed to wake up at 7am in order to go and find a place to do a covid test before the flight. Following the Covid test, we called the luggage claim number which was provided to us from the re-booking representative. In lieu of finding out where our precious BABY luggage and our luggage were, we only got a message saying that ""this line is no longer available"" and was disconnected.  This felt like a slap in the face after everything we had gone through. But wait, of course there is more to this utter lack of care! Finally the day had come, and we arrived at the Miami airport on Sunday for our new flight. We went straight to baggage claim to look for our luggage and they told us one luggage is waiting for us on the plane and the other luggage is missing and we should check if it's in the ""hands on"" room.  When we went into the ""hands on"" room, they told us that our second luggage was sent to St. Martins accidently, and we needed to go back to baggage claim to open a claim. Mind you this is all while also dealing with an infant 4 month old child. When we went back to the baggage claim, we opened a claim, and checked into our flight. We are writing this email from Israel 4 days after we initially checked into our flight. And one of our suitcases that contain all our baby essentials, clothes, and presents IS STILL MISSING. We are unsure when or if we will get it back.  This ordeal has proven to us that American Airlines customer service and team is a shameful disgrace. Unless proven otherwise, we believe this is unacceptable behavior from a company like American Airlines - one of the largest airlines in the world. We rightfully seek compensation in order to avoid any potential lawsuits. Moreover, we want to be shown care and understanding. Customer service supervisor should contact us as soon as possible in order to resolve this issue. We are furious at the way people treated us. We were offered zero help, zero compensation and zero assistance. As mentioned, this lack of foresight, care, and empathy for a family traveling with an INFANT child is inexcusable.  It was our first time traveling with an infant, you can imagine we were anxious even without this whole mess. It was beyond disheartening that your staff treated us very cold and were extremely unhelpful. Again- we politely ask American Airlines to have a proper compensation MANAGER contact us immediately. Looking forward to hearing American Airlines step-up and resolve this issue. Thank you, Shay Bonfil"

Sprint>>>",So as this was our first time flying American and defiantly last (I tend not to listen to others experience and see for myself) well that was a HUGE mistake. Like I said this was our first time flying American and we didn’t know how they did it so I asked for help. The ladies last name may of been Williams or something but she was clearly annoyed I asked to her for help but she scoffed and “helped me”. Instead of saying we can’t touch anything because of covid (which I totally respect) she just barked overs at my boyfriend. AND THEN!!!! The lady that was checking us in was even worse. She said to us “you know the worst part of my work is the people” how unprofessional and just plan out sad. My boyfriend and I couldn’t help but just laugh the entire time we literally couldn’t believe it!!! Just don’t waste your time on American Airlines I promise you will thank me. What a good start to a vacation right…
Date of travel: June 2021,10,DO NOT TRUST,"We have always been loyal to American Airlines but I think it may be time to cut the ties. First, if your traveling and concerned about covid, select another airline. the male flight attendant from Philly to Punta Cana did not enforce masks at all! walked right by people, talked to people with no mask or masks around their chin. This subject is important to me because of my compromised son. His dr thought it would be good for him to breathe in salty air for his lung and since masks are enforced on a plane, he felt ok with him wearing his mask and sanitizing and things. Now, the night before our flight from Punta Cana, American Airlines cancels our flight. My husband had recently had a heart attack and was given meds until his appointment which was on Monday and our flight was Saturday to be home. American booked us for a flight home on Monday. Well, that obviously wouldn't work. We paid thousands of dollars for last minute tickets so my husband could make his appointment and get his medication. Once we were home, we contacted AA and submitted the paper work they asked for. Today he received an email saying they denied helping with the cost of other flight. SO AA does not care about your health or your well being, be careful this could happen to you, your husband, father, brother, mother. you can't trust this airline!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,I will never fly American Airlines again.,"I will never fly American Airlines again. We were scheduled to take off at 6:45 PM. It is currently 12:29 AM, and we have yet to take off. We were told there was a maintenance issue. It wasn’t until 11:30 PM when we were told more details about what the actual issue was. The flight attendants let us get off the flight for about an hour at 9 PM. We’ve been waiting for “paperwork” for over an hour. The captain keeps speaking on the intercom saying, “it will be 15 or 20 more minutes.” I think we’ve been told that four or five times now. They haven’t given us anything water or snacks. It is the worst flight I’ve ever been on, and this is not my first bad experience with American Airlines. I would not recommend flying with American Airlines."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Dr,"Our flight arrived late to the airport and was late boarding. We arrive in Charlotte to catch our connecting flight (on the other side of the airport) and found our flight was still at the gate, but the gate attendant had closed boarding early. We go to the AA service rep to get help. She informs us that it was just part of flying with AA. We asked to speak with a manager which she introduces us to. He promptly tells us that we are on our own and that we would have to find our own way back. So I proceed to ticket sales. We then get a flight to Ashville. Long story short. We are now at Ashville waiting for a relative to drive 2 hours to come and get us. Why didn't we just rent a car to drive home? Because the rental car company refused to rent us a car to drive the our to tricities airport to pick up a car. I'm done with AA because of their poor customer service. They didn't even make an effort to help us. They just said your on your own."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Run ay from American Airlines,ALWAYS.... They are always delayed. Lines are long for everythig. Horrible customer service.I stopped flying with them some years ago for the same reason. But I wanted to give them anothwr chance. 3 in a raw and everytime time is the same. Please spend 30 dollara more and use another airline.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Airlines sucks!!!!,"Flight attendants act like jerks when telling you to put your face mask on, even between sips of my soda.  I would have enjoyed an adult beverage but American Airlines doesn’t allow people who can’t afford a business seat to drink alcohol.  Apparently you have to be a high-class person to drink on their planes which I found to be extremely degrading! Their planes are small, over packed and out of four airplanes I was on for my entire trip, only one of them had television.  Great way to make their passengers feel appreciated!!!!!I understand that Covid has effected a lot of businesses but none of the problems I saw traveling with AA were due to Covid.  It seems to me that they lack respect for their passengers.I will never fly American Airlines again and I will be sure to tell everyone I know to stay away.If someone from American Airlines wants to call or me about my experience, I welcome that.  My email address is RBenedetto@ConnectPayusa.com.Thanks,Ryan Benedetto"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,FEDERAL REGULATIONS VIOLATION,I caught a flight from Miami to Detroit last night 7/26 . During the flight a man sitting in the seat behind me started throwing up non stop everywhere which caused both row he was in and in-front of him to arise from their seat. The flight attendants by the name of Shawn and one who refused to provide us her name approached us and told us to sit I explained to her there was body fluids on the seat and I was not going to sit let alone lay my head on it that I would be contacting the airline about this and then Shawn approached me close to my face no mask on and said anything else you want to say to me in a hostile manner.  I said no I was speaking in general not to you and he walked away moments later the flight attendant who refused to give her name came towards me and quietly whispers “If your looking at me thinking I’m going to clean it I’m not cleaning anything” . I responded I wasn’t even speaking to her. The throw up was never even attempted to be cleaned or covered and when we asked her for water due to getting nauseas because of the smell she didn’t give me any water. I asked her for her name her response was “ I don’t need to give you a damn thing “ using profanity. I sat on the edge of my seat leaned forward for 2 hours remainder of my flight where I was even able to wear a seatbelt. This was the worse experience and airlines I’ve ever flown on in 29 years and the crew representing had no common courtesy and where hostile. They didn’t even make the man who threw up wear a mask. So many federal regulation violation were committed yesterday and I will be contacting my attorney to proceed with further action if needed. Do not fly this airline your better of going on any other one but AMERICAN AIRLINES ! Never again
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Never fly American Airlines!,Flight from Nashville was cancelled so had to book another one then get to charlotte NC sit in the strip for 20 minutes before we could get to the ramp and now we have sat at on the plane for an hour so far and haven’t left yet! Unacceptable!!!!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Cancelled my fight 8 hours before flight time,They canceled my flight hours before take-off and had no solution. This is after they had already moved my flight once which screwed up my original plans. Three weeks before they canceled our flight and forced us to stay overnight for a layover. DO NOT FLY AMERICAN. This company is a complete joke. Their customer service was extremely unhelpful and did not even seem to care.. We saved for a year to go on this trip and they took 1/4 of the trip away from us and cost me $500 for our hotel room with no offer to compensate.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Dallas to Austin TX,"AA you need to teach your employees of respect!  And if ladies have personal problems or going through menstrual cycle they need to STAY HOME and get over it, instead of Barking at Passengers and let the Devil out of them:(((((AA honestly - we will think twice before we book another flight with American Airlines, and that's after being a loyal customer for over 20 years :((("
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Never again,"1,000+ passengers were left to rebook our flights due to various reasons of the airline. We are stranded in Miami, some of us can't get flights rebooted for 2 days. I am sure they lost many customers tonight and I am one of them."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Airlines is a JOKE!!!,PT1: WOULD RATE 0 IF I COULD! We have had our trip booked for about 10 months and they canceled our flight to Dallas to get to Punta Cana the next day with less than a 12 hour notice giving us NO time to make other arrangements. Then we called American Airlines to get on the next flight to Dallas and they “couldn’t help us due to the weather” literally as our brother was flying into Dallas from California. I understand things happen but I’m so disappointed that we were not compensated for the night we will not miss at our resort and instead of a 5 day vacation we now have 3... after paying around $4000 for our trip. I’m literally so pissed off and want my money from American. 0/10 I can’t believe they’re allowed to do this.  They also moved one of our flights without even letting us know! My husband just caught it. Hopefully we make it to the DR by Wednesday 🤡
Date of travel: July 2021,10,The worst flight ever!,"We had hours of delays because of the crew! And once we got in, another 40 min since there was no pilot! How unorganized! Missed my other flight just because of their pilot forgetting he had a job!!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Pay more for any other airline.,"Don't fly be ready to be delayed, multiple gate changes, diverted to a complete different airport then have little to no information on how to get back to origin and get car that you paid for then get charged more because of late pick up. Also, Dallas is just as bad as Chicago for travel."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"@@#$$ BEWARE @@@$$ Save yourself Hassle and MONEY use OTHER , ANY other Airline!!","SAVE yourself TIME, HASSLE, Money and from this JOKE of an airline leaving you stranded in a foreign country!!!Oh but you do get them little peanut bags for a meal so maybe its worth it.Because when it Comes to customer service you will be Stranded, Left on Hold for Hrs. just to be hanged up or disconnected after 5-6 attempts to talk to a manager.Oh and If you cancel you get charged or buy new ticket but if THEY cancel guess what?? Oh well tuff Luck You do not get paid for the extra days or meals you end up spending."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,DO NOT USE AA!!! WORSE Experience 3 times in a row!! They DO NOT CARE!,"AA change my flight to wrong day , then canceled it , was left stranded in Colombia for 3 days , finally they fixed it Booked me for a flight at 1:20 am !!! and CANCELED my flight AGAIN oops sorry not enough personnel 3 hrs. prior to the flight when I was already on my way to the airport!!!   Now they do not want to pay for meal or Hotel except on the ones THEY want to send you to!!! Wow for sure 3rd world country customer service....Ohh wait did I mention they put you on hold to talk to a Manager and hang up on you and never get a call back!!!! Yes this AA is for SURE NOT American Quality, Should rename to 3rd world country Airlines Service!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Review of the airline,"Terrible experience. WiFi did not work. Paid for assigned seats, which they ignored and had us sitting 15 seats between each other. They kept changing my flight (at least 3 times). Missed connecting flight because the custom line was over 2 hours long. The trip itself s was fantastic but I will NEVER book with American Airlines again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Mr,Both flights to and from LAX and SFO were delayed at every possible step. An hour and a half flight took us 4 hours
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Sucks,"Flight got delayed four times, had to sit on the run way for another hour for other “delays”. Total waste of time and I could’ve drove home by now. DONT TAKE - FLY DELTA."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Lacking anything resembling customer service.,"Why is there never a zero star option?? American cancelled our connecting flight due to “maintenance”, and then tried to tell us it’s our responsibility to pay for an overnight stay. This after waiting in-line over an hour to be re-routed, cost us an entire day of our trip and not to mention the extra cost of transportation, toiletries and food because they had “no idea” when our bags would arrive. F! American Airlines! My recommendation: travel with any other carrier. So happy that my tax paying dollars went to bail them out (again) in 2020 though."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Horrible flights, don't fly American!","My husband and his brother flew from Alb NM to Alb NY on Wednesday. There was a problem with the plane, which a mechanic had to be called. That resulted in a two hour delay, which at least they didn't miss their connecting flight. Now, today, Saturday, the plane has no fuel, and they have been waiting for a fuel truck for two hours. Apparently, nothing is being done to pacify the passengers. And, this flight cost them plenty, not economy prices. Their experience is less than terrible"
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Mediocre flight with poor treatment with a service dog,"American Airlines Flight 1838PBI-PHL12:06 pm-2:47 pm Airbus A319I recently took this flight with my family and service dog when returning home from a weekend trip to Palm Beach, and the experience was just ok. The flight was very average overall, but negative treatment from the flight attendants when traveling with a service dog, as well as a late arrival, made it even less than ideal.We arrived at West Palm Beach Airport about 90 minutes before our flight, and found that American’s check-in counters at this airport are pretty small/cramped. Although I know American doesn’t have a ton of flights out of PBI each day, there were enough that lines for both the full-service check-in and the self-service kiosks were snaking around the entrance area, which didn't seem to be the case for any other airline. We waited in the full-service line to check our bags, since we had been told we couldn’t use the kiosks with a service dog in Philadelphia a couple days prior. We didn’t think this was accurate based on the information we received from talking to the Special Services desk that had pre-approved our service dog, but just to avoid having any issues, we waited in the longer line at PBI. We made it to the front in about 10 minutes, which was quicker than I expected based on how long the line looked.The agent checking us in was pleasant, but very slow. She didn’t ask for any documentation related to our service dog (so we probably could have just checked in at a kiosk), and went through the process of reviewing our IDs and taking our checked bags deliberately and carefully (i.e. very slowly).After that, we were off to security, where PreCheck had no line at all, but the line for regular security screening was a bit long. Since some of our group had PreCheck and others didn’t, we noted that there was about a 15-minute gap between when those of us with PreCheck got through and when those waiting in the regular line finally made it.  It seemed there was a lot of extra secondary screening being done that day.The terminal wasn’t overly crowded until you got the far end where American flights were departing from. In that area, it was totally packed and chaotic, with basically no seats available for waiting and a lot of difficulty even moving around to get near your gate. We ended up waiting a few gates away until much closer to boarding. As our scheduled boarding time approached, it became very clear that our flight was not going to board on time. Although the incoming flight from Philadelphia had arrived on time, that group departed the aircraft very slowly, so our scheduled boarding time came and went while people were still disembarking from the plane. Even with everything going exactly as planned, AA only had 40 minutes scheduled between the arrival of the previous flight and our departure, which is nowhere near enough time. Especially in Florida, where there are often guests needing extra assistance, 40 minutes for disembarkation, cleaning, and boarding is really ambitious on a mainline jet. I’ve looked at the status of this flight on other days, and it seems that it almost never makes it back to Philadelphia on time, so the schedule really should be adjusted.Boarding eventually began, and was a bit chaotic, since the gate area was so crowded with people swarming, and also because the adjacent gate was boarding a flight to Charlotte that was leaving around the same time. It was hard to hear what was going on and hard to keep track of announcements between the two gates.We boarded with Group 5 and got settled into our seats easily enough, but it was also during that time that we had a negative experience related to the flight attendants and our service dog. As I was boarding with my service dog, she was simply a bit scared to make the step over the gap from the jetway onto the aircraft, which is understandable for a dog in a loud, crowded, and unfamiliar environment, which has nothing to do with her ability to perform a service for a disability. As I was getting on and coaxing my dog over the threshold (she was fine after that), a flight attendant immediately saw me with the dog and asked if I was going to row 24 (I was). This seemed like a fine question if she was aware of us in advance and wanted to confirm that we had boarded. However, it turned out she was also looking out for us so she could be negative and rude. My mom boarded a minute or two later, and heard that same flight attendant talking to another, criticizing us and questioning the legitimacy of our service dog. She was saying that we probably just bought a service dog vest online to pretend that we had a service dog, and that real service dogs shouldn’t be scared while boarding a plane. She doesn’t know what she’s talking about, and it was simply rude. They know nothing about our situation and my service dog did nothing wrong either then or at any point during the flight. It was unfortunate to immediately feel unwelcome and questioned when boarding a flight.Due to the delayed boarding, we left the gate about 10 minutes late, but quickly took off, and had a smooth and uneventful flight back to Philadelphia that afternoon. I generally found the Airbus A319 to be nothing special. Legroom in the standard economy seats was very tight, especially with a service dog at our feet, so I’d probably pay for Main Cabin Extra seats with extra legroom in the future with a service dog. Even though it wasn’t exactly spacious, the 737 we were on during our flight to Florida seemed at least slightly better. The toddler in the row ahead of us that screamed for the entirety of the flight was also very unpleasant, but of course not the airline's fault. It appeared to be an issue of unprepared parents who had brought no activities of any sort onto the flight.Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and arrival time. Shortly after we reached our cruising altitude, flight attendants came around with the drink cart, offering full cans of soda, or juice or water, in addition to a choice of pretzels or Biscoff cookies.The flight attendants and pilot did make the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and they seemed pretty forceful about it, which I appreciated, since it’s not always the case. However, there was one passenger in the row ahead of us who was not wearing his mask over his nose or mouth for almost the entire flight, which was ridiculous. A flight attendant did correct him one time, which led to very brief compliance, but it was disappointing that there were no further warnings/penalties given after that, when it was obvious that he just didn’t care about following the federally mandated rules.As we approached Philadelphia, the pilot announced that we’d be landing in about 15 minutes, but after that, I noticed that our route started to seem very circuitous. We began to take a slow curving path as we flew over South Jersey, and the promised 15 minutes to being on the ground came and went. Although it was a nice day, I think there was just a lot of air traffic that afternoon. It would have been nice to get a more official update on what was delaying us. We ultimately arrived at the gate about 15 minutes late, which wasn’t unexpected given our late departure from PBI.By the time we made it from our gate at the end of Terminal C to baggage claim, luggage from our flight was already on the belt, which was a nice surprise. We very quickly grabbed our things and were on our way home.Overall, this flight from West Palm Beach to Philadelphia was just ok. The plane felt small and cramped in standard economy seats, and the flight departed and arrived late due to poor scheduling on the airline’s part. The worst part was overhearing negative comments being made about us by a flight attendant, which were totally unfounded and uncomfortable as a customer. Our previous flight with our service dog a few days before had been much better, so this one was definitely disappointing."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Customer service abysmal,"Several weeks back my flight changed from 2 PM to 7:30 AM. At the time there were no other options and I accepted the change without having much of a choice. It now looks like there is an option to fly on a 4 PM flight, a 2 hour time difference from the original flight. Customer service refused to change this flight without a $250 change fee, and when I spoke to a supervisor all she said was sorry it comes from our corporates headquarters. Every other airline I have flown have been understanding and flexible besides American. They are absolutely horrible and I hope you consider flying any other airline before giving them another dollar."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,AMERICAN AIRLINES COULD CARE LESS - WORST FLYING EXPERIENCE EVER,"Things couldn't have gone worse on this flight, and American Airlines could have cared less. The plane leaving Anchorage had some kind of problem, so they stranded us on the runway for about an hour. The heat inside the cabin was unbearable. Then they decided to taxi to an UNUSED terminal and unload us. It was actually a mile to the main terminal. Shuttles? Oh, no, not to be had. One of our group needed a wheelchair to cover that mile, which airline staff said they would get, but never did. So one of us had to walk a mile, get the wheelchair, walk a mile back, load the wheelchair, then walk another mile pushing the chair. Then he had to walk all over the main terminal to track down our luggage. He got his 10,000 steps in, huh? Then it was a 5-hour wait to rebook the 243 passengers on that plane so that they could make their connections. We were 24 hours late getting home, and we had no sleep for about 36 hours. American Airlines has refused to compensate all 243 passgers. They won't even give us miles credit for this entire flight because part of the trip, that they booked, was on a partner airline. I recommend you NEVER travel with American Airlines."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible lack of information,"We were returning from a trip to Paris. We knew that we had to take a covid test within 3 days of our trip. We did the testing and when we got to the airport we showed them our results, which were good. They would not accept it and told us we had to have the brand that they were using. This was never in any of their notices. So we found out that we could be tested there. We went to the area and it was packed with people needing the test. By the time we got our tests, our flight had left. We had to find a hotel for the night and got a flight out the next morning. This fiasco caused us to stay another day, for no reason except they did not clearly give instructions for Covid tests."
Date of travel: July 2021,50,AMERICAN AIRLINES CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS Baggage Claim EXTREMELY LATE,"We arrived at DFW at 9:00 AM, in boarded our plane at 9:30 and our bags are just now unloaded from the plane at 10:31. Terrible customer service at baggage claim. Nobody has answers nor etiquette.We tried escalate our concern with the employees working in baggage claim and they were rude and unwilling to even try to obtain a status.We are paying for our bags to travel with us and this is completely unacceptable.Treat your employees with the respect they deserve so that they in turn will reciprocate that samelevel of service to your customers paying increasingly rising costs to travel with you.We are hearing today from the employees themselves that they feel mistreated, disregarded and they are very short handed because so many are quitting and choosing to work from home or just work for another company.Shame on you American!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Do better American Airlines.,"I will never ever fly with American Airlines again. Our flight was delayed and then canceled due to a “maintenance issue.” We were then given a flight for the next day. We are three young girls stranded in a state we have never been in before and we were nervous about what we were going to do for  the night. We were then assured that we would be provided with a hotel, a shuttle, and a meal.  We were then told, after waiting for an hour, that there were no more hotels left to put us in. We were told by an associate at the airport that we will be refunded for our expenses, due to the fact that all of these things were SUPPOSED to be provided. Now that we are home and contacting the airline, we are being told we are being given a $50 American Airlines credit, and nothing else. This is the most outrageous thing I have ever heard. Since you were unable to provide us with a hotel we had to use up the rest of our money to find a hotel, pay for transportation, food and other health products to get through the night. We had to pay over $500 out of pocket but American Airlines believes $50 credit to fly with their horrible establishment for a second time will suffice. I think it’s honestly disgusting the way we are being treated by this airline, and how this situation has become such a burden to us as customers. Not only are we not being compensated for the amount we deserve, we are being given credit to an airline I never want to use again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Airline in existence,"I had a connecting flight from Orlando to Charlotte, then from Charlotte to Harrisburg and it was the worst thing I've ever had to do in my life. Ever sit in an airport and watch all the airline employees not know what they're doing for 12 hours? That's actually what happened. We arrived two hours early for our flight at noon. We get on the plane, sit for 40 minutes with no sort of updates about anything. Then are told to get off the plane it needs maintenance. We get off and our flight is delayed two hours. So now I won't make my connecting flight but it's cool this kind of thing happens. They put me on a later flight from Charlotte to Harrisburg so it should've been fine. But no, they delayed it two hours again with no explanation as to why. Then once those two hours were up, they delayed it again. So now takeoff is 4pm. My flight in Charlotte is at 8. It's a tight window but it can be done. 4 o'clock rolls around and they delay it again two hours. Now it's 6 and there's no possible way I'll make that flight. The workers were rude, gave no explanation to us as to what was happening and why we have been stranded in Orlando for 8 hours. They then delayed it again until 8. 8 rolls around and now FINALLY they get us a new plane. But it won't leave until 10. They gave us a hotel voucher which was fine and told us our luggage would be in Charlotte for us. They also gave us a 7:50 flight the next morning to Harrisburg. We get to Charlotte and ask where our bags are and they tel is they arrived in Harrisburg. So we sleep in the same clothes we had on then get to the airport in the morning and our flight gets delayed AGAIN. we finally get to Harrisburg at noon and go to get our bags from the left bags area and they tell us our bags were on the flight with us. At this point I was so fed up with these people I literally had no words. None of their workers had any clue as to what they were doing, they were all rude, they ignored questions, yelled at customers l, and even slammed a door in someone else's face. It was the worst experience of my life. I'm never one to complain and write reviews but holy crap this was terrible."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Slow and under staffed!,Literally missing our flight because we are waiting for air to be put in ONE tire. The maintenance crew is working on another plane and they don’t have any other people to help. Boo! Hire more people!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Use someone else. ANYONE ELSE.,"Don't fly with this airline or you'll regret it. Three gate changes, two plane changes and many hours later, I'm sitting in a plane still waiting to take off."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Never again,"Worst company ever. They lost our bags on each flight and could care less. They continue to have massive lines of people complaining about having lost bags yet they don’t seem to mind it. We pay to have bags checked, we should have peace of mind that we will get them when we return. I would strongly advise flying through a different company, any other company. We will never fly through them again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Do better,Me and my wife flew from fsd to mco with a layover in DFW The Who trip should have been 8hrs instead it was 25hrs look I get it Phoenix  a 8+ hr delay because it’s Phoenix but you don’t care about your customers and you tell them that you can’t help them for them to just sit in the air port well we sat in the terminal for 8hrs so I understand now go  with a trusted company someone that care
Date of travel: July 2021,10,The worst Airline around,"Never ever fly this airline, even if another flight is more expensive do it!! American Airlines delayed my flight an hour before it left, then canceled it. They could not get me a hotel close to the airport and were not helpful at all. I had to get a different flight to a different airport just to make it.  Take this advice and never fly with them, they don’t care about you, they just want your money."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Airlines is horrible,"On July 21, 2021 I traveled to Punta Cana, Dr American Airlines sent my luggage to the wrong place. I was not able to get my luggage shipped to in a timely fashion. I had very important items in my luggage and medication that I needed to take. My vacation was ruined because of American Airlines carelessness and sending my luggage to the wrong destination."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Seat Teassignment,"When I got on the plane and started towards my seat, I realized that someone was in it. I told her that this was my seat. The woman sitting next to her said that this is my daughter, and they told me she could sit there and that they would speak to anyone that had a problem with it. Honestly I would not have had a problem with it if they had just asked me first. I thought it was rude to allow her to sit in my seat, because technically, they can't make you do that. If the woman hadn't been snotty about it, I wouldn't have been bothered. But don't take my seat and get an attitude because you think I'll have one, lol. American, just ask first next time."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,DON'T FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES,American Airlines oversells their flights and bumps you based on when you checked in. They give you no warning so showing up for a 5:15 am flight only to be bumped to a 1:20 pm flight is a MAJOR inconvenience!!! I was raveling to my father's funeral and the airline didn't care if I made it or not. DON'T FLY THIS AIRLINE!!!!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Absolute worst flight charter,Before take out we were delayed three separate times while on the plane. I saw us go in three huge circles and delayed my trip by two hours with poor communication. We’d wait 30-45 minutes before we would even get a update. Speakers in back of plane didn’t work. The a/c wasn’t working. Nothing about my trip tells me to go with American Airlines ever again. I’d recommend it if you don’t want to be jammed into a terminal because not to many people crowding to get into American airline. They sweet talk you because they have the largest airline fleet. But what they have in numbers they make you pay for in piss port quality.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Connecting flight,Our flight 308 from Cabos left late on July 24 which made our arrival late arriving to Charlotte!!! Our baggage wasn’t loaded on belt until 8pm!!!!! So of course by the time we made it to E6 the doors had closed! Plane still at door but not allowed to board!!! Then not able to get another flight until next morning at 9 with no accommodations!!!!! Wow!!! Beyond disappointed as a customer!!! I understand things happen but this not being our fault is a great inconvenience!!! And from my understanding we were not the only ones!!!!! And the lady that was helping us already had an attitude when we got to her!!! So we weren’t the only ones to have a long day!! You guys need to do better! This isn’t customer service!!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Will never fly American again!,"What a rip off. I booked a round trip flight with American originally. Instead of flying out on the outbound flight. I booked yet another American flight out two days earlier because we decided to start our vacation early. Since we did not fly out on our original flight, they sold my return seats and even though they had 6 open seats, they made me re buy 4 tickets to get home and charged me a $35 fee per ticket on top of it. Two of us flying were even Aadvantage members... Canceling everything and will not fly American again. This is just a horrible way to treat your loyal passengers."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Awful,"This airline is ridiculous. Starts out with them changing our flight about a month prior and when we arrive somehow MY ticket is no where go be found even though we have evidence of purchase for us both and all the while MY phone is getting all the flight updates but my husbands phone isnt and his ticket is fine.  We were delayed on our flight out by 2 hrs. Missed our connecting flight and also had the same problem with them finding my ticket information...due to the fact they changed our flight time . Then, our connecting flight was also delayed and ultimately ended up making us need to get a hotel for the night since we had a 3 hr drive and we were supposed to arrive at 5-6pm but didnt until 1am. All this time EACH flight was overbooked. How do you consistsantly overbook each flight? What are you doing? We asked them to reimburse us for our meals and hotel stay that we WOULDNT  have needed without all the delays and all they offered us was $100 air credit. I dont want your air credit. My mother also got delayed on both of her flights JUST today with them. I also got an email (already had regrettably booked with them in Sept prior to all this happening) that my September booking to MI has changed. How does a flight already change in June when its scheduled in Sept? Im going to assume I will have just as awful of an experience in Sept and will post if I do and if I dont. I will absolutely never book with them again especially since my mothers experience today was exactly the same and will never recommend them to anyone."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN!!!,I'm not going into specifics about what happened with this airline but after 6 gate and  time changes for my flight to SAV..yes I said 6...I will stick with Delta..🤬
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Do not Fly with American Airlines!,American Airlines has way too many maintenance issues for my liking! Each maintenance delay has pushed back my flights and caused me to miss my connecting  flight more than once on the same trip! Then when you ask the gate agent what’s going on they aren’t very professional or knowledgeable about anything. Very frustrated with American Airlines and I will never fly with them again. It would be very helpful if American Airlines actually valued customers time and travel plans instead of constantly punishing customers for their crappy planes and lackluster customer service.
Date of travel: July 2021,20,American Airlines is not family oriented,"American Airlines is not accommodating to families. This is the only airline that doesn’t assign seats with each other. When you are travel with a young child, families should be able to sit together.It just doesn’t make sense. One of the flight agents that was not booked on our flights, got our seats together with no problem. Also, Every American Airlines flight has a connecting flight. They should work on straight flights.This is the last time I fly with American Airlines, unless they change something."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,What a sh*t company,"If you like being treated like cattle, lied to repeatedly to make you ""feel better"", and enjoy paying for your baggage twice, sneered at by attendants, and a stiff neck. By all means go with this airline. You'll pay extra for the privilege!"
Date of travel: July 2021,20,"No leg room, seats are uncomfortable, everyone is in boarding group 7","Don't worry about checking in exactly 24 hours before your flight it doesn't matter, everyone will be in boarding group 7. The seats are very uncomfortable and barely recline back. ( I am sorry but I needed more leg room so I have to recline my seat.) The leg room is minimal on the plane. Wait, actually nil. Delays, delays, delays. I am not quite sure why I booked with this airline but it will never happen again. Avoid them if you can."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Eggregious delays,My last two flights with American have been delayed a total of three times. The added delays are completely screwing my travel plans and taking away time with family. I hope they get a sense of how many peoples' weeks they're ruining everytime they make changes like this. Never patronizing again.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Won’t recommend or use this airline ever again!,"Flight 615 from Miami to DFW on 7/23/21 was awful. What a bunch of unprofessional people. I noticed their attitude right from boarding time, the way they addressed people was far from nice. Then the flight attendants were very rude as well. Instead of information they give you orders like you are their subordinates. I wasn’t even offered a snack like everyone else. At first I thought it was an accident but later I realized it must have been on purpose as a pay back for my refusal to check my carry on bag. Additionally, as soon as we got on the plane they announced a 90 minute delay which was a shock but even worse than that was the fact that it all changed a few minutes later saying our flight had been moved up and that delay would now be just a few minutes. Then once we arrived at DFW airport they announced that our gate was still occupied by another plane and it would take another 7 minutes waiting but this was taken back a few seconds later to announce that we would take a different gate which was further away. It’s like they lie to the passengers very easily.So a lot of people missed their connecting flight and we had a terrible experience with this airline. I definitely will avoid flight with American Airlines, that’s no way to do business I’m very disappointed with them."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Added 4 hours of delay,4 hours of delay and three gate changes. No apologies or explanations.  Made me miss a connecting flight.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,I will never fly American airlines again!!,"I wouldn't recommend this airline to any family or friends. I booked my ticket through American Airlines directly for July 10, 2021. The canceled my flight for the 10th of July with no notification I checked into my flight the day before. I arrived at the airport 2 hours ahead of my flight I lived 50 miles away from the airport. When I arrived they said ""Sorry Sir your flight has been canceled I was upset I explained I needed to be on this flight. There was nothing I could do I tried to call the airlines 4 1/2 hold time to talk with someone. I paid full price for the ticket to leave on the 10th of July no accommodations were made at all. If I would of booked my flight for July 11th I would of saved 150 dollars which again I didn't have a choice about the cancelation. I left Washinton state on the 18th my flight from Seattle to Dallas was ok. Once I arrived I then found out the canceled my flight from Dallas to Fayetteville North Carolina no explanation at all. I stayed at Dallas Airport for over 8 1/2 hours wanting on my plane back home. Again no accommodations no nothing. I didn't get back to my home state until the following day missed work but American Airlines doesn't care about the customers at all. I called corporate left an message here it is July 23, 2021 and no call back. AMERICAN AIRLINES IS BY FAR THE WORST TO EVER FLY DONT DO IT BETTER OF FLYING ANY OTHER AIRLINE."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,2 cancelled flights,I was supposed to fly to OKC on 7/22 at 7 pm out of DFW. My flight continuously was delayed for a 5 hour period. We eventually boarded and then had to be towed back to the gate when maintenance issues still were not fixed. The airline eventually cancelled our flight and put us on a flight for 10:30 the next morning. After spending $120 in Ubers back and forth to the airport my flight was again delayed multiple hours and cancelled the next morning. The staff had absolutely no idea what was going on a there was no communication to the passengers. I eventually was able to get on a third flight (thank God)!! I have emailed American Airlines expecting a full refund for my flight and the cost of my ubers. This entire experience has been absolutely awful and I do not plan to fly American ever again. There needs to be a better plan in place when something like this happens in the future.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"TLDR: I had an awful day, cancelled flight, 14 hours in the airport, I want a voucher for a new flight.","Yesterday was a terrible day, courtesy of American Airlines. I’m traveling for work, and leaving Columbus to go home to DFW. We board the plane and then the captain says they didn’t do their pre-board check properly and they didn’t have an operating fire extinguisher. So we were told to get off the plane. After that, the plane was delayed by 4 hours, and then another 4 hours and then cancelled. All of the other passengers waiting to fly to Dallas started screaming and yelling in the terminal at B19 “ARE YOU F** KIDDING ME! YOU COULD HAVE CANCELLED THE FLIGHT EARLIER SO WE COULD GET THE F** OUT OF HERE” So I decided I didn’t want to be a part of that crowd, so I walked over to my new AA desk at B26 and they told me for me to get a voucher I would need a supervisor’s approval or to email you guys. And then it turned out that the screaming people got vouchers for the flight and meal vouchers! I ended up having to take a flight to Philly and then to Dallas and I didn’t make it home until 1am. I was supposed to be home by 2pm. I spent 25$ on a phone charger I didn’t want, but needed. I spent 35$ on food/water I didn’t want, but needed. I spent 24$ on an extra day of parking at the dfw airport because I was supposed to leave by 2pm. I have received no compensation. The AA employees at the Columbus airport were either extremely rude or incompetent or a combination of the two."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Should be called American Longlines...,"A flight that should have taken less than an hour lasted OVER THREE HOURS. Delays boarding because the covid disinfect crew was late, delays taking off, delays at the ariving terminal, and they left my disabled mother alone in a wheelchair.Save yourself alot of greif and go with ANY airline other than AA."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Severely disabled flyer traveling special needs and getting abandoned by American Airlines and missing a flight,My disabled daughter was flying with special needs escort prospect and American Airlines . Service was set up for escort and UM travel well she was abandoned at a gate missed a flight and they tried sending her out to Chicago to a hotel alone overnight . She is developmentally delayed speech impaired and I had to fight via phone 1000 miles away to get her back to UM escort and remain safely at the airport . This airline has been a nightmare to deal with . They aren’t taking liability and have put me thru so many hoops . I filed a DOT complaint which is being investigated . People please don’t trust your kids or your disabled loved ones with this airline they will neglect and be so cruel To them . Here are pictures showing her with armband and lanyard she has the luggage labeled UM her iq is below 70 . Also a picture of another disabled person same incident abandoned in sane airport with American Airlines .
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Premium Economy ... closer to economy,"Comfortable seats and was looking forward to the enhanced drink menu offered on the IFE system. On the flight out the attendant said only beer and wine were offered in PE. Once I pointed out the system had not been updated, he offered to bring me a Jack Daniels from up front. On the way back it was all rules; beer and wine only for PE and economy and full bar up front. Menu options did not offer any meat options (except the beef in the bibimbap) in either directions but my son was able to get a chicken plate from economy which he enjoyed. The flight crew back to the states had obviously more seniority and made for an amusing time as they struggled with language and culture. The extra room in PE was nice but feel a bit cheated when they change offerings without notice. For an extra ten percent PE would be worthwhile but any more and I would look at another airline. Returned July 19, 2021."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Crappy service and airline,This airport and airline is the worst. It looks like they treat you depending by group number the higher the number the worst you are. Everyone has an attitude as if they have a bad day or something up their i will never travel American airline again. And that’s why JetBlue took over the world. By good service and great attitude.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,I had hundreds of dollars in posters stolen.,"I want to say first, my flight itself was fine. There were too many people on my first plane to they offered to send everyone's baggage and carry-on directly to their final destination, which I accepted. It wouldn't have made a difference in regards to what happened either way.I'm a collector of video game posters, and I had at least 10 posters in my luggage. I felt secure in thinking they would not be stolen. I was wrong. My posters ranged from $5 to so rare that I cannot find them online and thus cannot find a price for them. Most are $15 - $25. I couldn't check my luggage due to specific circumstances until two days after I landed, which was outside of what they deemed worth their time. And even if I had called in time, because they hadn't stolen my entire luggage it wouldn't have mattered anyway. I'm never flying them again, and recommending literally everyone I know to never fly them."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Significantly lacking quality customer service and equipment maintenance.,"Currently military, in the process of coordinating a relocation. My spouse and I had a flight booked for 22 July, but it was delayed. We received a notice 2 hours prior to departure.  This flight’s delay subsequently made us incapable of catching our layover flight. We were rebooked to 23 July and were told that “maintenance” is why our flight was delayed. No reassurances for the status of the flight on 23 July was provided. Additionally their capabilities in “refunding” you for failed services or canceled flights is abhorrent. Going Southwest, Delta  or Alaskan Airlines from here on out. This is 3rd time AA has failed me and provided lackluster service."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,NIGHTMARE,First they delayed the flight due to weather condition...ok that's understanble and beyond their control (if that was true)... then after three hours they boarded everybody to announce the flight was cancelled  right after the last passenger boarded....no hotel voucher no food voucher no water a limited number of blankets provided. The worst was they checked most of the carry on luggage to make the boarding faster. People had not their belonging for a whole night because of their disorganization. Crew was overall kind but one of them was extremely....shame shame shame! I would give zero if possible!
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Punta Cana Staff Went Above and Beyond!,"Flying from Punta Cana today to Seattle. Our connecting flight to Dallas was delayed by an hour, meaning we would miss our flight to Seattle. There were NO seats available for the next 3 days on any flights.  A supervisor came to help and put us in an all-inclusive resort for the night (not as nice as the one we were at, but it was a Dreams resort). Got us transportation, paid for that AND the hotel stay. Tomorrow they are driving us 2 hours to Santo Domingo to catch a flight from there to get us home! I never expected this type of service, the counter employees in Punta Cana are amazing! Far exceeding any airport in the United States (especially Dallas, AA really needs to work on that one). All flights on the way down were perfect (7/13/21). Flight attendants keep the liquor flowing and meals weren't too bad either. Well done American Airlines! Who wouldn't want another FREE day of vacay?!?"
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Smooth roundtrip travel,Pros: I got to my destinations on time and without incident.  Nobody went crazy on the flights.  So I'm very happy about that.  Cons:  flight attendants were not enforcing the mask mandate.  The person sitting next to me kept their mask on their chin the entire flight.  No one said a word to her.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst airline ever,The problem with this airline is that they have either low standards or no set standards the crews work really slow and they always make everyone miss their next flights please either set a standard or think about being something other than an airline
Date of travel: July 2021,10,What is wrong with the flight scheduler?,"I have taken the 5 am flight from Dallas , connecting through Charlotte for years and arrived in Salisbury at 11 am.  That has disappeared. All flights are 9 - 10 hours long and cost just as much.  I will be driving home until they find someone who knows how to schedule flights"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,two day nightmare,"Monday. 7/12/21 flight scheduled for 2:28 pm. One hour delay. Loaded plane at 3:30 and started taxiing. Held up on tarmac for over three hours. Disembark at 6:30 and told to stay close to the gate. Announced flight cancelled. Told to go to D37 (other end of the airport) to rebook. Stood on rebooking line for THREE HOURS. Finally told (9:30 pm) no more flights tonight. No direct flights next day. Needed to book flight from Miami 9:00 am Tuesday to Nashville, FIVE HOUR LAYOVER, got to La Guardia 6:30. No consideration of overnight food or lodgings."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible,This airline is the worst stay FAR away. our flight was to leave last night we where told pilot was tired and we would leave in a hour and a half then was told 8 am my children had to sleep on a dirty floor in the airport no pillows no blankets we get to our gate at 7:45 to be told our flight was delayed again for 9am then 10am now they are saying 11am. Another passenger is in tears as she has now missed her daughters wedding. I have asked for a manager to be told they will escort me out for being hostile. We're still here waiting and I am still her waiting to speak with a manager. I better have my money compensated for the time my car has been parked in the parking garage. DON'T FLY THIS AIRLINE!!!!!!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Travel International,"WORST, WORST, WORST  AIRLINE when I was traveling they over sold tickets and cancel planes. They begin to down grade people with out their consent. Eventhough we were at the gate and when I ask why the down grade. They just told me ""even you want to make you're connection you may want to take this seats"" surprise when I arrived to Miami they gave a different flight that place me past my 72 hours of my COVID-19 test so I can travel internationally. WORST WORST WORST AIRLINE."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Airline,"This airline is the worst, they down grade you to economy without let you know, the customer service is insane this is the first and last time. I will travel with them.  They don't care about customer service when you ask a question they just tell you a lied or get mad like you are inconvenience to them."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,So surprised (in a bad way),"I flew American Airlines recently and I have never been more disappointed by an airline. They just had another flight before me and failed to clean anything. I assumed since we are still in a pandemic, they would do their best to ensure that they are clean. However, there was trash left in the compartment in front of me. Gross. They took over an hour to actually take off from the moment we starting boarding. And when we landed, we did not leave the plane for over an hour. They did not tell us which carousel we were. We were dropped off at an international terminal on a domestic flight and we’re expected to find our way to Terminal 4 with no instruction as to where our bags were. When I got to the carousel, it said that the flight was for Austin, Texas and not Miami. However, my bag was there. There was only 1 staff member helping and a huge line to be helped. Everyone in the line had their luggage lost. Never flying American again and I suggest you don’t either."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Airlines Ever,"We were supposed to have a two hour layover after our arrival to Dallas but instead they made us sit on the tarmac for an hour and a half after an already delayed flight and made us miss our flight home, which was also the last flight there for the night. They compensated us for one meal for the entire day we'd be spending at the airport since the next available flight wasn't for another 24 hours. Horrible service, they don't care about their customers. Do not fly American Airlines. We will never make this mistake again, choose Delta instead."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,awful,THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL COMPANY I HAVE EVER SPENT MONEY ON… While on board flight 320 me and my boyfriend were eating the food we purchased from the Miami airport(a flight attendant clearly stated that we can pull our mask down only if we were eating or drinking). A male flight attendant walked by us and asked my boyfriend why his mask was down(once) while we were eating. A female flight attendant then gave us both a card stating we were using dangerous behavior a minute later. My boyfriend was physically hit in the head and shoulder by BOTH of the passing flight attendants a couple minutes later. No “excuse me” or anything. My boyfriend is black and I KNOW FOR A FACT WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TREATED THIS WAY IF HE WAS A 50 YEAR OLD WHITE MAN. I’LL GLADLY WALK TO MY NEXT VACATION THEN STEP FOOT ON ANOTHER FLIGHT WITH THESE POORLY TRAINED FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ON IT. I did NOT give this flight attendant or Envoy employees permission to use my cell phone number! BUYER BEWARE!!!!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,WORSE EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD ON AN AIRPLANE,Why is your ugly fat slob of a  flight attendants texting my phone? You guys have completely drop the ball with some of your new hires… Y’all are rude and racist. I will never fly American again.
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Exit Row Fiasco,"On July 4th, we were on a flight from BZN to DFW,  Attendant Gregory Gatze was so kind as to allow my husband and I to sit in the exit row of the flight from Bozeman to Dallas since the flight was not full and all of the exit rows were vacant. We, along with another couple, moved back one row to the exit row.  We were approached by a very rude, large, male flight attendant and told that these were premium seats and we had to pay for them or go back to our seats. We thought he was joking and continued to sit there.  My husband, a retired Navy veteran of 21 years who was ticketed in a different row from me on a flight with 50 plus seats available, told him that the other flight attendant had told us it was ok. This man said, “I don’t care what he told you. Go back to your seats”. I moved back up one row in front of the exit rows to my original seat. My seat didn’t recline even though the person in front of me was reclined the entire flight. The seat next to me was empty but my husband returned to his ticketed seat. It seems to me that it would be safer to have people sitting in the exit rows in the event someone needed to deploy the doors. Why in the world would these seats come at a higher cost if someone is willing to sit there and be responsible for helping others? The male flight attendant could have nicely asked us to return to our seats, but he was loud and rude. Mr. Gatze came and apologized to us and the other couple.  At a time when customer service should be so important, I really feel that some AA employees are not up to standards set by the company.  The male flight attendant was scary and rude and it was clear he did not enjoy his job. He also did not wear a name tag so I could not include it in my review."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible,Absolute garbage. No excuse for stranding people. Cancellations are unacceptable and should be resolved within the hour.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst experience,I’d give no stars if that’s an option. On the way to Myrtle beach our plane had mechanical issues and was delayed hours.  We were able to get on a different flight as we would miss our connecting flight.  On the way home again the plane had mechanical issues and we would miss our connecting flight. We were unable to book anything else.  Beat they could do was the next day.  We ended up taking a flight to Dallas (four hours after original) and then will have to stay overnight to take a flight to Minneapolis in the morning. They also split my family up so we won’t be sitting together.  We have yet to get vouchers for the hotel or meals.  I’ve NEVER had so many issues with flights before.  We will never book with American Airlines again.  We haven’t even gotten thru it all but I had to leave a review as this service is horrible and if it continues I’ll leave another review.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Canceled Flight, No Room, Food, Transportation or Refunds; Spent $1000 on New Tickets","On the night of July 1 when my family of 6 was thrown into a 600-700 person ""rebooking"" line and only got replacement flights 2 days out.  I spent $1000 to get 4 of us out on Southwest before the hurricane hit Miami a few days later.  We were told that the flight, which was a clear maintenance failure announced by the pilot, was weather related, so we were denied lodging, food, transportation or alternative flights on other airlines.  Later, AA classified the flight as ""crew availability"" related, which effectively voids trip insurance paying me for the flights home.  To add insult to injury, AA also just turned down my request for a refund for the last leg of our flight (Miami to Washington DC)."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,No proper customer service - absolutely the worst airlines,"The incompetency of this airlines cannot be described in mere words. We were supposed to travel to Chicago from Denver and take an international flight there.Our entire trip went down the lane when the AA flight got delayed by 5 hours at Denver. They made us wait for 2 hours in a line just to speak to customer representative. I would expect some apologies and regret, accountability for making us go through all of this - But NO.Incompetent - thats their customer service."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,FLY HLM OR BRITISH AIR OR LUFTHANSA,scum. They could help. But will not!! Rot in hell. No customer service and tons of attitude...I hope the air line does a huge crash and burn...you could take lessons from southwest...they do customer service
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Will NOT Value Your Business!! No Matter Your Status! MONOPOLY!,"Having so many airlines to choose from to fly to your destination is great, but when you have schedule restraints, American Airlines is the only option.  I fly with American Airlines once a month.  I would love to say many good things, but I cannot give feedback that is good when it's not there.  Now, when you have taken over 40 roundtrip flights with the same airline to the same location in the last 7 and a half years, you'd expect a little help.  I booked a flight 4 weeks out, and 1 week before my flight, I was told I needed a surgery that would not allow me fly.  When contacting AA to try to change my flight, even if I had to pay a fee, they completely declined to help me.  Reason for that, I bought the economy ticket with restrictions.  Needless to say, I am incredibly upset they took my money for something that was out of my control. Fly with someone that will value you!!  American Airlines is definitely not that airline."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Be aware of American Airlines!!,You have better chance of hitting the lottery than to be in a decent American Airlines Flight. Terrible customer service. Zero professionalism. This airlines don't know what courtesy is. They are apparently not liable for delayed flight because its your fault you booked with them. Choose wisely..
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Awful experience at DEN,"Absolutely awful service at American Airlines Denver check in. Rude, useless staff. I was in tears for the entire time they were talking to me. Asked where we could get urgent covid tests near the airport as they wouldn't allow us to use the COVID facilities at DEN. They said 'they couldn't help'. Asked where the nearest luggage storage was (travelling with 15 month old and 5 suitcases), and they responded 'we can't help and don't know). Useless electronic check in desks, long queues and rude staff. DO NOT FLY AMERICAN from Denver. It's not worth the hassle."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,NEVER WILL I USE AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN,"IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD. I was traveling active duty with my younger siblings and was treated HORRIBLY for the SECOND time within a month. The woman at the check in counter at FAY made things extremely difficult and charged me for bags I shouldn't have payed for due to military travel. IM ALSO 8 MONTHS PREGNANT and she kept asking for an ID for my UNDERAGE sibling. This is not the first horrible experience I have had with American Airlines and I will definitely never recommend anyone fly with them nor will I ever use them again. If you want an Airline that is CONSISTENTLY rude and INCONSISTENT when it comes to military then by all means use them. BUT if you can avoid them, do it."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible Customer Service,"American Airlines has no clue what is going on at all times. Very frustrating experience. Customer service was poor and unwilling to help. I understand an airline cannot make everyone happy, however, a certain degree of effort should be required to satisfy the base majority of customers who need service. My wife and I chose to originally fly American, and after our experience, I’d rather walk my happy ass from Miami to Indianapolis. Fly Delta."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American Airlines Horrible!,"Crew didn't show up so flight canceled. 4 hour long lines to get answers. They texted me a hotel confirmation code, called hotel and they have no names or reservations or shuttle service. AA did not provide shuttle voucher. Trying to get back home but sleeping on an uncomfortable chair at DFW. HORRIBLE!!!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Continual Disappointing Customer Service,"Due to a lack of American Airlines employees checking in customers at the ticketing/checked baggage desk located within the Salt Lake City International Airport as well as poor customer service, we were not able to make our 8:00 am flight. After multiple delays at SLC and DFW, we finally arrive in LBB to discover our bags were incorrectly offloaded at DFW and waiting in the baggage claim area. You would think it would be an easy fix to have my bag flown from DFW to LBB on one of the 5 nonstop flights which occur throughout the day. However, after notifying both DFW and American Airlines multiple times throughout the day, my bag has continued to sit at the baggage service desk at DFW after nearly 36 hours. Despite going without crucial pain medication for going on 2 days, the customer service representatives have been unwilling and/or unable to accomplish the simple task of transferring my bag on a flight to LBB. I’m so desperate at this point were it not for my one-year-old daughter, I would have them book me a round trip ticket to pick up the bag myself as it is seems this major airline is incapable of the simple task of sending me my “already found” bag."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible,"I arrived on time for my flight to NewYork. My flight was at 2:50, they initially delayed it by 2 hours. Then we got on the flight and then deplaned as they canceled the flight because they did not have enough crew workers. Then I ended up waiting for another 4 hours to get a new flight, they gave me a bunch of excuses. No refund. I had to pay a cab to get here. Who is supposed to reimburse for that? I now need to pay cab fare to go home and find another way to get to NewYork. The worst are the representatives at the counter. They are so indifferent about this issue. It’s just horrible. Do not fly American Airlines."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,So much for COVID security measures,"On my recent flight from Madrid toMiami, mask rules were NOT enforced, at least in coach, where I was seated. Several passengers around me during the 9-hour flight had their masks down (when it was NOT meal time) exposing noses and sometimes mouths, and one woman in my line of vision  took her mask off completely for most of the flight. I don’t know how long or if the passenger in front of me had his mask up at any point, but when he turned around upon landing it was completely down. Has anyone else had this kind of experience on an AA flight?I am dreading flying with AA again my first flight to see my family in over a year a few months after  losing my mom to COVID.  First to blame are the selfish passengers, of course. But as far as AA is concerned,  I guess they know we don't have many options for flying transatlantic so don't bother enforcing the federal and international regulations. Disgraceful."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Funeral,I missed my grandmother funeral because american airlines when I called they told me they  couldn't help me
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Horrible Customer Service, Ended up Cancelling the whole flight","I booked myself a nice business class flight for a family vacation to Switzerland. The trouble started about 4 weeks prior to departure: their partner British Airways cancelled the outgoing flight. Ok, no problem, I call and they rebook me on a United/Swiss flight - I'm actually happy about it because Swiss is a nice airline.Then two weeks prior to departure, they call me and tell me my return flight was also cancelled. So I call them again, thinking I'll just rebook. Maybe I can even extend my stay a bit. But the rep tells me there are no options. Either I do an overnight in London, for which they do not pay the hotel, or I wait for another flight for 4 weeks - that's not what I had in mind with extending my trip by a little bit.I argue, and call back 4 additional times hoping I would get something sensible. Each time the call center queue is 4-6 hours, thankfully they have a callback option. But still, at this point I'm planning my days around calls with AA and hoping my vacation is still happening. Mind you I made plans at this point, incurred additional costs, etc.Finally I reach a competent rep that escalates to their support, and that support escalates to their support. Then they drop this bombshell on me: the rep that rebooked me on the United/Swiss flight was not authorized to do so, and I will not be able to board when I show up. They are now clearly trying to get me to just cancel and get a refund 5 days prior to departure. At this point I'm done. I go through with the cancellation and rebook on Delta which never gave me this type of a nightmare.I will  never fly American Airlines, British Airways, or anything else in their stupid ""OneWorld"" alliance ever again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Absolute WORST airline to fly with.,"I had the WORST experience with American Airlines. Not only were there associates very rude and unprofessional but they also were very hostile. After showing proof of an approved COVID test by Korean Government, Tammy with American Airlines refused to let me board and kept stating my results were not an approved test. After showing her multiple methods of proof, speaking with multiple commanders in Korea, and showing her information about my test results she states she does not care and cannot help. She constantly raised her voice and was not helpful at all. Then trying to retrieve my checked bag from the baggage claim, The American Airlines associate at the baggage claim counter was very rude and was adamant about yelling his responses at you. Held his hand up in my face to get me to stop talking. I will never fly American Airlines and I will encourage others to choose a different airline also."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delayed arrivals and early departing connecting flights.,"The title says it all. Our AA Flight left without multiple connection passengers. They delayed our flight 45 min at the last airport, but they couldn’t wait 5 min here in Charlotte!?! Not only just waiting, but departing early so connecting flights couldn’t make it?!? Ended up costing them more money by putting people up in a hotels?!? Never AA and never layover in Charlotte again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Airline deteriorating every day,"This airline is getting worse and worse every day.  I fly over 125 flights a year, and AA is consistently bad, late, rude, and more."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,american airlines vactions dont do it,this is about their vacation packages. very simple dont book a package with them. on their site they advertise that you are getting a 2 bed in a room and when you get to the hotle you find out that they are not guarnteed room types eventhough you pay for a type of room it is not guaranteed. you call them to complain and all they do is send you an email saying sorry but nothing they can do. no compensation back for a room you paid extra for. Never again will i book with american airlines vacations
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Terrible Aircraft, Bad Deal",Outrageous pricing for one-way first-class ticket.  The first class cabin is dingy.  The cabin amenities are far below par compared to other airlines.  The aircraft info on aa.com indicates power.  There are no power outlets other than one USB port.  Never again.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Gave my window seat I bought  to someone else and threatened to kick me off if I didn't sit in the middle,"The seat you buy isn't the seat you're guaranteed. I bought my window seat ticket and sat I my seat when a woman told me I was sitting in her seat. Turned out she bought an upgrade to sit in the window seat and we both had the same seat number. The flight attendants came to assist us and told me the middle seat was mine. I argued that I bought the window seat online and that the app and ticket both showed it was my seat.No apology, no explanation, only that I would be kicked off if I didn't comply. No concern for the customer, no desire to resolve their own mistakes. Just sit down, shut up, and thanks for being a loyal scumbag to American Airlines."
Date of travel: April 2021,30,I Hope This Was A One Of A Kind Flight,Well I decided to travel in the USA as overseas travel is a little difficult. I have noticed that the service on international travel is much better than interstate. The service was indifferent and poor in comparison. I do think that covid has had a bearing on this but since I have traveled both recently it is still not up to standard. First class was really business. The choice of prepackaged food was sad. The staff did all they could to avoid passengers contact but a smile or a friendly word can be done at a distance. The attendant on my connecting flight spoke into the speaker system so quickly that I did not know what she was saying. When I think about how close I was to the next seat I am not sure a mask was helpful. I really think that overall it was the attitude of the staff that bothered me most. We were a nuisance to the staff and it showed. Great
Date of travel: March 2021,10,RUDE,"My fiancé and i went to Jamaica back in March, he flew us first class, he wanted me to have a great experience in this trip, he was proposing so of course he made it so perfect! unfortunately our first class tickets with American Airline was not as i expected, on the way back. from Montego Bay to Charotte, the flight attended was so Rude! she right away pick on me by asking me to put my little bag away and my tiny bag needed to be over head. but the lady  behind me had a much bigger bag, and she didn't ask her for to put her bag away.  second when i ask her for a blanket. she said she didn't have a blanket. when we had blankets in our previews flight. the plane was freaking cold! terrible customer service! flight attendant like her should not be working in this type of job if she is not friendly and she looks miserable she should find another job."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Long Day on AA,"Rough day flying American.  Arrived early for flight in Salt Lake City.  The check in operations were in shambles.  Understaffed.  Long lines.  A quick glance around the terminal showed that no other airlines had lines like American.  Perhaps there are too many flights scheduled at the same time for the minimal staff at check in?  The non-stop to Philly boarded and left pretty much on time.  Completely full flight.  When we got to Denver, we were told that we were being diverted to Phoenix - 2 hours in the other direction - due to mechanical issues with the weather radar.  Perhaps Dallas or Chicago diversions would have made more sense.  As we arrived in Phoenix, we were told that the plane was coming in heavy and that fire engines would greet the plane in case the brakes catch fire.  Had the feeling that more was wrong than the pilot let on.  Upon arrival in Phoenix, it took over 15 minutes to get a gate agent; we were then told to head to a gate in the next terminal to continue on to Philly.  The new gate was unstaffed for about an hour and a half.  Eventually left for Philly after spending almost 3 hours in Phoenix; arrive in Philly after 1 a.m., and wait 20-30 minutes for a gate agent.  The flight attendants did a great job though."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,How Are They Still In Business,"My title is a serious question. Our Flight from Kansas City to Charlotte, NC was delayed by almost 2 hours. Which caused us to miss our layover flight from Charlotte to Chicago. We paid $130 extra for our seats in order to be in the main cabin, which they didn’t refund us. In order to make up for their mistake, they rebooked us to Cincinnati and from there we would get to Chicago. Unfortunately they overbooked that flight to begin with and they needed volunteers to allow us on, which took forever. We were in crammed seats separated from one another. And once in Cincinnati, that flight was delayed by almost 2 hours, and we were in a very small plane! We are currently at the airport and AA already changed my seat numbers, for which I again paid extra for in order to be in main cabin, and the lady said she doesn’t know why they would do that, to simply wait until my flight to find out? Like what lol They also overbooked this flight and are looking for volunteers to take alternative flights back to Kansas City. This Airline is a joke and honestly not even Spirit was this horrible! Never take this AA!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Poor Service,"On July 7th, 2021, I was trapped in the Austin Airport for over 9 hours on a flight delay due to ""mechanical issues.""  I spoke with the local rep, called customer service, chatted on the app and emailed by concerns.  I have waited since July 7th any response from my email and have yet to hear anything from American Airlines.  Fast forward to July 18th, 2021.  I am stuck at JFK airport for an 1150am flight to Austin only to be informed that we are on a 1 hour delay, then 2 hour delay, then a 4 hour delay.  This time id due to lack of crew.  When trying to get any information, I again went to the app, website, and local rep(oh wait, there have been no local reps avail for the past two hours) and the 800 number is a minimum of 2 hour wait.  Poor communications and poor customer service."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Airline Ever!,Worst Airline Ever!   After a gate and terminal changed - our flight was delayed 4 times and now I will miss my connecting flight.  They told us to go to the customer assistance window and there are about 100 people in line and 1 agent helping.  I’ve been in line for about 40 min and he is on his second customer.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible Ticketing Supervisor - $350 for checked bags that always cost $40??,"I can’t even begin to describe the experience I just had with #americanairlines. Probably the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my life. My (under 2, lap infant) and I have flown American Airlines 9 times since she’s been born. NINE. I am an American Airlines credit card member for the last decade and pretty religiously only fly American. Every time we travel — it’s a lot — car seat, stroller, pack n play, Ainsleigh’s bag, my bag, the whole gig. And normally American is great — Ainsleigh’s baby stuff is free, my credit card membership covers my bag and I usually only have to pay for Ainsleigh’s suitcase — $40 depending on if we’re traveling as military or not. So tell me today how I’m flying out American in LaGuardia, NY and the exact same set up as the other 9 times cost me $350??!! Had I done the same transaction on the kiosk as I’ve done before - most recently July 4th weekend to Norfolk, VA — I PAID $40. But today I got sent to the priority line because the kiosks were full and my hands were full where I dealt with the manager/supervisor Quinn. Quinn was one of the most disrespectful people I’ve ever dealt with in a customer service situation, raising his voice and talking over me when I was just trying to understand how every other time I fly it’s $40 and today it’s $350. That’s a massive difference, that’s more than my plane ticket and he ultimately told me “pay the $350 or don’t fly, I don’t care” before he walked away. We didn’t have much of a choice — we have to get to Arkansas so after the back and forth when Quinn stormed off, I reluctantly paid it to the ticketing agent who apolgized to me !!!!I will never fly American again. I will be canceling my AA credit card. Customer service and experience is everything and this supervisor named Quinn completely ruined mine forever with #americanairlines."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,LAST TIME WASTING MY MONEY ON AA,"You guys are the WORST omg!! ALWAYS something with you guy's planes. All this money and you guys can't get a plane that won't cause 2hours+ delay???Thils is the second time this happened to me with this airline.. RIDICULOUS !! The pilot will say it will only take 30mins and that will multiple by 10x. I hate this airline so much now , horrible customer service and now this. Wow how degrading for an airline."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,THE. WORST. AIRLINE. IN. EXISTENCE.,"American Airlines canceled my flight and SEVERAL others due to not having staff. Ever since Covid they’ve just been creating flights that they can’t staff leaving paying customers stranded in the airport. What’s worse is they make it absolutely miserably impossible to get your refund. It’s unforgivably bad what they’re doing. My earliest flight home was going to arrive at 10pm the next day, thank God there was a frontier (that’s right frontier) flight that got me home after American left me stranded in the airport with no other option. Just nothing. Not because of weather, not because of any understandable cause, EVERY OTHER AIRLINE WAS WORKING. American kept everyone stranded in an airport because they didn’t have staff and made up a flight that was never going to work. And I’ve been trying to get my refund for over a month. I wouldn’t have left this review if it wasn’t for their absolutely horrendous and PURPOSEFUL, sickening, painful process to get a refund. It’s not even about the money at this point. It’s about the principle. You can’t steal from people. No company should be allowed to do what American is doing now. Never book with this airline. They’re not the same company they were before COVID, and you no longer have a secure flight to wherever you’re going. This is not an isolated incident, it’s happening to countless people going to various locations. Be safe. Book elsewhere. I’ve attached a photo of their customer service line (which made us stand in line for HOURS just to say there was no option but land home at 10pm the following night MAYBE). Imagine, due to no safety concern or fault of your own, you’re now spending the night and wasting a day in the airport because American doesn’t know how to be a company."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,A funeral and good bye missed,From 7:45pm to 10:53 my flight was changed shuffled delayed and then cancelled. And then they couldn’t even get me on a flight to make the funeral.  Disappointed and disgusted with the whole situation because they said the pilot was fatigued… so why not lead with that instead of changing our flights that many times. Give us the option to fly else where? It’s frustrating because in the end they couldn’t even help get me there on time for the funeral it was late and everything booked.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Where is the compassion,My daughter(15) flying alone back from St Martin.  She arrives 15 minutes before plane leaves and America will not let her on the plane. Can’t imagine a human being telling a 15year old that they can not get on flight and need to stay in Charlotte by themselves until they can get on a plane .  Just awful. .
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Honeymoon Trip of a lifetime..... or not,Literally have never been so disrespected by anyone.  We are flying half way across the world and the desk lady forced us to check our bags with no notice we are forced to carry all our belongings in our lap while we take flights over 24hrs.  If you have any other option besides flying this airline please take it.  What a way to start a honeymoon out.  The gate lady couldn't care less about us or our destination.   Worst decision ever to use this airline.   If I could give 0 stars I would.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,One star for consistency!,"There isn't an option to give no stars, so I'll settle for one because, well, at least they're consistent. Consistently the worst flying experience of a lifetime, that is. My first time flying American, I swore I'd never fly with them again because of poor customer service costing me hundreds of dollars and days of my time. But, several years later I decided to give them another try simply out of convenience of flight times and relatively low cost. I figured nothing could be worse than my first time. But boy, did they prove me wrong on this one! Twelve hours, an extra $600, and one condescending customer service representative after another, I finally made it to my destination...on a United flight. And what did American do in an effort to regain my trust? An email begging me to ""please give us another chance"" and a $50 flight voucher. Cute!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst customer service I ever experianced,"First let me say travelers beware. American Airlines will leave you stranded offering no help, options, food or compensation. In short on our leg from Phoenix to Regan National where the plan was a connecting flight to Providence.   Our flight from Phoenix  to Reagan was 6 minutes late. American claims due to weather in Phoenix. The excuse was a simple get out of jail free card. We asked a number of times let the connecting flight know we are going to be a few minutes late to hold the plane. Now lets get something right I know you cant hold a plane that has other connections as it turns into a ripple affect.  however this plane/flight to Providence was completing its day in Providence.  The result no harm done if it was 8 minutes late getting into Providence.. Okay so the plane left. and now we needed American's help to get us home.  This is where the American staff at Reagan in my opinion is the worst trained customer service team I have ever seen across all industries, they told us no flight tonight, no room compensation, no travel compensation, no flight the next day, no car rental you  are on your own figure it out. the result I had to rent a car drive from Washington DC to Rhode Island 8 hours in the middle of the night after  flying all night. Dangerous!  The result American wont refund the last leg of the flight not their issue,  the rental car, the rental car gas, and the extra day parking at PVD.  I advise everyone never take this airline. avoid it at all cost. pay extra to take another airline. As an company American Airlines cares nothing about the passenger.  Lastly besides my wife and I they left at least 6 other passengers  stranded.  I will say they gave us one option we could sleep in the airport from Friday until Monday when maybe a flight was an option.  Way to go American Airlines customer service at it worst!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Would not recommend this airline.,"Hello to whom this may concern. This Airline switched my bordering gate 3 times since arivial at the connecting flight location in Dallas international airport. So altough I got to my layover location in dallas 10 hours ahead of time I had to switch bording gates 3 times. So naturally the 3rd time I was frustrated and I asked the airline gate employee if this was going to be the last time to witch she responded that she did not know and that I should hurry up before my flight leaves me. Apon getting to the correct gate I was told to hurry by the new gate employee. So I responded by telling her how is it my fault that the airline decided to switch up the gate last min. Mind you I have been at the air port for 10 hrs at this point. So naturally I explained to this women airline worker that it is not my fualt the airline decided to switch 20 gates over makeing me late to the gate. She didnt care and threaten me saying she could prevent me from boarding. Then when I fianlly get to the plane and my seat. It is taken by other people not only my seat by the seat of my partner. So then I ask a near by captain of the plane whats going to happen. His reponse was ""idk I dont deal with the important things back here."" Then a flight attendant comes by. By this time the people sitting in my seats have heard me complain and what not. So they move to thiere actuall seats. So when they flight attendant actaully gets there she asks what my seats were and then proceeded to make fun of me by telling me a ""crisis averted the seats are empty."" Witch was enormously uncomfortable for me and my partner. All in all will never fly amreican airlines again. Would not recommend to anyone. Just spend your money elsewhere."
Date of travel: June 2021,30,"Terrible from Burlington, Vermont","We fly American frequently and have always been treated well until this trip. When we went to check in for flight 5057, we had two bags to check. Because I have an Aadvantage credit card, we can check two bags free for two passengers. The agent told me it would be $50 to check the bags. I reminded her about the credit card (which shows up on her computer screen) and she backed down in the charge. I asked if we could be moved to bulkhead and again she wanted to charge us. We are both using mobility scooters and this service has always been offered to us and we have been told that the airline holds these seats for people like us. Perhaps she was going to put the money in her pocket. After we got through TSA where they checked the scooter thoroughly, but never checked me, an AA employee approached us and had moved us to the bulkhead seats. When we landed in Washington, D.C. to change planes, they refused to bring our scooters to us as required until much arguing and convincing that if gate checked, as they were, they had to be brought to us at the next gate. Again we were refused bulkhead seating and had n extremely difficult walk using a cane and holding onto seats to get to row 13. Flight attendants were very pleasant. Scooters were brought to the gate in Nashville. At baggage claim one bag was missing. Reported it and it was located in Washington, D.C.  It was finally delivered to our home three days later. Not a good experience."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Airline experience for myself and over a dosen others.,"Like many of the people around me from all over the united states, we all are having the worst experience with american airlines. Lost baggage, canceled flights for no reason, stranded at the airport, you name it. Don't fly this airline"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst airlines ever!,"American Airlines is hands down the worst airlines service ever. I am a disabled person with a prosteitic. I flew from okc city to Dallas and then was suppose to fly to Las vegas. On the flight from okc city they had placed me in an issle seat witch is impossible for me to sit in with a prostetic. I cannot bend metal witch is what my prosteic is made of. So it was sticking out in the issle some. I had previously asked to me moved to a seat where I wouldn't be in the isle the first flight accommodated me no problem. The second flight refused to move me. I had latterly 32 people smash my leg with either their luggage or foot coming down the isle witch ended up breaking my prostetic. I had 3 attendants come speak to me witch I had to explain to them about my prostetic. A customer came down the issue cussing and threatening me the called a manage and removed me from the flight. Since they broke my prostetic I had to be taken out in a wheelchair. They left me in the lobby for 2 hours while they discuss what to do. Then they wheeled me down to the badge place and left me. This was 1030pm by now and in Dallas fort worth airport and I live in okc city oklahoma. My baggage was sent to las vegas so that was a whole other mess. I eneded up having to pay an ubet $1,172.73 to drive me back to okc city. Upon spending 4 hours trying to get me a refund for my ticket since I never made the flight and they left me stranded they refused to do so. On top of all that bs when I checked my bank statement today american airlines made 2 charges to my account I did not authorize. I have spoken to friends and family about my experience and we have all decided to never again to any business with American airlines I want the world to know how they treat customers and the disabled at that."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,My AA Experience: Carson Krug (AA Hero),"Carson Krug is an AA Hero! Changed my 1 star to a 4 star for this company. Personally, he's a 5 star!!!!  Now here's my experience...This was my first flight with American Airlines. I expected more but got less. The seats and comfortability wasn't the greatest. The staff was just fine, nothing spectacular.  The returning flight was horrible! I think it's fair to say, equivalent to a nightmare.On the 12th, In Colorado Springs, we were told our plane would be delayed due to a fuel problem ( bad batch or no fuel)... So, we were to fuel up in Denver, however, there was no need to get off the plane.Most people, including me who had connecting flights, was in a confused and angry uproar. Personally,  I think I was more sad than angry.Okay, long story short, we missed our connecting flight in Fortworth, TX... We were told to call their customer service number, which was like, impossible to talk to a real-time agent.The other option was to stand in the longest line you've ever seen in your life.  There were at least, four attending AA agents.I stood in line for, what seemed hours, watching this one agent, out of the four agents... Work the mobility of the long line by himself!The other agents, seem to spend like 45 minutes to an hour on one customer... Crazy.At this point, you might be wondering, why I gave them a 4 star rating?Unbelievable, when it was my time (in line) to speak with the agent, the only guy moving the line... I told him all about our planes' fuel problem, which caused us to miss connections.He gladly printed my tickets for the next available flight... Giving us options for a couple of flights, if we needed more time to return, as not to miss our flight.(Of course, we took option #1, the first flight out/ less amenities, we were desperate to return, but the options were great)...He gave us a Taxi vouchers... Set us up, with a voucher to rest/wait at a beautiful 4 star hotel in Dallas! And a voucher for airport meal accommodations.I requested his name, because he had miraculously turned my nightmare into a success story.  I told him, because of his work ethics, professionalism and caring heart... He'd just made a  remarkable "" turn-around"" on my thoughts about this airline.Yes, great associates, are the reputation, the ""foot soldiers"" and beating heart of  any worthy Airline. I only wish AA could make carbon copies of this guy!  His name is Carson Krug at the DFW location. He reversed my challenging experience. Thanks AA for hiring such a great guy.Hero:  Carson Krug"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Stay away from this airline,Every time I have booked with AA the flight has been delayed or cancelled.   I can see why they are losing money.   Customer service sucks and I will never use these losers again.   You can’t count on them to get you where you PAID to be so why use them.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Don’t do it,"By far the WORST airline ever in terms of customer relations, had an emergency cancellation, and they do NOT want to refund me my money back. Think twice before buying a flight with them. It’s been 6 months of constant back and forth and still no help, had to dispute my bank to get my money back. HORRIBLE"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Damaged my luggage and won't take responsibility.,Recently few on American Airlines for a work trip. When I picked up my checked bag at my destination I found they had ripped the sewn on compression strap off my luggage. The bag was fairly new and in great shape until AA baggage handlers got a hold of it.  I pointed it out the baggage agent and he shrugged his shoulders. I later filed a claim online for damaged baggage and AA denied it and said it is a manufacturers defect and they won't take responsibility. In addition the check in computers at the AA counter were all down and the line was backed up because everyone had to be checked in at the counter. Defiantly would fly with another airline.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible,"My experience with American Airlines over the last two months has been nothing short of exhausting. I booked a flight for a work trip and then a few months later left that company.  I called AA to cancel said flight and book two tickets for an upcoming flight which would result in leftover credit from the original trip. I was never sent a confirmation that the original flight was cancelled, or record of my trip credit. It took 3 calls over the course of 4 weeks to even confirm that our tickets had been booked, as each rep told me the previous rep did not press the right keys, but now they were booked, only to find invalid record locators for our flights. The night before our flight it appeared that our seats had disappeared. After a 4.5 hour call at 10pm, with the rep hysterically laughing that our flight no longer had seats and she could not use our credit, we finally figured out our tickets. Now, I am trying to book flights with the remaining balance and it has been next to impossible. I spent 2 hours on the phone with a rep this morning trying to find my flight credit with an email I received on June 1 (finally) listing my trip credit number. Even though my email was received on June 1 and noted that it was issued on June 1, I was repeatedly told that was invalid credit and was issued and used on May 20th. Not accurate. Finally I was reissued a travel credit and assured it would be an easy booking process when I called back. Here I am, on hold again for 30 minutes now because the rep cannot find the new credit number they issued or the travel credit at all. This process has not only been a gigantic waste of time (at least 12 hours on the phone at this point) but also infuriating that the errors and mistakes of AA’s booking process have become my own massive problem"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,American is horrible,This is the worst airline I have ever been on. They screwed up my flight on the way up to Vermont which resulted in us having to drive 16 hours to get to our destination. Now on the way back they had a last minute malfunction which results in our flight getting delayed and us missing our connection. So now since American Airlines is so oblivious to the problems that there plane has we have to drive all the way. Thank you American😐
Date of travel: July 2021,10,never fly american,my flight up they held us for mechanical issues and missed my connection and had to drive 16 hours. the flight down they held us because the sinks won’t work and now have to drive again. i will not be flying on this airline again. i do not recommend at all. bad service.

This poor woman was just asking a question and the response was CLT, oh I would never connect here....this came from a stewardess.   Then when I ran what seemed like a mile the plane was not full at all and I asked.very nicely move seats....answer was extremely rude. No...No smiles, very few thank you.... not the American airlines I knew in years past..."

Who does pretzels anymore. Take your own food for sure!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible customer service,"Flight kept us in the air for 2 extra hours before rerouting to Charlotte NC. They gave zero explanation of why we weren't arriving, until they decided to reroute us. There were zero reports of any other flights not coming into Indy on time. By the time we arrived in NC it was 1am. They told us all that we may get to leave for Indianapolis at 9am, but that it might be earlier or later. They wouldn't provide any accommodations and we were all trapped in one terminal, with no food or shops open. They told us to just keep checking the flight updates often and informed us that if we leave to sleep, eat, smoke, walk dog... we wouldn't be allowed back through security for 4 hours. They litterally wanted us to all stay in two gates and just wait for information all night and morning.Truly terrible customer service all around. I will go back to always flying AK or Delta, because they have never treated me like this."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Lost luggage / bad customer service,"I was on vacation from 02JUL21 - 11JUL21 to propose to my girlfriend. I had planned outfits and things to do while on vacation. I to cancel everything and change up the proposal at the last minute. Months of planning occured for AA for royally mess up my plans to the point where I do not want to fly with them ever again. American Airlines lost my bag on 02JUL21 when my flight from dallas, tx to greenville,sc was canceled. I was able to book a flight for Columbia,SC on 03JUL21. I asked numerous AA employees if my bag would follow me. They all said yes. I was rerouted to Columbia,SC on 03JUL21. I got to Columbia and my bag never showed up. I filed for a lost bag immediately. Again an AA employee said my bag should be found quickly. Again I was lied to. I went my entire vacation living off of lies by AA. Each phone call I was told my bag was at Dallas. No one could physically locate my bag. No knew what terminal my bag was even in. All they could tell me it was scanned at Dallas. Not one employee took the opportunity to go look for my bag. They all just said best of luck and hopefully you get it and hung up. To my knowledge my bag was sitting at Dallas airport from 02JUL-11JUL with no tracking. With 2-3 flights per day to my temporary residence not one person could deliver my bag to my temporary residence or even a nearby airport. I have flown AA for years and this is the most messed up trip I ever had. I had to file for my lost baggage and interim expenses which who knows when I will receive that money. My interim expenses were around $300 and the airlines lost my bag valued at $200 plus the $1200 in clothes i had in the bag. At this point AA should compensate me for my luggage and my flight because my vacation was completely ruined. Needless to say I will be waiting for my check from AA and letting everyone know my experience with AA. AA has yet to find my luggage to which we are going on two weeks now with no solution."
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Excellent,As usual DFW was busy and a little congestive. But the flight was very good to Biloxi. The travel back was very good. Gulfport has a much smaller airport.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Worst Airline,","The worst  airline I have been on. 1. I was supposed to get help with wheel chair assistance and the guy just stood there had me waiting 45 mins. I kept telling him I need to get to my flight, the. When he finally push me he tried to push two people in the wheelchair at the same time. I ended up missing my flight because of him. Then they change my ticket and I had to fly to Chicago and then to VA. Soon as I got on the plane finally it was another 1 hr delay before we left. When I got to Chicago, the attendee gave me the wrong ticket I had to wait even longer on standby which resulted in me having to catch a even later flight at 1am because that one was filled. I was suppose to arrive in VA at 5:00 pm original and end up getting there at 2am in the morning. Terrible management  and workers, no one was helpful. they don’t care about your concerns at all. That is my last time I will ever ride on this airline again. Date of travel: July 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdviso"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Hold times are terrible,Booked a flight in 2020  and had to change it due to COVID.  I called and waited on hold for two hours.  l understand that call centers are overwhelmed and I get it. But then I had to wait on hold for another two hours.  Four hours on hold is unacceptable.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,This airline is so awful,We were stuck in Miami going to and coming back. There always seems to be a problem. There is no one to help. You end up spending more on hotels and rebooking. Don’t book w them!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Never again,"Service in Mexico city is just horrible,  just go 4 hours early,  3 hours early is not enough time. Arrive DFW Airport at 2:50pm, about 20 minutes early,  waited on taxi way/runway for about 20 minutes,  got off plane went through customs,  the first bag didn't arrived until 4:11pm, my connection flight to Denver is at 4:35, no way to make that connection now, and have to drop bag off for connection to Denver then go through TSA again. Got to the gate at 4:26pm after running,  flight closed gate locked no attendant at the gate to help me. Went to help desk, they put me on new flight that leaves at 7pm. Arrived at terminal D from Mexico,  then go to terminal A , missed that flight,  now the new flight in terminal D. I had paid for my seats, 7a, they now have me in 29A, didn't even asked me for options on seating or that I paid.  The 7pm flight got delayed to 7:40pm, then to 7:50pm, then to 8pm. Then the gate was changed to terminal C. Got on the flight,  pilot said the plane has two flat tires. It will take about 2 hours. About an hour or so later, they said they have a new plane at the gate next to us. Waited until about 10:45 to start boarding. Finally made it to Denver 2 hours later. That's my experience."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Trash,"We boarded the plane only to be taken back off the plane due to an employee that was on another flight running late. Why is a company wasting everyone else's time waiting on THEIR EMPLOYEE. You're an airline company, put them on another flight. Unacceptable. Wouldn't recommend."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst treatment at the air port,Military members stay away!!!!!!!The worst costumer service I've ever gotten in my life Horrible under orders I had to go visit my husband in a deployment after haven't seen in him in almost a year!!! I get to the counter top giving all my paper work because south Korea has spacial rules A guy named Ron helping me and not listening to a word I'm saying to not process me through a civilian way but a military rule Goes to the back instead of listening to what me and my husband are trying to tell him BTW my husband went through it with delta and they listen and fixed it right away qith good customer service I'm super stress telling him why is he being rude to me and he just give my paper works back telling me I'm done here Just undeliverable rude rolling his eyes at me to other people hunilait me instate of doing his job Never going to fly American airline again in my life and will make sure to recommend every one I know not too espacially military members
Date of travel: July 2021,10,NO support at American Airlines,"St Kitts issued a travel advisory, the Marriott St Kitts cancelled my hotel room due to Covid.  I had booked a Basic Economy flight on American and then purchased my seats on a separate date.  American will not offer a credit or any support in switching my ticket telling me I bought a non-refundable flight.  They told me they cannot help me.  I was STUNNED that this company would take this stance!  I asked to speak to a supervisor and they told me I had to send an email to the AA customer relations.  I've sent at least 5 emails and no one responds!!!! Awful, buyer beware!  Basic Econonmy = discrimination toward people buying fares they can afford."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible Customer Service in Charlotte NC,"Let me start by saying I will NEVER use American Airlines on my own dime!! I felt unappreciated, undervalued as a paying customer and most importantly as a human being. Flight 1612 had several different maintenance delays followed by weather delays causing me to miss my connection home. Before I left Norfolk VA I was promised that I would be put in a hotel in Charlotte due to the original maintenance issue of my flight. Once arriving in Charlotte close to midnight I went to retrieve my voucher for a hotel. I spoke with Sharon who informed me that I was not eligible for a voucher due to my plane having weather issues. I stated to her my plane had maintenance issues followed by weather....this fell on deaf ears. Her Supervisor Mr. Marcus walks up and before even hearing my story (the customer) he sided with her. While looking at my flight information they put a note once I arrived that my flight had a weather delay. I then called American Airlines 1800 number and spoke with a representative who while in front of Mr. Marcus said the notes in the system states my flight had 9 maintenance delayed notices starting from 1503 until 1757. Even after hearing the lady and me continually asking questions I was in so many words pushed to the side, ignored, belittled, and treated as if my concerns were not important. Customer service representative, manager are the titles these people hold and should go above and beyond to ensure customers are satisfied and needs are met. If you don't like your profession then maybe it's time to move on. American Airlines boost of being the trend setters and being the largest airline but barely touch a average rating due to improper communication, poor customer service, training, low standards to name a few. American Airlines you have to do better !!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst airline,"Possibly the worst airline I have been on. 1. I was supposed to get help with wheel chair assistance and never did and they gave me the wrong seat the first flight. 2. Terrible management they don’t care about your concerns at all. That sill be my last time I will ever ride on this airline again. Also, slightly damaged my suitcase."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,AA Vacation and Flight Changes,"Have not traveled yet -- this is what has transpired.  I will try to make a very long saga as short as possible.  I originally booked an AA Vacation package to NYC for a 4-day trip, COVID hit, rebooked, trip postponed again, all travel put on hold.  Rebooked roundtrip, business class to Rome and return.  Had to book 3 days before cruise because of AA Vacation requirements.  After two flight changes I received a notice that my flight was changed a third time, this time just the type of aircraft.  When I went online to make sure I had the seat I reserved, there was no seat assigned to me and no business class seats available.  I called, was told oh, sorry, we will have to put you on a different flight.  They could keep me on the flight I had in coach, which was not acceptable as I fly business for specific reasons.  To keep departure from Rome and arrival into Phoenix about the same due to my daughter and her friend being on the original flight I had, I had to book British Airways.  To get a business class seat on their flights that would avoid having someone step over me or my having to step over someone else, I paid right at $200 to pick my seat. Well today I check online and my original flights are for sale again on AA with business class seats available.  I called, thinking they would put me back on my original flight.  But oh no, I was told that I was the ""lowest class"" of business class and I would have to pay the difference because they only had the ""upper class"" available.  Talk about being made to feel like a second-rate citizen!!!I have been flying American Airlines for as long as I have been taking trips (and that is a long, long time) ... but I will find other airlines to fly from now on.   Why is it that I have to pay some $3000 extra to get on a flight in the class that I originally paid for because AA decided to change the type of aircraft and not give me a seat, but now that they have seats available, I'm ""lower class"" and cannot be put on that flight.  It is not like there is a section of business that is different or offset from the rest of the cabin.  Total disrespect for customers by the people I spoke with today.  I have other trips in the works and will find other airlines to fly to points either inside or outside the U.S.  I may use my AA FF miles to fly into a connecting airport to fly other airlines.  It will be worth the effort of having to pick up my luggage and recheck just to fly on an airline that treats its customers with some respect.  Now my biggest decision is whether to cancel the AA credit cards I have, because I have no desire to bump up my FF miles with them."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Stuck on tarmac for hours,"Chose AA on a late notice flights over my normal (Delta)…. Huge mistake, been stuck on tarmac over mechanical issues and people on the flight completely expected it. Friggin nonsense"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Seriously, Spirit is more accommodating than this terrible airline","The seats were extremely uncomfortable and tiny- the same size as a spirit or frontier flight. Very little leg room available. Windows didn’t match up with the seats so there was a big bump out on our window seat. The staff were incredibly rude and irritable. We were supposed to attend a wedding in Hawaii that got cancelled due to covid. AA refused to refund us and gave us vouchers only available for 2021. I gave birth in February so traveling with a 4 month old was not easy. But if we didn’t use the tix we would have wasted $1,000 worth of tickets. They were not understanding of our situation and wouldn’t even extend our deadline knowing we’d be having a baby. We hate hate hate this airline."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible flight attendants and ticket check in,"Our first flight out of Dallas Fort Worth to Boston was delayed due to mechanical.  Over an hour after our flight was suppose to take off we were told we had to move to another terminal totally across the airport.  Rushed over to the new terminal to find out our new flight was also have mechanical issuers.  The people at the countertop making the announcements was not saying it clearly or loud enough so not everyone could hear.  I had walked up to the countertop from the bar area across from the gate and asked her what she said and her response was “you don’t have a mask on I can’t talk to you” with an ignorant tone.  I honestly stood up in a path to find out when I was getting back to Boston and  didn’t think to grab my mask.   I understand flights have not been the easiest lately but honestly that doesn’t mean you treat everyone like crap.  Some have been in the airport for hours waiting for flights and all we wanted was an clear update.   When I got on the flight, a passenger brought it to a flight attendants attention someone needed help and he gave her attitude too.  All she was doing was bringing it to his attention to get the other passages on fast so we can get out.  Well then another  flight attendants is on the speaker saying they are waiting for a final inspection and meals before we could take off.  At the end of her speech she stated if they didn’t pass inspection we would all need to get off the flight.  Ugh.  I have never seen so much ignorance.  I will never fly American Airlines again."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Very good flight experience,"American Airlines Flight 1401PHL-FLL7:00 am-9:45 am Boeing 737-800I recently took this flight with my family and service dog on a trip to South Florida, and I was very happy with the experience on American. We had originally booked a flight with Spirit on the same route that day, but after an issue with seating that came up less than 24 hours before departure, we ended up cancelling that flight last minute and booking this flight instead. This flight ended up having the perfect timing to get us where we needed to be in a pinch, and even with last minute fares, the price wasn’t bad (actually less than we had paid on Spirit with all fees included).When I booked the flight on less than 24 hours’ notice, there were no standard seats left to choose in economy, but I did see that there were five Preferred seats together for our group (i.e., seats closer to the front that don’t have extra legroom, but usually cost extra). I was prepared to pay for those seats if needed, but decided to chance it and see if they’d be assigned to us for free during online check-in, and they were. The system put us automatically in the exact row I was hoping for, where we had a full row of three seats and two more across the aisle. Since we were flying with a service dog for the first time, it was important to us to have a row just to ourselves, so we wouldn’t have to bother other passengers in any way. I also had to contact AA before our flight regarding our service dog. Although she was previously approved for our flight home that was always going to be on American, and AA had issued her a service dog ID that is valid on any flight for a year, I needed to get them to attach it to this new reservation. The wait times on hold for the special services desk were almost two hours that day, but I eventually got through. They were very nice, and added the information right away. I appreciated that even on short notice, my service dog could be added to the reservation with no issues.We arrived at Philadelphia Airport about 90 minutes before the scheduled 7:00 am departure. Since parking in the airport garages at PHL has gotten very full lately with the economy lot still closed, we had to budget some extra time for parking, but we got a spot easily enough by looking on higher levels of the garage. The flight was departing from Terminal A-East, so we made our way to the A-East check-in area, which is a bit smaller than American’s counters in other terminals. There was a decently long line of people waiting for full-service check-in, while many of the self-service kiosks were open. Since we just needed to check bags, I tried to use the kiosk. However, when an employee saw that we had a service dog, she told me that we would be unable to check-in there and had to wait in the full-service line because of the dog. This actually went against what the special services desk had told me, which was that no special check-in for the service dog was required, since we had her fully pre-approved. However, not wanting to make an issue of it, we went over and waited in the long full-service line. There were only a couple of agents working the standard check-in line that morning, and it seemed that every group ahead of us was having a major issue/transaction. No one seemed to know how to pack or pay for bags, and several groups that were taking trips to the Caribbean were creating a backup while the staff members very slowly checked their necessary paperwork, Covid tests, etc. for their destinations. Even with those added steps, service was moving at a snail’s pace. It would have been nice if they had thought to re-allocate staff to help move the line along, since they had at least three staff members at bag drop, who mostly appeared to be standing there doing nothing. Once we finally got to the front of the line, we were able to get our bags checked quickly and the agent asked for our service dog paperwork, which I had a copy of for her to review. Seeing no issues, we were sent on our way.Security at Terminal A-East was easy with no real line. It was disappointing to see that the separate Precheck lane was closed, but for those of us with Precheck, we were given a pass allowing us to keep our shoes on. They did still make us remove all electronics from our bags, which is not usually required with Precheck.There had been thunderstorms and pouring rain in the area the entire night before and the day of our flight, so we were nervous about potential delays or cancellations (lots of flights were cancelled due to weather that morning), but the flight boarded right on time. It was a full flight, and had the standard chaotic process with everyone rushing the gate to board with their group. It also didn’t help that it was hard to hear the announcements for each boarding group. The aircraft ended up having extra-large overhead bins that easily fit everyone’s carry-on bags with plenty of space, so there was no need for the rush to get on and get overhead bin space. I’ve heard gate agents announce this information before, which could have been helpful here. When we boarded, the flight attendants were very nice and commented on how cute they thought my dog is, which I appreciated.We left the gate a couple minutes early, quickly took off, and generally had a smooth and uneventful flight to Fort Lauderdale. In addition to the liking the large overhead bins, I generally found the Boeing 737-800 aircraft to be well-designed, even though I know it was the newer Oasis configuration that many people don’t like. I liked that every seat in economy had both full outlets and USB plugs for easy charging during the flight, and the phone/iPad stand at the top of the seat came in handy as well. Legroom in the standard economy seats was tight, especially with a service dog at our feet, so I’d probably pay for Main Cabin Extra seats with extra legroom in the future with a service dog.Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and the time until arrival.As the flight went on, I was surprised that no food or beverage service was being offered, since American had brought it back on flights we had been on in the spring. However, pretty close to the end of the flight, the flight attendants finally came around with the drink cart, offering full cans of soda, or juice or water, in addition to a choice of pretzels or Biscoff cookies. I’m not sure what delayed them in coming around for service, but they were very nice and even offered our dog some water, which was thoughtful.The flight attendants did make the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and I didn’t see any non-compliance from passengers. I didn’t like, however, that the pilot also came on with his own mask announcement that felt politically charged. He heavily implied that he doesn’t think masks should be required, and basically told everyone to do what they wanted as long as we’re “nice to each other and stay off the news.” He should just have been reading the standard announcement that had been prepared for him to deliver. It’s unprofessional and uncomfortable when things take a political turn from the pilot.We ultimately arrived at our gate in Fort Lauderdale a few minutes early, and luggage was available in a pretty standard amount of time at baggage claim. We’ve definitely had luggage come out more quickly, but it was far from noteworthy in a bad way either. Overall, this flight from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale was good. I appreciated how nice the flight attendants were, which really helped with any nervousness we had about flying with our service dog for the first time. We left on time, arrived on time, and were on an AA aircraft with basic features that we appreciated."

Date of travel: July 2021,20,AA Never Again!,"My wife and I along w/ 3 others traveled from BWi to DFW. a layover supposed to be 3 hours turned into 6 plus hours.  There was an issue w/ the plane, but we were not kept up to date, the people at the desk had no clue and you could barely understand them when they did speak.  First off, I should mention, has AA made the rows smaller?  It was so tight on these planes, it made it uncomfortable to stand.  When we landed in Dallas we were delayed on the runway for 40 minutes, after about 30 minutes the Captain finally spoke to update us.  The girl behind us was connecting to S. Korea and instead of them announcing when we got to the gate, please only allow those to get off for connecting flights, it was a madhouse to get off the plane.  We were then again delayed on our return home from Charlotte to BWI again without explanation!  Our flight was to take off at 3pm, we ended up taking off at 4:45pm, unacceptable.  My first and last time flying w/ AA unless they make this right and if they even care!"
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Trip ftom Hell,"Recent trip from Dallas to Honolulu on American Airlines, flight #1189 on 7/13 was a trip from Hell.  Paid first class for service and comfort, but received no choice of meal requested by both my husband and myself. Food tasted awful and we were not served together...had to ask for my wife's food to come out do we can eat together on every service. The Purser of the flight, a Stephanie, was so slow like molasses and seemed to care about making conversations with other crew members than taking care of her first class customers. Never offered a fresh refreshment drink with meals...everything has to be asked of her.Top that with this customer with 2 young kids that screamed and whined non stop and was never reprimanded to stop running full speed up and down first class aisles. The Purser should have not allowed this disturbance from 2 kids that disrupted the entire first class. Such poor service and lack of concern on your staff that we will take our future flying back to Delta!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst airline company ever. (In my opinion).,"Before I left on my trip, many people asked me what airlines I would be flying. I went from LAX to Peru then Panama to Cancun then Phoenix to Ontario. For this trip I used 3 different airlines a mixture of price and convenience. EVERY person I told American Airlines to (AA) said “they’re horrible”. I asked why. Almost every response was “they always have delays”. I don’t always take this data as face value. I will try things for myself, and then form an opinion. I kept my flights, didn’t change anything. I left Cancun Mexico, flying AA. I was able to upgrade my seat, very expensive but the flight was comfortable and everything went smooth. They mentioned a promotion about their credit card to earn flying miles immediately. I did not take the offer on my first flight, but I was seriously considering getting it on this next flight. I was going to make American Airlines my primary source of flying. I land in Phoenix Arizona, go through customs, hot foot to my terminal to catch my AA connected flight, and guess what… it’s delayed! My flight was supposed to leave at 7:20pm. Look at the time stamp on this review. It’s after 9pm. They have an estimated time of 10:45pm, but they can’t tell us an approximate time. Garbage. If management, or executives can answer these questions, who can? Insane! As a business owner, I can answer everything! As a traveler, I have had delays. I’ve just never seen a sure thing. If you want to win a bet, bet that American Airlines will be late. Will have delays. Will NOT be able to give straight answers. And no one will know anything. I’ve flown Latam, Delta, southwest, Volaris, United, Skywest and others. I WILL choose anyone of these over AA moving forward. Way to prove everyone right AA. I don’t blame the innocent men and women that work for this company. They were not in charge of it, and they don’t make calls. I one hundred percent blame Executives and Management. I am really upset that people I spoke with prior, were right. I enjoy proving people wrong, but in this case it makes it very difficult. My time is very important to me. It is the only thing I cannot get back. I can make more money, I can have more children, I can do many things. But I can’t get my most valuable asset back which is time. American Airlines does not Seem to care about this. I could be wrong. Let’s see if any upper management or executive has the courage to reach out to me and make this better. Obviously I am not investing in the American Airlines credit card anymore. PS… The photo I have attached this has changed three times."
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Nice meal service in first class: a SANDWICH!!!!,"Well, the bean-counter consultants have been doing their homework and found yet a few more ways to wring the profits in their favor.  You get what you pay for and apparently these bean-counters are making money for everyone who is a stock owner.  On our first-class flight, we got a truly welcome turkey sandwich on our first leg (just about 3 hours, only 2-3 minutes short of 3 hours).  We remember when we would have gotten a ""meal"" in times long gone.  But the bean-counters found a way to tighten the corporate belt.On our second leg of our flight, we got a mini-microscopic bag of 5 small chips and a small bag of almonds.  We flew both ways on a  A321 (return home on a newer stripped version A321) without all the extras we enjoyed on the earlier version.  No screen (BYO)  so, thank heaven for the bean-counters!  They found yet another way to pinch those pennies until they (and us) squeal.Aren't consultants the best things ever?  Better to leave that nest of vipers where it is right now.  It isn't going to get any better for us travelers, post-regulatory times."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,DO NOT RECOMMEND,Do yourself a favor book with any other airline. Terrible service full with delays and no accommodations. Our flight got delayed 5 hours in Santo Domingo and the staff took 3 hours to reschedule our connecting flight and gave us no accommodations. The staff in Miami wouldn’t let us check our bags unless we provided our original receipt even though we gave her the printed one they gave us in Santo Domingo saying we paid. Then that flight got delayed 2 hours due to maintenance issues. I do not feel safe flying American Airlines and it is definitely unreliable.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Costumer Service,Most of the people don't help and they will call the cops if they are fed up with you. I highly advise people to not come to this airline if you are in a business trip.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,awful service,"if i could give this airline 0 stars i wouldI went to fly Sunday July 11 on a 735pm flight from BNA-CLT-BDL my first class ticket was cancelled 12 hours prior with no remaining options, leaving my husband and I stuck in TN, paying for another room, another parking day at BDL and missing work when we are both first responders.  I am traveling AA in November and my second change, third booking has happened. I am aware American is understaff due to lack of retraining and you will not as a company be caught up until about. a year but honestly your lack of retraining should not affect my trips back to back.I do not agree with a four hour change needs to be done before i am issued a refund, as an advantage member, a flyer and at times a first class ticket.  I do not agree with transferring me to a connecting flight where i can now drive home faster than flying. The understaffing & change of flights is AA’s error, not mine. The cancellation AA’s issue, This is the most issues I have ever had with any airline and again I understand you are understaffed but that’s not my error and no future flyer deserves this. book a different airline, they’re customer service and supervisors pretty much told me it’s not there issue and expect more changes. fly anything else."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible bag check,"Arrived at CMH 1.5 hours before flight boarding time. Had a special bag so needed to wait in line at ticketing to check bag. Line was extremely long. Most kiosks empty and understaffed. Literally every single person in the line had issues at ticketing. The line wait was so long it caused me to miss the bag check time and ultimately missed the flight. They put be on a standby flight for 4 hours later, the best they could do. I’m TSA Pre so got through security fast — airport wasn’t very busy overall. I went to my original gate 15 min before departure  to see if the plane was still there — it was. The line at the gate as more folks like me that had the same experience tried to get on the plane. They told us it was closed and wouldn’t let anyone on it. Looked like 10-15 travelers all missed their flight because Americans inefficient bag check process/flight issues. I was 100% unimpressed by their lack of empathy for their travelers and willingness to hold the plan foe even 5 minutes to let people get on. The estimated arrival time was ahead of schedule and they had time to spare. It was terrible service. Never had this happen in 15 years of business travel with other airlines. I’ll never fly American again — something I’ve heard many business folks say, and know I’m joining their ranks."

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Airline Ever,This was the worse airline experience I have had in 30 plus years. I was unable to get consistent answers. The check-in officers were rude and cut people off when speaking. The flight was delayed and there was no air conditioning for an hour. The baggage took more then 4 hours to come to baggage claim. This is the worst airline EVER! DO NOT FLY WITH THEM.

Layover in Charlotte as there were no direct flights to Newark nor LaGuardia 6 weeks before.Flight from Charlotte to Newark never went to Newark that night d/t weather.  Communication was poor.  They said we were ""circling"" (which to me means the airport you paid to get to), but they meant Baltimore, MD.  They had one person trying to help the whole plain figure out how to get to Newark.  No vouchers, no hotel stays paid for that was made aware to me or my family.  Went to get rental car bc hotels were booked.  Called American Airlines at 3 days, 7 days later and 8 days later.  First time I called they offered call back after 4 hours (may have happened, but not during regular waking hours (1 am if that was their 800 number).  The other two calls never got returned.  They did offer 15,000 miles for the passengers, but apparently can't find my contact info, even though they e-mailed it to me....

The flight was somehow delayed and we had no idea until we got to the next gate to catch the new flight for us to see the message “This gate is closed”, after being sent to customer service there was not much that they can do but they did give us a bad hotel to stay at.  The whole trip was a nightmare from going over there to coming back.  IF YOUR READING THIS I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU GO WITH A SAFER MORE CARING AIRLINE.  So many were having to stay as well bc of the whole mixup the airline was having.  If we were traveling bc of a different purpose I probably would have been a little more understanding but the fact that when I called customer service and told them my emergency they were so heartless.  My rate for you is a Zero."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Horrible Service, Worst airline Around","I had a flight from San Jose Costa Rica to Indianapolis with a connection in Miami. I had to go through customs and reclaim my bags before going to IND. My flight arrived at 8:04 with the next flight at 9:17. Got through immigration at 8:24. Bags didn't arrive until 8:56 and when I tried to re check them they said it was too late you and you can't make your flight. When I wen to customer service they said the next days flights are all booked up there was no way to get from Miami to Indianapolis for another day and a half. No refunds, not even a bag fee. I had to buy ticket on Delta for $600 to get home. When I called customer service the wait was 8 hrs to get a person. This is by far the worst airline ever. In the last few years I have slept in more airports because of AA than I care to have. Do not fly this airline. It is time to put this airline into bankruptcy and have someone else take it over."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delays and feeling unsafe with AA,"I cannot recommend flying with American Airlines! When I flew to El Paso and had to change flights in Dallas, the flight got pushed back again and again and was finally cancelled at Midnight. No explanation whatsoever. The hotel, they offered us, was downtown which was quite a drive especially because we had to be back at the airport at 5am.On my return flight it got even worse. The flight from El Paso to Dallas got delayed. When everyone was already on the plane they told us that the machine had „mechanical issues“ and they needed to get a mechanic now to check it. Even though it probably was nothing major - that does not make you feel safe!Of course, I missed my connecting flight after that. So, I was waiting in Dallas for almost 3 hours till the next flight was going to Washington DC. Then, boarding was almost completed when flight attendants told us that the plane was somehow broken and they „just recognised“ that! Again: not feeling very safe! How can you miss that a plane is not working?! When I asked for compensation - vouchers for food and drink - a flight attendant told me that’s not possible. The whole thing was a business trip and my whole schedule lapsed. So: if you can avoid going bei AA - do it!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Genuinely the single worst company i have ever had to deal with, and if it were up to me theyd be bankrupt.","Decided to fly from CT to NC, this was the flight expedia gave me, and i regret every second. For reference, it takes 14 hours to drive from CT to NC. I booked my flight 2 weeks in advance, and less than HALF A DAY before my flight they cancelled my flight and rescheduled me to the next day.... which was after the appointment i was traveling to go to. So, they refused to put my on a flight the day i paid money for, then when i tried calling american airlines to fix this, they put me on hold for TWELVE hours. Seriously, twelve f*cking hours to get off hold. Then they rescheduled the flight still too late. On arrival, i went to take the flight to find that the plane had an issue, and we left over 2 hours after takeoff. So, what wouldve been a 14 hour drive costing $150, turned into a $700, 2 day LATE flight. I paid these incompetent morons $700 to take 3 times longer to fly me than driving would take. I will never, ever support anything to do with this company, they should be shutdown for refusing to providr a service people PAY for."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,By by American,"Just a terrible experience. Making me check a small carry on citing, the ""overheads"" are full, when actually they were probably half empty.  Then the ""jack boot"" attendants start barking out orders and marching up and down the aisle making sure the ""non medical"" Chinese masks are on correctly. No water No peanuts and certainly No smiles. If you don't obey you will be removed. Their fake spin on customer service, and how good they are is just utter delusional.  I used to love to fly, traveling was usually such a good experience, even when things went wrong. I have flown millions of Global miles with many airlines and it's sad to see American Airlines hit a rock bottom low. I will not EVER fly them again."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,More Stressed than when I left for Vaca!!,"I paid for and reserved 2 First Class round-trip tickets from Newark Liberty Intl. Airport (EWR) to Maui, Hawaii (OGG). A dream vacation. When I purchased the tickets, I asked would I be able to use the American Airline Lounge as a 1st Class/Business Class flyer. The sales agent said ""Yes"". When I arrived at the lounge, the agent said, ""No"" the lounge is reserved for members only. Disappointed in the lie because we had 2-4 hour layovers between flights. It would have been nice. On the return flight to Newark International, the plane was diverted to Allentown, PA (ABE) due to thunderstorms. We sat on the tarmac (not at a gate) for 2 hours. Then the Captain announced, ""This flight is terminated."" Over. American Airlines dumped us in Allentown at 7pm. They did not offer a hotel or meal voucher or a trip voucher. Over. They did not offer to pay for a rental car so I could drive to my intended destination. They said that had buses to take us to EWR but no drivers.  They were looking for drivers. Over.They could not give us our luggage because the hatch was jammed. A mechanic was on the way. Over. I left to rent a car and drive home at 9pm without my luggage. It took 5 days to receive our luggage, delivered to my home in NJ.  American Airlines was bad. I didn't know how bad. There's got to be a much better way to travel and not end up more stressed than when I left for vacation."

It is so sad to see an airlines like “American Airlines” been so careless with their customers! So disappointed 😡😡 never AGAIN!!😡
Date of travel: June 2021,30,Cost-cutting and penny-pinching,"Over the years, American Airlines has cut back on nearly everything and the travel experience has beome more an exercise in trial and tribulation than it should be (or ever was).  For us, we hold the belief that economy-searching consultants are always coming up with ways to cut corners and return a higher profit for the board members and stock holders.We flew an A321 out and back but the flight back was a different model of A321 (newer one with fewer amenities, like screens for watching videos) and these two travel trips were very different experiences.Crackers, nuts and water on leg one (2 hrs. 22 min.) and a fruit & cheese plate on leg two (2 hrs. 45 min.)  Apparently (we assume), the ""consultants"" advised that food service of a ""meal"" wasn't required for the trip legs of these durations.  Fortunately for us, our layover at DFW allowed us time to go to the Centurion lounge where there was actually something resembling a ""meal"" available.  For us, this travel experience just felt like it had been so stripped down as to make it hardly worth the First Class/Priority price.  If given a chance, we'd much prefer flying on Delta."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst staff,"My family flew aa in July, on our departure flight my family sat in the very back of the plane. Our seats were right next to the cabin crew. I’d like to first say that I have never been on a flight where the flight attendants were so rude. While sitting waiting for our plane to leave we witnessed and heard some of the most vulgar language from the three flight attendants sitting in the back. The three flight attendants sat there and cursed infront of my three children(4,11 & 13), not only did they sit there and using disturbing language with zero regards to my children being there they also sat there and spoke badly about the pilots. Saying that the pilots job was easy as they just sit in the cabin in the cold AC while the flight attendants sweat their a** off, and continued to say that the pilots only care about not using their fuel and not about the cabin crew. If that wasn’t bad enough none of the flight attendants wanted to work and made that very clear to everyone aboard the plane. They sat and discussed how the front flight attendants weren’t doing their job and it wasn’t the back flight attendants job to pick up their slack. I at one point asked if a flight attendant could throw my soda away; she rolled her eyes and grabbed my can. Again I was appalled at what my family was witnessing. Our return flight was unfortunately the same! On our flight out before boarding the plane the front desk made sure my family of 5 where all able to sit together; this was done even without asking which was much appreciated! When we got to the aa desk to board our plane I asked if they could do the same and was told no they couldn’t as it was a full plane; however that the flight attendants could possibly help us once we boarded the plane. I found that odd because our departure flight was also a full flight! When we boarded the plane the flight attendant told us to just go to the back of the plane an take those seats and the other flight attendants can help re arrange people. So my family went to the back and sat, myself my 4 year old and 11 year old in one row and infront of us was my husband and my 13 year old. Everything was fine until a passenger came to sit in his seat which we were in. At this time the flight attendant came up and asked to see our tickets so I showed her them as she saying that we needed to sit in our seats. I explained to her that all of our seats are separated and not even close to one and other and that we were told by the flight attendant in the front to go to the back of the plane an take those seats. The flight attendant started to get upset and said well she’s wrong you can’t just pick where ever you want to sit and you need to sit in your seats. I explained to her I’m not going to sit my 4 year old in a seat by himself, nor my other children. Even after the gentleman offered to give up his seat, the flight attendant proceeded to send us to the front of the plane while everyone was still loading on. While walking up to the front another flight attendant stops us and asks what’s going on so I explained to her and she thank god was willing to help. Again I have never flown an airlines with such unfriendly flight attendants. Flying can be very stressful for some and especially those flying with children; I hope that aa can let their flight attendants know how important it is to have a friendly staff while flying as they are the face of the airlines!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Delays, delays delays","Delays after being at the airport for hours. Missed connecting flight due to delays.  No options, vouchers or hotel offered. While waiting in line told by gate attendants to call AA number since they didn't have up to date information....called number... told I could get a return call in 4 hours. On return flight, same thing again. Got a flight the next day with an 8 hour layover.  Never again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible,I have yet to enjoy a flight from American Airlines. And they have yet to actually make a flight leave or arrive on time. I have not had a single good experience with them in all 5 times that I have flown with them. I’ve missed multiple trips due to delays from them. From mechanical issues on planes to not having a gate when the plane lands. I have had to deal with multiple issues. Where the plane gets delayed because of they’re aircraft and staff.
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Customer.,"Unfortunately, flying from Washington - Reagan on American Airline was quite challenging. They  are profoundly understaffed from check -in to gate staff and the overworked staff is not shy about letting it be known ... can’t blame them, but, yikes, it is adverse.

I went the check in frantic by now and found all the seats were unavailable but you could purchase seats randomly . $38 $44 I asked the ticket counter about it they said it was preferred seating. Now thats a bunch of crap. Apparently a seat will be assigned to you when you get on the plane. REALLY!!!! $794 and I can't pick seat. They are nothing but a bunch of thieves. never again

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Used to be okay.  Now I'm done with them for good.,"I'm not a loyalist when it comes to airlines - just give me whatever is cheapest and most convenient. I'm still that way with one exception: avoid american airlines. 1. Canceling flights shortly before hand and trying to rebook them the next day2. Dont take care of their staff (see what happened during covid compared to the other airlines)3. Their customer service is laughably bad (examples: if you buy an upgrade on a specific flight, and they cancel that flight, in order to get a credit or refund you have to submit and online request, and its likely the online request won't work so you have to call them. Every time you call them its at least a 3 hour wait. One time they called me back and I waited on hold for ANOTHER HOUR for no reason. I think they make it hard on purpose to keep your money)4. Their planes get you there (if you can actually get on board), but aren't comfortable. Ive found Delta to be way better. Trying Frontier as another option soon."

Date of travel: July 2021,20,I've seldom been so angry,"I bought this flight on miles many weeks ago. Just as I entered the airport door at 7AM, I got the call: American canceled this flight. Then I got the notice that I had been assigned a new flight the same day. A bit later I was told the first flight, to LAX, was now so late that I wouldn't be able to catch t he second one to SFO, because THE CREW DIDN'T SHOW UP. I was too sleepy to think clearly and stumbled around the airport between American and United for the next 6 hours trying to get a flight to my friends' 50th wedding anniversary the next day. I finally found a flight on United. They suggested I go back to American and ask them to pay for it. American said they could not do that. United insisted they could. At the end of it all, I paid $350 for a new flight that American made necessary."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,AWFUL.,"I boarded my original flight on Friday at 2pm at ILM. We taxied out to the runway and had to sit for two hours on the plane due to the Charlotte airport being closed(I understand things happen and im not mad about it.) We flew the 33 MINUTE FLIGHT to Charlotte, and upon arrival we had to wait another hour for a gate which is totally fine. At this point I had missed my connection flight and had to book another one which departed at 845pm. When boarding time approached, it got delayed an hour. When boarding time approached, we were told the plane had mechanical problems and were directed to a new gate in which everyone went to. Our plane was delayed again and we got information that this new plane was also having problems and were sent to our third gate and delayed once again. It was 9 minutes until boarding and we were told someone had previously brought a large FISH on the cargo and it stunk up the cabin to the point we could not take this plane so we were sent to our FOURTH gate to board along with another delay. Once we arrived at the fourth gate, we visibly watched the flight crew board, two pilots and four flight attendants. They kept delaying us (without stating any reasons) all the way until our flight time was midnight. When midnight came, we looked at the screen and saw that our new flight time was at 6am. No one made an announcement and the gate agent left. We all got in the customer service line to get a hotel, and when we got to the front of the line we were told they had no hotels available AND IF WE LEFT THE AIRPORT WE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED BACK IN IN THE MORNING (even when TSA opened at 4am.) They gave us a $12 food voucher (only redeemable at the CLT airport) but nothing was open nor would it be before our plane departed the next morning. I was left with no other option but to stay at the gate overnight, along with most of the other passengers from the flight. I went to C8 to go and get my new boarding pass for the flight that I PAID FOR. The attendant was too busy looking at her phone and talking to be focused on her job and when she gave me my new boarding pass, it had another persons name on it, when I told her she said ""oops I just put someone that was in standby in your seat and there are no more available for that flight"" I was put on standby and given a ticket for the 9am flight and never once was apologized to for her lack of attention to the task at hand. The vending machines were empty, the stores and bars were closed, leaving us with no food or water or anyway to get it. As a young teenage girl flying alone, the airport is a scary place at night, I was followed by an older man and interrogated and questioned by him to the point a family that was flying as well realized and welcomed me into their group just to keep him away from me as well as to PROTECT ME, something American Airlines and their employees failed to do. This is far beyond unacceptable. I understand being delayed and having things happen but we were not even allowed the luxury of an explanation or a solution, something other airlines always do. I was not compensated, and instead was charged EXTRA without being notified. The next morning, after lying on the floor overnight, I went to the gate agent and explained my situation and he was the first person to care as he put me on the flight in my original seat. I was never once offered compensation, never once given any ounce of any customer service as every employee seemed to hate the fact that they were there. This is unacceptable American. It is not only happening to me, I have family friends that were left stranded as well. I will never fly american every again."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Stress - Just When I Needed It Least,"We had 45 minutes to make our connecting flight in Dallas.  We spent 20 minutes on the ground waiting for a gate assignment. We spent 10 minutes at gate waiting for ground crew to wave us in.  When we boarded we were told that overhead storage was limited because of size of plane, so majority of passengers had to check our carry-ons at the gate.  The American employee who handled our bags when we landed was disrespectful and abrupt.  I only made our connection because my daughter ran to the next concourse and I arrived with 2 minutes to spare.  We were headed to a funeral and this experience was very stressful and exhausting.  I understand about reduced staffing and other issues, but I will never fly American again!"

I had 3 hours to then get to Phoenix for my conneting flight and called ahead to let them know I had a pet flying with me.  All was good until check in to receive my boarding pass.  There is only 1 line with American to check in with pets, which cannot be done at the kiosk only with an agent.  I waited in 3 lines for over 30 minutes and then was told my flight was closing the doors and they would not let me on.  No calling them to let them know I was here and coming that way, no TSA pre check for security, just nope not going.  Then they said we can get you a flight for 7PM but cannot guarantee you will be on it as it is standby only, I was checking in at 8AM to leave.  Needless to say I missed my daughter's baby shower for my new grandson and have never been treated so poorly by staff at an airline in my life!

Date of travel: July 2021,10,My daughter was traveling to see us by herself and her 4 month old because Ryan is deployed.  He is a green beret.,"My daughter Lauren came to visit us in Dallas,  She was alone traveling with a 4 month old  b/c Ryan is deployed overseas.  We called and asked about all restrictions, including strollers.  Flying here was great.  She was able to take the stroller and check it at the gate plane when she was boarding her plane.  We take her this morning and go in with her to help her with her checked luggage.  We get up to the ticket counter and check her suitcase and the lady said she would have to check the stroller.  Lauren was in tears because she has 2 diaper bags, a harness to put him in and was diagnosed at 10 with scoliosis.  The only reason she was by herself is because Ryan is overseas serving OUR country.  We get in the line and notice that there are bigger strollers than the one they made us check.  I have Chris stay with Lauren and go back to the ticket counter and demand to see a supervisor.  It takes forever.  She finally shows up and doesn't give a crap.  Sorry she said I didn't get to see the stroller.  She said that if it is over 20 pounds they have to check it.   I told her that the lady didn't even weigh it.  This is a $800 stroller and is very light weight. One of the reasons we bought the stroller was because of her back.  She said if we had called ahead of time we could've gotten a buddy pass.  WE DID CALL ahead!!  They never told us that she couldn't have the stroller and NEVER offered a buddy pass.  Then to top it off Lauren is crying and trying to keep it together and by the time we had talked to the supervisor for nothing and had waited in line to go through security she had to get in line to board.  Then the lady at the ticket counter was SO Rude to her because she was trying to get her pass on her phone and said you will need to move to the side if you don't have your pass.  WTF?????  Can you NOT see that she has a baby, 2 diaper bags, and has already been crying???   Oh it gets better.  When she lands and gets to baggage claim the stroller isn't there!!  Everyone has gone from her flight.  Lauren calls me crying and I tell her to go to a customer service area for AA.  So, she has to drag her checked luggage, 2 diaper bags and a her baby over to a little CS area.  She just breaks down and cries and has to wait while the guy goes and finds her stroller.  Social media, CHECK!  I will put this on every website I can find until someone calls me back.  NEVER in a million years have I seen worse customer service.

Bookaahotels.com never notified the hotel about my cancellation so I was charged $204 for a cancellation fee by the Hilton.

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst airline with the worst customer service,"Terrible,  inconsiderate,  left people stranded due to lack of crew members. Checked in at 6:15 pm with no problems and by 9 pm got a message the flight was canceled for our departure the following day. They lacked assistance, and could not even promise us a flight for the following day which was still unacceptable when you count on getting home with elderly travelers and children. We would have had no where to sleep for an extra day and the car rental for an additional day would have cost us more money. Never , ever fly with American airlines again. Who leaves an entire flight of people STRANDED? CLOSE YOUR BUSINESS AND TAKE THE LOSS, AMERICAN AIRLINES SHOULD SHUT DOWN AFTER THIS DISASTER.ALL THEY COULD SAY WAS SORRY, SORRY DOESN'T CUT IT. WHAT IF YOU NEEDED TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL AND TO ONLY FIND OUT THE STAFF DECIDED BOT TO SHOW UP? TERRIBLE..ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SERVICE AND NO CONCERN FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS"

Yes, flights were both delayed, due to weather, OK.  Flagship Lounges were all closed due to COVID, OK.  Service was pleasant.  Seat on the transatlantic was a full flat bed and wonderful.   Pictures speak a thousand words and the slop they served made me wonder how they can ever sell another seat in a premium cabin.  You guessed it: champagne in a plastic cup. Coffee in a paper cup. Salt and pepper in a paper packet.  Something they must have meant to resemble bread was cold, stale and wrapped in plastic.    Compare that to Lufthansa, freshly warmed/baked bread, pre-take off bubbly in a glass and a dinner to rival the very best restaurants out there.  Dear American Airlines, your customer in a premium cabin simply has not flown on the competition or may not have experienced the difference."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Most mismanaged airline in existence,This airline is the most mismanaged airline ever. The flight crew for my flight was delayed which delayed my flight and I couldn't find another flight because there were no seats available anywhere. Highly unprofessional. Do not fly with this airline. You're better off spending your money with Spirit.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Repeatedly reinforce that customers are the last priority.,"I’ve traveled with AA for over 20 years for work (I never choose AA if given the option).  70% or more of my flights have been delayed past the connecting flight and I either spend the night in the cheapest hotel they can find OR end up running to catch my connection.  I don’t check luggage as I’ve already capped my travel limit with the ticket price alone.  If I wish to check my bag or sit in a ‘more desirable’ seat, it’s another $100 plus per one way trip.  Given that ticket prices are higher than most other airlines, I find this just further reinforces that AAs business model needs improvement.  Customer service with AA is horrible.  Communication is horrible.  The employees all seem stressed and unhappy.  As an example, my last flight was over an hour late arriving to pick us up.  Once on the runway, we waited for the fuel tanker to fuel us up (an unexpected delay the captain announced) so we waited another 50 minutes on the aircraft for that.  We taxied out only to stop again for another 30 minutes and were told that the crew was remedying an ‘administrative issue.’  We ended up landing about 2.5 hours late to our connecting airport/flights. Most of the passengers around me were connecting and missed those connections. We formed a line to get hotel/taxi vouchers and after waiting about 20 minutes, the AA rep assisting us informed us that she would only be helping one more customer and the rest needed to walk down to the other end of the airport to customer service.  Once arriving there, those of us in the front of the first line were now last in the new line.  Needless to say, another 45 minutes watching the reps take water breaks and turning to chat while 30+ people waited for assistance did not leave anyone waiting with a ‘we want your business’ feeling.  The issue with AA is this trip is the NORMAL for this company.  Flights cancelled, delayed, poor customer service, etc is the normal.As travelers, we make plans. Business trips are scheduled around meetings, events, etc.  To book with AA means to me, clearing my schedule of any and everything for 48 hours as I never know whereI’ll end up and for how long before I get to my final destination.  My college son, two weeks prior, missed the day of orientation to a foreign country that he’d never been to, his ride from the airport to the campus in a non-English speaking foreign place and two full days of classes because AA cancelled his flight due to ‘’mechanical errors’. This was cancelled AFTER he was loaded onto a plane and taxied out onto the runway.  He spent 5 hours at the airport only to be picked up and brought home. Told to come back the next day.  It’s unacceptable. I certainly understand the lack of workers during this difficult time; however, how are the other airlines NOT having these issues?  For leisure, I travel Southwest.  Yes, there have been delays.  But they compensate these with AMAZINGcustomer service.  I feel I matter with them.  90% of my flights are on time or early.  Staff are friendly, smiling, quick to assist where they can.  American needs a new business plan."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible Airline and Horrible Airport!!!!,"I have never been so disgusted with an airline like I am with AA at this time! They are late every single time and then at the last minute, they cancel the flight! They have no regard for anyone’s time and anguish when traveling!! I will never fly AA again nor will I ever use LGA airport again!!! Nothing but disappointing travel plans over and over again! Where is the credit people should get for traveling to the airport and waiting for these idiots to get the planes off the ground!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,APP mistake charged me $150 for ONE BAG!!,"American is bottom of the barrel. Return flight was canceled until the next day. Ok, fine. Got a hotel and 3 food vouchers per person. The next day at the airport our last 3 vouchers didn’t work. Seriously- we went to speak with an agent and they issued new ones. Still didn’t work. The night before I tried to pay ONE bag fee for the return flight. App have me several errors to try again. Finally it went though. I got one confirmation email for $30. My credit card was charged $150 for those mistakes!!! I went to prefund site and only got $30 refund. Ridiculous! I will get my $150 back. I’ll never fly AA again!! Awful airline."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Abandoned special needs person in airport gate,My handicapped daughter went on a trip booked unattended minor and special needs . She had an escort or was supposed to have escort but in Chicago O’Hara airport she was abandoned at the gate by prospect and she was alone and scared . My daughter is mind set of a 4 year old snd was left to fend  for herself she missed her connecting flight home . American Airlines and myself spent over 2 hours on the phone Joseph cagle passenger services supervisor who was mean cruel wanting my daughter sent out of the airport to a hotel . My daughter is unable to navigate uber or check into a hotel . I had to fight to get her in a UM room for her 15 hour delay over night due to her being and fined by prospect and missing her connecting flight . I was denied access to CRO and asked many times . It was a very scary ordeal for myself and my daughter . This has traumatized her and she has medical issues including a birth defect and brain tumors and a congenital heart defect and her iq is below 70 . I would not wish any parent to go thru this ordeal or any disabled person traveling alone . I have been treated badly by both American Airlines and prospect. Below is pictures of my daughter and a link to another disabled person left in the same airport abandoned . This happens to often .
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible flight company!,"I am very very unhappy about my experience flying with American Airlines. I always plan ahead and I booked my flight 4 MONTHS prior, just so this airline could cancel my flight the day before and give me a hassle about scheduling another flight. Not only did I miss my plans cause of this cancellation, but this company also gave me a hard time at the airport. I am very disappointed and will no longer be flying with American Airlines."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Two Hours on hold tickets i needed were sold in that time SORRY!,"Had 3 tickets for first class or what they consider first class. NOT FIRST CLASS but price was first class,. Needed to change 2 other tickets to fly on 7/9 instead of 7/12 tickets were still available on line but wanted to see what they could do to move the date. After 2 hours on hold the 2 seats that were available were no longer available. All I go was a sorry nothing we can do. No supervisor or manager available to speak too. GREAT WAY to do business"
Date of travel: June 2021,30,"ok, professional airline people","The whole airline experience is something else.  Leaving a small airport at Scranton is easy for check in, security often does a pat down as most seniors like me look off kilter or maybe just bored since I was the only one passing security at the time. So went to Charlotte and long walk from terminal E to more used gates at ABCD terminals. So I had to rush since not enough time between flights.  I made it with 15 minutes to spare.  On trip home from Phoenix had overnight flight so upgraded my seat to first row behind first class.  Took window seat, had 2 next to me who ...well my upgrade was a waste. Did not sleep a minute.  Anyway this review is also about the airline. Enjoyed 10 mini pretzels. What can anyone say, the staff is doing their best. Nothing like pre 911, never will be again  Went to Hawaii in 1980 with college friends and flight crew in Chicago changed to Hawaiian garb and free dinner service of a complimentary  native Hawaiian dinner.  So happy to have that memory.   So many years later...my kids will never see such.  Sadly how some horrible people on 911 changed air travel forever"
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Thank you American!,"This review is based on customer service at Dulles International. We did not fly American for this flight. Although, have traveled using American Airlines previously. We were traveling United Airlines and stranded at Dulles International due to inclement weather at Newark Airport. United Airlines was a disaster. American Airlines provided us with blankets, pillows, food, water, and courtesy even though we did not fly through them for this flight. Just wanted to review based on an airline that treated us with courtesy and respect even though we were not flying through American. Big shout out to American Airlines at Dulles International for treating people with common decency who were not even traveling through American! Speaks volumes!"

Date of travel: May 2021,10,AA isn't the company is used to be. Don't fly with them,"10 years ago they were a different airline, nothing amazing but better than expected for the price.  Now you literally can't fly with them. In 3 years,  4 AA flights,  4 issues. This last trip was from Nashville to Dallas was insanity. Got rerouted to Tulsa, spent 1.5 hours circling, 4 hours on the tarmac, got a water and bag of pretzels and was told the airport didn't have to do that and to thank them. About the only information we ever got. AA let us off the plane at 9:10 when all the stores closed at 9... I didnt want a handout,  but let me off the plane so I can feed myself but almost exactly 8 hours to get from Nashville to a gate in Tulsa.Get to Dallas about 3 hours later,  then 22.5 hours til new flight,  have to get a hotel and no luggage. AA didn't know where our luggage was but promises it will be at destination. GLAD THEY CHECKED MY CARRY ON THAT HAD MY MEDICATIONS, so beyond inconvenient. Glad I'm not on anything more life threatening. Desk told me I would have to wait until SD, go to the ER or he could call 911 for me.$500 unexpected later on a plane to SD.  landing and pull up and over water. circle, pass, circle... I live in SD I know we're doing weird stuff, I know the cities below us that keep coming and going.  3 circle and they finally announce we were too close to airline in front of us and had to get back in line. Over SD County til landing took 1h15m.  This doesn't happen with other airlines,  Spirit is the 2nd worst and ill still buy a ticket from them,  but never again AA.I hope bankruptcy comes quick and competitors pick up a major of their runs. USPS to postage is better than AA to air travel."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Honeymoon,My wife and I had a horrible experience the staff was disrespectful. I promised my wife I would try to bump us in first class I saw there was 7 seats available and as I walked to the agent she would not stare me into my eyes and told my flight was booked!! Too bad could have made maybe a grand or 2 from me for a upgrade!! Garbage if all garbage service!!! So sad what was once a great airline is the most disrespectful staff management built!! If corporate your reading this do something about this NOW!!!! Otherwise you will lose your best clients!!!
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Customer service,"I had a flight credit that I wanted to use so I called the number on the voucher,And I was instructed by the representative I spoke to on the phone to go to the Airport so I drove to the airport only to discover that I did not have the voucher. But no worries,I thought. Because when I received the Voucher I was told that all I would need is a pic of it , this is not the case. So I drove home. I live 1 hr away.  I came back to the airport with my voucher to be told that they can't accept it. So after 4 hours later I got no where.  And everyone I spoke to gave me a different answer.  And now I have been waiting for a call back for over 5 hours and my flight reservation expires in 2 minutes.  I have tried to call another time and recording let my know I still have 4 hours away from them calling. The most important note is that this is a emergency business trip , so i have to fly out.  I'm not happy with America Airlines customer service."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Never again,Absolutely  the worst airlines I've ever been on.. first the lady was rude af for no reason... then we had to pay for our bags to be checked... then since we had to pay for our bags to be checked everyone had three over sizes carry ons ! So the plane ran out of room for carry-ons the plane was over packed people had backpacks on the floor and backpacks in their lap.. im traveling with my kids and we had a 10 hr layover over night in Washington  DC and they kicked us out into the streets... like I'm sorry but worst airline EVER!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never Again!,"OMG they are awful! It’s not only that they cancel flights but they keep you at the gate for hours waiting on the “maintenance crew to change a wheel”. BE HONEST American, you don’t have enough staff to facilitate your ticket sales. So stop selling tickets that you can’t honor and then make the consumer call back and literally wait for 2-3 days for a call back. This is no fewer than the last 5 flights you have canceled on us. We are done with you after 15 years of business travel."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible airlines,"This was a terrible experience. We decided to go on a special trip from Salt Lake to Cabo and actually fly first class. While flying I expected a meal or some special food or something. Especially for the cost of it. We got some snacks from the basket which were very insufficient and a drink. I had made arrangements for a wheelchair weeks before to meet us in Cabo. There was none nor can they get one. Returning from Cabo, I called that morning to verify I would have a wheelchair in Salt Lake. When we arrived in Salt Lake City there was no wheelchair again. The gate agent said she would call forone and we waited another 20 minutes and nothing ever showed up. My wife had to go find a wheelchair and then push me nearly a mile to the baggage claim. When we arrived in Cabo we had to fill out an immigration and customs form and find pens to do it. The airline could easily have provided us those forms on the plane so that everything could be filled out and we could go directly to immigration rather than having to stand in the hallway and try and fill The thing out. I would never fly American again. Very poor service everything seem to be terrible and we had a terrible flight. After landing in Salt Lake we had to sit on the tarmac for over a half an hour before we were allowed into a gate. Spend your money elsewhere."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst airlines ever,"Our flight was cancelled for no legitimate reason or atleast none was given only hours before we were to depart. The airlines tried to throw us on a flight departing the day before we were to return home. We finally found another flight with delta and they agreed to pay it. Now fast forward to getting back home. Flight cancelled again, rebooked for next day and now we have no bags. They lost our bags! And to top it off they’re rude, don’t take accountability for anything and don’t seem to really care that they lost our bags. Hopefully they turn up. We will never fly American again.Not to mention, flights uncomfortable, no TVs like other airlines, slow or barely connectable WiFi on board, no class & absolutely no care about their passengers."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES,"We bought the tickets through Expedia at a low price and I've found out why. Most of the American Airline planes are old and need maintenance, causing constant delays. The also cancel flights often, likely because the flight wasn't full. I was scheduled to leave Kansas at 4pm, but they canceled the flight and moved me to a 12 pm flight. In that flight, the plane was old, and we were delayed 30 minutes because a door to the overhead compartment wouldn't shut. I then had a 4 hour layover at Dallas due to the flight cancelation. Not only that, but the flight to take me back to Atlanta at 6:30 was also delayed 2 hours because of maintenance. If I wanted to spend 12 hours waiting, I would've driven. American Airlines is cheap for a reason and not worth the inevitable delays, do not book here!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Disaster,Flight delayed onceThen Flight delayed again once every one boarded the plane. It’s disappointing because you guys charge so much but give so little and take responsibility for nothing at hand. Flight 1785
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible Airline!!,"I don’t know why American Airlines is still a company Because 4 Years ago I went on American Airlines and they lost our bag…we got back after 2 days!! Then yesterday we flew American Airlines and they lost our bag again in Charlotte and we’re still waiting for it to come back to our house. I also saw many other people coming to the employees telling them that they couldn’t find their bags. If you need to fly somewhere I would give 5 star reviews to South west and United Airlines because they have never lost our bag and the flight times are pretty good. Also 1 more thing, where you print your boarding pass and the tags that you put on your bags the lady that was helping us was pretty rude for example she, I told her she selected the wrong person for the car seat and she said: “ITS NOT ABOUT THE CAR SEAT!!!” So I would definitely NOT recommend American Airlines."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,The worst,"Just awful. Chaotic boarding. Packed planes. Late takeoff. Can’t deplane  because of weather, bag soaked when it finally arrived. All the horror stories are true, pick any other airline!"

I had flights booked August 2020 and my family and I could not go due to quarantine restrictions in the arrival city. American would not issue a refund and provided a travel voucher for almost 750$ total for 3 tickets. Now that I can take that trip the following year that voucher won't even cover the cost of 1 ticket!!! No refund, no help!! Terrible company, have called numerous times only to be on hold for hours upon hours and not helped at all."

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible travel experience,"Had a trip planned for the 4th of July holiday. We were scheduled to fly American airlines out of Austin Bergstrom with a connection to Bozeman Montana out of Dallas.Our flight was scheduled to board at 5:55 AM on July 1st . We checked the TSA wait times via the TSA app And arrived at the airport 1 hour and 45 minutes hours early to ensure enough time to check bags and get thru the TSA security process.The line to check bags at American was out the door. No other airline had similarly long lines that morning. There were only four American employees working the check in counters. We were in line for almost 2 hours and ended up missing our flight. Once we got to the check in desk, we were told that the best they could do was put us on a 5:30PM flight to catch a connection in Dallas to our final destination. The only problem was that we would be on standby for the connecting flight and that the connecting flight was fully booked. Thanks so much American. Stranding us in Dallas did not seem to be a reasonable solution.I have two problems with American airlines after this less than pleasant experience.1.	At no time did an American employee appear to ask people in the check in line when their boarding times were.I travel frequently and when traveling with other airlines I have never missed a flight due to check in delays. Invariably all other airline companies I have ever dealt with always seem to have employee(s) working long check in lines making sure no one misses a flight. Apparently, this does not occur to anyone working at American.2.	After missing the flight we requested ticket refund. They denied the refund request and insisted on a creditBased on the inconvenience of missing the flight and the incompetence of how American handled the problem I think a refund would be reasonable. Americans recent proclivity to cancel flights seemingly on a whim combined with a total disregard for customers in my mind makes a future travel credit all but worthless.Epic fail American airlines."
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Image of stewardess from bad to worse!,"Going back years ago when all the airline employees were properly dress that everyone were looking at them so proud. Today, it's pathetic the way some of them are dress with a poor attitude and no customer service training at all. I'm trying to be constructive with this comment, so I highly recommend the airline to start reviewing the basic conducts. From the way they dress with respect not only for the passengers but with the company as well."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,A mixed,"In my experience, flying with American Airlines has been a rotating roulette on the wheel of misfortune and customer service, ladies and gentleman. I never knew if I would get good or bad service. When it was bad, it was bad bad bad.The situation:The flight was to Philadelphia, which was experiencing very bad weather. So bad to the point that the entire airport was closed for a good two hours, according to the gate attendant. Therefore, my flight was delayed for two hours when the airport opened back up. Understandable for sure. What wasn't understandable, however, was the fact that when we finally arrive at Philadelphia airport, the flight attendants were of no help for every concerned passenger that had connecting flights like myself. They gave the ""meh, figure it out"" response.  At least lie to the customer and give the ""Let me see what I can do for you"" response even if they could not do anything. As a result, I arrived at the gate, F35, which was the whole way on the other side of the airport, 10 minutes after my connecting flight took off. I get it, they cannot hold the plane for people running behind WHEN it is their fault. But when it is not the customer's fault that they were late, especially at 10 more minutes, come on man!! So I am there at the gate, trying to think of options for how to get close to my final destination. I go to the nearest gate attendant because the one at F35 was long gone, and she, at gate F36 at 10:54 pm very rudely said ""YEEEESSS. what do you want?"" That is NOT how you should talk to an exasperated customer. So I proceeded to ask if there were any flights close to my final destination, which there wasn't, then walked away, not wanting to deal with that rude employee any more than I had to. Luckily, I was able to have someone pick me up, which they had to do at 2 am, and we did not get back until the morning (by car). God bless those people. Brutal. HOWEVER, lucky for this airline, the manager came over and calmed down about 50 people. He gave THEM accommodations and a plan that they deserved, Justin was his name. 5 stars to that guy, good customer service skills, and efficient too. The return trip was stressful. As I missed my connecting flight to my final destination, through no fault of my own, American Airlines went ahead and cancelled my return trip. Blindsided by this, I show up at the airport to get my boarding pass and nothing. Thankfully, a gentleman by the name of Tim was very accommodating and figured it out for BOTH flights back to where I left originally. After that conundrum, flights were smooth on the way back as long as I avoided talking to any other employee because it was a mixed bag of good service and crummy service. OH, and on the phone with a representative, I was told that I had to cancel my entire trip to get a refund, INCLUDING the trip back. Yeah, so still working on a refund, but will likely be unsuccessful. Very distasteful and something has to change with that, man. Overall, American Airlines has trash service. Look elsewhere for your travels if you want to avoid the rudeness of employees and bad circumstances with mostly minimal effort."

Upon arrival back home while unpacking my luggage I notice that valuable items were missing from my baggage. The airlines enforce rules where you’re unable to carry on certain items due to the liquid measurement regulations, then when I comply and add my very expensive perfume to my baggage, it’s stolen right from my bag! I followed the exact directions from the airlines and put in a claim to only be told “sorry” they can’t do anything about my loss. I feel completely violated and can’t hold anyone accountable for what was illegally taken from me. I WILL NEVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,We are going to miss it! Run!,"Me and my 11 year old son got to hobby with plenty of time to spare. Our first flight was delayed 3 times. We were told not to worry because our connecting flight was also delayed. We finally land in Dallas and have 10 mi minutes to get across the airport. My self a random lady and my son all take off sprinting we make it to our gate as they are closing the gate. The lady at the counter says to us that's to bad this flight was even delayed. I said our flight was delayed getting here. She then books all 3 of us on a different flight but says you need to hurry because they are already boarding. So the 3 of us take of running again. The new flight is all the way back across the airport.  We made it but then sat on the tarmac for a hour. We arrived at pxd almost 4 hours late. We proceeded with our vacation. The day we fly home I wake up to a text that my flight has been delayed and I'm going to miss my connecting flight. They allowed me to change flights but it was the following day. That means I missed a day of work had to rent my car for another day and pay for another day of parking in Houston. My son and I go to the airport and flight 1 goes without a hitch infact we got to Phoenix early and then it starts the flight was delayed 40 minutes. I decided to check my carry-on at this point because I know we are going to have to run to catch our connecting flight. We land we have 20 min to make the next flight. We again ran but this time we made it but barely. We then sit on the tarmac for another hour. We finally arrived back in Houston, we go to pick up our bags and they are not there. Our bags are lost.

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Flying Experience of My Life,"I typically can be flexible and go with the flow, but in 20 years of flying I’ve never experienced such terrible service. We had 3 flights delayed for hours to eventually be cancelled all within one long weekend. We were given poor excuses for the cancellations. Clearly they have issues with staffing and overbooking, and they tried to act like other elements like the weather was the reason for the cancellations. It was frustrating to wait for so long at the airport each time, clearly they knew they’d cancel the flight. On our first flight we waited on the runway for 3 hours before turning around and coming back. Then we waited an additional 2 at the gate. When I asked if they would pay for a ticket on another airline they refused. They didn’t help to pay for a hotel. I had to call the customer service line countless times to get details organized. Many of the representatives weren’t even apologetic for the circumstances. Sometimes the wait times were over an hour. One woman never rebooked us on a new flight, she must not have put in the system. We were not even ticketed passengers when we showed up at the airport. I will never be flying American again. I highly recommend going with another airline."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Traveler Beware,This is the second time American has cancelled my flight out of Fargo. No explanation and rude customer service representatives.

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Pick a gate. Actually assist your customers,"This is the second time that this has happened now at DFW airport  so I decided to write this review…To start, on our first flight, (6 1/2 hours) from Hawaii to DFW Texas it was extremely cold, which would not have been a problem whatsoever except my girlfriend and I were in Hawaiian clothes and were not prepared for the climate change in the plane. So we decided to ask the flight attendant if she had any blankets available. She claimed that, “they stopped giving out blankets a long time ago and we don’t have any.” Then she just walked off. I thought nothing of it and used my beach towel as a blanket, but Upon exiting the plane I realized that she has blatantly lied to me as everyone in economy+ and above had one. EVERYONE! Tell the truth instead of lying about it… not hard.The main reason for writing this review, however is that since arriving at DFW airport our gate has changed considerable location every 10-40 minutes….. not exaggerating. Both of my parents are handicapped after brand new knee surgery and they have dragged themselves all the way across the airport 4 times now. We are currently sitting at the wrong gate on purpose because we have ZERO faith that your airline will actually keep its word in the next 2 hours and stick with the same gate. This is OUTRAGEOUS that you all do not consider customer service almost at all from what I have seen. I fly ALL the time. The only major issues I have are on YOUR airline! The last time this gate issue happened, I ended up SPRINTING across the airport and making my gate by a minute drenched in sweat. I’m tired of the lack of any initiative to fix these problems that have consisted for years. You show zero respect for your customers and it’s about time you did something.-someone who actually gives a crap."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Very Rude,"I said “Hello.” To the American eMployee at the check-in desk. Before I could utter another word he said, “Go ahead and get to your ask.

Any explanations we did receive were clearly an afterthought and given to us in VERY broken English so we could only guess at what was said.....I paid for a decent departure/arrival time (and paid dearly for an economy seat at that!) and received.....a red eye.  BUT I did not receive any compensation for what was clearly a marketing ploy to charge me for something the company had no intention of delivering to me!  Kind of like shopping at Macy's....and receiving a Wal-Mart quality product for the Macy's price.....We traveled to and from the major US hub for American (in from Albuquerque and out to Newark) so there should be extra stock of serviced, ready to go planes and pilots at prime travel times in the summer, etc, when issues arise....at that home location.Weather?  I highly doubt that because:  the weather was fine, yet there was a current-day news article stating COVID firings and plane decommissions.....YET AA took my money quickly and sold me the seats well in advance, AND filled the planes to capacity .....which they must have known they really could not deliver acceptable service (KNOWING they did not have enough pilots nor enough planes to do so properly)....."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Abandoned Daughter at gate,"#MichellesLifeMatters.Finding it hard to celebrate Independence Day this year.  Just this last Sunday my handicapped daughter Michelle was left abandoned at a Chicago Ohair airport gate by her American Airlines escort. I can hear you saying now ""Mike what does this have to do with Independence day?"". Let me explain one of the quotes of the declaration of Independence imbedded in my head from childhood and school. ""all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness"". We have strived to give our daughter this American right, while vowing to keep her safe.  So when American Airlines told us we could send her just as if she were an unattended minor (which mentally I don't think anyone would disagree with) and they assured someone would be with her at all time, we decided to allow her to fly unattended to her brothers for her birthday.  Now the Independence Day connection: I always thought surely that with all our rights in this country we could get the word out about our experience in a free and uninterfered with manner. We have found that to be anything but the case, this is truly a testimony to the fact that some corporations have more protections than you and I as an American. You would think that someone with ""Freedom"" would be able to work with Media, advocates and lawyers if needed to get the word out.  Our experience so far has been anything but a free speech one. After my wife had a 1.5 hour interview with the local media news channel and much excitement from the reporter of getting the word out, we were later told that the publisher denied it due to fear of reprisal of the ""Federally Protected"" American Airlines. So I figured ok they don't want to stick their neck out for the handicapped over the Airlines. Where could we go from here? So we tried contacting a lawyer, now we are having much reluctance of any lawyers wanting to take on  the case for, you got it, fear of the ""Federally Protected"" American Airlines.  Now I ask you as an American, How are we free if corporations have more say to squelch and cover up the truth. I just want to get this word out as I don't want anyone else to ever have to go thru this with their child. Ok she is not a child she is 29, but I can tell you right now if I were to dump my daughter at the airport by herself now being a week later I would be in Jail , sych evals and all other kind of scrutiny since I am her guardian.  Maybe if she would have opened the airport exit or she was an ""unattended luggage""  she would have gotten more attention.  Please help me get this word out, no individual or corporation should be above the law.  As for American Airlines it has been crickets other than having their lawyer call us. I need to know how and why this happened and above all what I can do to avoid this to happen in the future.If there isn't a  law to prevent this I am completely prepared to lobby for those (disabled) that can't communicate or even fathom the danger themselves. Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness was the goal back then and I feel it is still a fight today. We have reached out to #MarcoRubio our senator in hopes he will feel the same."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,WORST SERVICE EVER,"By far the worst service I've received from an airline as a service member. Initially attempted to contact the airline prior to arriving only to be met with a 60 minute wait time. Once arriving and falling into my appropriate flight grouping line,  a rude attendant ask me ""Um, are you priorit?!""   Then Jean at the front desk continues to be of no service in assisting me change my flight or provide anyone who could provide further assistance, as I'm telling her I would like to change flights she proceeds to print boarding passes for my current flight. Never renders a greeting or makes eye contact. Customer after customer I watched  a American Airlines service providers treated and spoke to customers horribly.I do NOT care where the military takes me on this planet I will NEVER utilize American Airlines."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,The worst airlines,"After a covid lock down  i planned a 5 days vacations to punta cana and ths f..... airline changed my itinerary 4 hrs before my flight to 2 days latter after i paid hottel, all inclusive and activities and the f...... guy at customer service tell me if i want a refund"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Don’t fly American Airlines,"Worst flying experience I’ve ever had. Customer service was terrible. The general manager, James failed to fulfill his duties. Had checked in 3 hours to my flight then they said my flight has been delayed a few more hours. I had to go to another gate, then it was delayed. I was redirected to two more gates. A military man and his three children were also on standby and were turned down from the flight. Very sad to see this and experience this. Please do not fly through American Airlines, it was so chaotic and disorganized."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Sweetest Flight Attendant,This was our first time traveling with our 1-year old. He was having a really rough time and Debbie the flight attendant let us stand in the back and even sit in the unused seats. She gave him extra snacks and played peak-a-boo with him. I'm sure she may get some heat for letting us sit in unassigned seats but she was SO kind to us. She's one in a million.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst Airline Ever-Please Fly With ANYONE ELSE,"Our party of 4 were flying to Colorado Springs with a layover in Dallas/Ft Worth.  The first flight was delayed about 40 mins, no big deal.  Our second flight was cancelled before we hit the ground in Dallas. We were in the airport,  trying to get re-booked, for 2 hours.  The AA rep we had was nasty to us & kept telling us how she was tired & hadn’t had dinner.  None of our group ( including my nine y/o niece) had eaten since lunch & there was nothing open at the airport….couldn’t even get water. We were told the earliest flight would be July 3, three days later!  They couldn’t get us anywhere close enough to drive to our original destination & refused to book us on a different airline.  We were put up in a disgusting hotel…in the first room we were given the beds weren’t made & when we were moved, the 2nd room didn’t have hot water. We stayed up till 2 am trying to book another flight (no luck) and cancel all of our reservations (sorry, too late) and finally decided to rent a car the next day & drive home (10 hour drive took us about 15 due to accidents & weather).  If we had driven to our original destination we would’ve had to rely on neither of our return flights being cancelled & no one trusted AA enough to risk their job over it.  This was one of the worst experiences of my life (not to mention it totally ruined my niece’s first time flying…she never wants to do it again).  Also, we are out all the money we spent on hotels, rental car & excursions….none of which want to give any type of refund.  Not to mention the rental car to get home and most importantly, the vacation time that cannot be replaced.  I don’t understand how airlines can get away with doing this & people are just left holding the bag….and no one is the least bit sorry.  This experience was so bad that we will probably never fly again.  This airline deserves zero stars!  One last thing….we kept hearing about the amazing sanitation process AA was doing due to Covid….that’s a joke.  Before we got in the flight, we watched the plane land & the other passengers disembark & the airline almost immediately started boarding us….zero time to sanitize anything!  When we got on board, there was a flight attendant holding a tray out to us & when I took what was on it I started to laugh….it was a wet wipe!  That was there sanitation process……a wet wipe.  You can’t make this stuff up.  American Airlines is a joke & should be grounded permanently."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,No adjacent seats available on empty flight,"My family of 4 flew by American Airlines on a half empty flight . Still the online app did not allow us to pick adjacent seats without paying extra . The customer service, after a 2 hour hold, said they could not help either . I will never travel this airline again ."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Likeliness to recommend is 0, I will actively recommend people do not use American Airlines","We had a connecting flight home, got there 3 hours early, checked in, waited for them to call our group, went there and they just gave out seats away! There was no competent reason given. Rescheduled us for the next one a few hours later in WORSE seats than we already had. Will happily pay more to never use American Airlines again, and warn everyone unlucky enough that I guess this is a thing they do."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Night Mare,First my flight was delayed in Pensacola so they change my connecting flight.While I was in the air they canceled my connecting flight. They told me they could get me on another flight two days later. Im in New York with no friends or family. Their are no other flights going out for two days and I had to book a ticket on Amtrack. So far American has cost me two days vacation and $350. They are not answering there phones and have a now refund policy after the 24th of may.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst ever.,My daughters Flight was suppose to leave COS at 430p. Got delayed to 553p. Then got delayed again to 633p. Finally got to Dallas. Since all the delays from American Airlines (the worst) she missed her connecting flight. The put her on a fricking standby list for the next flight. That flight was full so she did not make that one either. She finally got on the flight the next morning and landing in El Paso Texas at 840a. I told my daughter to take Southwest. American Airlines you are the worst and you did not even offer any compensation for my daughter. POS people. I will never fly American Airlines. So glad she did not have her 18 month old daughter with her.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Bad experience,Worst experience ever first time flying n with delay after delay we lost a whole day of vacation....
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst experience,Worst freaking experience ever we were delayed after delayed we lost a whole day of vacation at airport
Date of travel: July 2021,10,I will recommend my company book with another airline,"Horrible horrible horrible, this company is terrible.  Zero if I could rate that low..  Also flight was canceled less than 12 hrs before flight departure.  ✈️ right b4 the holiday.   Now I  have to find a way to get to San Fran, book another hotel night somewhere and my child is home from military, yet I can't get there.  AA refused to place me on another airline that left around the same time frame and same date as the one canceled.  Even tho they are blaming the weather it all has to be on my dime. The weather is dry both here and my destination.  After reading reviews,, this is all a scam so they don't have to refund.  Im going to the news..  people need to know about this.i  will never recommend them.  Because of holiday schedule my work company is unable to increase credit card limit for another night and now travel to San Fran as well. AA can care less. First rep says she will reimburse on another airline, spent 2 hours looking at flights and call back to book, 2nd lady says no because of weather.  I tell her what first lady said, she basically was said too bad so sad.  It's not their fault the weather is bad.  Well lady it isn't my fault either.  3rd lady was nice, but hung up on be b4 the survey could be initiated.  I'm so angry and frustrated.  This is legit not right!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst experience ever,Supposed to fly out 2 july…flight was canx’d for no reason. Told couldnt rebook us until 3 july. We drove 4 hours and had to stay in a hotel bc we live so far and had an early flight. Now paid two nights. Also flight was cancelled like 10 hrs before takeoff. Flight that was rescheduled also got cancelled……!!!!!! Get a text 10 hrs or so before saying were rescheduled for the 5th now!!!! WTF?!? Also didnt offer any sort of apology or refund or have any other flights we could change to. Were military and its hard enough for my family to find days of leave that line up nevermind this was my last two weeks of leave. So we wasted legitmate time with family because of this HORRIBLE HORRIBLE airline. I have never had worse experiences than flying american.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Canceling flights without warning. Stranded,"Avoid like the plague. First flight cancelled for lack of crew. Second flight, four hours later rerouted to Atlanta, three hours from destination. That flight was cancelled for maintenance issues. No other flights available. Tried to book us for a flight two days later automatically. More than an hour and a half wait time to get to customer service. Ruined our first holiday vacation in a year and a half. They do not have the crews or staff to meet their flight schedules and are proactively cancelling almost 100 flights every day because they don't have the crews. And, checked baggage was still sent to Atlanta despite the flight being cancelled. Never fly American Airlines -- let them fail and the other airlines take up the slack."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst customer service and last minute cancellation!,My flight was cancelled night before. Representative was not helpful at all! Worst customer service.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delays and information changes galore,My original flight was slated for 4-11 pm with a connecting flight in DFW at 8pm. First flight was 40 mins late. Multiple flights were delayed tons of times. My connection got canceled and rebooked for the next day on an evening flight. I was in DFW for 18 hours. I counted other passengers also spending the evening in DFW but stopped counting after 300.  The airport put a media release out about keeping restaurants open and providing cots and blankets to stranded flyers. All restaurants closed at their normal posted hour. Nothing was provided as promised and AA actually cited weather for being the primary reason for the cancellation instead of their lack of staff. Which also means hotel cost is put back onto the flyer instead of the company. Terrible experience overall with American Airlines and the Dallas Fort Worth Airport.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Steer Clear,"Canceled 8am flight less than 12 hrs before departure with no alternate flights until the following day.  After contacting customer service, I was told they would credit the flight,  but I would have to go on the website to request the funds to be returned to my account.  I had to submit individual refund requests for flights, bag fees, and seat upgrades and 6 days later, I still have not seen the deposits.  Choose any other airline besides American."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Save your money and hassle,"CONSTANT delays. My flight was scheduled to leave at 6:19pm and land in Charlotte at 10:22pm. My flight got delayed until 7:45pm with a land time of 10:58pm in Charlotte. See the problem? I was told 40 minutes before my flight was scheduled to leave that there had been a delay. The last time I flew American, the same thing happened. I ended up staying the night in the Charlotte airport and waiting 4 hours to talk to someone from customer service. While standing in that very very long line, no one was offered water or anything. That is really a health hazard having people stand for that long with nothing in return. Do not fly with this airline. Spend a couple extra dollars and fly with someone else. Beyond ridiculous."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst crew ever!,So annoyed Me and my son were supposed to go to Phily on July 3 . Today we were looking at the flight status and it got canceled. For no reason! We have had many issues with American and I am never booking a flight with American ever again.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Long wait times for customer service and extensive anti consumer behavior.,"Service is awful - four hour plus wait times on the phone, and they are deeply anti consumer in cancellation policy, missed flight policy, etc. Pay a bit extra and fly Virgin or something - avoid American.This is what monopoly power and very low margins gets you, airlines like American that feel zero obligation to create customer loyalty and will take every opportunity to squeeze you."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Seats have shrunk and now charging extra to sit next to companion.,"The seats have shrunk so much that any amount of time sitting in them is excruciating. The back of the seat has been lowered so it is even with the top of my shoulders. I am 5’6.5.  What do people do who are taller and bigger than me? I’m overweight, not obese, but a little hippy. I saw many large passengers on this flight. Did they ask for extensions? OMG! I had to totally scrunch my arms in so as not to bother my neighbors. They were also going to charge my husband and me $19 each to sit together! What? I usually travel alone so I didn’t notice that airlines are now charging extra to sit with family members or companions!! We sat apart on the sardine flight from H#ll!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines sucks!!!,"I've flown maybe fifty times in my life and this was by far the worst flight experience I've ever had. There was no difference between first class and everyone else. What a huge waste of money my father-in-law spent to fly the family out for my brother-in-law's wedding.  There were no TVs, tiny bit of food we were offered was ridiculous. Kid and parent behind us constantly kicking the back of the seat.  My wife and I will never fly American Airlines again ...what a crap Airline!"
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Comfortable and Clean,Loved my business class seat!  Very clean and well organized.  The food was excellent and the service was friendly and professional.  Everything you would expect in a first class seat!  Great privacy and sleeping seat!Will fly again
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Good but not so good overall,Everything was good until we came to the airport and found out that our flight was cancelled. They gave us 0 notice. They found a similar flight at a different airport but now are refusing to pay for an additional taxi taken to that airport.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Worst refund policy.,I bought 2 tickets to a family event in Aspen. I have not traveled in over 2 years and this is a one time trip. American canceled my flight and did not have any options for me to get to my destination that wouldnt make me stay an extra day and cost me $$. They refused to refund me my $$ and would only issue me a credit that I have one year to use???!!!  I could've spent an extra 250 to get refundable ticket. Seriously worst airline. Done never again.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worse airline I have ever had to deal with,"If I could rate this lower the a 1 then I would. This airline is an absolute joke. Awful service. Awful everything, not enough staff and not to mention the staff is rude and absolutely useless. Would never recommend this airline to anyone."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,lost reservation rude agents and supervisor,I booked a flight for my son and daughter on 06/16/2021 the flights for each was 147.xx I booked using the mobile app I also booked the same days as a package deal using price line when i called about no one was able to find me nor non of my children in the system i was referred back to price line when i reached price line they reached you all then i was referred back to American for the tickets for my 2 children Jakia Dewberry and James Dewberry I called AA and was transferred hung up on and over charged being told i have to rebook and being charged 100 dollars more then before i asked to speak with a supervisor where they transferred me to someone by the name of kelly she was very rude and dismissive she wasn't even trying to hear me out take no name or even look for the lost reservation also i did call when i didn't get conformation right away and was told no worries you get something in 24-48hrs via email then today i was told by the Supervisor Kelly that i couldn't book a flight for my son and daughter even though my daughter is 18 and we're flying together I just booked their flights separate to avoid paying for a hotel I didn't need--Kenya Moore
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"So unorganized, chaotic, uncommunicative  and awful experience","We were booked for an afternoon flight, got delayed 5/6 hours (ok fine). Then got cancelled for 7 am because they didn’t have a pilot. They told us to come BACK at 6 am with the SAME boarding pass. When we came to board our new flight they said it was full and that we actually needed new passes and that the airline didn’t transfer our passes like they told us all that they would. They didn’t let us in the flight, told us we have to wait another day, meanwhile we were going to help my grandma in the hospital. It is ridiculous and very disappointing."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Avoid if flying from smaller airport,"Scheduled to fly out from a relatively small-city airport.  American Airlines abruptly cancelled the flight out (likely due to low flight volume or staffing/equipment issues as the weather was fine) with no warning and automatically booked me a new flight out 2 days later (my return date).  No options to get me to my planned destination until well over 24 hours after I was initially supposed to arrive.On my first go-around with customer service, I waited on hold for 10 minutes to speak to a representative and after the call was connected they immediately hung up before I could speak a single word.  On repeat (another 15 minutes at 445 AM) I was able to speak to a representative who was able to confirm they had no capacity on any flights out until late the following day.  Ended up needing to cancel my trip entirely.  Unfortunately, this is not my first bad experience with American Airlines.  Will be taking my business elsewhere in the future."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,"There are no words to express how absolutely terrible our experience with this airline was. Flights rebooted days later, unable to obtain luggage, no reimbursement, no vouchers. To make matters worse so many people flying this airline were in the same boat it was nearly impossible to secure rides and lodging."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,The worst service I ever got,"This is the worst airline I’ve ever flown with since I’ve been in the United States. My fiancé and I booked our flight a month before in preparation for our wedding on the Fourth of July. Our flight was delayed at first and because they underestimated and over sold tickets lied to us telling us that our flight was cancelled while they flew that flight out. They weren’t even considerate, nice or remorseful neither did they compensate, they only asked to reschedule us for the next available flight on my wedding day. They messed me up emotionally and psychologically and financially because they also overcharged me for luggages which cost $740. I hope you guys get what’s coming to you for your deceit and dishonesty."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,worst ever,American Airlines is the worst airline company in the world. They are a scam on steroids. worst customer service. You have to wait hours on the phone to get anyone - they never help you with anything . stay away like the plague- horrible
Date of travel: June 2021,40,Best Airline,We have used many different airlines throughout our travel times. American Airlines always has the kindest attendants. They offer a drink and snack even for short trips. They are extremely helpful with any questions you may have. We ❤️ American Airlines!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Several hour delay, ultimately cancelled","Other airlines cancelled their flights well in advance but AA decided to string along us passengers with tales of whimsy that it would only be another 20 min here, 45 min there, 5 min there before boarding. Before we know it, it is midnight. Instead of boarding at 7:50PM, we showed up at 6:00PM for our flight and only by 11:30PM did they finally say that it was cancelled. A gigantic waste of time that caused a flood of people rushing to the understaffed customer service line to try and reschedule. Chaotic. Unorganized. 0/10"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,NEVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!,these a##hats cancelled my flight 12 hours before departure for my flight to arrive in dallas that was supposed to be trip from 7/2 - 7/5 and had nerve to send rebooking notice to depart on 7/4 to PHOENIX.  never again.  be warned.  never ever fly this airlines.  been on hold 2 hours and still waiting to talk to representive!!  #bidensamerica
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Attendants at Charlotte airport and  Punta Cana did not show up,"My wife and I requested wheelchairs at Charlotte airport and Punta Cana airport on June 15, 2021 since both of us are handicap and cannot walk far.  she has two metal implants in both femur.  Whereas I have cancer and heart problems. Once we arrived at the gate in Charlotte airport, the one guarding the wheelchairs told us that they cannot find a wheelchair assistant.  So my wife who has metal legs pushed to the gate of our connecting flight to Punta Cana.  Once we arrived in Punta Cana, there was no wheelchair assistant again and this guy told us to walk and follow him.  I was panting like a dog once we reached custom then picked our luggages and dragged them to find our shuttle to the resort.  Coming back we complained at check-in and at the airplane about  the very poor service for handicap so coming back was a lot better."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Literally the worst flying experience of my life.,"Please put this airline out of business, I had two of my flights canceled for no reason and when my new flight was delayed for 4 hours I missed my connection and was denied compensation for my hotel so I had to sleep in my connecting flights airport. The limited help I received for switching flights was not useful and was essentially told sucks to suck when I was told I would be missing my connection. I never write reviews but in the 4 and a half hours I have been waiting in the airport I had an epiphany to write this to hopefully save someone the time of dealing with this airline."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Choose a better airline.,"Flight delayed 3 hours due to a ""computer reset"", missed the connection.   Very poor customer service in Boston Airport.   Had to stay over night in DC, airline gave voucher for hotel but not for food arguing that they didn't give more food vouchers and some people did get food vouchers, who knows, not even the AA people get their stories straight.  Not worth the hassle, poor customer service.    The news always say that AA cancels flights, this time better believe the news.  Better to pay a little extra sometimes but making sure the selected airline will deliver its promises."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible experience,"I have never encountered such rude flight attendants before. We paid extra to sit together and were not seated together. We were treated poorly by the flight attendance when we made them aware of it they said “the seat your sitting in is actually better than your seat, it’s a paid seat”and I said this is the seat I originally paid for.  Then they checked the name and verified. As I was snacking one of the flight attendants red head came up to me and firmly stated keep your mask up! It was clear I became a target just because I had a complaint. Its an 8 hour flight so I will get their names and report it to customer service and I won’t be flying American ever again! Flight AA334 01JUL610P 17C & 20D"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Did not honor flight credit received during Covid!,"I was guaranteed a flight credit when I cancelled a flight due to Covid. When I contacted reservations to use it, they couldn’t find it. I then emailed customer service and waited more then a week for a response. In the interim, I had to book and pay in full for a new flight. They miraculously found the Evoucher, a week after I needed it. Now, after hours on hold and time corresponding, they will not reimburse me for the credit on my credit card. I guess they need $55 more than a good reputation! Very sad!  Terrible customer service!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Round trip,"Our experience was terrible. Not only did we get delayed for 3 hours for maintenance, but when we got to the layover (missing our flight) a line of 3 american airline flights were in the assistance line for the same reason. And the employees weren’t sympathetic to us even when our flight we missed came back for almost an hour they wouldn’t let us get on or grab the car seat for our 2 year old….they lied saying the plane was gone while we stared at it through the window. Will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: July 2021,50,I've made enough complaints about bad service and had incredible service today,"Its hit or miss on Check in Staff at EVV, but the person that helped me to day is smart friendly and offers 5 star customer service.  The flight attendants were exactly the same way.  Too bad you can't book a flight based on whom is working that day.  Just thought I'd leave a good compliment because a few days ago I realized all I was doing was complaining about bad service when it should be the other way around these people should get a bonus or something."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE/CUSTOMER SERVICE ALL AROUND! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"On Tuesday June 29th, 2021, I boarded my 1st flight with American Airlines, flight 919 from Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, to Dallas, TX with Houston being my final stop.  Whilst boarding the plane, I misread my ticket and once seated was asked very politely to move to my correct seat.  As I began to walk to my seat; which I didn’t need help finding because the numbers above the rows are extremely visible, I was approached by another gentleman, who said and I quote, “Your seat is right here hun.”  Now being as that I am a grown man typing this complaint I feel as in a professional setting anyone should be referred to as “ma’am” or “sir”.  I was on the phone with a colleague of mine when this incident happened and I did say, “This mf just called me hun, that’s so weird.”  Now being as that I was not talking directly to the flight attendant, I didn’t initially think anything was wrong but he heard what I said.  When he heard his exact words were, “If you call me out of my name again, I will get you kicked off the plane” and my response was “I’ve been trying to leave Mexico for 3 days, I haven’t done anything to you and I wasn’t talking to you, therefore if I’m kicked off this plane your job will be in jeopardy.”  Ten minutes later a supervisor by the name of Sara Dinka, asked me to meet her in front of the plane we needed to “talk”.  I continued to leave the plane where she explained that the flight attendant felt “offended” and because of this I was not able to fly. I explained what happened and how the last 3 days I’d been trying to leave Mexico, she told me that it was up to the pilot and continued to tell me I couldn’t fly.  The pilot (William Berg) stepped out of the plane coincidentally and I was allowed to speak with him.  I explained my situation and what happened to the supervisor and the pilot and both did not care about the customer (me).  I was tired of Sara yelling at me so I agreed to leave the plane behind, the only request I had was that I was given the flight attendant’s name or badge number so that I could make a report. Both Sara and William denied me access to the flight attendant’s info and when he heard me asking for it he literally ran to the back of the plane and disappeared.  I walked with Sara as she was yelling at me and telling to calm down.  I begged her to please let me explain my side of the story.  I am very passionate and my voice is very clear so she kept insinuating that I was yelling at her which was upsetting me because I was trying my hardest not to yell or get upset.  At this point, I was on the phone with customer care who continued to tell me that they couldn’t help me with anything except to direct me to the online complaint portal.  I walked back up to Sara calmly with a smile on my face.  She said, “I don’t need you to fake smile at me, it looks very forced.”  I was trying to show her that I was not upset and never was and that was her reply.  She also said 15 times (I counted) that if she booked me on the next flight I couldn’t get into any “altercations” with anyone else or would not be allowed to fly as if I didn’t understand this concept.  Once she spoke with customer service she finally gave me the flight attendant’s, Peter C (skinnier, light complexion guy about 5’8, LGBTQ+) after she said that she never told me she wouldn’t give me his name.  I fly to Dallas and once I arrive I went to recheck my bag, the 2 woman at the AA counter were very rude and were telling me that since my bag tag was hand-written that it was given to me free and that I would have to pay for another one.  One of them eventually attached the one I had.  I walked over to bag drop and a man was there, again an AA employee, but once I dropped my bag he walked away.  Upon my arrival to Houston, I was met with the fact that my bag was left in Dallas.  I hadn’t been to sleep 36 hours and was exhausted from my flight so I got the info I needed and went home.  On June 30th, my bag was delivered.  I opened my bag to find my $150 bottle Versace Eros and my $100 bottle of Millions shattered and spilled all over my new bag and the new clothes that I had purchased for my trip to PV.  I fly Southwest and Delta very often and I’ve been flying for years and have NEVER had an experience like this never even lost a bag.  I am now a REALTOR in the State of Texas, but I worked in customer service as management for 5 years and anyone with sense knows not to yell at a customer especially in a supervisor position.  As an employee not in a position of leadership, you should always respect your customers and refer to them as either ma’am or sir.  It is simply just common courtesy and as far as the pilot, he seemed as if he didn’t care for much of anything.  This is one the WORST experiences I’ve ever had with a customer service official and by far THE WORST experience I’ve ever had with an airline.  I will no longer be flying or referring AA to anyone.  What steps will be taken to correct the actions of these employees?  What reparations will be made to me to make me change my mind about your airline??  Completely UNACCEPTABLE!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,America Airlines WINS award for worst airlines,"Not one to write many reviews but after SO many bad experiences...it gets old.  Flight this morning, departure time moved from 8am to 7:25 back to 7:50 and as I type this at 8:25, we are still sitting here.  A month ago members of our wedding party had their flights changed as they were sitting in the terminal in Dallas.  My wife missed a flight due to them deciding to close the doors early; even though she was on time.  It’s now to the point where it’s comical to be honest. We just know if we HAVE to take AA - just be prepared for delays because they seem to leave whenever they feel like it.  Oh and the excuses!  Idk how they come up with these excuses. “We over-filled the fuel”. “The tug broke when we were pushing back”. “We called your name over the loud speaker and didn’t see you.”  If you have another option, please choose the other route."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Horrible customer service,"This is my final time flying with them. They are always late, missing staff or having mechanical issues. I honestly no longer feel safe flying with them. They had a 2 hour wait for customer service to get a hotel due to their issues with making me miss my layover flight. If I stayed in the line I would’ve been there well last mid night when I and my child had to catch an earlier flight the next morning. AA won’t refund me for the hotel which they were giving vouchers to individuals who informed me the hours they stood on that line without a child. The company is very disrespectful and completely lacks customer service. I do not recommend ever flying with them."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,NO LEGROOM,I’m only 5’6 and it was impossible to pick up anything off the floor. My knees touched the seat in front of me. It was the most uncomfortable flight I’ve ever been on. The seat itself is short. Larger people could barely fit. Worse than taking the greyhound!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Flight EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the WORST flight in my life! Starting in Jax. Two tickets leaving Jax going to Las Vegas. My girlfriends ticket had her middle initial wrong. We got to the airport an hour and a half before the flight. The guy printed our tickets then I informed him her middle initial was wrong. He took our tickets and walked off then came back 10 mins later and said we could not get on the flight and tore our tickets up. He said go to the kiosk and try to reprint the tickets. And to call AA. The plain left without us. We called AA they said they could help us for 250.00 more of a charge. I went upstairs to the people that check your luggage and they said a wrong letter for the middle name does not matter. After we missed our flight. Next we get to Charlotte. Get to our gate with 20 mins to spare they had already shut the doors and gave our seats to someone else. We had to go talk to an agent, more time gone we got on the next flight. I get on the plain someone is in my seat, he said it was his seat, but he moved over to the next seat, then the guy showed up for that seat. It was a mess it took 35 mins to get it straight while a pilot that was flying free sat there and would not give his seat up. What a team player. Well we get to Las Vegas. Coming back We get to the airport at 1230, flight leaving at 905 just in case. We go to check in cant till 505. At 503 I go to check in the kiosk prints my Tickets but no bag tags had to wait 2 mins for bag tags. So I went to counter and after 50 mins a lady helps us get our luggage tagged. All good right NOPE. We go to get on board at 835 the lady tells us our seats have been given to someone else. We had to stand to the side and wait to see if the weight on the plane was low enough for us to get on. WHAT!!!  I weigh 180 my girl weighs 130. Well she lets every one on then calls our name. I had a window seat at first then when we got on the plane I was in the Aisle AGAIN!!!!! The we get to Phoenix on time go to counter and we were told our flight had changed and that we might have to wait for another flight. Well we ended up getting on that flight. Guess what, Yep seat changed in the Aisle again. We get to Charlotte, You guessed it our flight changed, but we complained and got on that flight with different seats. This by far is the WORST AIRLINE in the history of flying!! Then I get home and try to call guess what put off for 4 hrs, I just gave up. I guess the Customer service don`t fall far from the wing!!!! J. D. in Jacksonville Finally!!!! What A JOKE FOR AirLINE!!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,NEVERRRRRR AGAIN ! ! WITH MY 4 YEAR OLD!,"You guys are the definition of "" Mess"" . In every city ! I flew American airlines today with flights that included 3 states , and I thought maybe just one state was a mess .... I flew ATL-DFW-LAX one delay after another and upon leaving DFW while on the runway the pilot announces that we have to pull back in the amount of fuel we have won't get us to LAX 🤯😳I COULDNT MAKE THIS UP...   You guys drug me through 14 hours of travel time with a 4 year old today , I just got out of surgery on my leg. I was supposed to drop my son off with his grandma and I did to leave out of town and I was supposed to fly right back, it's 730pm right now and because of all the delays I missed my return flight back home , and have ZERO options for a flight to Atlanta tonight (No other airlines have openings either ) and I'm having to sleep here at terminal 54A until tomorrow morning 7am  with all the restaurants closed  , sleeping on waiting chairs and a empty stomach. Thank God I was able to get my 4 year old where he needs to be prior to things getting to where I'm at now . NEVER AGAIN I've dealt with delays in the past , but never nothing like this , I got put on  standby flights that both included me having to get on a skytrain to go to with a fresh surgery and a 4 year old , just to tell me they don't have any openings and start right back where I was originally at. A delay is 20-30 minutes maybe a hour . You guys delayed a flight from 1030am until 345pm .  ? You had to go build a new plane real quick ?"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Gate Pass,"My daughter’s 16 yr old childhood friend was returning to Florida after a 2 week visit with us in Dallas.  We went to the ticket counter to request gate passes to make sure she got onto her flight.  The ticket agent was the rudest & incredibly inhumane. Declaring that since my daughters friend was 16-she was an adult & denied us gate passes to see her off safely.  She said it was an American Airlines policy but we’ve done this for the past 3 years with no issues.  When will AA understand customer service & humanity? In addition, I wasn't able to find this policy anywhere on their website."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,This is the most bad airline ever that I have travel in my lives I will never recommend this,This is the most bad airline ever that I have travel in my lives I will never recommend this  ever again
Date of travel: June 2021,20,"Gave it a shot, regret my decision.","I had never flown AA before, but I had heard no so great reviews. I was traveling for an unexpected event and needed a last minute flight. American Airlines was the cheapest so I decided I would go against what the reviews said and trust them. I deeply regret it. The first leg of the flight was 45 minutes late to take off, despite being boarded on time. To make matters worse, this is Southern California where it is almost 100 degrees outside and the ac on the plane isn’t working. Which would not have been a problem except that they made us sit in the plane on the tarmac for 45 minutes when it was 100°F. I was just glad I’d payed a little more with the flight that didn’t have a 35 minute layover because I would have missed my flight. (Thank God I Didn’t)The layover in Phoenix was okay, but again it was unacceptably late. At the time the flight was supposed to leave, the plane we were supposed to be on had not even arrived and yet they had made no announcement of any kind that there was going to be a delay. The only benefit to this flight over the last one is we were able to wait in the terminal instead of on the plane. The flight ended up being an hour late.I give 2 stars because while it was a terrible experience, all of the flight attendants and gate staff were pleasant and helpful as they could be and I understand it is not the customer service people’s fault that their airline is terrible at following their own schedule.Overall it was not a good time and I can safely say I would not recommend American Airlines to anyone who does not want to deal with delays. In the future I will gladly pay more to fly on a different airline I can actually trust to get me where I need to be on time."
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Great staff,"Michelle Williams on flight # 2990 on June 18, 2021, gave us exceptional service. She was kind and considerate. Please reward her for all of her efforts. Her coworker gave us her name because she was reluctant to receive our high esteem. We felt she deserved it."
Date of travel: June 2021,40,My rating depends completely on the city where you experience them.,"It is like a tale of two companies. One in Los Angeles; kind, patient Ticket agents helping you check-in and get to your gate, nice flight, nothing but compliments. As opposed to Dallas, where the gate agents were extremely rude, dismissive, and unhelpful. I overheard a passenger asking about the details of getting into Italy and she was treated disgustingly and dismissively, not by one agent, but all three at the gate. Also, on our way back through Dallas returning from Rome, they must have driven over my bag. It has a huge cut in the hard shell, one wheel was knocked off and the one side was scraped all to hell like they dragged it or jammed it between a truck and the conveyor belt. I've had it for many years and never had any damage, but this looked like the employees in Texas don't have any regard for other people's property. Not sure what the difference with the Dallas employees is, maybe they have all been there too long being in the home base, I'm not sure. But, I do know, a little courtesy and empathy go a long way. Traveling right now is hard enough with all the changes going on and the requirements needed to fly, for both the employees and the passengers; but it would be much better for everyone if we helped one another through the process with patience and courtesy. For the employees of American, isn't going to work and being happy and for those passengers traveling and getting to your destination calmy, both worth working hard for?"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Airline and Service,It started off bad from the beginning by delaying the flight from McAllen to Dallas which caused me to not make my layover to Boise. Then we get to Dallas and they tell me I will not leave until 7pm at night because that's the only flight to Boise so the time comes and we board the plane it's on the track to take off and returns to the terminal and we have to deplane because they canceled the flight. Did not offer anything and we slept in the airport as we were put on standby for the first flight to Boise early in the morning. Coming back home it delays taking off from Boise and then the layover was supposed to take off at 8:56pm and we end up leaving until 10:45pm and landed past midnight. It was horrible as it ruined all our plans with our family. Never again will I use American Airlines to travel.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,worst service and nobody available to answer questions,"AA delayed the flight from Atlanta GA to Miami FL at least 8 times with no reason and no explanation. NO apologies. they simply do not care. flight delay with no reason. They tried not to take me with the connection flight, because the connecrion flight was oversold. thats the main reason for them to delayed flights. I was flying with a Senior and a 4 Years old. They did not care at all. Worst flight ever. I thought AA was a serious airlines. Now I know they are not serious and they do not care about passengers."

Date of travel: June 2021,10,The worst travel experience of my entire life.,"I had a flight from kona to lax and than a connecting flight from lax to Dallas with a final destination to Denver. Upon landing in lax my boyfriend and I got a notification that our flight to Dallas was canceled which we originally were only going to have to wait an hour to board. They changed our flight to having to wait 12 hours overnight at lax. On top of that, we had to wait over 2 hours at the American service desk just to be told basically nothing and not even reassured that our check in bags would be safely rerouted to our destination. Currently writing this review at the lax airport, so I have yet to find out if my luggage will arrive at my destination. My likeliness to recommend would be a negative 100 if I had the option. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT give this airlines your money."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Airlines,By far worst experience. I advise no one to travel with American Airlines. The piolets are extremely lazy and will leave you stranded if they don't feel like flying. Very unprofessional ... Please do NOT waste your money
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worse Airline Ever,Too much to complain about!!  Don't book your flight with AA! You will regret it.  I have been burned too many times. Never Again ...

No apologies, no good explanation, and no reply email from the airline. The most terrible experience I ever have with an airline. It might be a one time thing for them, but it ruined my break."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,No value for life of handicapped,As a frequent flyer I am aware of the many unavoidable issues that can occur. I have been in crazy wait times and even had airplanes take off in 98 degree weather when AC was broke. I have never left one bad comment. Today that ends when you completely disregard the life of my handicapped child. The mommy in my wife was very concerned about my handicapped daughter traveling. After calling American and being assured  she would be personally cared for and not left unattended I convinced my wife that American was a reputable company that would take care of our child. The flight to her location didn't vary from this thought she was escorted through DFW and watched. Then came the trip home through Chicago O'Hair. To give you an idea my daughter's IQ is probably about the level of a 4 year old. She can not read and her speach  is very impaired. She is however 29 years old please don't judge my decision to let her go unless you yourself have spent 6 months side by side in the NICU with you loved one after birth as well as the many hospital stays there after. My wife and I would never endanger her life knowingly. My daughter does however like most of us like to feel somewhat independent. When her brother asked her to come see him she was so excited. We never knew what inherent risks loomed. While my daughter's ticket had every note on it to indicate she can not be left alone. She was wheeled to the next gate and left alone and with out a complete understanding of travel she missed her flight. This was in Chicago O'Hare.The horror started when we received a call from her. She stated she couldn't find  any workers and was left alone at gate. We immediately panicked and told her she had to find someone. She got an agent that knew nothing about her being dropped at the gate. The agent then called a supervisor and you would think our problems would have been over. Not in the least they could not find her another flight out to Jacksonville from Chicago even though it was around 9pm. Then the supervisor started telling us how they could get an Uber driver and hotel for her. Really?  In the middle of Chicago they wanted to have my 4foot mentality delayed daughter catch an Uber and stay in a hotel? After a good 2hours of my wife on the phone asking for  cro which by law we should be able to talk  with having a disabled child we were unable to get him to transfer us. Finally after 2hours they found her a um room which she was supposed to have in the first place. So apparently travel is safe unless you are handicapped.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,They ruined our vacation,"The aircraft suffered some mechanical problems in Omaha. We were late in departng which resulted in our missing the connecting flight in Chicago. We had to stay in the OHare all day. The first day of our vacation. Which cost us $200. We are going to try to recapture that. Not done yet. My wife booked a bag at a cost of $31. They we decided not to use that service because we could not risk a lost luggae situation plus so we carried on. Now they will not refund us our $31 for services we did not use. Company policy. The old standard answer that all the customer service minions are taught to use. How cowardly is that. Now catch this on the way home from Boston we decided to take them up on the free bag policy since the overheads would likely be full. Guess what these bozo's lost one of our bags. This company is the Laurel and Hardy of flying. We are done, How you bettin on getting our $200 back that they cost us for missing the first night of our hotel stay.Don't use American"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst experience I have ever had flying,Well to sum it up landed short of destination to refuel causing a missed connecting flight had no flights till the next day after standing in customer service line for two hours at Chicago O hare airport was not even offered a hotel room the staff was walking away from the desk while there were over thirty people in line leaving one staff member complete disregard for their customers time and money lost out on rental and hotel and other reservations I had booked and to top it off they had me wait three hours for my luggage that they lost so now I’m stranded in Chicago with nothing. I have never in my entire life been so disrepected by a company then I was by the American Airlines staff at Chicago O hare and the worst part after being stuck in the airport for over ten hours the nightmare is still not over American Airlines has gone down hill worse then spirit do not fly with them my flight was flight 695  June 29 Fort Lauderdale to kalispell with connection in Chicago.
Date of travel: June 2021,30,Cross country flight,"Flight was on-time and very full (over booked), plane was clean. Wish they had TVs in the back of the seats, only free movies on your own devices."

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline service known to man,"If the pilot wasn’t subpar enough, the flight attendants are filled with entitlement and lack of customer service experience. It saddens me to see customer service go down the drain through the years at American Airlines. Each time I fly AA, not often, it gets worse and worse.No wonder they are about to bankrupt. AA makes United look like Starbucks of the airlines."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible experience. Ignore American Airlines if possible,Worst experience. Missed my interview. Called customer support but as usual wait time was more than 4 hours.

Weather is not an excuse here.As a result I missed my interview. I hope they change their way of arrogant business.
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Comfortable flight,"The flight from DC to NY was a lot quicker than scheduled. As soon as the pilot reached cruise altitude, it was time to descend. After analyzing train vs flying, I would definitely recommend flying for this route. Both airports are a little historic. I can remember when DCA was just called National and the namesake of LGA was a very popular person in American history"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES,I have never experienced such poor and unprofessional customer service in any business. The checkin staff and rebooking staff are absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this airline to any traveler. My flight was delayed from 9 to 1:30 AM with no reason or any clarification provided to customers while we sat in panic hoping that our flight would arrive. If you value your hard earned money so no spend or with such a horrible airline. Covid effects various daily operation but basic customer service should not be absent at any time. Very disappointed I hope I never have to used this airline again.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Terrible, Terrible airline","I flew to and from Baltimore from Texas. Both flights in and out were canceled last minute. Ended up having to take 3 flights to just barely make it to my grandmother's funeral in time...and when flying back home I ended up stuck in Dallas when I needed to be in tyler with no other flights til 5 pm the next day. They even kept my luggage! So now I have to wait until late night tomorrow to get any of my things (whenever they so kindly decide to send it to my original destination), and find myself a ride to Tyler at 1 a.m. so I can make it to work in the morning. Screw this airline, they are the worst and I would much sooner eat from a toilet, than ever use this garbage airline again. How hard is it to keep up with YOUR OWN FLIGHT SCHEDULES THAT YOUR OWN COMPANY SCHEDULED??? THERE IS NO REASON ALL OF MY FLIGHT SHOULD BE CANCELED, I BOOKED 3 MONTHS IN ADVANCE FOR A REASON."

Go to their facebook page and look at how many negative comments and that’s all you need to see.WORST AIRLINES EVER…..DO NOT FLY AMERICAN airlines FOR NO REASON, you will be sorry!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,50,My family trip from Boston to Honolulu,"I want to mention about a great service at the check-in counter of American Airlines @Boston Logan.

Great service from American Airlines check-in counter agent. THANK YOU!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Will never fly American Airlines again,"American Airlines airline is always problematic. I booked my last flight because it was a one-way to my destination. AA changed my flight to be a connecting flight. It was supposed to be a 90-minute flight but turned into a 6-hour ordeal. The staff was rude, unhelpful, and unknowledgeable l. Alcohol was not offered and for drinks we had a choice of water or orange juice. The live TV feature in the AA app wasn't working for any of the four flights. The worst part is that AA lost my bag. I had to buy clothes and other items and didn't have my medicine with me. I didn't even want to check my bag - they forced me to check it at the gate. They have been a pain to deal with about the lost bag. Their customer service is so terrible. I will never be flying on this airline again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Not child friendly experience,"During this flight, I was traveling with my 2 children, ages 12 years old and 12 months old. During the flight, an attendant approached me and said my 12 month old son could not watch to the musical cartoon he on his tablet without headphones because it was bothering others on the flight. The attendant made it clear he did not care that I was just trying to keep my son entertained on the evening flight to prevent him from screaming on the 4 hour flight. If this is the representation of your airline, I don’t feel parents are welcome to bring their children on flights."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! Will never fly with AA again.,"Spent 5 hours on hold while trying to find a new connecting flight because the original flight got delayed.

I will NEVER fly with this awful airlines again!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible professionalism in JFK,"If you buy garbage, you get garbage. Avoid Chaos in the line, terrible work in check-in, unfriendly supervisor.

They got money from the government for nothing...Stay away from this airline even paying more."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Cancelled flight because of poor planning.  SHAME ON YOU AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!,SHAME ON YOU AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!DO NOT OFFER FLIGHTS if you don't have the staff to run the flight!!!  No backup solution for canceled flight either.SHAME ON YOU!!!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Got nothing for the price of my ticket,"First flight was 3 hours late due to mechanical problems, rebooked a terrible three-part connection and then the middle connecting flight was canceled about 10 minutes before I was due to board the first flight. I bought a one way from another airline to get to my destination. Then I found out that they had canceled my return flights. They said that since I had not boarded the rebooked flight, the entire ticket was void. ""You will have to buy a new ticket"". I bought it from another airline, of course. Never again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,TERRIBLE. Delayed my flight with no solution. Missed important meeting.,The worst airline to ever exist. They delayed my flight so then I will essentially miss my connecting flight. Their solution was to drop me off at an airport three hours from where I needed to be. Are you serious? I am missing a very important business meeting and losing hotel I booked. This company is garbage and deserves to go under. We hate you American Airlines!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Cancelled flight and didn’t call me back,"So my original flight was canceled due to bad weather. Totally understandable, however, they did absolutely nothing to accommodate customers who got stuck due to this. The next flight they had to offer was two days later, nearly doubling my stay. I tried to call them multiple times, the first of which they called me back at 2 am so I obviously did not see it until morning. I tried calling a few more times to hopefully at least get some kind of partial refund for the flight as it caused me to miss an entire day of work and have to book a hotel for two nights. They put me on an indefinite “callback list” which they never returned the call for. Unless something drastic happens, will never fly with them and will urge friends and family to use a better service."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible,"Where do I begin? Yesterday I flew from New Orleans to Lake Tahoe for a vacation. The flight from New Orleans to Dallas had no issues. The plan was to meet up with my sister in Dallas (she flew from Houston) and fly together to Reno. Her flight was delayed 20 minutes leaving Houston for weather. We both knew we already had short layovers. When I got to my terminal in Dallas, I called her and she had JUST landed from Houston and she was at a different terminal. I went to the desk at the gate and told them my sister's AMERICAN AIRLINES flight was delayed leaving Houston and she was at DFW walking to the terminal now. The flight attendant was EXTREMELY RUDE and said ""if she doesn't get here by the cutoff time we are closing the doors. Tell her to hurry up."" I then called her and relayed the information to her and the flight attendant said ""if she's not here in 8 minutes (15 mins before take off) I'm closing my doors"".  Keep in mind this basic economy flight was $800. Wouldn't you think the flight attendants would work with her since her connecting flight was also American Airlines? Nope!After that whole charade, thankfully she made it on the flight.  The flight itself was the worst flight I've ever been on. The landing was extended about 20 minutes because the pilot was trying to avoid a paraglider. Understandable. However, the landing was the most motion-sickness inducing flight landing I have ever experienced (and I fly a lot). The pilot did not communicate to us except ONCE throughout the whole 40 minute landing. Usually they warn of a bumpy landing. It felt like a roller coaster. I as well as MULTIPLE others on the flight VOMITED PROFUSELY FOR 30 minutes straight. I have NEVER gotten motion sickness on a flight before. No apology or communication or anything from the pilot or the flight attendants. Nobody brought us extra throw up bags or napkins. Some peoples vomit was leaking on the floor. Just disgusting. Thank god, we landed safely! Then we received an email that my sister (who came from Houston)'s bag was delayed. Her bag is on another flight. It is now the next day and no bag. It's almost impossible to get in touch with American Airlines. When you try to call, it's a dead end and doesn't even give you options of speaking with a robot let alone a human. The man at baggage claim was also extremely rude. We are now on vacation in Tahoe .and she doesn't have a bag and the tracking feature online is useless. I can confidently say that this day of traveling was the absolute worst I've experienced. I fly often, about 1/2 the time on American and can say I will never fly American again."

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible customer service,Worst customer service ever. Look at my hold time . 5 hours and still no agent . This is ridiculous SMFH
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Misery,American Airlines is miserable.  They sat me next to an unaccompanied minor who sneezed all over me the entire three hours.  I had to help and babysit the kid as the flight attendant sat up front in first class.  They had to ask someone to volunteer to leave the plane because the overbooked.  And the door was broken so once we were all on board the maintenance crew had to come out and we were further delayed.  The planes are old and dirty.  Felt unsafe.  Won't fly with them again.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Trash people. Trash planes. Trash service,"Horrible customer service. Attempted to communicate with employees over luggage/ gate terminals, they made everything difficult and was informed wrong twice. Treated as if was an animal when I was just attempting to ask why things where being done so differently from when I flew from FL. My carry on bag of small size was told it had to be throwin in with main luggage when this wasn't so when leaving from Florida. Do note that plane size never change through this entire process."

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Review of American Airlines:  Horrible Experience,"I booked a round-trip ticket from Madison, Wi to Ontario, Ca, and back.  On both my flight to Ontario, and then the return trip to Madison, Wi were marked by several hour delays on both trips. One delay was in Phoenix, and the other in Dallas.  Each time we were given multiple reasons for the hours long delays, and each story was different.  What it seemed to come down to was there weren't any planes available.  The delays went on and on for 4 and 5 hours.  And each delay was prefaced by a new and different explanation each time.  I do not intend to fly American Airlines again.  The airline should really offer at least a partial refund to each passenger who experienced these delays.  If the hours spent on delays were calculated in terms of my salary per hour as a therapist, I lost at least $1500.  And, I could have spent these 10 hours with my family on both ends of the trip.  Just not okay.  Never again will I fly American.  Done."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The worse customer service ever,"I see hardly any good review for this airline !! At Birmingham desk the  travelers looks like prisoners and the and aa crews are wardens!! rude , screaming and unfriendlyThe cops had to stay at the station because some travelers lost their temper  because of the attitude and it came from the SUPERVISORS !!!!!!NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN WITH IS AIRLINE NO MATTER WHAT"
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Never Again!,"I was so excited to finally fly first class!  Unfortunately, it was not a great experience.  I was given soda and snack mix just like the people in economy.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!  The price of my ticket was almost the price of 2 economy seats.  The only benefit was being able to board /exit the plane first.   In first class, there needs to be more bells and whistles!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Airlines no Longer Care About Their Passengers,"Our Flight from Boise to Tampa, with a connecting flight in DFW was supposed to depart at 15:30, but was delayed. This, of course, adds stress when you know you may very well miss your connecting flight. Our flight finally left at about 16:45. We get to DFW, and our connecting flight was also delayed, which I thought was a blessing: I was wrong!  AA had to change planes, which resulted in three different gate changes and over 6 hours of waiting. Not so long ago, airlines would offer vouchers or discounts/ meal coupons, or something!  Those days are long gone!  No matter how severely you've been inconvenienced, the airlines just don't care. Domestic flying is now a nightmare and a non-enjoyable experience which I no longer look forward to."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worse,"Our red eye family flight to Miami has been suddenly canceled today. Our final destination is St. John's USVI. We have a connecting flight from  MIA to St Thomas AA943. We had booked a taxi to pick us at St. Thomas @ 2:30 pm to take us to the ferry  on Sunday 6/27. We had paid the ferry tickets online as well. Then our rental car was awaiting for us at the ferry area which has been paid for as well.  Also we booked a VRBO house.  We no way of contacting anyone in your airline. We have called and left all numbers and wait for a call for 4+ hrs. What is this ? We need to get tho St. Thomas tomorrow or cancel our trip completely and we are not sure we will get a refund. It took a lot of time and effort and logistics to plan their trip and a couple years of savings to bring my grandkids with me. This is very irresponsible on your part to cancel all of the sudden and not even have the decency of calling the passengers is to try to find an alternative. We paid for tickets, taxis, ferry's, cars, house and we want to support the economy during these hard times. I am not sure I can repeat this trip again next year as they are going to be in school. This is terrible and disappointing."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible experience,"Horrible experience. Will not recommend them or fly with them again. They changed our flights and with that our seats so that the people in my party were no longer sitting together. We talked to three different employees, sent an email that no one replied to, waited on hold twice for over an hour, as well as an hour on their chat feature where no one would fix what they changed unless we paid for it."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible experience,Where do I start... my entire flight experience going and coming was horrible the customer service was horrible the workers were very rude long story short going to MIA our flight was overbooked so they had us put on another flight which didn’t leave until 4 hours later so me and my guests spent 4 hours in the airport waiting on this flight just to realize we were on standby they kept telling us they only had room for 2 ppl which was not an option after getting the runaround they finally figured it out and we were able to board the flight but we were separated on the plane I have reached out to there customer service several times I got no response no accommodations were offered this is the worst airline to fly with I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AIRLINE.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Had to steal another flights pilot… RIP Roswell.,"We showed up to the gate 2 hours prior to the expected departure time but got overwhelmed by the number of texts for delays for our flight. We were supposed to take off at 5 pm but got delayed for 6 hours. AND THIS WASNT THE END OF THIS CRAP! After we made plans for an overnight layover, we were told that a pilot was on the way from a nearby city which was a 3 hour drive away. And on top of all of this, we weren’t even given service in the plane, and our bags arrived 4 days late to the wrong city, and when we finally got it back, items were missing from the bag, and the bag itself was damaged! If you even have one brain cell left, DO NOT TAKE AA!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"First class ticket, but third class service","Recently took a trip to SLC from DFW and decided to fly first class.  Before we took off there was a problem with the aircraft so they had to call maintenance.  I thought, ""no problem"", I'm in first class and surely they'll provide us with drinks and snacks.  Nope!  I asked for a soft drink and was told they couldn't serve us anything until we were in the air.  That's funny because one of their competitors starts serving first class passengers when their butt hits the seat.  Anyway 2 hours later and we are finally underway.  We get airborne and my first class ticket gets me a fruit and cheese snack...no meal, just a snack...in first class.  The flight attendant was not attentive because she was on her phone.  Pic included."

Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Inhumane, AVOID!","This airline should be shut down!My wife and I arrived hours early for a morning flight, with our infant. Here’s a snap shot of what ensued…Two hour flight delay 1 terminal change (long walk)2 gate changes Boarded the plane…got on the runway, then taxied back to the gate…Then the crew and pilots timed out and ditched us.Then, never ending postponements and lies about trying to find another crew. Meanwhile another AA flight to the same destination (scheduled for much later) gets a crew no problem. “Customer Service” (what a joke) lies and tries to dodge questions for 12 HOURS. Won’t help anyone with the truth so that they have an opportunity to make other arrangements. Won’t get our bag that was checked. So, we’re just essentially held hostage from morning to night. In the late hours of the evening, they cancel the flight and we drive home around 10pm…again, we’ve had an infant with us the whole time. Worst. Airline. Ever. Inhumane treatment. And nobody at the desk at the gate has the slightest clue. Don’t even get me started on the 50 text alerts. No refund. No apology. No effort to get a checked bag even though the plane isn’t gonna go anywhere ever.Thanks for ruining our planned anniversary trip. Never again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Believe the Bad Reviews,"I’ll second what everyone else is saying in the overwhelming amount of negative comments here: avoid this airline like the plague. Not even Spirit or Frontier have demonstrated this level of incompetence. I was flabbergasted.The checkin process at JFK was particularly unpleasant and chaotic. There were a very limited amount of employees (four) working at the counter for multiple international flights, and we were all grouped into one line which stretched around the terminal. The line moved terribly slow and multiple people missed their flights (it must be noted that I arrived at the airport almost 3 hours before my flight). When I finally reached the counter, after 1.5 hours in line, the employee who was helping me was extremely rude and indifferent, snapping at me whenever I asked a simple question in a friendly manner. She was also working at a painfully slow speed. Her printer wasn’t working to print my bag tags, so she sent me to another employee, who was equally as rude. I understand these individuals have difficult jobs, but a level of respect and professionalism is expected.I understand that a few things are out of the company’s hands - including delays, etc. (My flight was delayed 22 (!) hours for mechanical issues.) What I will not tolerate is the unprofessionalism that I experienced by the American Airlines employees at JFK and over the phone/chat service. It’s incomprehensible the amount of incompetence and indifference I encountered by these employees - often throwing their hands up in defeat when their computers weren’t working, not being proactive, not caring about customer concerns, etc. As an American citizen, experiencing something like this makes me embarrassed for America in general - let alone a company that has the audacity to use “America” in it’s name. You would never encounter this kind of service at Middle Eastern airlines, etc. In fact, of the 80+ countries that I’ve traveled to, I have never encountered rudeness like this.I will not be flying American again. Period."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Trash Customer Service,"They changed my flight twice in a day and at the end of the day they change my boarding pass to a stand by flight meaning "" if you are lucky, you get the seat"" well I waited 4 flight and I didn't get lucky so they changed my flight for the next day again!!! 2 days in a row. It is a foolish. Terrible experience."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst experience,"We arrived two hours before our flight. It was domestic!  The check in and bag drop off area was a mess. There was no structure and no direction. There were very few people working to help. And the workers checking you in and taking your bags were working at such a lasidazical pace, it felt like they were the ones going on vacation. I am a seasoned traveler and have been in the airport with way more people then I saw at 430am this morning. There was no urgency to get people help, information or the bags dropped.  People were in the wrong lines all over and they only had two people taking bags. There were easily over 500 people walking around like jerks not knowing what to do. WE ALMOST MISSED OUR FLIGHT.  All of our bags were checked and looked through in security so that part is on the poorly trained and staffed TSA. But it was also a night.  They found nothing in our bags;  like the person scanning it had no explanation to why it was put to the side. They had to hold our flight and door. My sister with a hip replacement and cousin with a boot on her foot for a fracture had to run to the gate! The stress of the ladies at the gate desk telling us we weren't ganna be let on made the morning sour. Then on the connecting flight gave one of our flyers a wrong boarding pass splitting us up. It was corrected but still stressful. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!! I will never fly american airlines again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Horrible customer service and staff, unreliable air service","I’ve been trying to get to military training for nearly 3 days, each time they cancel the flight or roll onto the next one. When they cancel a flight they don’t tell you, when they reschedule they don’t tell you and of the changes, and when they roll you over there’s no guarantee you’ll get the seat you already bought.If you’re gonna fly, fly elsewhere, American Airlines doesn’t respect its passengers or employees."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Poor customer service after mechanical delay,"Delays happen when you travel. Especially connecting through O'Hare. But the way AA handled our delay last night was exceptionally poor. Our 2 hour mechanical delay and 8:45pm arrival resulted in about 100 people missing connecting flights and getting stuck in Chicago overnight. The solution? Flight attendants didn't have answers, they directed us to a customer service line upon arrival. The line was so long, I waited 1 hour 20 minutes. During that wait I also waited 30 minutes for the live chat operator on their app (who couldn't help me with a voucher or even answer voucher questions. She said I had to speak with an agent in person) . The AA employees at other gate desks who had no line said they couldn't help us, only customer service. I saw the same 3 AA gate employees walking back and forth, talking, laughing, and ignoring our long line. Until about an hour into the wait when one of them started helping people at his gate. Not one person came to us in line to explain what was happening, our options, to direct us to shorter lines, nothing. I tried researching how the vouchers work on the aa website. I found a statement about them helping me find a hotel if I needed help. So I thought I'd  be getting a credit toward a hotel near the airport. No so. The only option was a voucher for a comfort inn in Schamburg 20 minutes away . Plus a voucher for a taxi ride there but no ride back to the airport. It would have been much better if the idle AA employees had offered to help us at their empty stations or stopped to ask if any of us had questions. It also would be much better to get the option to receive a refund for the value of the hotel and meal. I don't care if that meant it was only $50. At least it's better than this. Very poor. BTW even though my next flight was 3pm the next day, the meal voucher I got was $12 ""redeemable where accepted."" I have yet to find where that is."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Angry!!!,Believe EVERY REVIEW YOU SEE!! They have no attendees for our flight and we been here since 3am it’s now 1030am and they can’t get in touched with none of their staff members.. They’re not trying to accommodate no one and they have us waiting with no information given!!! Every other airline is not having these issues!! They’re understaffed and still booking flights messing up everyone’s travel plans without a care in the world!!! They need to be shut down this is insane! Save your money and book else where!!!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Title,"Bumps you from seats and flights with absolutely no explanation other than ""because we can"". Absolutely terrible."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline company,"I have flown many of times through out my life and I have never had as bad of a time flying.  They delayed the flight 4 hours and then made me miss my second flight. They also didn’t let my carry on size backpack come on because they said it wouldn’t fit. I put it in the sizer and it did fit in their standards. They still wouldn’t allow it to be brought it. It’s ridiculous the way they carry themselves for such a well know company. Very unimpressed, I will never fly again with this company."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines is awful,"My first flight was delayed due to mechanical issues, which made me miss my second flight. I was then placed on a later flight which was delayed 3 hours due to weather. Because the SECOND delay was due to weather, the airline refused to cover the cost of a hotel. O'Hare reps were rude & dismissive throughout this ordeal. I will never fly AA again & recommend noone else does either."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Avoid Cancun at all costs,"Avoid all travel to Cancun.  As I was about to board my American Airlines flight from the Cancun airport to Miami, the gate agent who scanned my ticket told me I had been ""selected "" and directed me to a nearby table where a female Mexican official was seated.  This official proceeded to order me to remove my outer shirt,  my shoes and socks, and lift up my tee shirt to expose my stomach area.  She then stuck her hands down my pants and swabed around my entire waist below the belt line.  This was done right in front of all boarding passengers in full view of the public.  In the United States we would call this a sexual assault.   Unbelievable.   I will never return to Mexico and risk this ""routine random passenger search."""
Date of travel: June 2021,20,I thought I'd learned...,"This was a stop for a connecting flight from Richmond, VA to McAllen, TX.  Our flight was delayed, then cancelled.  We were put on standby for a later flight.  My wife was able to get on the flight, which left later than expected.  She didn't get home until 4 AM.  I was put on a flight the following morning.  It was delayed until noon.  We flew almost halfway to our destination when we were told we'd be returning to DFW due to a sensor.  Finally got another flight at 3:30 that afternoon.  Oh...and our luggage was not sent with us.  We got that 2 days later.  We weren't offered vouchers or anything.  Will not use AA again.If you don't have the crew for your flights, don't offer them"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Avoid them at all cost these days.,"I had a trip scheduled on 19 of June, 2021, from Dallas to Chicago which got delayed around 5 times and we entered the airlines to tell us later that the trip have been cancelled, this is not the worst part yet, I have waited on a line for around 4 hours to get a new ticket from them and the customer service agent told me wait for a call to get your bags back and I was waiting for that for a whole day, then I did contact customer service to ask where are my bags, they told me,  your backs have traveled to Chicago and hand off to another airlines!!!! like WHAT, who told you to do this!!!! the agent told me I don't know what to tell you this is all I know!! not only this my bags have  been waiting by the other airline which is Royal Jordanian for 4 days and guess what, yes they did steal items from my bags and said it is not our responsibility."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Peanut/Tree Nut Allergies,"I am extremely disappointed in the way a flight attendant handled our initial concern. I was traveling with my daughter that has peanut/tree nut allergies. We did what we were told by alerting the person at the gate and again when boarding the plane. We also understand American Airlines' ""allergy policy"" and we were only asking them to make an announcement and the flight attendant blew everything out of proportion. Before the plane disembarked, we were asked to come up to the front of the plane by one of their ""Customer Relations Reps"", he explained their policy and suggested that my daughter not fly if her allergies are so severe. I felt, he was basically asking us to find another way back to the United States. My daughter at this point is upset and crying as she did not expect this unwanted attention the flight attendant created. We stayed on the flight and nothing was said to us until it was time to disembark from the plane. Said flight attendant once again pointed us out to the Charlotte Customer Relations Rep as we are leaving the flight and we were once again pulled aside to discuss American Airlines' ""allergy policy"". The representative on the ground in Charlotte had printed out their policy and proceeded to explain it to us, she thought she was helping us but only continued the embarrassment. We had no other issues with our other flights but this one was beyond disturbing in the way the issue was handled. I had no idea how bad American Airlines is regarding food allergies until we were home and googled it. American Airlines is rated No. 1 as the worst airline to use for traveling with food allergies."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The WORST airline there is…,"American Airlines is the worst airline possible, they are the epitomy of failure. A bunch of inhuman, robotic and racist people work at this airline. Every time I have used this airline, it never failed to validate that to me. I try to avoid them when possible, but sometimes I have no choice, sadly:They somehow always manage to put me in group 9 (last group), they don’t make the effort to seat together people traveling together, and on my last trip returning to Boston, they selectively chose to argue that my carry-on needed to be checked in (not treating the carry-ons before me and after me in the same way) yet the cabin luggage compartments had lots of space left upon departure. I am landing in Boston very late at night and I have delicate things that need to be carefully handled. They simply did not care and didn’t want to hear any of it. That very same carry-on has gone with me on several trips and it has never been an issue. It’s always passed. Why does it always have to be AA that thinks they are better than the rest of the flying world…?Please, if you have the option, simply do not travel with them. The customer service is as bad as it can get. Why are we making such companies richer…?"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst customer service ever,"Don’t waste your time flying American. I had three different itineraries trying to get to my destination. They kept delaying flights due to “mechanical” issues and I ultimately didn’t make it PDX the day I was supposed to, and missed the funeral for my long time partners dad. Then on the flight home, I was an hour into my second flight when we turned around and went back due to yet another mechanical issue. Sat there for 8 hours before we got home at 5:30 in the morning when I was supposed to land at 10:30 the night prior. The whole trip was a disaster. And when I wrote to American Airlines, they wouldn’t give me appropriate compensation. Not even pay for my $40 uber I had to get to go home after getting in 8 hours late and I couldn’t get a ride as people were sleeping…instead they blamed it on me as the customer. I should have been more prepared for unexpected delays. I’m sorry I wasn’t prepared to deal with the absolute dumpster fire of a flight experience they created both to and from. Yikes. Do yourself a favor and pay a little more to fly delta."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Customer Service Ever!,It all started in San Juan waiting in line for over an hour to talk to an employee about our flight. Come to find out the person in the front spent over an hour with the only employee there and wasn't even there for that flight. They did not call for extra people or a supervisor. When approaching another lady that arrived she refused to help and told us to continue waiting even though we told her we HD been waiting an hour and she refused to call for help or get a supervisor. When we got on the plane the flight attendants could not be bothered for anything because she was on her personal phone. Her and another flight attendant were talking crap about only giving one snack per person and that they didn't have more and everyone will just deal with it. After we finally got to DFW we had another issue getting our baggage. It took them 50 minutes just to show up after the guy said he would be right there. Then he wouldn't even look up our tickets but instead went locker to locker and refused to open them for us to see when asked. We had to go through all lockers twice because of this. I have never been so furious in my life. The lack of customer service and human decency is beyond me. Especially when you have employees just walking by saying they don't know and can't be bothered to call to get someone with answers. We will not be flying with American ever again!
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Great service!,"I had a great experience with American Airlines flying from California to Chicago and then from Chicago to Traverse City. Despite delays due to weather in Chicago, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and worked quickly to ensure we were able to make it to Chicago to catch our connecting flights.  My flight from Chicago to TC was delayed almost four hours and we sat on the plane out on the tarmac for the bulk of that time but staff were very friendly and lightened the tension. Staff helped me lift my luggage to the overhead which was great. They handed out snacks and drinks and the pilot had a good sense of humor about the situation which helped. They gave us updates to explain the situation and what the next steps would be and eventually the pilot was able to fly us home after a big thunderstorm. AA offers free in flight entertainment which is great; there are lots of shows and movies to choose from on your preferred device and it makes the flight go by much faster. Thank you to AA for your great service! I would recommend them to anyone."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Do not expect to reach your destination w/in 5 hours of the planned time,"Out of the 10 American Airlines flights I've taken in the last 2 years, EVERY SINGLE ONE has had 3-7 hour delays. But the worst part is, the won't update the departure time until they are already 15 minutes behind, so you don't have a chance to consider other options (switching to other AA flights, getting a rental car, etc). Today for example, my flight was delayed by 30 minutes 3 times. When I looked up my flight online I saw that my plane was still at it's previous destination, and not due to arrive until 4 hours after my departure time. Why not just be honest and say the flight will be delayed 4 hours!?! I could have driven the rest of the way in that time, or switched to one of the other 3 American Airlines flights leaving going to the same destination. Again, this is just one example, but this happens EVERY SINGLE TIME. And they aren't even a budget airline!!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines Gave My Seat Away,"I was checking in to go to my wedding in Dominican Republic and had my ticket that was purchased months ago. They informed me that they didn't have room for my one carry-on bag. I had friends on the flight who saw someone in the seat that I paid for months ago. They gave my seat away. They then put me on another flight where I had to stay overnight in Tampa and pay for a room plus cab fares. They would not even pay for the room. I almost missed my wedding that we spent thousands of dollars on. That is the last time that my family and I and our businesses will use American Airlines. We have had multiple bad experiences with American Airlines. Since we have switched to different airline companies, we have had great service and experiences. I do not recommend to ever use American Airlines. There are better airline companies to use."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Cancelled my flight. Horrible customer care.,"I was flying internationally for a 26 hr long trip total and my last part of the trip was on American airlines. They suddenly cancelled my trip from Chicago to Indianapolis without telling me. Since the later flight that day was full, I would have needed to wait two days to get a confirmed flight to Indianapolis. They refused to provide any compensation such as hotel or meal voucher etc meanwhile. I barely had any cash and was basically left to fend for myself in a new country. When I tried to cancel my flight and go by train their website didn't work and kept telling me the information I've entered was not valid and to wait 24 hours. This was the experience of other people as well. I called their customer service to make the cancellation and stayed for 35 mins of the line. No one replied. While they didn't offer me a hotel room, they offered a discounted room but the amount of discount was not clear as the rooms near the hotel were pricy. When i tried to call to clarify i stayed on hold for 15 mins and got a machine telling me no one was available and to leave a message. My 26 hr trip ended up being a 40 hr one at least and costed me extra money. Made me late to meetings i had set up and had to reschedule almost causing me to lose a deal."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Last minute canceled flight by American,"I was scheduled to return to Phoenix on American. I had booked it with my miles through its partnership with Alaska Airlines. American canceled my flight a few hours before it was to take off and I was two hours away from the airport. I had to get home to work so had to book a flight ASAP that I had to pay for. The option American texted me with was the next day, which would not work for me. They were not available for a phone call, obviously. I contacted both Alaska Airlines and American when I got home. After trying for two days and waiting hours to talk to a representative, American said they would not reimburse me for the flight I had to pay for because I did it through a third party. Alaska reimbursed some of my miles, but would not reimburse me for the ticket because they said it was American's fault. Suffice it to say, I will not be flying American again."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,No Refund,"I was on my honeymoon and we had an upgrade for first class for both my wife and I. Her ticket didn't upgrade so they gave us two other seats NOT in first class and we went back to our original seats. American charged my card for my upgrade but told me that it would be refunded since I did not sit in First Class and went back to sit with my new wife since it was THEIR computer that messed up and did not give us both First Class tickets.They will not refund my upgrade purchase of $720.00. I keep calling customer service but they won't help, they say I have to put the the request in online. When I do that, it says pending and has said pending for 6+ months.I have a high status with American and pay for Lounge access. I would have never thought they would steal $720.00 like this."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never use AA travel Agency!!!!,"Horrible customer service, rude, and not helpful. I travel a lot and have use many other agencies and I have never ran into the issues I ran into using them as my travel agency."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,MD,"Worst customer service, they printed wrong boarding pass twice and we were late to the flight because of that! The staff on the flight are extremely rude and unprofessional and they should get more training on how to talk to the passengers Gotta only give credit to the supervisor for waiting for us when the delay happened due to their mistake! Worst experience ever! Won’t use this airline again"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Pick another airline,"Horrible … no customer service, never on time look up all the crap they’ve done since the pandemic fly a different airline."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible customer service totally unprepared,Sure the pandemic and recent return to relative normalcy have caused challenges for everyone but American Airlines is about the worst I've encountered in trying to give customers a reason to support them during the recovery.  If you are not going to have sufficient flights to accommodate people wanting to travel you should at least provide descent customer service.  Our initial outbound flight was inexplicably  delayed multiple times necessitating rebooking of the connection.  The gate agent was totally annoyed that  flight had to be rebooked even though we were the ones being inconvenienced.  Though I have flown the route many times and there are several other cities you can connect through she refused to send us through any airport other than Charlotte.  When I asked about other connections she got wven more unpleasant and said there were none.  I called American Express who I booked the tickets through since American wanted $50 to talk to agent and have them make reservations. American Express found three other flights that all got me home earlier and went through cities OTHER THAN Charlotte.  I had similar problems with the last American flight we took before the pandemic started.  Who needs the aggravation of multiple flight delays and nasty gate agents!??!  We're done with American!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline ever.,Worst airline in the history of airlines. Completely disrespectful to their customers & could care less whether you get to where you are going on time. Our flight was 2 hours late and they gave us no explanation and made us miss our connecting flight with another one of their flights. We missed the flight by 5 mins and they wouldn’t hold the gate for us and there are no more flights to our destination for another day or so. NEVER AGAIN.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Honeymoon disaster,"From the time I got to the airport in Kansas City, I was not a fan of AA. It was our honeymoon, our first flight was canceled (okay, things happen), AA flew us to Chicago instead (thats a long way from Hawaii)...on the 9 hour flight from Chicago to Honolulu, the flight attendant insisted my husband and I separate so a family to sit together (it was a full flight and he refused to look for an alternative). Once we landed in Honolulu We were quickly told by the health screeners at the airport that we had the wrong covid test and we would be quarantined during our honeymoon. As if that wasn’t bad enough, AA didn’t send our luggage on to Kona, although it was marked to go on, and the man at the Honolulu baggage claim told the Kona baggage attendant that he was too busy to look for our luggage. I wrote to AA last week and have yet to hear back. I really hope they make this right. We flew over 20 hours just to be told we would need to quarantine or leave...they need to do better."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible airline,Worst airline I’ve ever used in my life! Flight was canceled and rescheduled for 8 hours later and then delayed again for another hour and a half. Never in my life have I had such a bad experience with an airline. They should just shut down!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible customer service,American Airlines has terrible customer service. They don't care about their customers. Pick another airline. Not recommended
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Cancelled Flight,The airline rebooked our friends we were traveling with on a different flight for the same day.  The rebooked us for the following day which meant an additional $700 for lodging.  an additional night for our car back home and coordinating someone to watch our dog another night.Horrible communication and service.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,not recommended,"it the worst company ever and the customer service ""Galliani giancalo"" are not professional at all 😡"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline ever!,"We made a huge mistake of trying to save a few dollars and fly with American airlines. They will NEVER get another dollar from me. The staff at the gates were the rudest bunch of people I've ever had the misfortune of having to deal with. On several occasions they made elderly customers sob! I mean huge tears.  The flights with the exception of one flight attendant (had a layover) were the rudest people ever! I get you basically work in a tin can but sh*t! Every single time they pushed the carts around I got hit on the knees or arms. I get it no problem there, but hell say sorry apologize SOMETHING! I can't count the time the flight attendants walked into me! A person behind me bumped into a male flight attendant and you would have thought the world was going to end.  The guy got extremely angry with the customer! On our adventure home our flight got canceled. Ok not the end of the world. Book a later flight same day whatever,  but oh no AMERICAN AIRLINES moved our flight from that day to the next without any warning! We were lucky and checked the app often! We were lucky and caught it. We had to pay to get home that day.  This company again will never get my business again,  and I can promise after watching and listening to people around us they lost a lot of repeat business and respect.  Do yourself a favor fly a different airline or drive, take a train,  bus, boat, walking would have been better at one point! BUYER BEWARE!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Will not fly American again.,"My husband and I booked a flight from Memphis to SanAntonio (connecting flight in Dallas) a month ago.  We checked in early (the night before), got to the airport over an hour early, and did not check any bags. There was ONE security line for the ENTIRE Memphis airport, which wrapped all the way around to the left side terminal.  It took more than half an hour of standing in line before we even got TO the security check point.  We got to our gate 12 minutes early and the couple in front of us were having issues with their tickets.  It took both American Airlines employees to get the issue resolved and by that time it was 8 minutes before our scheduled flight.  When it was our turn, the AA employee, who  then told us that there were no seats left and that the gate closes exactly 8 minutes before our scheduled flight.  Our flight had to be rescheduled, my husband and I were seated in completely different areas of the plane, and our plans for that day had to be cancelled since we would not be arriving on time."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines have zero care about their customers,Absolutely no care for their customers. They left myself and my wife stranded in Dallas with no help for a hotel or transportation. Our flight was suppose to leave at 10:00 and now we will be lucky to get a flight at 10:00 the following morning. American Airline has lost my business completely.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Very poor customer service,"My flight from LAX to Chicago was delayed for an unknown reason.  The flight left late, and arrived late into Chicago.  I made it to the gate for the flight to State College at the exact time the plane was to leave.  I had been told by a flight attendant that they will often hold a plane if they know passengers are late because of a late connecting flight, especially if the flight is the last one of the day to that destination.  They did not hold the plane, even though there were several of us that were affected.  The soonest flight to State College left 24 hours later.  The plane to State College should have been held for us.  It was obvious that this was the reason we were late, and holding the plane would have been the right think to do.  The fact that they didn't do so shows a real disrespect for their customers.  What harm would it have done to hold the plane for 5 minutes?  When I asked this question of ""customer service"", I was told ""they have a schedule"".  Really?  There schedule didn't seem to matter to then when the plane from LAX took off late.  I guess schedules only matter when they want them to.Secondly, there is an attitude problem in customer service.  I don't envy their job.  They have to help people all day long who have problems and are stressed.  BUT, their job is not only to solve the problems and make other arrangements, it is also to make the customer feel like they give a damn.  How about some empathy that your company has screwed up and screwed up our plans in the process.  Mistakes happen, and not holding the plane for 5 minutes was one of them.  But good companies train their customer service people to commiserate with the customer, not act like disinterested robots."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,"On hold for over 2 hours to talk with customer service, I just gave up!",I've been waiting for over 2 hours on hold to talk with someone from customer service after I received an alert that American Airlines changed my flight.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE EVER,"My flight home to Cleveland was completely cancelled & the next flight they could offer me was 2 days from my original flight time. I waited in line at customer service for 3 hours just for them to tell us there was nothing they could do. No hotel voucher or flight voucher, or even a voucher for Uber/Lyft. They refused to give us our checked bags because they were locked away & the staff already went home. I am an epileptic & my medication is in my checked bag which I could not get to. I am cancelling my American Airlines credit card in the morning because this is complete bull*hit I would rather fly Spirit or any other airline!"
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Furloughing pilots and canceling flights,Canceling flights at 10:00pm  when the flight leaves at 8:00am is totally unacceptable.  American Airlines is a poor airline and furloughing pilots and canceling booked flights for 4 days in a row now is totally unacceptable!  My mother who was on vacation with us is now potentially stuck in Charleston and my grandmother who is 88 could be without meds on Wednesday!  We have booked and paid for another flight with a reputable airline unlike AA in hopes she can make it home to my grandmother.  I hope and expect my mothers flights on AA will be fully refunded so she is not out any expenses for the trouble this has caused!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Wow AA sucks,"So the AA website is down and they are going to charge an ""airport fee"" for selling me the ticket.  GFY"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Customer service update,"Update: 3hr 5min later... A voice.Other two phones, still on hold. Over one hour and two hours on the other phones while the third finally got a response."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Customer service phone wait time,"Still on hold... ""48-52min"" wait window?It's currently over 2hrs and 40 minutes and still counting for the longest one (so far)...One of three phones CURRENTLY on hold...This is no longer a service and is a disservice. If you can't help, don't try. Just tell your customers online only. Don't even try if you can't even give accurate time estimates. I'm so glad we're not using payphones or paying by minutes anymore. What a laugh."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,They don’t care about your time.,"My flight was supposed to be at 5:30 but after the delayed we borded at 9:40 and that wasn’t it, they did not have their crew ready and one off the members ended up being late to an already late flight, we waited 30 minutes for them to arrive and ended up talking off at 10:25. Yeah I’m not a scientist but that’s not how business should be operated, I’m sure some people ended up missing their connected flights, lucky for me it was my last flight"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The WORST,"Purchased a vacation package and when I realized I did not have trip protection, I immediately started calling to get it! Called for days and days and stayed on hold for 3 hours, 4 hours at a time and got NO ONE! When I finally did get someone he said too many days had passed and I couldn’t purchase it. I explained I had been calling and NO ONE answered. Didn’t matter. Then he said he would make an exception and cancel the original booking and I booked again with the protection. He said my trip was now protected and if anything happened, my trip would be refunded to the original payment. Then today on the news I see American Airlines is cancelling 100’s of flights. So I call to cancel so I can make other arrangements for our trip. They tell me I get travel credit! What? Not only that, but she never even cancelled my trip! So now I get to spend more days and hours calling again! Absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable! Do not book with this Airline if you want to enjoy a vacation! I have emailed customer relations and also have no problem going to the news. They have an ethical obligation to consumers! No wonder this airline is in trouble. The only way they make money is by ripping of consumers!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Known Pilot Shortage Led to Cancellations,Absolute worst! Should be called UN American Airlines. They knew they had a pilot shortage yet still booked thousands of people only to cancel their flights! Cancelled mine twice and expected me to believe the third time would be different. Not a chance you greedy excuse for a business. Never again nor would I recommend them!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,No call no show,"Online it reports my flight is on time however it is 6:29pm, my flight was to depart at 6:27pm. There are no agents at the gate so we're all sitting here looking at one another. There isn't even a plane."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,I remembered why I never flew American,"This trip was truly awful. It began with the counter agent who could not print boarding passes. She finally called a supervisor and 20 minutes later, we were off to security. Finally making it through, we dashed to the gate to find them closing the door on us. Because the counter agent took 20 minutes tp issue the boarding passes, we were 5 minutes late to the gate and not within the ""15 minutes before flight time."" The, not very concerned, gate agent put us on a flight to Chicago, with a connection to Boston. It was, of course, late leaving, AND, my seat had a condensation leak overhead, so all the way to Chicago, I was dripped on and had a very wet shirt by the time we arrived. When we did, finally, get to Chicago and to the gate, the plane was there, but ""no crew, they had been ""delayed.""  Over an hour late taking off, we, ultimately, made it to Boston, to find out that part of our luggage was lost!! Hey, no problem, ""we'll bring it to you tomorrow."" 2 days later, we got the luggage. NOW, I remember why, being a Delta 2 Million Miler, I always avoided American. I would rather fly some 3 rd world carrier than ever, EVER ,  fly American Airlines again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Stay Far Away!!,Run far away from this airline! 3 of my last 4 flights were delayed/cancelled. All different times. Left us missing connecting flights. Several hours stuck in airports. Mostly equipment malfunctions or “plane is too hot”. Terrible. Never again.
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Unpleasant staff who need sensitivity training.,"So I wanted to pen down my thoughts on a rude encounter with an AA gate attendant. Flight AA 3658 Jun 19, 2021. For a super short Flight, it turned out to be double the time. The reason cited by the gate attendant was that the flight attendant was delayed. According to her, he was ""here in the airport just not here at the gate""When tired of waiting, an exhausted customer (me) asked the gate attendant about what's the holdup and what're they doing to fix it - I was dismissed initially and when I insisted, it was ""dont argue with me"" or ""I can't help you"". Giving the benefit of doubt, I reconfirmed if she was an AA employee and the answer was yes. So...why can't I escalate an issue with an AA representative? Answer is simple - perhaps I should have asked the other traveler behind me (who happens to be a white guy) to kindly be my spokesperson for the evening (because we can't all be white, right?)AA - your attendant needs some serious sensitivity training or a clear direction that non-white travelers are also equal travelers in all respects (to the best of my knowledge, I haven't come across a different fee for being non-white) When a customer is upset and the issue is yours and yours only AND avoidable, you do not get to be rude to the customer to top it."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,They DO NOT care about you.,"American has terrible customer service, and will do whatever they can to improve their bottom line. We were delayed leaving Fargo ND Due to mechanical issues. We get to Chicago late enough to miss our flight when we land. Instead of bringing us in, we sit on the Tarmack for 2 hours. Once we get off and wait about an hour or so in customer service line, they tell us that it's been deemed an air traffic control problem so nothing is covered, and they can't do anything for us. We rebooked through southwest to get home for a business meeting that can't be missed. We were also told that our luggage was already in BWI at that point and we would just have to pick it up. WELL. That turned out to be a lie, so they didn't have to deal with us, because when we got to BWI our luggage was still in Chicago and wouldn't get to BWI until late. Because we booked a connecting flight with Southwest, we now have to go back to BWI to get our luggage because they won't do anthing for us because we didn't finish flying with them"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Run far away from this airline,"I had the best vacation in Costa Rica. It was so amazing I literally cried leaving the resort knowing I was coming back to the bull in America. Little did I know that it would start sooner than later. My flight from Costa Rica boarded around noon. I was headed to Raleigh, NC. We had a connecting flight in Miami, FL. While flying over Miami in circles due to bad weather we were running out of fuel and circling around the airport we were number 17 to land. We flew to Orlando,  Fl and got fuel and flew back to Miami, Fl. At this point we waited on the runway for planes to unload. It was at this moment that everyone on our plane missed their flights. American did not get us a room would not book is another city in oir state. The only thing they could do was book us anothwr flight over 24hrs from oir original. Literally homeless in Miami right now. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT BOOK WITH AMERICAN. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Customer service is terrible,"I tried to book my 15.5 year old daughter onto a flight to Newark and you can't book a minor using the website so you are forced to call customer service.  I called on Friday evening and they said they were experiencing long hold times and asked if i wanted to have them call me back...the first availalbe call back time was Sunday at 9:40pm.  The called promptly at 9:40pm and it has been 54 minutes sitting on hold.  The crazy part of this is that a good contact center software solution could automatically adjust when your call is returned and minumize the wait time to a few minutes.  AA is saving a ton of money right now on payroll for call center staff, but they are losing clients like me who only fly 6-8 times a year with them...always first class!  Sorry AA, but I am out of here.  We can try this again in a few years after you have a dozen or so articles written about all the crappy leadership that got fired and how you have realized that your clients are important.  Until then, you can treat someone else like crap."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,DID NOT EVEN GET MY TICKETS!!!!!!!,"I booked tickets last month for my boyfriend to come up  to see me  and meet my family booking the tickets was the easy part, but getting them not so much I had  them email to him and 24 hours before his flight he checked his email ( more than once that that  day mind u ) and  he NEVER got them . I called the same day and never got a call back . So since he never got his tickets he could not fly . like at this point I just want my money back and i have been waiting to talk to a person for  a while  now  . PLZ DO NOT use this airline  . i would give it no stars  if i could ."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Will not let pets travel,"My daughter-in-law flew from Birmingham, Alabama, to Charlotte, North Carolina, on 6/20/2021 with a miniature Dachschund. Birmingham stated there was no problem with the pet carrier. When she changed planes in Charlotte, they would not allow her to board because it was not a ""soft sided"" carrier. Nowhere in their travel policy does it state that it must be soft-sided. She had contacted American on 6/18/2021 to verify the requurements and was not told that it could ONLY be a soft-sided carrier. Ad a result, she was stranded in Charlotte with no way home to Pittsburgh. Family members had to drive 7 hours one-way to pick her up. Horrible, disorganised airline with no clear and competent policies in effect."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Awful Customer Service, Change of flight","We scheduled a trip August 2021 in April 2021. Direct flights both ways,  As I am traveling with children this is importatn.  All of a sudden I get an email that our flights are rescheduled.  We now have a layover and we are not sitting together.  I called to address the issue. At 10;30 AM I opt to get a call back when the next agent is available.  They are now calling me back at 10:15 pm only to put me on hold. I have now been on hold for 30 min with no answer.  What kind of customer service is this?  Change my flight, separate me from my children and not have a representative available to speak to me? These were not cheap tickets. I deserve better!!  Consider a different airline, this is awful!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline ever,"You have to pay for wifi, the flight attendants don’t care about your personal well-being and don’t try to help you, the seats are too small, constantly getting hit in the shoulder by people walking by because the issle is so small. Don’t fly American Airlines."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible customer service and no accountability!,"We arrived at the terminal with all of the necessary COVID-19 documentation to travel.We come to find out that the first of our two flights is delayed which would mean that we would miss second place from Philadelphia to Dublin. This means we have to be booked on another flight. However that flight would land after our 72 hour PCR covid test expired, which would not have happened had American airlines not delayed our flights. American airlines told us that we have to get new covid-19 PCR tests since they would not let us board this flight as an original test will have expired by the time we land. Since there's four of us traveling it has cost me $800 to redo my PCR tests and American airlines will do absolutely nothing to compose for the fact that they caused this problem. On top of that I broke my leg and they said they would give me help from the terminal to the gate. As we were trying to sort out the mess that American airlines caused, person who was to give me the help left and has not come back. Now my wife and two kids not only have the luggage to deal with but also to push me around in the wheelchair. So far we have been stuck in the terminal for the past 5 hours and have gone nowhere and have had to spend the next $800 on covid-19 tests. American airlines are the worst airlines I have ever had to misfortunate dealing with. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this company"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,A traveling nightmare…,"I have never had such a terrible experience with an airline. The morning we were to leave (4 hours before takeoff to be exact) AA rescheduled our flights for the following morning which would completely mess up our travel plans. After nearly 3 hours of waiting on hold with CS, we were adamant on getting put on to another airliner and they finally did so after insisting that we drive to another airport 2 hours away to try to get to our destination on that day. Thanks to AAs carelessness, we arrived to our final destination 12 hours past our original landing time. Essentially losing an entire day of our vacation. Coming home was just as bad. Not only was the check in process complete chaos, but they were asking people to volunteer to change flights due to overbooking (as a means to make more $ off of people who don’t show up). We then had a 3 hour layover which then turned into 4 hours due to their delays. After 12 hours of traveling we finally get home to realize AA never put our luggage on the plane… Our layover was FOUR hours. There’s no reason any luggage should get left behind after such a long layover. At this point, it was 2am and we were so frustrated and exhausted from this whole experience. This airline was such a disappointment- to put it nicely. The worst part is that the airline doesn’t seem to care about customer service/experience. They’re just trying to make up for lost time and only care about your money. Please, take your hard earned money elsewhere and do NOT fly with American. They will make your travel plans miserable and not show a single ounce of sympathy for it."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,AWFUL.,"If I could rate this lower than 1 star, I would. DO NOT travel through this airline. This is literally the worst airline of all airlines. Terrible service, terrible punctuality, and useless staff. I've been on a connecting flight in Miami to New York since yesterday afternoon and they told that our flight was going to be delayed until the FOLLOWING DAY at 9 in the morning. This morning, they told us that it was delayed again up to 11:45 and then they told us at 12:15. In less than 24 hours, my flight has been rescheduled 3 times and the worst part is there no alternatives for this problem. Horrible airline."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airline are racist,"I will never travel with American Airline again. After all the check out process at the airport I have been waiting Mr. And my family in front the gate, then someone from American airplane came to ask my wife to remove her scurf because they think we’re terrorist. They said if you revise we can not let you flight . They force us to double check even that was not legal and they revise to identify them self by hide them badges and when I start recording they run away. This people harassing me and my family and they discriminated us badly. I’ll sue this company for what they did."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"American Airlines: Simply, The Worst.","Diverted to Montgomery due to weather in Pensacola, early June. No updates, no personnel at an airport that was closed for the night, no information, nothing—a timed-out crew and scant options. They finally got a crew in six hours later. On the trip back, flight was cancelled on Saturday a week later. Scrambled to book a 0540 flight home. Again, no gate assistance, offer of reimbursement or credit for our hotel stay, nothing. That flight delayed due to flight attendant shortage, then taxied back to the gate for hydraulic malfunction.American Airlines operations management is thoroughly incompetent. This is a broken carrier in every sense of the word. We’re done with American."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Long delay due to maintenance issues on first 2 planes 3rd was a charm, airworthy",Wasted a whole day at MIA getting on and off planes that had maintenance problems.  American Airlines gave very little information and certainly nothing in the way of sustenance.  Sat on runways for almost 3 hours on first 2 planes with no air.  AA finally found plane  without engine problems.  This was not encouraging since all 3 planes were Max 737's.  Finally arrived in Antigua at 8:47 pm and left airport after 10pm and we were first out.  Obviously missed day of vacation.  I have never flown on another airline american or foreign who treated passengers so poorly and  disrespectful.

Why call me back, if you are just going to place me on hold ?"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,My horrible experience with American Airlines,Very Very Very HORRIBLE customer service. They don’t know how to communicate & talk to you any kind of way. My ticket was “canceled” because I didn’t “check in” but the catch is I had my ticket & ready to be scanned. Long story short I missed my flight & had to sleep in the airport overnight on the floor. & on top of that I was thinking I had a morning ticket for rebooking & come to find out after I noticed an EXTRA $70 charge off my card my ticket was for the next night..... Very cold only one blanket ALL food places closed. Just a very HORRIBLE experience compared to Southwest Airlines ... I WILL NEVER BOOK WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES & SUGGEST YOU DO NOT EITHER!!!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Great flight but lousy customer service trying to make changes,"I have several flights booked with American for the next year. The flight we just had out West was amazing. The crew and flight times were perfect. We had a very pleasant flight. One crew member, Lisa, went above and beyond. But here is why I gave them one star. I had to make some changes to our flight for this trip and have now been trying for days to make a change to a flight for Italy next year. Both times it is almost impossible to get someone online. They finally called me back for the change out west at around 10pm. I called that morning. The trip to Italy has been very frustrating. I have been calling for three days. One day they called back and put me on hold and I finally gave up after 30 minutes. The next day they called back at 2am and I did not answer. Right now it is 4:11am and they called me back 1 hour and 16 minutes ago after waiting 18 hours for a call back. They called me back and put me on hold. This is ridiculous. I won't book them ever again even if the flights are great."

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horror of No customer service or care.,"This airline puts senior citizens Last and in danger. No accommodation of their own fault to the customer. And, my luggage destroyed. After I complained,  crickets. At the Philadelphia Airport abusive and condescending customer service reps. Awful"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible service,"Flight gets delayed, they say it will for sure take off same day, same flight gets cancelled minutes later. Horrible customer service as the lady working the desk takes off as there are lines and lines of people requesting assistance. Will never fly again."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Had to wait on plane to get off because understaffed!,We had to wait more than 30 minutes because they are understaffed and don't have gate attendants. This is ridiculous! It doesn't take thst much to let people off of a plane. Spirit was better than this! I'm not flying American again!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,A nightmare of an airline,"Our flight to our vacation included a plane they did not have time to clean before we boarded  (yes, great COVID protocols).  On the way home, the pile of delays in Pensacola caused us to miss our connecting flight at Dallas/FW. They could not get us home the next day, despite multiple flights on the docket.  The reschedule line for people missing connections was hours long all afternoon and night.  We had to stay all night in an airport with two kids to catch a flight that would get us 3 hours from home, where we had to incur a rental car expense..  And we were not the only ones in this situation. The cursing could be heard from far off. The weather was fine so all of these stranded passengers were due to rampant incompetence and not acts of God.  Will NEVER fly with them again.  I wish I could have rated them with a negative number of stars."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines is the worst service do not use them,"This is the worst airline services, the Philadelphia terminal looks like a homeless shelter, it is dirty and smells like a old gym locker, the aircraft service was the worst they kept pushing people going to the islands to the front of the line over all of the people that had been standing there in line for an hour. And don't even try to call customer service their message states that it is a 4 hr wait time and it is not a joke, and after a week of calling I left my phone on for 3 hr to get through to someone who out of the gate had a piss poor attitude, and I even asked for a supervisor to explain that this is a military travel  just to get no resolve. On my first flight Richmond my bags did not make it, yet there was a whole conveyor belt of packages that were not claimed and I guess were more important than my bag,  and I was told to come back in 3 hr to the see if it was on the next flight, mean while I was required to get a shuttle service to my location and then back to search for my bags at my cost.  I was trying to cancel my return flight after I got to my first location for the military and was required to return on military ground transportation. Now I am stuck with a $225 useless ticket that I will never use. Their policy that their tickets are non refundable  is not posted on any of their ticketing that you have to ask for a refundable ticket and non of the people at the desk offer any of this information they just process you like cattle. They expect people to know what their internal policies are but they are not willing to post it on any of their paperwork that they give you or put it at their counters. I will make it a point to never use this airline ever again and I will be contacting my government representatives to let them know that this airline is ripping the public off. I will be posting this every where and will make it my goal to ensure that everyone know what a rip off this airline is."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Unamerican Airlines,"Let's begin with the fact that I will never fly American Airlines again. Even though they are the only airline that flies out of Waco Airport (ACT), I will drive to Austin or Dallas to reach my destination through Southwest Airlines. Chapter One - The Flight CreditI had a flight scheduled right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit that was cancelled due to the world coming to a screeching halt. No worries, I'm tech savvy and consider myself an extroverted introvert. However, I had a flight credit burning a hole in my wallet that I could finally use. I tried to use this credit online, but to no avail. Apparently I had to call and speak to a Reservation Specialist to click OK on a keyboard to make the reservation for me. Four hours later, the time being 11:35PM I believe, I finally received a call stating I am next in line to speak to a representative regarding my reservation. After explaining the situation, the representative begins finding the reservation I just handed to him on a silver platter and says it will cost me $200.00 to use the credit. With my curiosity piqued I asked the reason for this charge. He proceeded to tell me that it was because this was a new destination and not the one I had originally booked over a year ago. You can imagine how the rest of that conversation went, however the ending threw me for a loop. After saying that he would speak to someone who could indeed make the call to correct this wrong, I hear a click and begin seeing red. Yes you are correct, the man did indeed hang up on me to sweep under the rug. However, I am a rather large man and not easily swept off my feet nor under any rug. I spoke to the Reservation Specialist Supervisor who simply read from her script ""I am sorry for the inconvenience."" I asked if there was any disciplinary action against employees who hang up on customers, because in my line of work there tend to be repercussions for negative employee behaviors and actions. At this point you could hear the tensing of her stomach as she frantically flipped through her script to find this scenario, beads of sweat beginning to form on her upper lip. Naturally she skipped to a response that was as generic as they come and I grew tired of speaking to a blank page. I ended the conversation with a question that I would grow to use frequently in the near future ""Who else can I speak to that can actually help?"" Rather than spend my nights waiting by the telephone I decided to email my issues to the next line of defence by American Airlines, Customer Relations. The next day on my way home from work I received a call from Customer Relations regarding my misfortune of using a flight credit. She proceeded to defend the individual who said he would be back but left me all alone fuming in the dark saying that he probably pushed ""End Call"" and it immediately started to ring again for another customer. Makes perfect sense because I used to use that line back in college.""I'm sorry, I must have accidentally hit ""End Call"" and it moved to the next girl in line. I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.""Doesn't matter at this point, I just wanted to use the money I had already spent with American Airlines and not incur any further hidden ""fees"" associated with using this flight credit. This call ended the same as before with another line from America's Customer Service Anthem ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but..."" and having 5,000 miles left on the nightstand as a tip. Not sure if you know this or not, but a 30 minute flight cost around 45,000 miles, one way. Makes a man feel cheap, ya know? Anyways, she said I needed to speak to a Reservation Specialist to finalize my flight reservation and use my credit, minus $200.00 in change fees. Another four hours drift by like sand through glass and I speak with another representative who placed me and my wife's reservation separately, because you cannot use a flight credit that has more than one passenger on a ticket. I only mention this now because it comes back later in the story. With that, we wait till the day of the flight which brings us to our second adventure. Chapter Two - The Absent AttendantHungry, tired from work, late, and masked I stand at Gate 29 in the DFW airport terminal impatiently waiting for a woman who will never show. I can see the plane outside the window, the pilot has made several coffee break visits to the door, but no boarding takes place. ""Your flight has been delayed 15 minutes"" dings across my phone as we listen to the poor souls holding the door so the tired and weary passengers don't break down the gate to get on a plane just waiting to be boarded say ""we are waiting on the flight attendant who should arrive here shortly."" How little did I know that this phrase is one I was going to hear quite frequently for the next hour. A woman stands up and makes her way to the counter around 45 minutes in and speaks with the pilot and two souls informing them that she was a flight attendant off duty but would gladly step up and work to get us off the ground. They say no at first, but another 15 minutes go by with no flight attendant in sight and they hail her from the door to save us all. Cheers from the crowd fill the terminal as she walks through the crowd of irritated passengers offering free drinks to this woman who may or may not have been God sent. After our ""brief"" delay we finally begin boarding our flight to land in LAX two hours later. Chapter Three - A Seat by Any Other Name As we begin picking up the hotel room, packing up our items for our 5:00AM flight, we remember we need to check in for our upcoming flight. As we rush to the app my wife notices our seats are quite different from what they were a few days ago. Puzzled, I investigate and surely enough she is correct. I am now at the back of the plane whilst my fair maiden lay in the middle seat at the front of our plane several stories ahead of me. Remember when I mentioned the separate flight tickets due to the credit earlier? Here is where that comes back into play. Because we had to do two separate tickets due to a flight credit testament passed down from the American Airline Gods, we were now separated on a flight leaving Las Vegas, quite tragic indeed. Not only were we separated, but both of us were taken out of our Exit Row seats and assigned to main cabin seats. Did I mention my wife and I are both over 6 feet tall, and I am not the skinny skater boy I was back in high school. So you can imagine the horror that came over me when I realized I was sitting in a very tight fit seat next to some stranger. I was able to move my seat for free to an Exit Row thankfully, but my fair maiden was not so lucky. There were several Exit Row seats available, however we were forced to pay for a seat upgrade on a seat we already upgraded so she could sit next to her Romeo and stretch her legs out on our two hour flight at 5:00AM. Which brings us to the end of our fairytale and on to...Chapter Four - Happily Never AgainSeveral emails go by with a Customer Relations Representative as I ask for the reimbursement of a seat upgrade that we were forced into after they moved us around due to equipment changes, AKA a new plane. We were reimbursed for our original seat, but that left $13.27 needed to be reimbursed for a seat change we did not plan for. Now we are blessed to not be hurting for money, but I cannot stand idly by while large corporations sit there and take advantage of the people that pay for their peanuts and tiny plastic cups. I have seen enough poor customer service to last me a lifetime and I cannot, no...I will not stand for it any longer. After waiting several days for a response, Cara Whitney copied and pasted her script into her email and said ""I must respectfully decline your request for a refund."" While I went into great detail how this is only logical, I received nothing back. I respectfully declined her response and said that I cannot accept these terms for the stated reasons, to which I typed out in great detail. The last email I received from Cara stated that she added a flight credit to my account in the amount owed to me and said that this is the best she can do. Now let us take a pause here while we look at the series of unfortunate events that led me to this conundrum I call my personal Hell. Do you see the irony? All of this began with a flight credit, and she expects this to end with one. Even I had to sit back and laugh after reading that response.I replied back stating that I must not have made myself very clear. I WILL NOT be flying American Airlines EVER AGAIN so what good is a flight credit to someone who is not flying your airline? Yet another slap in the face similar to the ""Bonus Miles"" left on the nightstand. You can credit my account for the total amount I am requesting, but not reimburse me directly? Seems odd and cruel if you ask me. Anyways, I ended the email with a note that said I get off work at 5:00PM and you can call me at that time to discuss how you can arrange my reimbursement and take back the flight credit. 5:00PM arrives and I am greeted with a call from an unknown number masking as ""Potential Spam"" but I threw caution to the wind and answered anyways. Sure enough it was Cara to tell me that she is sorry for the ___________ (entering the test portion of the novel) and that there is nothing they can do. (true / false)If you said ""inconvenience"" and circled false, you would be correct in my book. I refuse to believe that Customer Relations is the end all be all for American Airlines. If so, I feel they would have a much more distinguished title to reflect their God like abilities. However I was told that there is nowhere else I can turn to to have this resolved. No supervisor, no corporate, nothing. It has reached the end of the line and has been deemed the weakest link in their eyes. So I continue to ask for clarification so that I can understand her side more, and hope she hears the true logic and something clicks. I ask how it's fair to change a flight where you paid for an Exit Row seat to be bumped to the middle of a main cabin seat. Her response was that it looks for her EXACT seat and throws her into it. C9 may have been Exit Row on our original plane, but C9 is main cabin on the new plane. At this time there are still no lights on at home and she continues to say ""yep"" despite the illogical statements I am spitting out. I ask why they do not move seats and include extras, such as Exit Row, and she simply replied with ""cuz"". At this point I have lost all composure because I am I am trying to reason with a brick wall, or at least the person with the intellect of a brick wall. So from here there is only one thing I can do. I said I am making my story known on every platform I can think of. I did not mean to take it so literally, typing out a novel as a review of a poorly run company, but here we are. All of this to say I, nor anyone I can influence, will ever use American Airlines ever again. I hope that this novel gets published for corporate eyes to see the level of customer service that is being shown to your patrons. I hope you, as patrons, band together and let your stories be known when you are shown injustice because saying nothing means nothing will be done to fix it. I hope you aren't shown this level of poor customer service and injustice, but if you are I hope you stand with me and fight for the cause to wipe out poor customer service and injustice anywhere you can. Stand with me, and together we can make a difference. *steps off soapbox*"

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Customer service hates to deal with customers!,"I’m writing this as I sit and wait for my DELAYED flight. I get to the airport an hour before my 3:40 departure. As I pass the TSA screening, I notice my flight has been delayed until 4:22. Ok, it’s Friday, people coming in and out of Disney. I get to the gate and it now says “Delayed 4:48”. There’s another flight boarding at my gate. So I walk up to the counter and ask if there was a reason for the delay. The response? “I’m dealing with this flight you’re gonna have to wait now move to the side so I can deal with this flight!!!” I add the 3 exclamation points because that’s how angrily the customer service rep spoke to me. I just back up to walk away and he said “I’ll get to you with I get to you”. Never, ever, ever again will I fly American. EVER"

Date of travel: June 2021,10,This is a painful joke,"I was in pain for days after sitting in these horrible seats. It didn't help that the pilots screwed up the flight check data (their own admission) and missed our 2nd window for takeoff so we sat on the runway for quite a while. My ass literally sank through the seat feeling the aluminum seat frame pressing me from all four sides and most importantly against my tailbone. Sitting was painful for the next three days after my flight and it's not a problem I've ever had before in my life.  Tried to reschedule flight back and sat on hold for a couple hours, never got through and never had a call back. The online system said I had to call in to make a change, roughly 36 hours before my needed flight.  Canceled my return trip and rebooked with a one-way ticket costing almost the same as my entire round trip.. All in all, paid double price in order to save $50 over a respectable airline like Delta or United. You guys have no interest in repeat customers apparently."

At precisely 8:46 a 3 hour delay is announced, new departure time is 1 PM.Spoke with agents at gate, no form of reimbursement, vouchers, etc. Reason for delay is a crew shortage.

No accommodations were offered. No hotel, no food, no other airline still flying. We are 77 year old seniors and required wheelchairs.

Anyways, when that “major” issue was resolved, we took flight and landed to our destination.

Date of travel: June 2021,20,"Delays, Delays..","It first started at the curbside check in. I waited 20 minutes for this one customer service rep helping a family family... I had been in line a long time and asked him is it going to take much longer, he seemed to not understand English and waved me off.. I say this because the family he was hoping he was speaking Spanish to.Anyway, I get out of the line and go to another and my bag is checked.. after we boarded the flight we sat on the plane for about 35 minutes or so before the captain came on to tell us there was an issue with the smoke detector and we were waiting for the maintenance people to arrive.They apparently arrived at some point as we sat on the plane that was getting hotter by the minute with no info. Finally, roughly 45 minutes later he came on and said that they're trying to fix it but they didn't understand what was going on.. The maintenance people don't have a clue. Great! After about 2 hrs they tell us that the plane is being taken out of service & we have to deplane... so now everyone has to get off,  take all of their luggage out of the overhead cabins and go sit and wait in the boarding area again..Mind you there are people on the flight whose final destination was not Los Angeles and they were going on to Portland and Hawaii.  American got on the intercom and told them they were completely sold out,  they didn't have any other flights to put them on and if they didn't get to LA on time most of them will be looking at spending the night in the airport...So now after waiting in the boarding area again they tell us that they repaired the problem and we're going to start the boarding process all over again.About an hour later we're all back on the plane but we sit there another 30 minutes before we're ever pushed back... The pilots weren't very informative... they let us sit there quite a while before they told us that the holdup was that we were number 8 in line to take off and there was some weather pattern that was delaying all of the takeoffs..Great!  4 1/2 hours later we finally get in the air and the trip itself is uneventful... except for the screaming baby... We were supposed to land at 1:05 but we landed at 5:15.Then the flight attendant gets on the intercom and tells us we're going to have to go into a satellite gate and take a bus..LOL It only made sense, the entire flight had been a comedy of errors.A few minutes later she gets on and says we're not going to the satellite location but we are going to pull up at the gate in the international terminal ..But before that, once again we're sitting on the aircraft wondering what's going on and the pilot gets on and tells us ladies and gentlemen the machine or whatever it is they used to bring the plane and attach it to the jetway is for the wrong type of aircraft & we have to wait for them to go get the right one..So finally they bring the rthen we had to get off the plane and walk all the way over to the domestic travel area to retrieve our luggage and the poor people trying to make connecting flights had a long way to get there because they weren't even in the domestic terminal...Finally, because of the plane being in the international travel terminal and the luggage coming through the domestic side,  we waited 30 minutes before they even started sending the luggage down... For the privilege of all of this, we got water a soda and a ginger cookie..I fly a lot and this was the absolute worst flight of my entire life."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,All around terrible experience!,"I will never fly American Airlines again! My experience was terrible from the beginning to the end of my trip! They were not helpful or accommodating in any way to me having an infant. I was traveling alone with my 7 month old. They made me check my stroller so that I could not even use the bathroom during my 5 hour trip...because i had nowhere to put my baby! Every person from the person at the gate to the flight attendant was highly unprofessional. When I asked to board early due to needing extra time (as is offered on every other flight with United or Delta etc, the woman at the gate rolled her eyes and reluctantly agreed). Then I found out that my return flight home was cancelled....for no good reason!!! The weather was fine at my destination and all other flights from other airlines were still going to that destination. They rebooked my flight to 24 hours later. I couldn't stay another 24 hours, because i had 3 other children I needed to get back home to. I could go on and on but I don't want to waste any more time or energy on this. I might not even ask for a refund because they make the process so difficult and time consuming. I am telling everyone i know to never fly American Airlines!

Date of travel: June 2021,10,"23 hours at DFW with rude, unhelpful AA employees","My family of 5: Our flight from Bham, AL to DFW went off fine until we landed & received the text that the DFW 4383 flight to SLC at 1:20 had been canceled. We confirmed for the 7:30 2846 & luggage was sent on to SLC (which we did not know). Total of 11 delays (told weather & maintenance), 7 gate changes, 1 plane change, loaded the plane at 11:30pm, sat on it for an hour to be canceled because the crew would time out. After getting off the plane, we were told to go to customer service desk several terminals away to reschedule. There were 100s in line because other flights had been canceled also. My husband & aunt stood in line while I went to the desk to see what I could find out about luggage. I overheard an AA guy in a suit talking to someone on the phone saying that they had given out the cards, told everyone that it was a waste of time to stay in line & to call the number to reschedule. I finally got to talk to him to ask about our luggage & say that we had been there since noon, over 13 hours & all he could say was ""I'm sorry about that."" They shut down the line at 2am & they were very ugly about it saying that the workers had to go home because they had been there since the morning. Well, we were paying customers who had been there for 14 hours with no kind of answers. We weren't offered a hotel because they were full. We were offered nothing by American including answers. No flights were available for SLC the next day so I did get our flights changed to IDF, but that meant we lost $300 on our SLC hotel. Our luggage was in SLC & I had to call several times to finally get it Tuesday, 6/8. We also had to pay $200 more for a rental car a day later at IDF because that's what we could get.

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Canceled our Flight within 24 hours of departure,I used to love American Airlines. The customer service has dwindled I wish I could give them zero but that was not an option. We have booked this trip twice due to flight schedule changes and they had the nerve to cancel with 24 hours of departure. The options to rebook consisted of flights 3 days later with stops and over 11 hours to travel. I am so dissatisfied with this airline. I will never fly with them again and I will be selling my stock.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Consistently undependable,"Each and every flight that I have ever booked with American Airlines has been canceled then I have had to scramble for another flight. In keeping with their lack of customer service tradition once again  they canceled a flight and ""rebooked"" to a later longer flight one vacation day wasted. NEVER AGAIN."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,NEVER EVER fly American Airline,My boyfriend had points and used American for a flight. They changed his flight going AND coming back so many times. First couple times they didn't even send me a notice. HORRIBLE!
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst ever and never again!!,"First of all no direct flight from Vegas to Reno. Have to go to Phoenix and change planes. Same coming back! Why? What a waste of fuel! The service was horrible!! Not even an offer of water!! The flight attendants just about doing nothing! All sitting in the back by me telling stories and laughing. Nice job you all have! Coming back to Phoenix I walked a long way to go to my flight back to Vegas. When I got there they had changed the gate way back about where I got off! Another long hustling walk back and got there 4 minutes before I had to board! I said something to the check in gal and told her about changing the gates on me. Her reply, it's been up for an hour. I said no it hasn't and I haven't even been on the ground an hour. Really pissed me off! She was rude!! I'm done with this airline!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Very Irresponsible, Negligent, Inconsiderate","Sometimes, things happened and we have no control of it, but mannnnn....couldn't you have notified the passenger way ahead of time? That is just very irresponsible, very inconsiderate and negligent! Especially when you are dealing with a senior who is 74 years old, carrying and pulling bag and big luggage all by herself at the airport, only to find out that her ticket from Japan to Dallas is SUSPENDED! What the hell is suspended? NO ONE KNOWS! It is not cancelled, it is not delayed, but apparently, the ticket was a NO GO! What the hell is no go? NO ONE KNOWS.  My sisters and I were contacting American Airline and Travelocity, and both of them were playing pingpong on us.  First, they make you wait on the phone for 2 to 4 hours, while our confused mother was stuck at the airport for 24 HOURS!!! The frustrating part was no one had the decency to inform the person who booked the  ticket for our mother, and no one knows what the hell is suspended and no go ticket! I could understand if the traveler is young, tech savvy and can stand confusing situation like this, but we are dealing with an old senior who knows nothing about this stupid technology that is only design for young people! Who could not check what is what online...and the person behind check-in counter is more confused than our mother.This is not the first stupid experience we had with American Airline. My sister and her children traveled to US about 4 years ago via the same stupid airline, and made them wait for 2...TWO! days in Korea, and if not because of my sister who called this stupid airline, there were 5 more families traveling the same way who cannot communicate in English, only God knows when will this airline snap out of their stupidity and realize that they have customer stuck in a foreign country that is not their destination!...that they will be waiting for Judgment Day if my sister did not call and re-booked herself and all these people.  I would have told her that they have enough people to file a lawsuit to this stupid airline!WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AIRLINE TO ALL OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES FLYING TO AMERICA, AND TO ALL PEOPLE WHO COULD READ THIS REVIEW!  I'm a top reviewer and I will definitely review this stupid airline in all social media out there.  TO THIS DAY, NO ONE CAN TELL US WHAT THE HELL IS SUSPENDED OR NO GO TICKET!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,F**kyou over in a heartbeat,"We have flown AA several times and every time we fly them they change our return flight and then we are kicked out of the Forst class seats we paid for, we are shoved back to coach amd then have to pay for luggage and we cannot even upgrade to premium seats. We will never never never fly this POS airline ever again!!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,N/a,I have been on 3 AA flights in one day and ALL 3 hade some reason for late take offs I mean 20-30min late take off this is horrible customer service bad. I will be 2hrs late due to the delays on all theses flights. I have never encountered theses problems on any flight I usually travel United but since I am considered standby I hade to figure out other options to make it home in time and AA ruined that
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Do NOT fly with this airline,"American Airlines was completely understaffed, underconcerned, rude, inconsiderate and a downright disappointment to deal with on my last vacation which happened to be my honeymoon to Negril Jamaica. We boarded the flight from  Philadelphia to Montego Bay and after sitting on the runway for over an hour and being told over the intercom multiple times there was a small maintenance issue and we would be taking off soon we ended up getting cancelled all together. The staff at the gate then assured us they would be getting another plane for us and we would be leaving shortly which also turned out to be false. We were then sent to “customer service” where there were 3 very frazzled workers that really ha no answers as to what the next steps would be. We were basically told to “find another flight ourselves and get refunded later.” Which lead to my husband and I making OUR OWN arrangements and getting ourselves via public transportation 3 hours away from Philadelphia. At this point our COVID tests were also not going to qualify as it was passed the 72 hour mark. We were then sent to a testing station on site and charged yet again for this. All with very little concern or accommodating measures being taken.On our return flight we almost missed our connecting flight due to having to wait 1 hour and 45 mins to receive our baggage from customs, and yet again without any concern or accommodations.Overall flying with American Airlines was disappointing, frustrating, exhausting, and overall a horrible experience. I will go out of my way in the future to never fly with this airline again and tell all my friends and family to do the same. If yuu oh I are concerning booking with this airline, do yourself a favor and check into other options."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Baggage ,Horrible customer service!!!!!My luggage did not make the connection and then I waited 2 days for my bags. On hold for 50 minutes then hung up!!I hate AA!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,AA is now the most unreliable airline nationwide.,From one of the best service in the industry to basic and super unreliable.  They decided to change the flight with out any notice. Just now. We have a kid and they didn't offer to.cover for the extra expenses. This is happening very often now with this AA. Stay way from this airline. Try other alternatives because this is very disrespectful. Specially traveling with infants. Doesn't matter any more the price of the fly. This cost us more than 1k.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines cancelled flights because pilots were not available,"American Airlines has 3-4 flights cancelled on 6/4/2021 from Miami to various destinations that had to be cancelled because they HAD NO PILOTS AVAILABLE.  Why is that?  Our co-pilot tried to blame it on Covid.  Really? Why is that?  We were not offered hotels because there were about 1,000 people stranded with us.  Had to sleep on the floor or in chairs.  They provided water, cookies and a $12 food voucher (only Starbucks was open).  I asked for half credit back (this was the end of our trip) and they said no.  I feel like I hired them to bring me home on 6/4 and they didn't do it so I shouldn't have to pay."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Lost bags with no tracking. Avoid AA. Terrible customer service.,"My boyfriend and I traveled from PHX to DCA on June 12. We arrived at PHX around 11:45am local time to check our bags in before our flight. Paul from the Resolutions Counter checked our bags in. We were there about 2 hours before our flight… plenty of time to get our bags checked and on the plane. There was a misunderstanding during which I thought that our bags were included in our reservation. Instead of Paul explaining to us AA’s procedures, he proceeded to get very unprofessional and confrontational toward us. At one point he cursed at us, and then scoffed at us. He was disrespectful, rude, and a bully. At this point we wanted nothing more to do with Paul so I told him he we would just pay for our bags and be on our way. Paul then took our ID’s and ran my debit card, he weighed our bags and tagged them in front of me. And then threw my debit card back to me. When we landed in DC our bags never arrived. Every AA representative I’ve spoken to has told me that there are no bags under my reservation, even though my bank statement shows that I was charged by AA for bags. We watched Paul tag them. No one can track our bags, no one knows where they are. It’s like they somehow just don’t exist. How does this happen? Based on Paul’s demeanor and disrespect, I’m starting to worry he maliciously did this. American Airlines has been NO help. After waiting daily on the phone for hours, one representative will say one thing and the next representative says something completely different. The customer service is TERRIBLE. We have spent hours and hours trying to get ANY information on where our bags could be and have received ZERO help. We are going on day 4 of no bags with absolutely no updates. We have another trip in 2 weeks (sadly with AA) and I need some type of compensation for new luggage, new toiletries, new clothes, etc. We had many necessities in our bags as it was a long vacation. AA has done nothing to help. What did the worker do with our bags? I don’t understand how they aren’t pulling in the system at all. Do not fly American Airlines. They lose more luggage than any other airline and obviously are NO help when it happens."
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Grateful to the pilots,"I want to start out by saying that I have never been a fan of flying and especially at take off but as I have matured, my anxiety about flying has increased.  In March of 2021 I had a full on panic attack on my flight back from Belize to Dallas (was not American); so much so that I drove home from Dallas to L.A. because I could not bring myself to get on another flight.  The flight was not a bad one, it was me that lost all control and was a wreck.  When we finally got home, I thought I would never get on a flight again which saddened me because I love to travel and experience different places and cultures with my family and my husband.  I decided to put some things into practice to help me get control of my anxiety so I could proceed with a pre-planned trip to Miami with my family earlier this month.  I do think that I covered some ground on my own but on both flights to and from, the pilots put my mind at ease.  They were very communicative with a controlled and calming tone to their voice.  They forewarned of ""bumps"" as well as communicated how long they would last and when we finally got through them.  Their communication meant all the difference to me and now I only want to fly American.  Thank you to the exceptional pilots on Flight AA 620 on June 6, 2021 and Flight AA 1870 on June 13, 2021.  Your professionalism and communication with your passengers provided me with an experience that I had hoped for and now I plan to travel again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Bait and switch,"Terrible customer service. First they cancelled the fight, 3 months before it was scheduled, they put me on a flight that was longer and was arriving 7 hours later. When I called about it the first time they said we have. No seats on any earlier flights. That was a lie this passed week they added another flight, one that they had cancelled, after a 7flight hour wait they called back, it was now 11:30 pm, again they said no seats available. The next morning I went online and saw seats available on both parts, in all classes. I called them back at 3pm , the call back again occurred at 11:30 pm, but this time after 45 minutes waiting for a representative I gave up. Today my wife called and was put on hold for over2 hours, no representative. When I tried to do it online they said you need to call. If you have other options don’t use American Airlines."
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Great Customer Service,"We went to the Palm Springs airport where my 16 year old was flying for the first time alone to South Carolina. We have never usually flown with American Airlines, so needless to say I was in unfamiliar territory as far as sending a minor on flight across country. We went to the American Airline desk to check in. I cant even begin to explain how much John helped us. He answered my million questions with ease and patience. He had a complete understanding of my worry and my fear and not knowing what the rules were or how anything was done. He assured me that they would take care of him on the flight even knowing my son did not want to be labeled an UM. He explained where he would be flying into, what gate he would be out, what gate he would need to look for. My mind was put at ease through the whole trip and then he made sure I had a gate pass to walk my son through TSA. Thank you American Airline and especially thank you to John at the PSP airport"
Date of travel: June 2021,50,flight attendents please be funny,Ok thanks for this awesome flight i just wanna say can you make the flight attendents's funny? i just saw a video and a flight attendent was funny so i wanna have  that expierience
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Avoid American,Booked non-stop and were bumped to multiple stops. This  scam is happening regularly with no consideration that passengers book flights based on arrival times. First Class was filthy. Food smeared and dried on tray-table. Crumbs in seat. Unripened fruit and soured yogurt handed out in boxes. Washroom filthy as well. Flight attendants’ main concern was pacing the aisle looking for mask violations in a gestapo-like manner. Terrible experience.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Terrible Customer Service Since the Pandemic,"I noticed that on the About section for American on different sites, it doesn't mention anything about customer service and it shows...apparently even for their highest tiered members. I ran into a situation where I had accidentally booked the wrong dates for my trip. Unfortunately I did not realize this until I was at the airport with my wife. We went to the desk to see if there were seats available since the flight was due to take off in 1 hour. Luckily there were some seats available. Great! We were told we would have to pay the difference in air fare. Our original tickets were $500...the difference in airfare was $1550!!! I was told it was because the flight was close to fully booked. I understand there weren't a lot of seats left, but if there are seats left on a place that is due to take off in 1 HOUR, they are only going to be filled by standby passengers where there is no additional charge. To charge $2000 for tickets (for a direct 2 hour flight from Dallas to Phoenix mind you) is absurd and unreal. On top of this, they lost my golf bag (again, direct flight) and my wife's luggage was rifled through on the way back and she had a romper that was missing. Did I mention that I was the top tier of their Loyalty Program (meaning I fly 40-50 trips/year for work), and we also have the AA credit card that we use for all our expenses and bills, totaling around $30-60k / year?!?! If this is how a company takes care of their ""loyal"" customers, I would be afraid to see how they treat people who only fly with them 1x / year. Covid is not a reason to take advantage of people. There is a reason Warren Buffet sold all his airline stocks."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Just the worst,"Our flight was cancelled without any type of notification, we were forced to pay for an additional night in a hotel, and waited 8 hours before we got our first response from a representative from American just to tell us they wouldn't be able to help us. In the end their partner airline, Alaska, helped us out within an hour. My next response from American came 23 hours after initially trying to figure this out as the representative at the front counter in the airport said they wouldn't be able to help us at all. Afterwards we had to pay for our check luggage (when we originally were not supposed to according to one of the American helpers.) Overall the front desk representatives were rude, unhelpful, and even gave us incorrect information. Down to the point where they refused to assist us with anything. Would not recommend ever flying with them again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Central Baggage Resolution,"Ok, First off, Melanie, the specialist I spoke to was terrific. The phone system in the office has major issues. I have been consistently calling for the last 30 minutes 48 time in total. After following all the prompts, the call lasts an average of 25-40 seconds before the system hangs up on you. This is the second day in a row for this issue. Yesterday I called 30 times on an off for an hour before i finally got thru. Melanie was very helpful an I reported to her the hang up experience. I was hoping it would be fixed this morning but it is still broken. I have a web support guy maybe he can transfer me. Bottom line its been over 24 hrs., we still dont have our luggage, and I can not get a hold of a live person to speak to about it"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Awful!They have gotten worst since the pandemic,"Customer service is deplorable via phone and in person. As an Executive platinum member I’m incredibly disappointed in the type of service they provided me and the other passengers. They performed like a low class airline. I was on hold for 4Hours after they boarded us onto a plane in Las Vegas with no air conditioning in 108 degree heat. The agent at the customer service desk was extremely rude to multiple passengers including me. The agent on the phone was also very rude and refused to look at rebooking my connecting flight. On the chat function they kept switching me to another agent. After 7 different agents, the 8th agent via chat helped hold my place on another flight. Then told me I had to speak to any agent at the airport. One of the agents at a separate gate was nice enough to release me from the delayed flight to allow me to be confirmed on another flight connecting in another city. I will have to start flying Delta... American airline more like spirit airline lately except they charge high prices. They will likely lose me as a loyal customer."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Bad customer service,"The worst customer service ever. Call at 2 in the afternoon to see about changing a return flight. They woke me up at 1030 that night, only to be held on hold for 2 hours. Maybe it their CEO would focus on their issues instead of politics on voting, things just might get fixed. I hope and prey the pilots and mechanics aren’t being short changed!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,DO NOT TRAVEL WITH AA,AA had us spend a night at the airport stranded with no assistance. To top it all off we had items go missing. Items went missing in the time frame it took them to get our luggage to us. We went almost 3 days without our bags which had clothes and essentials. Their response was if you don't have the receipts of the items (items we obtain over years) we can't help you. @AMERICANARLINES is the worst airline to travel with. Our seats were also given to others while we paid extra for specific seating.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,THE  FLIGHT OF OUR DREAMS JUST VANISHED FROM OUR ACCOUNT. IF YOU BUY A  FLIGHT ON AMERICAN IT MEANS NOTHING.,"We booked our first trip in 17 months to Italy this Sept. We decided to splurge and book business class to celebrate our post covid celebration. We found great (haha) flights and purchased. Today we found out the outbound direct flight is gone, completely vanished from all trackable technology and the direct return was just rerouted from a direct flight to a multi stop journey that adds many extra hours of useless travel but we are still paying the same amount of money with no outbound flight? How can this happen?We have spent the entire day in a state of confusion waiting for the notorious call back from the 800 number. We were told it would be 4 hours plus, it’s been 6+ hours waiting for the call and still no insights/methods on the website as to what is going on. I’ve never in my 2 million+ miles of flying been treated like this. If this is travel hell we are here. The stress of the unknown for our first trip in 17 months is just so frustrating and unnerving. Thanks American for such a world class experience."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never flying again,"I have taken 4 American Airline flights in the last week, and every single time there has been delays. I understand that it sometimes happen, but for every flight is just bad service. They were all at least one hour of sitting on the plane. Next time I’m going with Alaskan airlines."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,30% chance your flight arrives on time,"Flight to destination, delayed by a day. Return flight, delayed by a day. Twice as expensive as more competent airlines, absolutely stay away from American. If this is the USA's flagship airline, it's an indictment against the poor service this country provides to people, and mirrored in its abysmal airline Delayed my trip, delayed my return. If you're on a tight business schedule do NOT give your money to American."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Dr,"Avoid traveling with American Airlines at all costs if you have other choices available. I had a flight from Louisville to New Orleans though Charlotte. When connecting in Charlotte they delayed the flight from 10 pm to midnight due to maintenance issues, then around 11:30 pm conveniently cancelled the flight due to weather. They did not provide any voucher for food or hotel. They would only offer a flight to New Orleans the next day at 10 pm (a frequently cancelled flight time for them). I told them that was unacceptable and I would buy an earlier flight with Delta. They said they refund the flight then. I later got a refund for HALF my flight, the Charlotte to New Orleans portion, even though me going to Charlotte was not my final destination or where I intended to go, they do not feel like they need to refund this portion of the trip.This isn’t the first time American has been unreasonable but it’s my limit. Will not be traveling with them again, they basically don’t have customer service."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Delays and Cancellations,"I am a frequent traveler. American Airlines continues to disappoint. I've had three trips in the last month undermined/ruined by delays and cancellations. First of all, they seem to struggle with the basic premise: getting passengers from Point A to Point B on-time. Worst of all, they are terrible once the delay process begins. Very little communication. Incremental delays rather than a accurate estimate of the realistic timeline. Their staff is alarmingly apathetic and lacks any compassion or problem-solving skills. They are also understaffed leading to long lines at airports where delayed customers are hoping to speak with customer service. There are many weak links in the chain...I don't expect perfection, but I expect a more reliable airline. I expect better customer service (and communication) during delays...This frequent traveler is now going to avoid American Airlines whenever possible. Enough is enough."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Avoid American Airlines at all cost,Think twice or more about ever booking a flight with American Airlines. They are now in the habit of cancelling flights and using weather as the only excuse so they they are not accountable for anything.  If you’re lucky they’ll let you know before hand that your flight is cancelled - even if it’s only 2 hours ahead of time. If you’re not fortunate- they will cancel your flight weeks ahead of time and not bother to tell you.  This is what they did to my daughter and her friends. You also have to sit on hold for 2 or more hours to speak with anyone. They are having major staffing or equipment issues and choosing to use weather as an excuse to cancel flights.   They will most likely be defunct in less than a year.
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Cancelled Flight,"We booked a round trip on American. We had no issue getting to our destination, but on our way back there was some lightning and that caused our flight to be cancelled. The next flight was not until the next day and we had no where to go. American offers no help when you are stranded. I understand that bad weather will happen and it’s not the airline’s fault but it is not my fault either. They basically dropped me off and stranded me in a unfamiliar city with no help help whatsoever. On top of that I purchased upgrades for the cancelled flights and I have to contact their customer service. The customer service wait time is over 4 hours. They do have an option to be called back when it is your turn in the call queue. When they call you back you still have to wait 15 minutes. They also have an option to schedule a call, but you have to select the time and the times I picked were not available. You only get 2 tries before you have to start over from the beginning. When there are no issues American is as good as any airline. It won’t be comfortable but you will get where are going. Some of the people working for the airline will nice and some won’t. If something goes wrong there will be very little help. I read that American is ranked one of the top 10 airlines in the US. The way I see that is it is like comparing garbage. Maybe their garbage smells better than someone else’s garbage but it’s still garbage."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,"Delays, Delays, Delays","Scheduled departure 9:05 AM and actual 2:48PM.  Missed connection in DFW and rescheduled for later flight but put in Economy.  Told it was weather delay in Dallas but actually plane never left Washington Nat'l the night before!!! It was replacement  aircraft (AA745Q) from DCA that eventually arrived  TPA at about 2:10 PM that we boarded for flight to DFW. Given meager refund for seat change and nothing for delay or inconvenience!  Only positive was Admiral's Club  lounge was open in TPA and Kimberly, Sue and Jade (AA reps in lounge) were extremely helpful."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Dropped Flight,"Booking made via Iberia Air with last leg serviced by AA. On check in for last flight was told by AA that ""flight dropped"". Instructed to get bags and report back. Went through customs to get bags where told that were not supposed to be outside international terminal and needed to return without bags. On trying to return again told by AA ""flight dropped"". AA and Iberia communicated over phone with no resolution - missed flight. Finally made it home and contacted customer service - got thanks for feedback , we'll try to do better. No answers as to what happened and why it could not be rapidly resolved. Will not give them another opportunity to do better."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines has turned our DREAM HONEYMOON into a NIGHTMARE SITUATION!!,"If possible I would give American Airlines a negative rating.  It is stressful enough planning a wedding let along the current day climate socially, financially,  etc. . However,  AA seems to have stepped up to the challenge of worsening the modern day feel of creating anxiety.  My fiancé and I are getting married in a few weeks and are at the point of just wanting the event to be done with already.  We are two hard working class American citizens, her being in the medical field, and I myself am a polymers engineer @ my respective company, so our careers can be very demanding on top of having two children. This was going to be the first time actually where we could get away to enjoy ourselves and have some alone time without the kids and just the everyday hustle and bustle.  However,  AA has seemed to have made different accommodations for us.  Not only did they just now tell us that the trip we have been planning for months is not happening with very little time to properly plan another; because of a hotel they knew was closed,  which we had no way of knowing because their website is fully up and active like business is still being conducted, they are putting salt in the wounds by trying to keep our VERY HARD EARNED MONEY!!! THANKS AA FOR THE EARLY WEDDING GIFT......"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Beware worst customer service and business. Stay away from American Airlines.,American Airlines worst company in the world. Have everyone on flight AA1562 board then 30 minutes later say of we don't have a pilot. We now need everyone to Deboard and get luggage at baggage claim and call their number to rebook. Yet all the flights to rebook are days later to get home. Or give a partial refund. Yet don't compensate us for the inconvenience. Have to sleep in the airport. Getting back late and missing our kids school event. Shame on you. American airlines is straight trash.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never Again,Such a shame. AA not only hurt customers they definitely caused their Staff a mess of stress. Disgraceful. Delays and canceled flights. For both our incoming and out going flight.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The 2nd time they messed up my travel plans,The worst customer service experience I've ever had was with this air line. American air line has messed up 2 of my travel experiences.  If you are not in a hurry to get to your vacation on time then travel with American they will most likely get you there 1 to 2 days later than expected.  More delays and cancelation than any other air line in the business. Attempting to get through a customer service agent is even worse. The wait time is 4+ hours and getting a refund is almost impossible.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,unloyal to military,"They offer active military two free checked bags. I tried explaining to the assistant I was military and showed them my ID, they told me to pay for my bags and call customer service. I get home and call customer service and they put me on hold for 4 hrs, when they finally pick up the phone no one answers and they just kept the line open for another 30 minutes. I'll avoid them every time from now on"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,AA SUBPAR,Horrible service after abruptly cancelling my flight at boarding. Gave no reason for canceling and AA employees seemed completely indifferent to situation. Was directed to a closed service desk and had to walk to another terminal only to find 60-70 other travelers be waited on by ONE agent. AA did text me options for flights the next day...all of which included 5-9 hour layovers. Called the telephone customer service number and was advised I would be called back in 4 hours. I received a robo call the next day and was put on hold for 30 minutes only to be given the run around by another disinterested AA employee. Booked a flight on Delta and was home by 0930.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Do Not Fly with this terrible airline- would rate zero stars for customer service if I could,"Had a connecting flight in Charlotte to Cleveland. Our original flight was delayed multiple times due to weather after boarding and an eventual cancellation because the copilot timed out and there was no other copilot available.  After a 2 hour fiasco (I will spare you the details) with customer service desk we were scheduled to fly in to Erie Pa the same night with a hotel voucher in hand and guaranteed shuttle transport regardless of time. I specifically asked these questions.  The flight to Pa was the  delayed multiple times but eventually landed at 12:40 am. In short they lost our luggage, had no actual hotel reservation for me and my daughters and no transport.  No Uber’s running and no hotel availability in the area.  AA left us stranded and alone in a deserted airport. We ended up staying at a YMCA for the night 15 minutes away in the middle of nowhere after the director (who happened to be picking up a kiddo for camp) graciously offered to house us.    This complete stranger cared more about us then American Airlines.  American Airlines absolutely sucks.  First and last time flying them. Never again."

AA has used the Pandemic to lower their class of service.  An Advantage member for 30 years, I will do whatever I can to avoid AA."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,I wish I could give them a zero,"I had a layover in Charlotte from Tampa headed to Nashville. I had the worst experience ever and I fly all the time. We had 4 delays in Charlotte and then after the plane arrives in Charlotte. They clean the plane and the crew gets on. They decided they had worked enough hours for the day so they leave us at the airport and canceled our flight.  We were at the airport for another 4 hours because almost midnight on standby before we left Charlotte. My bags wee loss for 2 days, came from wet. It was bad."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Batting a thousand!,"International flight, Premium Economy, Booked with an American Airlines Citibank Mastercard, paid for with miles!  At the airport, my wheelchair bound wife gets told she has to pay $!00 for the second bag.  Turns out the changed the policy in the fine print three days before we booked the flight! American Airlines already had a perfect batting average.  The NEVER ONCE got me where I was going on schedule and with my bags.  Not a single time, and since I live in Central Texas, if I die, it does not matter if I am going to Heaven or Hell, I have to fly American!  The saddest comment is that I have ALWAYS gotten better service and customer service out of SAFI Afghan Airways than I ever got from AA.  They are a third world airline in a third world country!  How can you live with that, AA?The final straw comes when they break from normal on 28 February 2021 and begin charging for a second bag on international flights!  I have flown FORTY ONE MILLION MILES since 1985 in my career in aviation, and am currently working as a contractor special projects manager reactivating aircraft from storage out in the deserts of Arizona, New Mexico, and California, and to have American jump on the Spirit Bandwagon to Nickle and Dime their customers to death is just plain ignorant!   We were ALREADY disgusted, but now, you are no longer competing with Delta and United!  You are competing with Enterprise, Avis, and National Car Rentals!  I will rent a car and drive to any airport where I can fly with anyone else!  I also will no longer extend any courtesy to my brothers working for AA, so their on-time RTS's WILL suffer delays!  God forbid I get another contract to RTS an AA aircraft.   I have ethics so I will refuse it, but if I didn't!  That hundred dollars will cost you millions, AA!  Keep alienating your customers!  Some of us are positioned to BREAK YOU!  Think about how vulnerable you are due to COVID!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,THIRD WORLD AIRLINE,"Delayed flight and lost connection in NC to Tennessee and my minor daughters at the airport waiting until the next day or they would take them to a hotel alone outside the airport with the dangers of today, call American Airline explain the situation and me They responded like computers without putting a minute instead of a parent, that the connecting flight was not going to wait being from the same airline, inhuman and unprofessional, a third world airline."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Just Choose a Different Airline.,"All of these recent reviews are pretty much spot on. In a nut shell: delays, cancellations, missed connections, rebooking, vacation delayed... going and coming home. Ridiculous. Then, the planes that even had screens didn't have working screens, air-conditioning unit not working in half the cabin on one flight, charger units not working to charge devices, etc. These were all 2+ hour in air flights. Some flight attendants were kind, and did their best, but the quality of the planes and the incessant delays and rebooking connections is exhausting.There must still be a serious issue with their maintenance union because, both coming and going, the issues with the planes were maintenence related."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Unaccompanied minor lost for several hours,"I don't think I could give less of a review. My son was traveling as an unaccompanied minor today. He had a connection flight and they gave his seat away to someone on standby. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED!!!! I spent hours trying to find where my son was, went to my local airport to find he was still in his connection city. Not given an update as to what flight he was being put on or departure time they let me talk to him but no one from American airlines would get on the phone with me. I've been on hold for 8 hours trying to speak to someone in customer service and still cannot connect with anyone. I was told by my local airport the next flight they're putting him on may get canceled but it's the last flight out for the day. I asked what happens to my son overnight and am told they don't know I'll have to talk to someone in customer service about that!!!! The same customer service that I've been on hold with. I don't even ha e the words to express what they have put me through and not the local airport or Charlotte Airport american airlines staff seem to care I didn't know where my son was or what flight he was on. They see nothing wrong in the fact they never notified me they gave his seat away and put him on a different flight.Do not trust your loved ones with this airline"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline,"I thought our flight out was terrible after a nine hour delay over one guy trying to fix a tire, however the incompetence kept flowing at American Airlines.They made us late by an hour for our connection in Dallas.  We had a two and a half hour lay over planned with customs.Then to cap off our travel with them they decided to lose our luggage.It was like they don’t even care.Trying to chargeback the charge on my credit card.Sincerely Scott AndrewNever choosing that crap airline again"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible airline,Nothing went right flights delayed almost missed connection flight  sat in Dallas for over 10 hour cause they lost the pilot and had no crew never  traveling with them again I would give 0 stars
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Stranded w 7 kids,"Rude mask forcing attendants, dragged out DCA departure, couldn’t land in PNS due to rain, took us to Montgomery AL left sitting on warm plane for hours w no communication then put us out in Montgomery terminal hours away from PNS leaving the whole of passengers including many children in an airport that was closed. No open shops, no way to go out through security, only well meaning Montgomery Airport guards who have warned us not to leave out through security bc we won’t get back in. No rental cars available, and no hotel, meal or amtrack Comp options. Not even a single communication from American except that there is a 22-hour wait time when you call the 1-800 number. Our flight should have landed around 5pm in PNS and here we sit in Montgomery at 9:30pm with 7 kids.  I assume we will all be sleeping here on the floor. . Departure screen lists we don’t get to leave until 6:27a.m. Tomorrow."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible Airline,I don't know they stay on business with their horrible service and routine last minute cancelations. I have never had such routinely poor service. If only I had a choice.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Flight Experience Ever,"Just as I was preparing to go to the airport, American notified me of a delay in my flight.  They gave me the option to change my flight which I did, only to receive yet another notification that the new flight I had just selected would likely result in me missing my connecting flight.  I changed my flight yet again and rushed out the door, hoping that was the last hiccup in my journey.   Nope!  By the time I arrived at my gate, the flight had been delayed a third time for three hours.  I rescheduled a fourth time.  After checking with customer service, I was reassured there would be no more delays.  An hour later flight was delayed another hour.  Finally boarded and arrived at first transfer in Dallas.  Thought I had enough time to make my connection, but spent 10 additional minutes waiting on tarmac while they cleared a vehicle collision from our gate.  Ran 15 min to make connecting flight, only to have the connecting flight delayed...wait for it...THREE MORE TIMES!  I will NEVER fly American again!  I will pay more with another airline just to avoid the hassles associated with travelling with this inept company."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline,American Airlines is the worst. They changed our flight 4 times before we were going to leave and then at midnight the night before they cancelled our flight and put us on an earlier flight. We luckily were up otherwise we would have missed our flight. Coming back they delayed our flight an hour then we got to the gate and they said they have no pilot. We just sat there without updates and not knowing what the heck is going on. They are the worst airlines I think I have flown with. Don’t do them unless you really have to.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Catastrophic responses to weather,"Late leaving Sarasota. Not allowed into Chicago, 45 minutes holding pattern, only to have to go to Indianapolis (!) for refueling.  Seventh plane in line for refueling. Finally arrived in Chicago, only to have our gate unavailable, and another 15 minute delay.  About to miss my already delayed rebooked flight. Flight attendants unfriendly and unhelpful.  Slightly better communication with AA than United on another delayed Sarasota - Chicago flight, but still not usually in the detail required, and not every 30 minutes, as required by law and their own regulations."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Bad experience,"This is not the first time I book tickets from American Airlines, but it's my last time. 4 out of 10 times my flights were canceled. Yet, Delta had never delayed or canceled my flights. I'm so disappointed."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The worst airline in the world,"They are terrible and don't deserve to be an airline, we will never book this again. We had to wait for 5 hours and then our flight got canceled, this is a prime example of a terrible airline, the costumer service was rude and sounded like they didn't even care! Never ever fly this airline."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible experience american American airlines,"Absolutely awful experience. Flight was delayed then no connecting flight wouldn't offer any assistance had someone in a wheelchair with us. Tried to make us stay at airport in Charlotte for $160 for a cot, no assistance to hotel paid 40 dollars just to get to hotel and back. Then forced to take two more flights so 5 planes in total with a woman in a wheelchair and two small children. And refused to help with hotel or anything. Absolutely awful experience for the first time ever flying. I'll choose a different flight if I ever choose to fly again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Be prepared to never make it to your destination,I will attempt to write this review with just the facts. Flight originally booked to leave out at 4pm from Cincinnati with an hour and half layover in Philadelphia. We were supposed to get into Boston Friday around 830pm. When the plane arrived a fire truck arrived shortly after and two fully equipped firemen board-not a great sign. This is still going on and the message on the screens still said we were boarding in 5 minutes and leaving on time. 15 minutes later we are told there will be an hour delay (5pm) At that point we knew we would not make our connecting flight. No big deal. We get in line to see what we can do. We were able to get on a later flight to Boston. They then tell us we are to leave at 6 but from a different gate. Therefore we all go to that gate. We are then told that this is a flight that was already set to go and it’s full. Therefore we all go back to the original gate and now the flight time is 630. When we get in line they told us that the time is wrong and he was 80% sure the flight won’t leave that night because “the wing is still smoking”. Okay....so we were able to get on the next available flight at 6am. We then leave and go to the ticketing booth and ask if they can get us a hotel room near by. With lots of attitude they say no because the delay was due to “weather”. I explained that in fact there was a fire truck and the wing was smoking therefore how is this weather related.  After about 45 minutes refusing to leave the line and asking to speak to the manager they finally agreed to pay for out hotel room. Okay great. Can we have our baby car seat back? Umm well....we can’t find it..... Okay (thank god we only did carry one-we met several people stranded without their luggage for the night) They graciously allow us to use a car seat for the night. We go back to the overnight parking and go to the hotel. Hotel staff states that the airlines did not provide the correct voucher information and “when we call them they are emotionally abusive to us”. After about 30 minutes waiting because the hotel staff needed to call the airlines to get the voucher for the room we finally make it to our room (930pm). We wake up around 4am and make it back to the airport. Everything is all great and ready to go. But WAIT the flight attendant who was just busy taking selfies of herself had a mini freak out because she just realized she left her wallet at the hotel. Flight is now leaving out at 630am. We finally did board knowing that we might get stranded in Philadelphia if any other delays happen (flight from Philly to Boston boards at 850am the only flight we can get on because there were no other flights leaving out Saturday from Boston)Thank god we made it. Ran from terminal F to C with only minutes to spare. Finally made it to our destination Saturday at 11am. Car seat is still missing-no idea where it went. Luckily we did not check our bags.

Date of travel: June 2021,10,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIR LINES,******PLEASE SHARE******DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES I normally fly Delta and chose to do a cheaper route (by only $100 or so - bad idea) and go with American Airlines. I flew from Lexington to Chicago where my flight was suppose to leave from Chicago at 8:35 to Vegas for my boys bachelor party. We landed at 8:30 pm and as I got to my gate at 8:40  pm the flight had already left. They advised me on my flight that they were communicating with the other flight to not take off due to there error of being late. They did put me in a hotel in chicago for the night but that’s it. I then wake up this morning to go to Vegas for the bachelor party where my flight is continuing to be delayed. While speaking with customer service through American Airlines they were rude and advised it is not their  issue. I have lost money with my hotel in Vegas as well as other adventures that have been paid for that I have missed due to this airline. I HIGHLY recommend not flying this American Airlines due to their lack of unprofessional support!!!! I still get advised by customer service that this is not their issue and basically leave me the option of just walking home! Absolutely crazy!!!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,DFW American Understaffed,Check in was like hearding cats. Kiosks not working efficiently. Security way backed up. 3 hours from airport arrival until getting to gate. Almost missed flight.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Stuck in Charlotte with No Help,"PLEASE READ AND AVOID AMERICAN AIRLINES: Last month, I was flying from TN to NY with a layover in Charlotte. The AA flight from TN was incredibly delayed and besides my best efforts to get in touch with AA before the flight to resolve the situation (I was on hold for an hour with no response) and sprint through the airport, AA would not let me on the flight that had not yet began departure. The agents at the gate would not help me find another flight, which began the pattern of me getting directed to different agents throughout airport, but to no one who would actually help me. It wasn’t  until an hour later that I finally found someone who would help me at least find a hotel, but would not help me find another flight home as there appeared to be no options. Side note: it was late at night and I was told to wait for a hotel shuttle in a vacated location in which the hotel shuttle never arrived at. I expressed these concerns to customer service in hopes of getting reimbursed for the flight I had to take home on a different airline because AA would not help me find a new flight. Brittany Dor from American Airlines declined my request to be reimbursed and told me that it is against their policy. She also told me there is a policy in which American Airline representatives must make their best efforts to get me home. However, there was 0 effort made in getting me home and I feel incredibly frustrated that American Airlines can violate their own policies but not make exceptions for their customers. Please avoid this airline!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never flying AA again,Delayed TWELVE Times in the same night had to cancel my trip. Asked rude lady at front desk on cancelation/refund policy she hands me a pamphlet with 800 customer service number and said I'm #### out of luck. Terrible company. Terrible logistics. Terrible leadership. Boycott AA.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible airline,Nothing worked on the airplane. No water. No WiFi. And stuck window. The airplane still had trash left over from the previous voyage. What pisses me off is the gate agent forced me to move everything from my laptop bag into my backpack even though there was space to place he backpack in the overhead bin and the laptop bag under the seat so I could use it during the flight. So I wasted my time placing everything in my backpack that I then had to spend time to unpack before taking my seat so I can use the items I specifically set aside in the laptop bag.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Go ahead fly with literally any other company,"I was asked to change my flight because the one I was on was full. Sure. No problem. I’ll help out. Not knowing I would be placed in the back row next to the bathroom that had a constant line of people... people directly next to me, touching me, leaning over me, hovering around waiting... and when I asked the flight attendant to kindly ask people to wait until the bathroom was open (aka when the fricken light is green) until standing, she claimed they weren’t allowed to do that. A line of 5 people in the aisle? I think not. It’s a huge safety concern and irritating for all of those seated and that is also  not allowed on any other airline I have flown. And again, I was the one helping out because they overbooked my first flight. Unless I wanted to drop $46 on a “preferred” seat I was stuck. For 3 hours and 50 minutes, constant people 2 inches away from me (and they are standing while I’m seated, so you know it’s either a crotch or a butt right by my face). Can I throw out covid/flu here as well? I don’t love strangers close to me normally and then to have, at minimum ,40 different people hover over me?...  SUPER SICKENING. And no one was helpful from American Airlines with anything. Starting with the initial phone call when they asked me to change my flight and then proceeded to screw me over with my seat assignment. That price might look nice, but add in the $60 baggage fee round trip and a decent seat if you want it and you might as well book with someone else “more expensive.”"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible Flight worst I’ve had,Sierra was condescending and extremely rude! We sat at the back of the aircraft we look back there several times to see that she and the other man with her were not wearing their masks but were demanding the people in front of us wore theirs… what an odd display!Only one of the 4 attendants (Bobby) was pleasant. The others had very bad attitudes and were not willing to help whatsoever when I asked a question they acted like it was not their job and were put out to have to help! I brought a mask I was told was not sufficient! I asked for a cocktail and was told I wasn’t first class! If told that when booking we would have booked 1st class!!! However I am more than happy to purchase my drinks!!! The touch screen displays are absolutely DisgustingI fly very frequently. This will be my last trip with American Airlines! With or without Covid-19 this is not sanitary! See pictures attached. These are our touch screens on the headrest.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Lost my luggage,I’m not one to complain but they lost my luggage and can’t get through to anyone. Will never fly with them again. I have at least $1000 worth of clothes in my luggage and they were so careless. I’m in another state with literally nothing but the clothes I flew in.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"SPOILER **NOT MILITARY FRIENDLY, NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY, SERIOUS LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE**","My family and I were traveling with my infant son on American Airlines 1663 from Cabo to DFW on 6/10/21. What should have been a relaxing flight home, turned into a nightmare. The minute we boarded the plane we were rudely told by the crew members put our luggage anywhere and take our seats because the airplane was running late (AA delayed the flight 4 times and then there was a looooong line at the check in the counter with only 1 person behind the counter). We found our seats and the plane took off. Almost immediately I became the target of flight attendant on board (Stephanie, badge #3). I had my son in my lap who was teething and a little fussy and kept trying to pull down my mask because he wanted to watch my mouth as I sang to him in a soft voice to keep him calm. Well, my mask kept sliding down the bridge off my nose to the tip of my nose (literally an inch down my nose but never off my nose) and that was enough for Stephanie to keep coming over and yell at me and to give me nasty looks. Instead of asking me if I needed assistance with anything, she was extremely RUDE and yelled at me in a loud voice because my mask did not cover my nose all the way up. What was extremely upsetting was that there were several other passengers who were there without any or only partial face covering walking up and down the aisle, but she never said anything to them. Instead, she kept harassing me over my mask that covered my face and nose. None of the other flight attendants intervened although one barely apologized to me in the end for Stephanie’s behavior. Towards the end of the flight Stephanie came back and yelled at me once more and then gave me a piece of paper that said I was not incompliance and that I may not be permitted to fly AA in the future. My family and I have never been treated this way before and in hindsight, I feel that we were targeted because of our minority status (we were the only non-white family on board, and I was the only person with a baby). My 6-month-old was more courteous to other passengers by not crying…the courtesy me and my family should have received from AA crew. I understand flight attendant is a stressful job but as a military member and a mother of an infant, I am stressed out all the time, yet I never treat someone with such wanton disregard. Now, I have serious reservations about flying AA in the future and my family whom I convinced to fly AA will never purchase another AA ticket. I am also considering taking legal action against AA for harassment and discrimination."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines Sucks,The worst. The absolute worst. Late crew. Rude customer service. Missed connection. BS fees added. Never again.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Awful or even worse attention to customers,I had prepaid my flight (round trip) from DFW-Monterrey Mexico and had an issue not receiving my daughter’s passport on time and couldn’t take the flight from DFW. I called the airline before and after the day to explain the situation and advised that I needed to keep the Monterrey-DFW flight but was cancelled due to our “No Show” on the first flight. I received the passport and wanted to go to my destination thinking that I already have our flight back but unfortunately they Cancelled it and haven’t responded to the e-mails. Amazing that budget and cheaper airlines have better service and attention to customers.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Abusive staff,"American Airlines has a very low standard of customer service in DC.  Every customer service person encountered was terribly rude. I did not even ask for assistance at the baggage check and an American Airlines employee yelled at me from 4 kiosks away continuously ordering me how to put the sticker on my bag. I asked him to please stop and he continued yelling instructions to me, flustering me and it was an extremely upsetting experience as everyone at the busy kiosks stopped to stare at me. I reported this situation to American Airlines directly, but they did not contact me as requested. Its very disappointing that they would allow their staff to treat customers badly"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Poor service,My family and I haven’t had such a bad service with an airline ever. We were trying to go to my Nana’s funeral in Dallas Texas. Our flight was supposed to leave 6/10/21 at 11am. A few weeks before our flight ended up getting delayed to 1:30pm which was no big deal. The day of the flight ends up coming around and it kept getting pushed back farther and farther all the way to 10:50pm and then the flight ended up getting canceled all around. We went to the airport and talked to they’re staff and all they said was they were having some issues with a tire and maybe some other mechanical issues. My mom has been on hold for over an hour waiting to try to get a changed flight. They’re is 5 of us trying to fly out of Eugene or Portland to Dallas and as every minute goes by the seats are booking up and it looks like now we will not be able to attend my Nana’s funeral which my dad is devastated about since it is his mother. I’ve had flights delayed many times before but I’ve never had to deal with something like this AT ALL. It’s very unfortunate that this has happened to us and others and I hope this isn’t how they deal with any inconvenience that happens and if so I’m shocked they still get any sort of business. This was my family’s first time flying threw this airline and now will probably be the last. All and all this has been a very upsetting day for my family and we are still on hold and haven’t heard ANYTHING from them.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline experience ever,Items were missing from my luggage and the said the only way they would reimburse me was to have my original receipts. Who has anniversary gift receipts. The plane was leaking water on the controls and had to be repaired at the airport. On the way home the plane was late causing me to miss the next plane forcing me to say in phx AZ for the night. Spent two days in an airport and missed an unpaid day of work. Sad thing is I'm a heat fan.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines Horror Story,"After years of enjoying the so called cattle call on Southwest I booked a 1 way flight through American Airlines due to cost alone from Richmond Virginia to Sacramento CA. The initial flight was delayed by 20 minutes from Richmond to Charlotte. Having been told how long the trek through Charlotte terminals can be I knew I would have to hustle to make my connecting flight. Running through the concourse I had hopes of making it. When I arrived to the gate myself and about a dozen other would be passengers found our seats had been filled by stand bye passengers and the doors were closed. Immediately I thought of the countless times over the past 20 years traveling with Southwest and how the loud speaker would make an announcement that a plane had just landed with connecting passengers and we would be waiting for them to board. Not the case with American and it only got worse from their. After waiting an hour in the customer service line to be told I wouldn’t have a direct flight the next day and would be put on Stand bye once arriving in Phoenix I thought my accommodations would at Least be taken care of. Nope. Inclement weather is out of Americans control hence a night curled in the corner of A10 waiting for my morning flight.  Once I had arrived in Phoenix I found the same chaotic scene throughout the American Terminals. Long lines in customer service, delays and more customers in stand bye hoping to catch the next flight home."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Mr.,Worst Airline Ever!!! Ruined our family reunion!  Told part of our family to switch flights to make sure we made connections and had no clue. If we would have stayed on original flight all would have been fine. Instead flights were cancelled delayed and we missed being together. Will never fly again in American!!!!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,#Zerostars,"#americanairlines yet another fail from American Airlines where instead of choosing to be the hero of their failure they chose to split hairs and gouge the customer. A coworker and I flying American air we’re pushed from Sunday to Monday due to negligent maintenance practices. On Monday they jacked us around with “weather” delays  (incompetence) causing us 17 hours of travel, For a 5 hour flight. Because they messed our schedule we lost work and now they want to charge $72 dollars to fix the back end of our tickets."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines is UNACCEPTABLE,"I can't state strongly enough how poor the execution of their basic mission - get a plane in hhe air. We are right now waiting on our third plane at our second gate. We boarded the second plane, doors closed, pilot said we'd be in the air shortly. Nope - get off the plane this one is broken too.We've flown all day from Oregon to this point - all on American. American will never see one dollar of mine again. We're at about three grand if we were to complete our booking back. Never again. American Airlines is Unacceptable."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Traveling with Minors,"I booked tickets with my two minor children (8 or 10). When I booked the trip I selected seats for us to all sit together. When we boarded the flight to return to DFW they seated me in different seats with 4 or 5 rows seperating us. My 10 year old has major aniexty being seating beside a stranger. I asked the stewardess for help seating me with my children. She said it wasn't her place and I was free to ask any of the other passengers if they would switch. I asked one passenger and he refused to even consider the move (although he was flying alone). My children and I were crying, them becuase of fear and me because I was unable to help my children. Finally,  a nice man said he would switch with me and we were able to sit together. NO HELP FROM AMERICAN AIRLINES. NO CONSIDERATION FOR ME OR MY CHILDREN. THEY COULD HAVE CARED LESS. As I said I had booked the flight with all seats together. This was not a failure on my part but on AMERICAN AIRLINES."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,"If anyone is considering flying internationally on American Airlines, I would not recommend it!","There were 6 of us travelling for a family vacation.  Our flights were booked 3 months in advance.  We had received one notice of our flights there being changed, getting us in 1 1/2 hours later than original.  That was nothing compared to all of the problems we had.  There were only 2 agents working the check-in counter for flights out of DFW on an early Saturday morning, and with all of the Covid requirements, it took so long that we missed our flight, as did most everyone else.  Our agent was able to get my husband and I on another flight later that day, and our children and their guests were placed on stand-by.  Luckily we all got on that flight, but if we hadn't, we would have had to go through all of the Covid protocals again, and would have missed more than half of our vacation.  I saw several people, and large groups, leaving the line in tears, not getting to go at all.  Our daughter and her fiancé left two days before us to return home.  When they got to the airport, their flights had been cancelled, with no notice.  Maybe this was because they missed their original flight, but again, we were not notified.  Thankfully, the ticket agent was able to get them on a flight.  When the rest of us (4) got to the airport on Saturday, my husband and I had been scheduled on a different flight from our son and his guest, without any notice to us.  And then our flight was delayed which was going to make us miss our connection into Dallas.  We had to go back through security, stand in the long line, and try to get on a different flight, which again, the ticket agent worked a miracle, and got us on a direct flight.  The only reason I gave two ""stars"" was because the ticket agents worked hard to get us all on flights, but they shouldn't have had to do this.  I did not see any passengers that were happy with their experience with American Airlines either of our travel days.  I did see a lot of people screaming and cussing at the agents, whom I felt so sorry for."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,AWFUL customer service & overall AWFUL,"I don't leave reviews normally but this experience with American Airlines was pretty bad. We have had our international tickets bought for over 4 months. No email, or any notice was given that our covid records had to be uploaded, although we had all of the paper work as well as rapid tests with us. So we get to the terminal over 2 hrs before our flight we wait in line for 45 min and they give us a website to register on and tell us we have to get back in line. We finished our registration and went back through the line and the lady tells us the registration pretty much isn't good enough even though her coworker gave us the site and gave clear instructions  So by the time she figures out why shes confused she looks up and said oh sorry u have to be here 30 min before ur flight. I said we have been here for more than 15 min & qe still have 30 min she said no its 29 min so I can't check you in. It was 5:41am and our flight is at 6:10. So basically she waited 1 min after she could book us to figure out what made sense on her behalf & how to get us checked in. Plus she couldn't rebook us and neither could the customer rep. Without charging more than double for the flight to book for the next day."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,"Arrived to the ATL airport on time for our flight. They rebooked us onto a different flight with no explanation and told us to go to the Delta desk. The different flight was in a different terminal which we had to shuttle to. When we arrived, Delta informed us that American Airlines had made a mistake and booked us onto a flight with no seats available and also had not submitted the ticket changes properly. We were unable to get on the flight. We then shuttled back to AA and were told there was nothing they could do despite the fact that there were many other flights to Europe with seats available day and connections to our final destination. Their excuse was “there is nothing we can do since the tickets were booked with points their value is $0”. This is not how you treat your loyal customers. We are now arriving 24 hours later than scheduled."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Customer service and app ever,"Worst customer service ever. Had a 10 hour wait on hold and was able to schedule a call back. When I got the call back finally, they didn’t even add my infant to our boarding passes like they said they did on the phone. Still had to add at airport. The App is absolutely garbage and doesn’t register any charges made to reservations, even if you are paying to upgrade. DON’T FLY AA"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Absolute garbage,"Said they’d reschedule my flight and they’d send me an email with instructions to claim credit…never got an email.After that, one flight was still active and one wasn’t. Still no credit. 4 hours between callback times so that’s 12 hours of waiting on the phone on 3 calls for a rep. Connected 3 times and disconnected twice. Eventually got hold of someone and “now the flight is full”I haven’t even touched a plane, gave up $1300, didn’t fly anywhere and can say without a doubt that this airline is absolute trash."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Bad info from AA representative costs me $500, no refund.","Bad weather caused a delay, which I understand. This caused me to miss a connection, after the flight crew promised repeatedly over the loudspeaker that connections would be delayed also, no need to worry, no need to rebook.  200 people in line for rebooking when I get into the terminal. I Text in to customer support, representative named Samantha tells me its a good idea to just buy my own ticket home since there is only one seat left on the last plane home. Samantha reassures me that I will get a refund, since this action is exactly what the counter rep would do if was at the desk.  I have the text exchanged saved. Been battling with AA Refund, customer service, and complaints for 2 weeks now.  Final verdict: We're sorry, but no refund.       Thank you Samantha, for lying to me and costing me $500.   Will not be flying AA again, and I'm selling all of my AA stock as well."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Business Manager,"I never write reviews but have been so disturbed by this airlines consistent poor performance that had to. Maybe it is the unions or just a general lack of pride in their work but clearly the employees lack basic principles of alignment, urgency, attention to detail, and general customer service training. Many years ago worked for an airline for many years that took pride in all of these elements. Looking at principles of business success., many of the employees I encountered provided multiple reasons why the should be released from employment just over the course of my several hours with them. If not for the immense demand for travel despite lack of basic sound service principles,  this company would be shutting it’s doors."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,THEY CAUSED ME TO MISS CONNECTION AND HAD TO FLY ALL NIGHT TO GET BACK! AWFUL EXPERIENCE!,"They caused me to miss my connection and had me fly all night through a different airport to get bath home!! Missed a whole night waiting around in airports!! The first leg was delayed, which then caused me to miss my connection. The connection would’ve had to wait only 10 minutes for the 7 of us on the first leg. It was the last flight out that night. They wouldn’t pay for a hotel, so I had to fly to a different airport, wait there 4 hours and then fly back. They had me at airports all night long for a missed evening connection, which was their fault due to delay. Awful experience!! Never again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Business Woman,"Awful experience. I do not recommend. Will never use again. I already paid for first class, but it was not available on flight. No refund was given. No meal. They stated their oven was broken. Furthermore, my seat, and arm rest were held together with duct tape. Awful and unprofessional. Moreover, I was physically harassed by their security over a physical deformity I have. They poked and jabbed me with items at my deformity, even after I told them they were hurting me. They announced that they can have me escorted out if I did not comply. Just Awful service."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,AA- Never again,"I chose to fly American Airlines because I found what I thought  was a reasonable rate for a round trip flight on Hopper. In the long run, it ended up costing me a lot more for what I would have paid for on SOUTHWEST. Now, I am sitting here at the airport waiting to fly back home but my flight is delayed. It went from being 5 minutes late to an hour to now two hours. This has also caused me to miss my connecting flight. Which now has caused me to get home 4 hours later than I expected to. I called to see if I can speak to an agent to refund me my money so that I may take a different airline- my call back time to speak to an agent is 4 hours! I will not be flying with AA-ever."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Travel Experience from start to finish I've ever had!,"Memorial Day we confirmed our flight twice to leave on the morning of June 1 (our resort and tickets were booked from June 1 -7 a year in advance.) At 4:00 we get a notice that the Tulsa to Dallas flight was cancelled and they couldn't get us on another flight until Friday over 1/2 our vacation. It was too late to rent a van for 7 people so we drove 2 cars to Dallas a 4 hour trip paid 168 per car to park so we could take the flight from DFW to Cancun. June 7 we arrive to the airport 2 hours early to take a flight home. We start getting flight delay notices. No communication, then after sitting at the airport for 4 hours we get notified that our flight to the US is cancelled. No communication on what to do we were herded like cattle back through immigration no vouchers for food, or safe places to stay. We are in a foreign country with absolutely no help. We finally find a Marriot that has a free shuttle but we have to pay another 261.00 plus another 180 in food  to stay the night and eat somewhere safe. American Airlines tried to tell us that there were no flights out until the 9th we finally got a flight for all 7 of us, but we had to fly to Miami then to Dallas and then drive 4 hours home plus pay an extra 24.00 for parking.  Also we were delayed 45 minutes getting to our car because a stewardess decided that my daughter's carry on wouldn't fit even though she has used it the whole trip and its a carry on size made her check it in and the baggage claim was at terminal B and we need to pick our cars up at terminal DI think AA over books then cancel people knowing that there is nothing the people can do because it is blamed on weather, but all the other airlines were flying out to the same destinations we were going on the day we were going. All we got from AA is since it was weather related they don't have to give vouchers or any help. They left a full plane load of people stranded in another country in an unsafe area. If I can keep from it my family and I will never fly AA we will stick with Southwest"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Incompetent at EVERY LEVEL,"Only flew AA because of early flight availability. Flight was 1 hour late leaving IAH because they brought WRONG PLANE to gate!  Missed connection in DFW so had to fly in an OLD DIRTY PLANE standby coach to meet our time frame because gate person initially put us on a flight that would miss our event in OKC.  (paid for 1st class) to OKC. Waited 4 hrs for a call back from AA.  Never got it. For our issues! 37.00 refund.  No miles, no apology, nothing. Avoid AA at all costs!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE EVER!!!!!,Flight got cancelled..had to wait in a customer service line for 3hrs...got home a day later and AA refuses to refund me my money.  They gave 2 different excuses of why the flight was cancelled.  I would suggest no one EVER uses these guys to fly.
Date of travel: June 2021,30,They can't afford to refund $158.25,"A weather delay causing a mass backup and major inconvenience for thousands. I'm not looking for a full refund as our trip to where we were going was just fine and no issues considering COVID rules. On the way back home, we were put in a holding pattern over Charlotte due too weather but then got diverted to Knoxville for refueling. Ok that sucks but necessary. We land in Knoxville and receive notifications that our connecting flight is also delayed. We land in Charlotte ad have to sprint to our connecting flight. We make it and within two minutes the flight is canceled. Head to a customer service desk to find a line that was longer than a country mile. I get a notification on my phone that we have been automatically rebooked for a flight 48 hours later. This we cannot do as we needed to get home and back to work. Needless to say this trip cost way more than budgeted because of hotel room and rental car to drive 350 miles. Mind you I am not looking for a full refund just the amount that wasn't used because we couldn't use that particular flight."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines lost my baggage,Flight to Nashville was cancelled June 8 2021.Due to maintenance. They have me a quick connect flight. But they didn’t load my luggage and when I arrived to my destination my luggage was still sitting somewhere in North Carolina. The next day only one of my bags arrived. Don’t fly American Airlines.Requested a refund and was told I was ineligible.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Customer Service Does NOT Matter,"American re-routed our trip sending us through Charlotte NC, which is the ABSOLUTE WORST airport!!! Over crowded, FILTHY airport with INSUFFICIENT seating for passengers. I literally had to race an American employee (on the clock) for a seat because he wanted to charge his phone while WORKING! The employee beat me to the seat and proceeded to take the seat next to him placing his airline radio on one seat as he sat in the other. UNBELIEVABLE!!! Why send customers to an airport too small to accommodate the number of passengers en route???? I purposely booked our flights so as to AVOID Charlotte, yet American changed the connection to Charlotte. If you like STANDING for hours between flights choose American. When we arrived at our final destination the cleaning crew entered the aircraft BEFORE we exited the plane!!! After the first few rows of passengers exited the FULL plane here we have the cleaning crew in and out of aisles cleaning as the majority  of passengers were waiting to exit the plane.  INSANE!!! Our flight was on time so it made ZERO sense to bring the cleaning crew onboard with majority of passengers trying to exit.  Even the flight attendants were baffled by this action. The final FAIL by American left us with a LOST BAG once we reached our final destination.  The lost bag line at American was LONG, clearly a sign this is par for the course, as baggage claim employees SLOWLY acknowledged waiting customers. American wants your money in return for HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. American re-routes passengers in an attempt to fill seats without any consideration for the passenger. Clearly customer service is NOT a priority!  Avoid this airline at all costs!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,20,WE HAVE TO DO BETTER AMERICAN!!!,Things happen and some thing are out of anyone’s control but to have two planes with mechanical issues causing long delays is not a good way to do business. There has to be a better way to take care of the planes . On top of changing gates. American needs to do better. I know Covid stressing everyone out because you cannot get people to work due to earning more on unemployment. But is there anyway we can do better….please. American use to be great and it has drastically gone downhill. Been delayed 6 times now and still counting….
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Horrible Airline, Been on the phone with them so many times this week","I  booked with AA with a voucher when they cancelled my flight back at the beginning of the pandemic. They once again cancelled one leg of my trip and did not notify me that they did so. I had to call them and find out from their agent. I rebooked a different flight with them, and their agent booked my connection flight 15 HOURS BEFORE I GET THERE!! HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?!?!? I have been on hold with them for about 45 minutes now and I am using the time to leave them poor reviews because this is ridiculous. My flight is tomorrow and I have no clue if they will let me fly to Nairobi"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,An entire day of DELAYED & CANCELED TRIPS!,"First time on American Airlines as an Adult - and I have to say I am thankful I'm NOT a card carrying member of American Airlines! Flights were canceled without any communication from EGE to DFW.  I received a notification that American Airlines had kindly rescheduled me to a flight the next afternoon-- I could go on and on... Basically, if you have nothing better to do than be jerked around all day, fly American Airlines!  If you actually want to get somewhere on time, fly United or Delta."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Awful scheduling,"We were supposed to leave at 7:36 pm and took off at 9:09pm. We had two separate delays, and still left later than the second delay. They changed the gate on us four separate times, causing us to walk all over the airport. Then after that, apparently we were on a different aircraft than was originally planned. TEN MINUTES before we were supposed to board new boarding passes were being issued to every passenger. Now this last part isn’t that big of a deal, but after all of this the plane had zero outlets even though it was advertised. I hope I never have to fly this airline ever again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never again,"The worst record for on time flights. Don't count on them or you will be very disappointed! If you like sitting around the airport, ok. They will promise and promise and delay again and again til finally your flight will be cancelled."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Mr,"Will never fly on American Airlines again, cancelled our flight to Miami which connects to st Lucia, gave zero notice would not help us with a connecting flight . Do not go with American Airlines, apparently they do not need your business nor care zero about customer service!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Cancelled our flight with no notification &/or reason,"We booked our trip about 8 months in advance, checked on for our flight online the day before & just happened to check the flight status the morning of on the way to the airport. FLIGHT CANCELLED. No text, no email, no notification whatsoever ... no vouchers, no apology, no explanation, no refund. They found another flight that could get us home 9 hours later, who knows if that will happen. Completely disgusted with American Airlines, will never recommend flying with them again."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Gross mishandling of luggage and terrible customer service,Flight was filled to the brim and several travel partners and families had been split up even they booked the ticket together. I was forced to check my carry on even though I told them I had a tight layover. My bag was delayed. I was going straight to a backpacking trip 3hrs outside Portland and was told to purchase everything necessary. What a hassle but OK.  I called later that day to inform them that I was going camping and would not be at my destination for the next five days. They ensured me that I would get a call before they dropped off my luggage. When I got back to civilization I'd received an email with a picture showing they had DROPPED OF MY BAG ON THE FRONT STAIRCASE IN THE MIDDLE OF PORTLAND CITY.  I've never experienced such reckless disrespect for passenger luggage.  The bag had been sitting on the porch visible from the street for three days! They are supposed to have you sign off the drop of which of course no one had done as no one was there! Now AA is trying to wiggle their way out of reimbursing my purchases. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY WITH YOUR LUGGAGE! I'll do my best to warn anyone about using this airline.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Airline in the History of Airlines (American Airlines),The company flat out fakes plane schedules and will have you sitting in a airport all day to go nowhere.  It's all about money with these guys so if you value your money and time fly anything else.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,What a NIGHTMARE,"My flight was diverted to another airport because of weather. No big deal, it happens. BUT my flight was delayed until the next day and was from the diverting airport to the airport I was suppose to land with no way of reaching my final destination for another few DAYS. American Airlines has been extremely unhelpful and sorting out the matter of refunding my flight they were not able to fulfill. Correspondence has been very poor via e-mail, I've had to wait for HOURS on the phone to get someone, to only tell me to ""try again tomorrow"". It's been 2 weeks, still no word or reasoning for why I have yet to be refunded."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Abominable, appalling, horrendous, incompetent","What we thought would be a direct flight from Savannah to Dallas at 8am turned into a 15 hour grueling ordeal. First our 8am flight was rescheduled to 6am (no notification from AA). Flight was rescheduled to 2pm. We arrived at 1pm to find our flight cancelled (no notification from AA). We hopped on a flight to Charlotte connecting to Dallas. We spent the next 6 hours in the airport waiting for the connecting flight. BTW the flight was not sold out but the incompetent airline couldn't manage to seat my family together, so we switched seats ourselves. Once boarded we sat on the tarmack for an hour because one of the engines wasn't working. Finally in the air we landed in Dallas but couldn't exit the plan because the sky bridge was broken. Finally, off the plane ready to retrieve  our bags only to be told by a first class idiot that our bags never left Savannah. Through my research I found that they did leave Savannah, they were just re-tagged. But the first class moron who didn't have enoughh sense or no-how to research the issue couldn't tell me that my bags were actually at Dallas at a different baggage claim area. I WILL NEVER FLY THIS AIRLINE AGAIN NOONE SHOULD!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American airlines,"It is absolutely ridiculous, having someone stuck at the airport because you cancel flights out of nowhere. My boyfriend has now been stuck there for almost 24 hours because you decide to cancel his flights an hour ahead of time. with no explanation? Seriously? Never will we book with American Airlines again. that’s a promise. This is not the only time this has happened, you guys are most certainly not to be relied on."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline since Delta,"American Airlines SUCKS. They are worst ever. Cancelled our flight without a reason. We were put on standby that we waited for one hour. No seats!!! We were put on another flight that was four hours later without ""I'm Sorry"" or a voucher to get lunch or dinner.Never Ever Again will we fly American.Delta use to loose our luggage but American Lost our WHOLE DAY waiting in the Chicago Airport.."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline  experience ever!,"Booked a flight to NYC for Thursday June 10 (in 2 days) No confirmation email, no charge on my card, just message saying flight confirmed, not “ticketed” yet. 12 hours later: no change Try calling customer service: 4 hour waitTry to use “call back service” only works with US numbers (really? 2021 with all the high tech software available...)Email customer service: “Expect response in 7-10 days”So... i booked with Delta (an actual airline with humans who treat you like a human) Because I need a confirmed flight ASAP to connect with my international flight....15 hours after booking! : email : flight confirmed...card charged.Try calling, emailing to cancel and refund: see above...Stay away from these thieves!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Everything is Poor,"First of all I don’t know who does the employments,it is really bad customer service as in all over, they kept canceling without even trying to be sympathetic when you talk to them. They are rude!!! I mean from midland to Louisville cos my last flight to Lexington was cancelled and I had to reroute, got to Louisville and my bag wasn’t there, the lady attending to people was very lousy, it’s sad that I’m saying this as a Blackman, but that lady shouldn’t be working for anything that has to do with customer’s service,then the attendants at the kiosk were very insensitive apart from the lady that attended to me in Dallas. There’s nothing American about AA…they don’t care!"
Date of travel: May 2021,30,NO FOOD ON PLANE NO FOOD IN THE AIRPORT,"As always the employees of American Airlines were kind courteous and helpful. No fault there.We arrived at the airport at 2:00 pm to fly at 3:30 central time.  We landed in KONA at 2:00am Central Time.We had a 20 minute transport from gate to gate in LAX in a shuttle across the Tramack.From 3:30 pm to 2:00 am we received on the airplane. 2 small packages of pretzels and 2-ounce bottles of water.Sodas were requested by other passengers but were never offered to us.I was aware of snacks only and attempted to purchase sandwiches online but could not navigate the website.NO sandwiches were offered for purchase on the airplane.  We were a party of 5 and my daughter and I bought at 2:00 pm the last two packaged sandwiches at the airport.  A ham and cheese which was bread ham and cheese for $9.00 and an Italian which did have lettuce for $12.00.  The other people in our party had to share.   The airport was out of wrapped sandwiches.  PACK A PICNIC LUNCH FOR AT LEAST 2 MEALS PER PERSON!!!  Carry it in addition to personals.  The Kona Airport did not have food at 11:00 pm and it looked like all restaurants were closed.  On the way back we were able to purchase a hard boiled egg.  200 plus people flying out at the same time.  We were given a tiny bag of wheat thins, craisons one oreo and a can pf pop on the airplane.  REMEMBER 200 PLUS PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO BUY FOOD AT THE AIRPORT AND THEY ARE NOT READY FOR US.  MOST CONCESSIONS ARE CLOSED."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Airline Experience,"Not only did we have to reschedule our flights twice, but we missed two connecting flights due to American Airline’s incompetence. I get delays happen, but the complete lack of concern the American employees showed toward its customers today was actually shocking. Everywhere we turned for help we were met with literal shrugs, “go stand in that line,” and absolutely zero indication that anyone actually cared. We ended up having to reroute to Atlanta and rent a car to get home. They lost our entire party’s luggage. We were supposed to be home at 7PM and I’m writing this from the Atlanta airport at 2:56AM with a 3.5 hour drive ahead of us. Whatever you do avoid this airline at all costs. I have flown many airlines over the years and this one obviously does NOT care for its customers."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,I don’t know if it’s CLT or American Airlines but this is ridiculous,"First, the agent was amazing: so nice! But the rest of the  was absolutely abysmal. We were supposed to take off at 10:30 PM and experienced 10 minute delays until finally at 1:00 AM we were allowed to board. This is absolutely ridiculous and America Airlines should be ashamed. No other industry could treat customers with such little transparency. Awful experience. Will never fly through CLT again and hopefully can avoid American Airlines for the rest of my life."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The Lie just to get you out,Flight was delayed 4hrs that resulted in missing connecting flight had to spend the night In Miami for next flight next day that said contact this website for reimbursement spent $500 on the cheapest hotel available at 12am they lied the AA website answers no we don’t !!!!  They charged us for over Weight luggage in Cancun $160.  But in Miami they told us that’s for one flight only we need. To pay again for Orlando flight while it was there fault we had to stay in Miami due to their delay 4hrs.  Basically they are acting like street hustlers.  Never again will fly AA
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline ever!,"We had a flight booked from San Jose to Dallas booked and it was cancelled right before with no explanation or alternatives. We sat at the ticket attendants for an hour before we got anything worked out, just for the second flight to get cancelled again. We were not provided with any help to reschedule our flight, and customer service was a 4 hour wait. We were told a worker would come assist us, and an hour later a very rude American worker came, and made us go through customs squishing a whole flights worth of people into one line, and only offering cheap food vouchers and one night in the worst hotel in the area, still not providing help to reschedule a flight home."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Nightmare,"Took this airline returning and the weather wasn't that bad and its caused alot of problems, I do not recommend this airline. All the othet companies were flying no problem and with American its a issue."
Date of travel: June 2021,40,"Smooth, safe and on time both ways DCA to New Orleans","Very orderly boarding and on arrival disembarking, with all pax masked as well as ground staff and flight crew as far as I could see. All fully complied with the Covid precautions. The airline could pace us on arrival to deplane by small groups of rows to avoid aerosolized buildup in the aisle with too many people standing up. Otherwise the full procedure was as safe as possible."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never again,"I will never under any circumstance book with American Airlines again. After experiencing a medical situation that made me 3 minutes late to boarding, they refused to let me on my flight. My flight has been sitting here for over 30 minutes, without a single **** given from any AA employee. They refused to let me on my flight.They don't care about you, they don't care about your comfort or safety. Choose anyone other than AA."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst flying experience ever.,Absolutley worst flying experience of my life and ive flown alot through out my life both domesticalyAnd internationally. I will never fly american again or recomend any one else do. I dont how theyre headquarters are in dfw and they still have no grasp at that airport
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worse experience ever,Well let me start off by saying worse experience ever.  I made my reservations early in March.  When I checked in the night before to print my boarding pass and also to check in I noticed they bumped me off of my Flight.  This is NOT what I signed up for. I was suppose to fly directly to Laguardia but they decided to place me on a stop over at Charlotte first then to NY Laguarida airport without even notifying me prior to this change.  How disrespectful!  Oh it gets better.  I proceeded to call American Airlines to change my flight.  I started calling at 9:00PM in a panic waiting to speak to a customer service Rep. waiting for someone to finally answer but due to high call volume a person finally answered at 5:00AM in the morning.  Oh yes I was on hold for 8 hours.  I could not even change it online saying I had to call the airline directly.  How ILLEGAL this is to bump me off my flight due to the fact someone paid more money for the flight I was suppose to be on.  I finally got a reservation booked for the next day with JET BLUE.  I will never fly American Airlines again!  Beware people this will happen to you so think twice before booking a flight with them and good luck getting thru to customer service!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible Air line,"The WORST airline. Terrible seats, no room for your legs, and the most obnoxious people. We were delayed by an hour and were never told a reason. Then we were delayed getting off the plane. THEN it took an hour to get our bags from baggage claim. I will never fly American again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Fly AA only at your own risk.,"As a frequent tourist, hiccups and not so good service is a very common thing in the whole world. However, this Co. takes the first prize in absolute disarray, mismanagement and helpless customer service.  Talk about complete disaster! We walked a long line of about 3 blocks inside the DFW airport and counted over 400 people in a row at 3 a.m in order to secure rescheduling for a dozen flights cancelled or delayed this Saturday, June 5th 2021.  They simply had other employees on other counters just fixing their nails while hundreds of people were standing in a single line for over 5 hours. They blamed a bad weather in the area but Delta and others were flying w/o a problem.  After 18 hours at the airport, finally was crammed set on an antiquated, very old plane, with upset and rude cru that had worked already over their regular schedules to no of our faults. Even though we had bought premium economy were told to take the basic one or wait another 6 hours at the airport. Still have to dispute the charges though. Our family, for one, no longer  ever will try to fly with these incompetent fools again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible.,This is the absolute worst service I’ve ever experienced in my life. We were supposed to be in Palm Springs Saturday at 10 pm. We are still stranded in Dallas on a Monday. We had to move our flight to 9 pm and we’re supposed to have our rescheduled flight at 1pm. They refused to pay for me and my boyfriend to get a hotel or even a taxi. We’re 17 and 18. Stranded in a whole new state with no way around spending money I don’t have to spare. Will never travel with them again in my life.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Absolute worst customer service,"Missed our connecting flight due to delays, all I got was a free voucher for a 12$ meal, had to book a hotel on my own dime for the next flight which was 7am the next day, finally get here and that flight is canceled. They overbook their flights and don’t leave room for standbys for situations like this, currently at Dallas airport for 12 hours and counting, next flight is 7pm tonight"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,WORST SERVICE EVER,"Where do I start?  I came to bury my grandfather in Illinois from Florida so already had a fun time of navigating airports and rental car drama when they decided to delay our first flight and then when we finally do pull into Charlotte, we are sitting on the tarmac 10 minutes doing nothing while our plane is being boarded giving us 5 minutes to traverse 2 whole areas of gates on a Monday morning.  Get your crap in gear American, I won't be flying again.  Not to mention we finally arrive at home and yet another delay due to the FAA overbooking flights for a short handed ground crew.  HIRE PEOPLE AND GET BETTER ORGANIZED."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,American Airlines Dishonest Practices,Understanding that the Airlines are not operating at 100% due to COVID and waiting to speak with customer service for long periods of time or waiting to board with only one ticket agent does not upset me. My complaint is on May 31st we were delayed due to weather and that's ok. We were told that we would miss our connecting flight and again that's ok because safety first. I spoke with ticket agent who was so helpful and accommodating. I was booked for a flight for the next day out of DFW. We had a 4:26pm departure. We again were delayed so we boarded an hour or more late but again told that we had a delay as other plans were in front of us. Pilots were great and keep us updated till the last update that the pilot/co-pilot were approaching their MAX Hours to fly and that we would be canceled. We were taken of the plane and again asked to contact customer service to rebook to get to Dallas. Here is when things got crazy as American couldn't get us to Dallas for days. So the gate agent said look rent a car and drive to Dallas to make your flight tomorrow and submit your for rental car and hotel. So I went to get a rental car as well as contacting America over the text app and also got confirmation that this was the only option and to submit receipts to American. American Customer Relations emailed me and phoned me and stated the Flight 1691 was canceled due weather no refunds sorry your SOL. I disagreed and informed her that we were delayed because of weather and canceled because no pilots. Her response is the computer states canceled for weather so again sorry. Please understand my complaint is not that I lost money or a day from work or couldn't get home to my kids. It's American Airlines defrauding its customers by labeling a flight canceled for weather when in fact it was canceled for no pilots. I believe this to be unjust and for that I and my family will never fly American Airlines. My hope is JETBLUE will take them over.

Date of travel: November 2020,10,Rescheduling a flight has been a nightmare!!!!!,"American airlines has the worst phone service.  I called them on  Saturday June 5th I was on hold for almost 2 hours waiting to speak to a representative.  I finally hung up. I called  back Sunday and was able to leave my number for a returned call.  I had to wait 15 hours for a return call. They called me at 9:30 Monday June 7th  i again waited 5 minutes for a representative.  I was transferred twice because no one was qualified to help me.   Now I'm on hold according to their automated system for another 40 minutes.   I can't re-book  my reservation online because my traveling party is too large.  It's crazy with the technology we have that it takes this long to try and rebook a flight!!!!! Hire more operators that are qualified in all areas of ticket sales because this is ridiculous, having to wait then having to be transferred to 3 people and yet no one has been able to help me.   You have no problem charging high ticket prices and luggage fees.  Maybe you should take the cost of all your rising fees and you should hire more phone operators that are qualified in all areas so the customer doesn't have to be bounced around."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Return flight experience,"Never Again!!!!  There were too many issues to name them all. But after being stuck in traffic on the way to the airport I get to the American Airlines terminal and there are hundreds of people in line trying to get their bags checked. What a nightmare! After not being able to pay for my bags online, ( my friend and I both tried and she on a computer) and not being able to print or get on my phone, a boarding pass online, the counter had hundreds of people trying to check their bags. I had only 46 mins before my flight was scheduled to leave! There were too many issues to name including being given bad advice by their attendees. Fortunately, I did make my flight as they were boarding but no thanks to American! Never again will I fly American Airlines!!! Period!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Most unreliable airline ever!!,"This is the last time I will fly with American Airlines. They always have delays and do not care about customer service. After a delay for 7 hours due to 'maintenance issues ' I missed my connecting flight to Springfield, MO..had to stay overnight at Charlotte Airport and they used 'weather ' not to help with hotel coverage or vouchers. These ppl are truly heartless!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines screwed me and they’ll screw  you too.,American Airlines stranded me in Los Angeles and refused to pay for a hotel room. Missed my connecting flight because they weren’t on time.  They screwed me and they’ll screw you too.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst day ever,"If I could give them a zero I most definitely would . By far the worst experience of my life .  I’ve never flown an airline so unprofessional and horrible . We missed our flight because they had only one person checking bags in . After that our flight was delayed 4 to 5 hours and they just kept changing departure times . The communication was the worst . And when we finally landed we still couldn’t even get off the plane . I almost cried , never will I fly with them again . Please do yourself the same favor , not worth the trouble"
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Will Never Fly Again,"Nearly had my honeymoon ruined. They delayed our flight by hours, which would have caused us to miss our connecting flight, and the only other one to take after that would have caused us to miss out on a whole day of vacation. Try to switch flights on the app and online: nothing. Called them: nothing. Finally, a super nice flight attendant at the airport was able to get us a flight on another airline (she’s the only reason I didn’t put this as Terrible). Get to our destination hours later than we were supposed to only to discover they lost our luggage. They were able to locate it, but it still caused a ton of grief. Definitely won’t be flying again; their prices are nowhere near being worth this level of drama"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,BY FAR THE WORST AIRLINE I'VE EVER DELT WITH,"Can't even put in words how BAD the experience was. You don't have to do the same, but I will make sure to NEVER fly with such an unprofessional Airline again. The miscommunication between their employees in UNREAL."

Customer service was atrocious. I am now scheduled to fly from my original nonstop to a 4 hour layover. I recommend anyone considering flying with AA, pick another Airline.  Likeliness to Recommend 0."

Staff has been kind to rearrange our flights but they keep getting delayed then cancelled. Although they're kind, they need to be better organized. I will not fly with them again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Abominable AA,"ABSOLUTE WORST flying AND customer relations experience in our lives. American Airlinws was the flight to connect us to an international flight at JFK. At the last minute they cancelled the flight without notifying us. Waited in line 2 HOURS at the airport before we were notified. Then they offered to put us on a 32-HOUR flight itinerary the following day! Our original itinerary was 20 hours!!! They added 12 HOURS to our trip, plus caused us to stay overnight in the city, the expense of food, re-taking the PCR Covid test, AND waiting 4.5 HOURS on hold to try to reach a real person on customer service lines. This is ludicrous!!! And they claimed over and over it's the best they can do! We have vowed to NEVER fly AA again. ALL three times we've flown with them, there have been problems, but this takes the cake. Infuriated...."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst travel experience ever,"This is the worst flying experience of my life. Our flight at 10pm was cancelled reportedly due to weather in Dallas. We watched flight after flight take off following the cancellation of our flight. We were directed to go to customer service to receive assistance with getting on another flight to get home. We were told that the only flight available would be in two days. When asked about accommodations we were told that American isn’t a hotel and that we would need to figure it out. Unacceptable customer service. There was no attempt to empathize, no apology, and no attempt to help further. When asked about getting a hotel accommodation due to being scheduled out two days we were told by Elena that as parents if we wanted to make sure our son was properly taken care of we shouldn’t have traveled without enough money to get a hotel. When the supervisor arrived it was much of the same. Raised voices and yelling that there is nothing American can do. Stating multiple times that it’s not their fault the flight was cancelled and that we signed a contract. We asked to speak with the managers supervisor only to be told she’s not going to speak with us because she won’t tell us anything different. They threatened to call police on us. We attempted to get our bags (and toddler car seat) that we checked, in an attempt to drive the last 5 hours to Wichita only to be told that they would not release our bags. The highest ranking manager Jennifer reluctantly spoke with us and was no help as well telling us that there’s nothing we can do. Continued to tell me to call corporate if I wanted saying it would do no good. I called customer service and stayed on hold for 2 hours and 16 minutes before hanging up. After much debate and finding out there are no rentals available and full hotels we stayed the night in the airport. In the morning we found one of very few bright spots from a customer service rep named Bellen. She helped us find a flight into Kansas first thing in the morning. Unfortunately our bags got lost while we were in flight. Now in Kansas bagless, we worked with the great team in Manhattan to report the missing bags. Delivery was set up and now we wait with no safe form of transportation for us and our toddler. The incompetence of this airline is unbelievable. Only rating 1 because 0 is not an option."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Flying First Class But No First Class Service,Sat on tarmac for 1 1/2 hours and did not even receive on drink during entire time.Is this first class?
Date of travel: June 2021,10,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!,"Absolutely the WORST flying experience we have ever had! Our flight was cancelled last minute, and we did not receive any notification that it was cancelled. I had to find out on the way to the airport through the app. Once we got there to see what we could do, we had to wait in the long line with the employees wanting us to get stand by tickets which meant we were gonna be waiting at the airport ALL day. It was the only option we were given, so I spoke to the supervisor. She was 10x less helpful!!!! Worst experience and customer service ever. Finally, we were told to call the American Airlines customer service number (which is always a 4-5 hour wait but luckily it wasn’t that morning). On the phone they said there was no way we were getting on a plane by doing stand by, so not sure why they gave us that option at the airport! We got more done on a phone call then at the airport. All flights were booked, had to reschedule paid hotel and activities (lost money), and the best they could do was a flight the next morning. DO NOT RECOMMEND WHATSOVER!!!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Stuck at the airport in Dallas/ AGENTS DON'T CARE,"As you can see in these photos the line for ""customer service"" goes on for probably an eighth of a mile if not longer.  Its 1:00 am on Sunday June 6th 2021 at DFW and American screwed it up big time.  Yes there were some storms here but It took almost THREE HOURS TO UNLOAD THE PLANE OF ITS LUGGAGE SO WE COULD MAKE OUR NEXT FLIGHT WHICH WE NOW MISSED AND HAVE TO WAIT IN THIS RIDICULOUS LINE! We ended up giving up trying to switch our flights with American after leaving multiple messages on the phone with them, they'd put us in a queue to leave a number,  they call you back and then make you wait for over a half hour only to hang up on them.  I had to spend almost 2k dollars for 6 one way tickets from Dallas to Chicago through United.  The soonest I could find a flight was on United, if I had to wait for American I wouldn't get out of this airport for TWO DAYS!! THEY KNEW THEY'RE WERE PASSENGERS STRANDED AT THE AIRPORT BECAUSE THEY CAUSED THE DELAYS YET THEY CHOSE TO LEAVE PASSENGERS SUCH AS US BEHIND SO THEY COULD KEEP THEIR SCHEDULE WITH A PLANE PROBABLY HALF EMPTY!!!! BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING MONEY AND KEEPING THEIR SCHEDULES BUT TO HELL WITH THE CUSTOMERS THEY LEFT STRANDED!! I AM NOT GOING TO BE STUCK WITH PAYING FOR SOMETHING AMERICAN AIRLINES SHOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF!!!  I WILL BE CONTESTING THE CHARGES FOR THE ORIGINAL TICKETS THROUGH AMERICAN.We're still here at the airport in Dallas, hoping to be on this plane in an hour."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,Our group of 10 people flew American Airlines from Vegas to DFW down to Cancun and did the reverse flight path coming home a week later. Our flights times got changed on us a week before our flight and with none of the 10 in our group getting to sit next to each other on any of the flights down or back. They wanted us to pay additional money to be able to sit next to each other even in economy. My new luggage I checked arrived in Cancun with a hole in the side of it from baggage handling. The worst experience was in Dallas on our return home. We had our flight delayed four times over a course of five hours due to no available flight crew and then they unexpectedly cancelled our flight altogether for “weather” without warning. Other flights continued to come and go out of the airport during this time. No lodging was provided for us when they cancelled our flight at midnight and told us we wouldn’t fly out until the following afternoon. AA customer service was terrible and had no regard for the impact there decision to cancel our flights and rebook us for 24 hours later.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,International travel,"Yes, I saved money, but not really. Once you buy your flight you find out you have to pay for up charges such as for a single bag, where your seat is. Then you get on your way and you think all is good. Think again! On our way to Costa Rica our flight was 30 min late which meant we had 20min to navigate through Dallas/Fort Worth airport--not an easy task. We arrived at the gate 5min before the flight was to leave. They already had the doors shut, claimed they waited three minutes for us and we were not getting on the plane! This caused us to have to spend the night in Dallas. They did pay for the hotel, but it cost me $200.00 in missed vacation expenses. Now tonight we are trying to fly back home. Flight was supposed to leave at 10:30---the plane has been delayed several times and the latest is midnight we may leave, because we are waiting for the flight attendants who are late from an incoming flight. This will cost me an extra night of parking. With American, your gate constantly changes, the flight info is not correct on your fancy app and flight times are constantly changing. I would think twice before leaving the flying to American. In the end any money you saved is lost in your time spent and extra charges as a result of their untimelyness."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Customer service waiting time is horrible,I was on customer service call for more than 3 hours . They didn’t give me option to call back . I stayed on call for more than 3 hours.
Date of travel: May 2021,40,Pleasant surprise,On this occasion American Airlines has not cut its services like other airlines. A choice of meals for dinner plus breakfast and the crew regularly checked on the passengers.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Mr Flat,"Maintenance issue.  Not a problem just need to change a tire.However after a wait of two hours, the maintenance guys left for shift change then had to wait longer for the next shift to take over.Either the employees are incompetent, lazy and not wanting to work or American Airlines is to cheap for overtime.There are probably 200+ less willing to fly AA again.Not my first problem with American Airlines just first time mad enough to write this"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never Again!,"They put us on a plane with a broken toilet that delayed take off.. They then brought in another maintenance worker to work on the overhead compartments. Once that was done, they could not find any ground teams to move the plane from the bay. Due to these delays we then were hit by a thunderstorm.Now I know that we cannot predict the weather, but there were flights taking off well into the maintenance window we experienced. After 2 hours of waiting, we finally took off, but the delay caused us to miss our flights.When we made it to Phoenix, they have hotel vouchers to a lovely couple due to being on their honeymoon. The rest of us were cut loose to fend for ourselves as there were no other flights to the west coast until next day.The responders were completely neutral and showed no signs of empathy or care. The plane was apparently on its last run before being retired. I will never fly AA again if I have a choice.."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never ever fly american airlines,"If there is a 0 rating i will rate them 0! The worst airline out there! It canceled 6 flights tonight at 10pm and nobody from the customer service can answer. We decided to book a different airline instead and just get our luggage. Rebooking was hard and had a mile long line wait. When they texted our rebooked flight ( texted at 3am)it was the next day and a longer flight with a connecting flight. But the worst thing is they cannot even give us our luggage. They told us when they canceled that we can just get our checked in luggage at the baggage claim.   But when we were there they said to wait until 4am to get an answer coz they dont have enough  workers. No hotels available, no flights and with 3 kids!  Imagine that! Never ever use American airlines! Worst service and airline!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The ABSOLUTE WORST Customer Service,"Made roundtrip reservations on the American Airlines web site in March 2021  directly thinking that would improve service for a June 2021 roundtrip flight to Boston from Seattle. Yesterday, thanks to another flight booked through Expedia, we learned that the flights were cancelled. No communication at all from American. Imagine showing up for your vacation and finding out then that you have not flight! Called American's customer service. The option was to wait on hold or get a call back in over 4 hours. That was 2:30 in the morning. I opted for that because this had to get resolved now. The call came at 2:30am (middle of the night waking me up). I spent 45 minutes with their rep who at first didn't even know his  own airline cancelled the flights. Finally got rebooked. Well, after work today I checked on line. The original cancelled flight was removed. That's good. The newly promised flights were no where to be seen. At this point I have been waiting over 3 hours on hold listening to ""your call is important to us."" B***S***. If I don't hear from them tonight, its off to the airport tomorrow to speak to an agent at the counter. Do not book directly with American Airlines. They don't give a damn. Use Expedia. They have real people to talk to. If this is the level of American Airlines customer service, I can't help but wonder about their aircraft maintenance or their pilot training. What a joke of an airline!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Our flight was delayed because of maintenance needed on the cabin and bathroom,"Absolute nightmare. Our flight was delayed for over an hour because they were doing work on the cabin and the bathroom. The ground crew kept leaving so we couldn’t take off and then when a thunderstorm hit the captain said, we’ll were stuck here anyway. When we finally arrived in Phoenix the attendees were absolutely no help at all and refused to comp a hotel stating it was weather even though several other passengers agreed with our statement saying it was maintenance. The plane was also falling apart and they didn’t adhere to the cdc mask guidelines at all!!!! Don’t fly American Airlines ever."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible service,"After making us board a plane twice over 4 hours, American finally cancelled the flight due to a shortage of pilots. Interesting that our tax dollars were used to bail them out and they still treat us poorly. To get new flight arrangements, they made us wait in another 4 hour line (see pictures). I even had a customer service rep laugh at our situation. Never again!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,HORRIBLE!! I rather take greyhound 😳,"Both flights were delayed due to ""matience"" and battery!?!?

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst flight ever!,"I booked a flight about a month in advance to go to South Carolina. It was cheaper to do a flight that stopped in Miami for 55 minutes. However when I got to the Philly airport they were talking about how they needed to reroute, long story short it was almost 9:00pm when I boarded my 4:45pm flight. I check in my luggage and everything it ok until I get to Miami at 1:00am which means I missed my flight to South Carolina. To make matters even worse, my luggage is in South Carolina right now and they don’t have any flights going there right now. So I’m stuck in Florida with all of my stuff in another state god knows where including my phone charger. The lady tells me that I have to wait until 3:30am for somebody to get here and try to get me on a flight to a state I was supposed to be in at 11:00 pm. I WILL NEVER ride with American Airlines EVER AGAIN!!"

Date of travel: May 2021,10,Jobless...because of American Airlines!,"Veteran, husband and father of two...I lost my job because I went home to visit my two grandfathers graves (both WWII veterans who were at D-Day) and pay respects on Memorial Day. All because American Airlines failed to honor the services I paid for and get me home on time to report for work. To make matters worse, I had to cancel another upcoming trip that I already booked because I can no longer afford to go...and they refused to give me my money back. Hit me with the ol' ""Tickets are Non-Refundable"" line. They gave me credit to book another flight...that's only valid for a year. Like I can afford to take another trip or be able to get time off once I find a new job. During a phone call to try and schedule another flight home I was lied to. The customer service representative said he could get me home the following day by 7am. Which, was still too late to be at work on time but I could have at least just been a few hours late. Maybe still have a job? I asked to speak to the manager and he gave me the work around. Said that 7am was never even an option. During our discussion I asked about a refund, he ensured me I could get my money back and put in a request. That didn't happen! So, I was robbed and lied to. I ended up paying for two nights at a hotel, food and transportation costs to wait for the next available flight home (on a different airline, because fuk American Airlines after this)Bunch of lying, thieving, greedy, penny-pinching fuks at American Airlines...Fuk You!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never again,"I will absolutely never fly American Airlines again. We had an original flight last year for a wedding, which we obviously had to cancel. Went to use our airline credit, said it was an additional $500 because someone got “booted” from our flight so we could have those times on that day. Our flight got changed TWICE since we’ve booked, is currently delayed and we’ll miss that connection, so now we’re getting in at midnight on a completely different flight. That’s a $1000 lesson to stick with ANYBODY else and NEVER use American Airlines again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Insult to injury,"Return Flight: Expected to fly from Gulfport Mississippi at 730ish to Ontario California arriving before noon with 1 connecting flight in Dallas Fortworth Texas. What happened left Gulfport on a tiny plane which was then diverted to Waco Taxas for over an hour during which time I sat on a warm small plane with a malfunctioning toilet. When I finally landed in Dallas Fortworth, the child in front of me vomited sooooo much (really cant blame her but that happend). I get of the plane to inquire about what to do about my now woefully missed connecting flight to be given a ticket for another flight which would have been fine but I paid extra for my previous seat and the assigned seat was a free seat. No problem I thought, I just want to go home. I get to the departing gate to wait for my flight at which I watch the departing time for my flight get more and more delayed. In total there was a ~3hour delay but no worried I had food & soda and at tge end of this hassel Id be HOME!!! I finallt board my flight still able to crack a friendly smile as other passengers wedge themselve and things all around me. High point a lady behind was in a full blown lovers quarrel behind on her phone so I wax lucky because at least I wasnt arguing with anyone. So after a fair amount of turbulence, Im home. I got to collect my checked bags and one of my bags (my pink leather trunk) looks as though its has been punted around the airport. Its missing one of the magnetic snaps and is gouged everywhere. Even the handle has deep scratches thay expose the wood. I grab it and my checked makeup case, look around for a claims desk but there is one near by and Im dog tired (it is now 5pm).  So I figure Ill get it fixed on my own and go home. The next day after work I decide to unpack and find the the tsa rated looks are jammed and are initially won't open. Alittle more elbow grease and they open. So now I decided to put in a claim for the bag. It takes 3 days to get back to me to be told that theres nothing that AMERICAN AIRLINES will do because it wasnt reporyed in 24 hours. They didnt even evaluate the pic's of the bag nothing. They just sai they'd refund my bag check fee. So now in addition to a terrible flight experience (exp arrive 12 ish act arrive 5ish pm), I out a very cute bag that I only used this one time. Maybe if I was a raving lunatic at each inconvenience along the way the outcome would have been different. All I really want is the stap and locks fixed because I genuinely like the suitcase.So NO I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND AMERICAN AIRLINES. I feel as though the short reporting time </=24 hours is just a way of them not paying for the damage the caused by making sure the claims desk is not readily available to tired customers who just want to go home.(My claim was placed within 72 hours of damage due to the hours I work)"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Customer Service Contact Sucks,Having to wait 24 hours or more to speak with someone says all you need to know about this company. You are just another number to them and they couldn't care less about you or your family.
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Unclean aircraft,"With all the concern regarding COVID and the requirement to wear a mask, they need to be more concerned with someone catching something else from the aircrafts not being cleaned. There is no way the aircraft used for flight 4522 on 05/27/21 has been cleaned out properly in weeks from the mass amounts of hair, lint, food etc I saw at the base of the seats along the windows. I always fly American but was very disappointed knowing I was having to sit for hours with this at my feet with my carry on bag not far from it."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,This airlane should go out of bussiness !,"Let me start by saying that choosing this airlines was the worst decision that I made when I was planning my vacation 6 months ago. That is a reason why I have not use this airline in a long time. My flight was supposed leave on Thursday May 27 at 6:00Am, AA send me a text on Wednesday May 26 to informed me that I needed to check in, witch I did. At 10 PM on the same day they send me another notification to confirmed that the flight was on time. At 3:30 AM when we were getting ready to go to the airport a text was send to lets us know that the flight was cancelled, called the costumer services line and they told me that this flight was cancelled and the AA was not able to get me in another flight. Well I have no other choice to book another flight at the last minute. Within 2 hours of the flight taking off!I was issued a refund. Then in the way back from Mexico 5 days later the changes  the flight time of departure 3 times, making me and my husband leave to the airport earlier than it was plan, when w arrived at the airport they changed the time once again, leaving later than the time it was scheduled, we waited at the  airport for about 6 hours. Who does that!!  This company is so irresponsible and I WILL NEVER BOOK ANOTHER FLIGHT WITH THEM!!!  PLEASE BE AWARE!!! AA WILL RUIN YOUR PLANS!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS AIRLINE,Had to cancel my flight due to new curfews imposed by the government in Santo Domingo - 6pm week days and 3pm weekends. AA won't refund the trip or even provide travel credits that i can use for future dates. I called them and they pretty told me that i lost the $950 that i paid for the trip. Same thing happened to me with a trip last year and Southwest Airlines gave me travel credits that i got to use later on when it was ok to make my trip. Feels like i just got ROBBED by american airlines.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,They don't care,Happens every time I fly American. My plane is delayed for whatever reason and I'm late to get to my connecting flight. Usually I miss my other plane by just a few minutes but it has already left forcing me to sit around for hours. What's worse is nobody seems to care. Why can't they hold the connecting flight a few minutes if it is there fault and they know I am running late? I asked a captain I saw on the sky tram and he said it is because they only care about the money. I will try to never fly this airline again! Terrible service.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Check in,"Check in was a nightmare , very slow process Attendant at window very slow Over review of paperwork was unnecessary 3 people checked paperwork COVID Test is not approved unless It’s a PCR only do not what’s the difference Do you check in and traveling form at home Before you get to the airport App is not that good"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,DO NOT TAKE THIS AIRLINE,"DO. NOT. TAKE. AMERICAN. AIRLINES. they let all the people who showed up late for their flight skip the entire line, leaving the people who did things correctly in the miserable heat. How does it make any sense to punish those who showed up on time and reward those who don’t do what they need to? Absolutely ridiculous. Never again."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,American Airlines should be put out of its misery,"From Aruba to Phil w stopover inMiami. First leg continuously delayed until getting connection was impossible. I could not find agent available at airport for hours. Wife searched airport for agent who turned up wandering somewhere. Turned his back on her did not acknowledge or answer. I have never heard of such behavior, regardless of whether a matter was urgent — and indeed this was — or not. This guy’s lucky we can’t ID him because he should find another line of work if he has the kind of contempt for customers he displayed. But aa seems to encourage that behavior. Finally after hour agent shows at desk and another human showed to help. My wife was anxious understandably so he decides to deal only with me. Ignored her when she answered questions; should have corrected that problem from the get go but was keen to get through the ordeal. He ignored my wife and humiliated her. We missed connection because of continuous delays and had to stay overnight unplanned, missing work and spending as much for accommodations as for flights (actually more). No consideration for defraying this outlandish expense and a posted policy with something about “vouchers” which likely amount to what you’d pay for a crash pad charging by the hour. Don’t try calling the line listed on website because it’s invalid.I hate to say it but we will likely at some point be forced fly this sorry excuse for transport at some regrettable time. The best thing that can happen is for this awful business would be for it to sell its aircraft and require its staff to work and learn real skills. This truly is an operation that should do the world a favor and disappear."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Choose another airline if you can!,Flew business class to and from Mexico City in May 2021. Other than priority check in and early boarding I have nothing good to say. Food offerings consisted of a fruit and cheese wrap or a fruit and cheese wrap. USB  plugs didn’t work. Admirals club closed. I realize we are coming back from a pandemic but services were missing. Don’t know if other airlines are having the same issues..
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Flight change,Worst airlines ever I would always fly with AA but will be my last after not wanting to change my flight or give me a refund I lost $1300! They pretty much said oh well sorry can’t help you! All I wanted was my flight changed from a Thursday to a Saturday and nope they couldn’t help me! I even asked for an upgrade they said sure but it’s $250 per ticket just for the upgrade! Plus I had to buy the tickets again! Absolutely ridiculous I hope you shove that money up your *** 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Last minute changes; tyrannical flight attendant,"I booked tickets months in advance (otherwise would not have flown them), and they made a last-minute change that got me in at a very inconvenient time.  No choice by then because booking another airline would've been last-minute expensive.  I think they count on that.On top of this, the flight attendant was an absolute NotZ.  Guess what?  You're supposed to be in customer SERVICE, not patrolling the aisles so that you can exercise your ""authority"" on people who've paid to be there.I've changed my credit card to Delta AmEx and will be flying Delta for most trips; Spirit (did I really write that?) for cheapies - their flight attendants tend to be young, happy in their jobs, and not willing to wear a Brown Shirt."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Make sure you take extra clothes with your carry on!!,"I traveled on May 31, 2021 to Puerto Vallarta. When we arrived to the airport not one but three of our luggage’s we’re missing, apparently they never loaded them to the plane. So now here we are stuck in our room with no clothes to wear, horrible experience. They don’t understand how this ruins peoples vacation and to top it off, customer service can’t  answer the phone, you have to make an appointment for days after!! Learned my lesson!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Don’t do it,They changed both of our original flights last minute and gave us a lay over in Charlotte from Miami. The flight 5656 is extremely hot because an air conditioner is not working. It feels like 80 degrees and awfully uncomfortable. The flight attendant Sydney was super rude & unprofessional. 10/10 do not fly American Airlines.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Can't keep accountability,My experience with American Airlinesis was horrible. They can't keep accountability with their passengers. The lady that was in charge looked at me and gave me an attitude and asked what's me and my wife's seat number. We knew what was our seat number 3 hours prior to our flight but the tone she gave me pissed me off.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible!!!!,"This is by far the worst airline service ever. My family were forced to sit on the extremely packed airplane for 2 hrs uncomfortably without moving. We were unable to get off the plane to even breathe because we were threatened that we would not be able to board again.  Then we  were delayed over and over and over and finally cancelled from Monday at 3:00 pm and they told me I couldn’t get a flight until Wednesday at 4 o’clock. They told me “it’s up to you if you want a hotel room or stay in the airport until Wednesday but we can’t compensate you”. We had no water nor food because the stores at the Texas airport were closed. I spoke with a supervisor Donnet F or whatever her name is, who was unable to help me. I will never ever ever ever in life book with this airline again. It’s like when they get your money, they don’t care about you anymore. I could see if the plane went to Memphis, it didn’t even leave! Just canceled. Then they lied like it did leave on time but when we got to Texas airport, we learned that there was not a flight which went to memphis. You suppose to take care of your customers!  I Highly recommend Allegiant airline because I was compensated in the past when my flight was canceled. Just horrible!!!!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Ignore the 1. It’s a -0.000,"Bro. Don’t do it. If you’re military reading reviews. Don’t do it.   You WILL miss formation flying with this airline. FIRST OF ALL. On my flight TO TEXAS. It was delayed, WHICH MADE ME MISS MY SECOND FLIGHT to my final destination. they were all like “oops, here’s a later one” THEN on my flight BACK from Killeen to Savannah, I had a stop in Dallas. flight kept getting delayed. THEN GOT CANCELLED. They said “oops, here’s a flight that doesn’t take you to your destination but to take you to ANOTHER airport, then from that airport to your final destination.” THAT FLIGHT GOT DELAYED ALL THE WAY FROM 2000 to 0000. DO NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE IF YOU ARE MILITARY. If you do you better hope you put in that 4 day pass my dude."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Never fly with American Airlines through Colorado Springs, Co.","I had a problem with an agent in the Colorado Springs, CO. airport on 5/31/21 at around 4:30am. I didn’t get her name because I was in a hurry but she was checking in people for a Chicago flight. She was kind of an overweight person with glasses, tall and Caucasian. She was the rudest person I’ve ever encountered in my life an airport. She was very angry with me and my brother for absolutely no reason. She was having trouble finding my second connecting flight. My brothers girlfriend had to check her bag and threatened us she was going rebook our flight because of it. Then I asked her if I can just get the ticket on the self service computer to make easier. She responded in a very rude tone, “you can do whatever you want.” Instead of kindly responding a simple, “yes.” I will never fly American Airlines because of the staff. That absolutely uncalled for and very unprofessional."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,A rat ate my armrest,"Not wanting to take the chance to get an aisle seat i paid $40 for a window seat.  When i get to my seat on the flight i see a chunk of armrest padding missing, right where your elbow rests.  I would expect this on a bus in Detroit but not from an airline that claims they welcome back their customers.  I would have submitted a picture of said armrest but tripadvisor app sucks so bad it won't load it and forces me to refill the review when i try."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Just don’t!,"On May 28th we were supposed to fly out of DFW for a 30 minute flight home around 9:25. They kept delaying up until almost midnight and then they cancelled our flight and pushed us to the morning. They said it was because the bathroom on the plane wasn’t working. Again this was a 30 min flight. They gave us vouchers for cabs, hotel, and food. When we went to get a cab we were told it could take up to an hour. Then they put us in a hotel an 20 mins away.. mind you it was almost 1 am when we arrived to the hotel. We were traveling with my 9 year old. Then the hotel refused to accept our voucher from AA. They really didn’t explain this to us they just said we could talk to the manager in the morning. We went ahead and stayed and provided a credit card assuming this would all get straightened out. We did talk to the hotel the next morning and we’re told that they have told American Airlines many times that they do not have a contract with them and did not want them booking rooms for customers because they don’t accept the vouchers. The manager said they did this to 11 customers just that night we wereThere. We only got 2 1/2 hours of sleep before we had to head back to the airport. The cab driver was upset because he said he hates taking vouchers from American Airlines because they don’t pay the full wage and they take forever to pay them. After we finally got home and rested I contacted American Airlines to see about getting a refund for the hotel. I was told they don’t do refunds, instead they gave us vouchers. We don’t want to fly American Airlines anymore so now we’re out $200 for a 3 hour stay at a basic hotel..... thanks American Airlines..... next time we will just sleep in the airport because you treat your customers like dirt. We weren’t the only ones either. Also some of the passengers said when they got to their hotels they didn’t even have rooms available... they don’t care about their customers at all."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,NO food/drink services in the main cabin?!?!,"First let me say this. The staff were great. Polite, Professional and approachable. We flew to Mexico May 23rd to meet some friends for a 50th B-Day celebration vacation. They flew Alaskan. Now, we had left very early in the morning, having a light breakfast before boarding thinking we would get something mid-flight as we always do...NOPE! NOT ON THIS AIRLINE, NOT ON THIS 2+ HR FLIGHT IN THE MAIN CABIN...8oz bottle of water, pretzels and a wet nap...that's what you get.  Having just mins to get to our connecting flight we were not able to grab anything, for sure there will something on the 2 hr flight to Puerto Vallarta...NOPE! NOT ON THIS AIRLINE, NOT ON THIS FLIGHT IN THE MAIN CABIN EITHER...8oz bottle of water, pretzels and a wet nap...that's what you get. But, here the thing, apparently these things were available to first class but NOT main cabin!!! It was the same way coming back as well...why would these things NOT be offered..EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THAT PLANE HAS TESTED NEG. FOR COVID - IT'S SAFER IN/ON THE PLANE THAN IT IS IN THE AIRPORT!!!!  I asked my friends that flew Alaskan if they had food/beverage service and they looked at me with puzzled faces and said ""Yes, of course""Lame."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible service,"0/10 would not recommend, my brother in law was coming into town for 2 days and they delayed his first flight which made him miss his second from Dallas to Spokane then on his way back to IL today they canceled his second flight."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,A PIECE OF crap,My granddaughter was flying today from Miami to pls with one of my friends the baby is only 1 year and 8 months so she don’t need a plane ticket just the taxes which is under 30 dollars. On the 24 on may I went to the airport in pls to add her to the lady booking and all was set to go only to reach at the airport to check in to know that that ticket was cancelled in the system and the stupid agent who was checking her in was not allowing her to check in saying that the flight is full and there is no more seat. What seat will she be needing if she is under 2 and will be siting in a lap? The dog agent refuse to assist and I had to walk over to the agent here in pls which told me that all the agent need to do is check her in while checking in the lady.I hate American airline its like they staff is incompetent and are total donkeys at the Miami airport everything is a problem with them. A next airline needs to come from Miami to pls to give them a lil competition so they can step up they stupid game I am upset at this mess happening..If she did not get on the flight today I was going to sue yinna donkeys for being so stupid
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Covid Excuse for Greedy profits,"Ok explain to me why there is no food or beverage service on flights? Everyone wears a mask,there are sanitizer packettes and supposedly spraying the interior between flights and air exchange and filtered. But not even water and coffee? They haven't lowered the price of tickets. This is greed at the highest level! I am done flying american and any other airline that is greedy like this!"
Date of travel: May 2021,40,Flight coming back from Honolulu to DFW was good,"The business class seat is really nice. You can lay flat and actually sleep.  Due to covid 19 the meal is served all at once so you can finish it quickly and actually get some sleep.  Since this is an overnight flight that only lasts 6.5hours you have to push to get sleep, I got almost 3hours which is great for this short a flight."
Date of travel: May 2021,40,"Good smooth flight, on time, great seats","The seats in business class are really nice, you can lie flat and actually get some sleep.  The flight was on time and it was smooth.  The food was OK.  One thing I do like as because of Covid the food was delivered all at once rather then over several passes.   The view from the left side of the plane is good when flying into Honolulu as the plane circles the island and you approach from the west so you get a good view of Pearl Harbor."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Would give them a 0 if I could,"Never, ever flying AA ever again. Our flight was set to leave Las Vegas at 2 PM and arrive in Dallas around 6 PM. We boarded the flight and sat there in a plane that was 80 degrees (air was not working) and de-boarded the plane at 3:12 PM. We then re-boarded the SAME plane at 5:15 PM (they had insisted us we were taking that plane and it was good to go). We sat there for another hour on this plane in the heat, and they un-boarded us a SECOND time. We were supposed to arrive at Dallas then make our connecting flight to Madison, WI and be home at 10 PM. We did not get home until the afternoon of the next day. I had to re-arrange my entire plans, delay the pick up of my pet who I was greatly looking forward to seeing and cost me even more money, and purchase a lot of gross, expensive airport food (and most every place was closed - we had been there 6 hours). Our AA flight was also delayed on the way to Vegas and many people on our plane missed their connecting flight; we were lucky we barely made ours. This is not our first horrendous, despicable experience at AA but it sure will be our last. Never, ever, again."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Wow, NO!","I would not fly AA again and will actively avoid taking them from here on. In the past they weren't any didn't better or worse than any other airline, but that no longer holds true. First of all, they have no in-flight entertainment of any kind. They say you have free Wi-Fi,  but stops working after about an hour, and when you are on a long 6+ hour flight, it makes it longer. Secondly,  their in-fight service for drinks, they no longer offer if its a domestic flight. It is only upon request that you get any drinks or snacks. If it is crossing an ocean,  they will offer one round of drinks and snacks. They are the worst airline!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Profit over customer service,American overcharged us $750 per ticket on our Aviator credit card and refused to issue a credit.  They are profiting from their own errors.  Ask for an itemized receipt or BEWARE!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,BAGGAGE,"If you travel with American airlines to Dallas, you will need to add an additional hour to your travel just to get your bag. I travel a lot but the baggage handlers in Dallas are the worst in the country. I hate to say this because I live in Dallas."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Don't think your status will help you!,"I have never been so disgusted by customer service in my life. I am never flying AA again and I must say that they should not treat ANY customer the way they do. Having said that , I have platinum pro status and was hung up on 2x and 3rd rep  did not hang up on me but was severely unhelpful. I would fly spirit before flying aa again."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Not good!,"Seats were so uncomfortable, they hardly recline,no leg room. I couldn't relax or even sleep,and I was on the red I! The only time I saw a flight attendant is when she handed me a tiny water and a small bag of Pretzels! Packed plane with 200 people."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible,"I got stuck traveling for 24 hours for a flight that is 3 hours. I got stuck waiting 9 hours in Fayetteville, NC and then spent the night on the airport floor in Charlotte, NC.at no point did AA offer any compensation or help. I even paid extra for my seats so I would have room."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible border line traumatizing experience,"They delayed my flight 3 times before finally canceling it without any explanation and the weather was perfect Dallas and san Antonio, i spoke to the luggage supervisor who ensured me my luggage would not be shipped since i was getting a refund, when i call to check if i can go back to the airport to pick it up they tell me its in san Antonio and nobody can take 1 minute to talk to me over the phone or the app to help me recover it.  i have valuable items in there and nobody seams to care, ive never felt so hopeless in my life.  I will never again travel using this trash company.  Spirit airlines and southwest have been amazing in comparison,  anyone reading this should stay away."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Floyd Meriwether,"This airline has the worst check in for Tulsa ever! Staff was rude, not helpful at all, made a lady in front of me leave in tears for the constant berating and badgering due to a handicap. American Airlines has been notified and hopefully this female at the check in will be fired. If she hates her job so bad she needs to go home and collect unemployment. I fly AA 2 to 3 times weekly for work and I will never fly AA out of Tulsa ever again. Here I come Delta or anyone else!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Thieves,"Purchased a ticket right before pandemic for a child. Found out he couldn't fly alone or at time of purchase, so asked for a refund and got rejected. Tried changing a while after to a different name so I won't lose the ticket and was told that couldn't change the name either. Lost 600£ just like that !"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Worst experience in 30
Years",After 30+ years of flying with AA I’m am done!!!  They totally screwed up our tickets by canceling my wife ticket 24 hrs before our fly.  We arrived at the airport 2.5 hrs before our fly and at the checking booth they told us that was a problem. 2.5 hrs latter between the airport personal and the office personal Of American Airlines they could get it fix.   Once they got it fix abs after they discovered that the issue was at American Airlines HQ by someone cancelling my wife ticket forNo particular reason they decided to charge meMore money.  Then they send us running to the gate after they called the gate no told themWe where on our way. The gate person Natasha dos not allow us to board.   No one tool responsible for there mistake. No one offer a fix.  No one offered toRefund the money they charge for no reason.  This is the worst experience of our life.   American Airlines is the worst.  I used to be proud of AA.  Not any more.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Bad service,"Nothing wrong with flight itself just terrible service and rude attendant when asking basic question about the flight. Wanted to see if it was even possible to be considered for an upgrade and got the worst response from the gate attendant who could've easily just said ""no it's not possible"""
Date of travel: May 2021,20,First Class and Business Class don't give you much these days,"My first flight was from SFO to MIA leaving SFO at 12:45 am.  We got beverages and a snack (nuts).  Then we were offered a snack like potato chips.  When morning arrived, we got nothing.  And oddly enough, it seemed like the people in coach got a snack box.I got to Miami and I was starving, so I went to Admirals Club.  That was a mistake, their food was sub-par, serving packaged bagels and the like.   Not good.   The second leg was Miami to Lima, Peru.  American sells this as Business Class, but it's the same airplane as the first leg, an Airbus 321S.  Why is this called Business Class?  I don't know.  The food was OK, but otherwise I didn't feel like I was in Business Class."

Date of travel: May 2021,10,Pilot Crashes Plane Into Lightpole—  American Airlines Blames Passengers for Missed Reservations,"The pilot crashed our plane into a light pole on the way out to the runway. Not sure if he was drunk, or...?The crash was very jolting. We have been jerked around since then— with no rebooking help or guarantee that we will make it to our destination. The customer service was extremely unhelpful. They acknowledged zero accountability— even though the issue was clearly operator error. They wouldn’t even compensate us a meal. We are still waiting at the airport and unable to get help from anyone."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible consideration for their customers,"They postponed the flight 2 hours before departure, waited on hold for 84 minutes until time expired and it just hung up. Theyre refund website was down and they then cancelled the flight and rebooked for 23 hours later. Absolutely unacceptabale service,"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible experience,"Awful experience, flight to Dallas at 9.30 got in line at 07.30. There was I huge line , nobody willing to help pregnant with a toddler ! Just raising their arms if you ask personal for help or info .By the time it was my turn to check in it was 10 clock, only person there friendly was the check in agent that checked me in .Put on on of the next flights , which was delayed and had to sit on the boarded flight for over an hour with no A/C and a completely full flight !! Then circlén above Dallas to get permission to land cause of closure Dallas airport ( bad weather )  By the time we land I have 20 min to catch my international flight to Amsterdam .Captain announced there will be agents at the gate to help connecting passengers.Got off the plane , not an agent to be seen .Got to the gate asked the agent, she called and said No closed ( no emotion nothing on her face !!!) Then had to stand in line for ‘customer service ‘ after like an hour finally my turn, instead of treating you with any dignity they speak to you in one word , flight ? Passport ? I can understand they are dealing with lots and for themThis is there job but to make it even lore difficult for the passenger I cannot understand !!! I was rebooked on next flight the next day anything else I can figure that out yourself , even after talking to the supervisor who looked at me from underneath her glasses, no not our problem it’s bad weather condition !! Very good role model for her personnel to look up to such an example.Stuck at the airport pregnant with a toddler, spend 400 dollar on extra cost.This airline is a big no go and should be avoided at all cost !! They give you the treatment of low-cost airlines but still charge you for high class airlines .Horrible horrible and I will avoid this airline at all cost !"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,horrible,"After having a really bad trip because of flight attendants having a reunoin in the back behind my seat I sent an email and was told I should fly with them again so I could regain my confidence in them?!?!?! WHAT!!!This was a portion of my response to american customer relations---I understand it is against your company policy to help customers who have had a bad experience on your airline, and your hands are tied. This is unfortunate. American airlines does not ""look forward to rebuilding confidence"" this is an untruthful statement on your company's part as it's just a tag-line at the bottom of your email. I find it insulting that American has to add this line at the end of all your emails, as the statement is blatantly false. And the further statement -- ""hope you'll give us the opportunity to provide you with a more positive experience"" is a joke in that I would have to pay you for another flight to see if my next trip won't be as bad as the previous. With no resolution from the past bad experience. With no resolution, why would you ever think I'd travel with you again or even recommend someone travel with you. As a matter of fact I'd go out of my way to broadcast to others that your airline should be avoided. This is not just because of the incident on the flight. These emails to and from your company have proven that your company flat out just doesn't care about the customer. There is no other way to explain how utterly disappointing your customer relations responses have been.All I hoped for was some semblance of your company taking responsibility and doing something about it that would satisfy me the customer. But I was astounded at how wrong I could be."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst Airline,I haven’t traveled yet. My trip is August. I’m suppose to be going on my honeymoon. We booked an all inclusive trip using American Airlines. Now they changed our flight and they said we can come back a day before or we can stay in Charlotte and our flight won’t be till the next morning. When I tell you I will never fly with American Airlines. I will not. There was no accommodation or anything. They will never get any of money and I have told all my friends and family members. So I hope they continue to lose customers.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Don't fly America Airlines,"We have been planning this Vacation since the pandemic.  3 hours before our flight is to go out on a Monday night.  We get a flight alert notice that our flight has been rescheduled.  Then another and then another.  They said it was due to ""not having a flight crew.""  How do you book 200 people to fly out with no Crew to fly the plane!!!   We spent 2 hours in line with customer service at the airport.  They could not get us a flight out at all until Thursday night. 1/2 of our vacation would be over by then.  We ended up staying behind with our dreams for a vacation shattered,  disappointed and stressed out.  We had to call the resort and cancel our rooms.  There were 6 of us, all our family dragging there luggage back to the car & back home.  So Angry and upset.  We were offered nothing for our loss. We were told from one of the workers at the airport that this happens all the time with AA."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,No social distancing whatsoever on a packed flight,I was shocked that there was no social distancing on the plane. We were packed like sardines. It is such a stark contrast from the current pandemic rules. I almost wished I never booked such flight as I felt the Arline was willing to risk my health and safety for a few more bucks. It is almost as if I spent all this time in quarantine and following guidelines just to have that level of protection thrown out the window. The flight was late by 2 hours on the next flight and the airplane was cold as ice.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Seat Change,I booked a flight almost a month in advance making sure I chose a window seat. I get to the airport and they changed my seat to and aisle. I have anxiety and this was not the way I wanted to fly. I will never fly again with American.

Date of travel: May 2021,10,Really??,"Well we just changed from using Delta because of delay s . I was hoping American was going to be better. Once again I have been disappointed by the lack of service ( at this point I have been on hold for over 2 hours trying to talk to someone at American). I realize that they could really careless about the plane being late , the pilot lying about the reason why its late or the fact that this has once again cost us a hotel and other expenses the most important thing is my wife gets to come home once a month and now they have taken a day out of that . I am not ranting like I see some of the reviews but rather I am thinking the next time the ecomony goes south and the airlines need to be bailed out I am asking myself why ?Let's say a few of them go out of business  do to poor customer service , poor time management, lack luster employee that could careless of the needs of their customers. Let's give the one that are doing a good job stay in business because they deserve to not because of the party they contribute to . When they know that the Government has the ability to bail them out whenever they need it , why change the level of service they provide. When they are the only game in town they can sit fat and happy behind the desk and screw the customer they have to come to us right?? I say we start by changing the people who are supporting the airlines .Let's provide them and the people who love to give them MY tax dollars the same level of service. Lynn Oliver"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,NO STARS! Horrible customer service - Stole money!!!,"American Airlines charged me 3 times for an upgrade and never upgraded my flight. They took almost 1000 dollars from me. They’re hold time is more then 4 hours. They took 8 hours to call me back. When they did call back, the woman hung up on me. Total trash company. Will never fly with them ever again."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Awful,American Airlines is awful.  Only fly this airline because Southwest doesn’t fly into Pensacola.  Thankfully they started flying into Ft Walton Beach on May 6th.  Every time we fly AA there are issues.  This trip they changed our seating selections after we booked seats together without notice.  Then we are delayed because the crew was late to worm.  Once on the plane they claimed it was the AC.  They made us check our carryon bag because it has wheels and “wheeled” bags are not allowed.  Well clearly they allowed wheeled bags to be carried on.  Last time we will ever fly AA.  Horrible service and airline.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,NOT REFUNDABLE,It is such a worse experience I ever had. I canceled my ticket because pandemic increase  suddenly. The price was $510 when I first booked it. Within 15 days difference the price increased to $846 which is unbailable. More worse part is that ticket are nonrefundable and the parson you booked the ticket for that exact person has to use it. You also can not use it for DELTA AIRLINE. For DELTA AIRLINE are price is $510 for one way.  I know the AMERICAN AIRLINE is worse than so many other airline and how come the price is so high that I cant even make the plan to rebook the ticket again. I hope someone can help me with that .
Date of travel: May 2021,10,The Absolute Worst Airline in America,"I don’t even know where to start with my experiences I’ve had with American Airlines in the past few years. However, as of today, I absolutely refuse to fly with them ever again. I had limited choices as it was considering I needed to make it in time to my destination so I booked American Airlines in a pinch. Not only was the flight continuously pushed back 2 hours later on the same day, but upon boarding, the pilot informed us there were mechanical issues with the plane itself. After waiting an hour, the pilot attempted to take off. The plane violently shook and everyone in the plane began to scream, including the flight attendants. We had evacuated the plane into the terminal, in which chaos ensued. A passenger had actually suffered some type of injury and was seen being carried away in a stretcher completely unconscious. While that was all going on, we were informed that we needed to wait in the 180 person line in order to catch whatever flight was available (American Airlines only, no other airlines) to the destination. Basically, it was first come first serve, so all viable options were gone by the first 5 people who got in line. No refunds were offered, nor were any alternatives. Aside from my personal safety being put at risk, this was not the first time American Airlines have provided horrible service to me. Last year I had gotten stuck in Arizona for a connection flight for seven hours due to a plane that was “running late”. DO NOT book with American Airlines, your trip will be RUINED. They have become the absolute bottom of the barrel in terms of costumer service. I’ve had better experiences with Spirit, and that says a lot honestly."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst Airline Ever. They completely Screwed us out of thousands of dollars.,"We had a connecting flight in Dallas from Seattle to get to Tulsa. It was raining and instead of delaying our flight, they canceled it and told us we either fly out 4 days later, or we have to lose our money because due to “ company policy “ they can’t give us another flight with another airline and they had booked up every single flight for the next 3 days. So we were stranded in Dallas and we asked for transportation or a place to stay because it was 10PM. Again, due to “ company policy “ they didn’t give us any of that. So after over $60 of Uber fees and $250 hotel rooms, we had to purchase $800 worth of tickets with Southwest Airlines the next morning in order to get home. Not to mention we completely lost our tickets for our flight to Tulsa and they won’t refund us because we didn’t want to flight out 4 days later. Southwest accommodated us so well and I highly recommend flying with them or with Delta. NEVER FLYING AMERICAN AGAIN!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst airline experience!,"If Customer Service was a picture, it would not be a picture of American Airlines!  After having the worst experience trying to check in and then missing my flight, and then being told every other flight was booked out of New Orleans for the next 2 days was absolutely exhausting!! From the ticket agents, to the Gate agents , and then back to the ticket agents again, and watching other customers being berated, and treated with less respect than I could have imagined.  I watched the manager repeatedly yell at a customer that he was late to the gate so they gave his seat away and she wasn't going to help him in any way!!! Our situation was that we couldn't get our test result papers uploaded to the website to get back home to the USVI and they would not print the 2 boarding passes of the other 2 passengers traveling.  When we finally got it uploaded and ran to the departure gate the seats had been released.  The gentleman then told the other gate agent to hold up Here are 2 passengers.  I told him it's 4 of us but the 2 could go because they have to get back for work. He yelled at me No!!! Than called 2 standby passengers and let them on and left us standing there!! If you have 2 seats that were available why were they given to standbys when you clearly had 2 confirmed passengers you could have put on knowing your flights were booked until further notice..... He then tells us we have to go back to the tkt counter for rebooking. American Airlines is the absolute worst! We encountered some of the nastiest American Airlines Airport agents and in addition the most unprofessional service a customer could receive!! They could really benefit from the Ritz Carlton training "" ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen"" I am not exaggerating the level of unprofessional service they offer! I hear stories but until I encountered it first hand , I now know the horror stories are not fabricated! As a 30 plus years customer service professional, travel agent, and airline retiree, I know they should be doing so much better.  Speaking of, I will never fly this airline, recommend, this airline, nor book any of my clients on this classless airline because they can truly ruin a vacation if given the opportunity! Not again AA, nor ever again!! I will definitely stick to Delta Airlines in the future.  They don't just say they care, they show you....."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst Experience,Moody fly attendents and horible food. When you are eating or drinking they are annoying remembering you about cover your month even when u are still working on your food.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,American Airlines is not AMERICAN!,"CAUTION - American Airlines does not stand behind their customer!  American Airlines - Where did your customer service go?  Very sad to say,  we chose American Airlines (aa.com) for our trip AFRICA!  ONCE IN A LIFE TIME TRIP  - BUCKET LIST VACATION to Nairobi, Kenya Africa fo r7 people!  American Airlines cancelled our \ trip from London to Nairobi with not alternative options but to REFUND!  We purchased tickets in Business Class for 7 passengers 5 months in advance for $30,000.00 and American could not get us to our destination!  Found a comparable trip on UNITED - 3 weeks out!!  GO UNITED 100%!  I will never fly AMERICAN AIRLINES EVER AGAIN!We booked with United instead!  NEVER EVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES!  They have poor customer service and do not stand by their customers! They have zero solutions and poor communication for all travelers!WELCOME BACK TO TRAVEL means you will not get to you destination -  WELCOME HOME AND STAY HOME!!  Book with UNITED ALL DAY LONG!  SO DISAPPOINTED IN AMERICAN AIRLINES!  Please take American out of your corporate name, you do not deserve to use!YOU LET US DOWN!  NO SOLUTIONS MEANS NO BUSINESS! BYE-BYE! ADIOS! Kwaheri!THIS WAS FOR A FLIGHT JUNE 18, 2021!  AMERICAN AIRLINES IS NOT AMERICAN!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,I am tired of sitting in airports and planes because american airlines cant get their sh*t together.,I dont know why I keep buying flights from american airlines...almost every trip I take has complications...delayed flights and cancelled flights are one thing but changing your flight time from 3pm to 11am in a 4 hour notice to have you rush to the airport so they can change gates 3 times then delay for 5 hours is ridiculous.  I thought this was a professional business. If I was 1 minute late to my flight I would miss it and it would be considered my fault. But they can move your flight times ahead and behind as much as they like totally ruining your schedule and  they take no blame. I understand that flights get delayed or cancelled but there should be compensation for your time when they are not on schedule. Time is money and american airlines has wasted more than enough of both. It is NOT worth doing business with them ever again. I hope if you read this review you will also decide to pay a little extra to fly with an airline that has their sh*t together.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Do not ruin a perfectly good trip with American Airlines!,"We purchased a package trip for a vacation in Aruba four months in advance. Within the last week of our trip, we were told that our flight got changed and now we have two connections without any compensation. We were also told that we lost our seats and have to pay extra if we want better seats. When we called the customer service they told us all those seats are actually available but we cannot see them online. We have to ask for our original seats at the check-in desk. So the airline makes it look like there are no seats available to trick people into paying for an upgrade. Very deceptive! During the trip, we were told that we may miss our connection due to the weather conditions in Dallas. We tried rebooking our flight but they sure made rebooking service impossible. Long line only with two agents ""helping"" one person for about 45 minutes. Do the math for how long it's going to take them to clear the line. It is nothing but another form of punishment for choosing AA. On top of all that, our luggage has not arrived. We have been stuck home all day waiting. I am definitely not flying with AA ever again. I'd rather pay a little extra and treated like a human being."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Paid Customer,No customer service at all they do not care about the people that’s flying I paid for my sets they said I didn’t pay for it and  made everyone miss their plane and they didn’t care to help you. You must find and help your self i paid  for insurance and was immediately told before I can tell them the situation that I will not get a refund American airline is a BIG scam they also lost my luggage if I could give them a -0 that what they deserve never ever again and I will spend the word absolutely the worst experience ever.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,I would give 0 stars if I could,"My family and I got screwed out of our tickets and had to eat additional charges. We had our flights booked for months and this morning (travel day) our flight was canceled for “maintenance.” (Meaning American Airlines not fill the flight enough even though they claim they are worried about COVID.) We were told ALL other flights going to Maine for the next two days were completely booked. The only option was we could stop in Philadelphia for two days for a layover. This would result in us losing two days of our trip. Nothing was offered to compensate for this greedy mistake. No hotel voucher, nothing!! When we started saying we were going to call partner airlines of American Airlines the unapologetic lady changed her tune and said she would look for us. She was suddenly able to find a flight (for tonight) where we travel all night on United. This flight was also an additional $200 dollars which she stated would not be covered for them cancelling our first flight that we already paid for. We are still losing a day of our vacation too. My next phone call will be to the rental car place in Maine since that will now have to change too. I am so sick of these airlines treating their passengers like cattle. Yet they claim they are hurting with the pandemic! Save your pennies and book with another airline."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Poor Ground service and attitude,"My trip was actually round trip from Knoxville, TN  to Little Rock, AR and I departed on 21 May 21 and flew back 24 May 21.  My complaint is they force you to vallet check your bags which on both times landing at Charlotte Airport we ended up being on the tarmac 25 to 30 mins waiting to get to gate made any connecting flights nearly impossible.. My bag is well within specs for size and even when flights were not full we still had to do vallet check. Waiting for the vallet bags in Charlotte to make my connecting flight was awful and the ground crews bringing up the vallet bags were exceptionally rude.. Even though I tried to ask nicely to bring up my bag as quickly as possible  the handler point blank said "":He Didnt care and it wasnt his problem"".  And I was not a lone several people had to run to make connections because of this.. Your flight attendants preach how happy your airlines is that people are flying during the pandemic yeah line of BS.,.  When your ground and baggage crews are rude and have such crappy attitudes..  The poor and rude attitude was so bad at Charlotte, NC that I am writing this review... I would not recommend your airline period because of the lack of care or even semi support your ground crews show.. Sad statement on American Airlines because these baggage handlers and the rude woman ticket agent when I was boarding my flight at Charlotte to Knoxville on 24 May 2021 both represent your company... Would never recommend this airline.."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,I would give zero stars,"My original flight was AA3705 at 4:45pm. I return the rental at 2:48pm.  Didn’t receive an updated email until 5:35pm. The flight was delayed 3 times before they final canceled it.   After standing in gate A30 line for 2 hours, they reverted everyone in line to the customer service line. I stood in that line for 3 hours and 5 minutes according to my timer. It’s now 9:40 as I approach the counter. I just needed to make it to Charlotte NC and I could’ve drove to Norfolk Va..  There were 3 flights after 9 that went to NC(that wasn’t fully loaded) that I couldn’t get on.  I only have one carryon bag no extra luggage.   All concessions had closed by then.   I am Navy Veteran that’s 34 weeks pregnant, my due date is July 5.   My feet and ankles are swollen and in pain.   No one made accommodations or even offer things for the people that stayed at the airport.  I have 6 hours of recordings of wait/customer service from this day.   I’m in third trimester, under 200lbs .. I have no water, no food and swollen body parts.  I’ve called the emergency OB on call in Houston for help because I lost my mucus plug at 12:48am Tuesday  May 25th( I have photos of that as well)  ,   the terminal closes all doors for all incoming traffic at 10pm. So I’m sitting here waiting for the next flight.   No refund, half off, no breakfast voucher or hotel was offer to me.   I have everything recorded.    Just send help !!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Missed my connection, thier fault. No compensation",Flight delayed 3 times forcing me into a 12 hour layover. Didn't even offer to comp hotel or give flight credit. 0/10 will not fly again
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Service and transperency,Today is May 24 2021 and my flight from Hartford to Dallas was the worst ever. I should of had my company rebook me in Hartford for the get go. The whole plane had to wait for the stewardesses to come back from a smoke break. Then we were able to get on about 10-15 lates. When we boarded our connecting flight in Washington DC is was good till we got 1/2 hours from Dallas and we circled for 1/2 hours then the pilot got on the speaker and told us we are heading to Tulsa OK. When we landed  he said that he did not know what we are going to do and that he had no communications with headquarters. His words not mine. I would try and avoid American if you can.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Another Bad EXPERIENCE,"Once again another ban experience with American Airlines, you would think that they would fix their problems, I mean they had a whole year to work on getting things better. For example, boarding and leaving on time, I mean how hard is that, other airlines seem to have it down where they board and leave on time but not this airline, always running behind. How is it that no beverage service but you have time to push your credit card on passenger but no beverage service, only if you fly first class. Also, why where a mask when you are packing us in, like sardines in a can, make no sense what so ever. Remember that the customer is the only reason all of you have jobs, so fix the problems and made you can fix your airline if you really care."
Date of travel: May 2021,30,Full flights with no mask enforcements,"While the crew do wear masks over their mouth and nose, and do announce for passengers to do the same, a quarter of passengers were not wearing masks properly and the crew did not enforce it like they do on Canadian airlines."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible airline,Please do NOT use this airlines. We are out $672.40 because they would not refund us. Only a voucher and this was because of their error.  This was an international flight and now we have had to book with another airline. HORRIBLE.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,absolutely no professionalism,"My husband and I took an anniversary trip to Vegas and flew AA with connecting flights in CLT and then Dallas on the way home. The flight down we were sat way in the back of the plane (fine) but the entire duration of the trip, the two flight attendants sat in the back, LOUDLY discussing personal affairs, using profanity and cackling like animals. They also frequently put down the pilots, calling them “stupid” and “dumbasses”. On our flight back, the attendant mentioned the mask mandate a total of 24 times. In a 3 hour flight. She scolded people for having masks down while actively eating and drinking, and her attitude was negative, rude and dismissive. We get it. You need to enforce the mask policy- but calmmmmm downnnn, girl. AA- get it together. We will be avoiding AA like the plague from now on."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible Customer Service,HORRIBLE. Never get basic with them. Rude and inconsiderate employees when it comes to needing ticket changes.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst possible customer service should any issues occur with your flight,"Absolute worst possible customer service. Online system for changing flights repeatedly failed, then left me on hold for hours with no indication of my hold time. An enormous hassle and waste of time; I will be avoiding at all costs in the future, knowing what an impossible process awaits me should anything go wrong with my flights."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible service- wait time 7+ hours on hold,Horrible service-2times waited over 7 hours on hold- they ended up calling at 2am (yes 2am in the morning) after they said the wait time was only 4 hours - and called at 6pm to get in the que- finally went to the airport to make a changes for the flight. Absolutely ridiculous service!! Do not fly American Airlines!!!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible; regular delays on trips for internal reasons,"AA has always been horrible to fly in; there is always delay along the route for reasons related to airline. I have had delays due to waiting for the air hostess being late to show up before we board, the co-pilot not being on time, engine issues for the plane, arriving late for incoming flight etc. horrible airline and service. Cabins are tight and crammed. The staff don’t care much about customers and how they are are affected by the delays. Of course being in the airport, customers have limited say or option to complain. Pathetic airline"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible - AGAIN,"First off let me say the flight down to Tampa bay was great both flights.  Coming back however was I cannot even come up with a word or words.  Our flight was on May 22 last flight into rochester NY from Philly, the flight was delayed due to some maint issues, which okay fine like the pilot said safety first.  He kept saying we would leave shortly and an hour went by as he dangled the carrot, it as very HOT in the cabin, with COVID they do not serve drinks but due to the heat in the cabin ""they are going to serve us water, juice or soda"" Like they are doing us a favor REALLY??.  So we finally did take off and the stewardess that takes care of the regular cabin was belittling and rude to the point of embarrasment.  NOT the woman that is from Rochester her self.  There was a family that was Spanish backround in front of us and yes they had issues with masks all the way up, however the way this stewardess treated them was embarrassing to especially in front of their little kids -  For me to say something it was not good.  So, the other issue is when we landed again we had to sit for about 15 mins before getting to the gate some people undid their seat belts YES i understand that is safety concern HOWEVER, the stewdardess could have handled it alot different by maybe asking people to put them back on INSTEAD of threatining people with a 1500.00 fine, REALLY????  You know I am a credit card holder that spends quite a bit of money on it yearly and I also travel on a regular basis -  Her behavior could loose you customers maybe you should get her some training on Customer service -  The stewardess that is from Rochester has always been very professional on the flights we have had her on.  Maybe if you are reading these reviews they have not been good as of late.  Maybe you should take notice"
Date of travel: May 2021,40,Going Home,"This flight out of XNA was dreadfully early (6a), so I had to get to the airport extremely early.  Check-in was a breeze and a very nice ladyy at the counter helped me get my bag all checked in.  It had been two years since I had flown out of XNA and the security was twice as large.  There was next to no one there so I breezed through.  We boarded right on time and left a little early.  First class did drinks and a breakfast bar.  The flight attendant was delightful, especially when I asked for another bar to take with me.  The flight was a little bumpy at the start as there was weather, but otherwise it was smooth sailing to DCA."
Date of travel: May 2021,40,First Flight since the Pandemic,"So this was my very first flight since the pandemic started.  I opted for a direct flight, so I had to go to DCA instead of IAD, like I normally do and I chose to go first class for the extra space and room.  The airport required masks and after a little bit of difficulty I found where I needed to check in.  A very nice lady, came over and helped me and got my bag all set to be checked.  I had to take it to the TSA scanner before going through security.  I was in the new terminal at the airport however NONE of the restaurants were open as they were all still under construction.  We boarded on time and the flight attendant in first was very pleasant.  The flight itself was uneventful.  They had wi-fi and movies available to watch through their app, but I decided to just read as it was late.  First class did get drinks (non-alcoholic) and a snack bag, but I was really too tired to eat, but the water and tea were great.  I was disappointed that they did not have power outlets to charge my devices but it wasn't too long of a flight.  Overall not a bad experience."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS,"As someone who flies more than the average person, I’ve flown American Airlines numerous times. The last trip I took was the WORST out of all the times I’ve flown. First, our flight was delayed by FOUR hours, fine whatever, I go to the desk and they get me on flight that leaves for Dallas in 15 minutes causing me to lose the upgraded seats that I paid $$ for. The flight is full and I’m forced to check my carry on that contains a bridesmaid dress.  But at least I made it to Dallas right? Kind of. We were rerouted to Austin and sat on the tarmac for another FOUR HOURS. Finally make it to Dallas, and the flight to OKC is delayed but at least we make that. Get to OKC and find out the airline lost my bag. They mistagged it and couldn’t locate it. They reassure me that the bag will make it back to me in 24hrs. NOPE. I called every few hours for updates, first the bag is in Dallas, then Los Angeles, then CABO. Not only was my dress in Cabo, but it was handed off to UNITED AIRLINES. HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?  Spoiler alert: I didn’t get the dress back in time for the wedding and had to buy a dingy $20 dress from David’s bridal. So now I’m out over $200 on this trip due to the negligence of American Airlines. They offered me a $125 voucher, that doesn’t begin to cover my losses.  I demanded they put for the expensive bridesmaid dress I was supposed to wear as that is my biggest loss and they offered to pay for the dingy David’s bridal dress. STILL DOESN’T COVER MY LOSSES. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I for one will not be flying American Airlines or recommending it to anyone. The customer service is horrible. They truly do NOT CARE about their customers."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Management,I had a flight scheduled for nine which actually didn’t wind up leaving till 10 PM I was verbally harassed from another person riding the airplane the associates nor the airline did nothing until I had to defend myself from a man and I am a woman and then in return they canceled my flight due to the flight attendants saying they were not feeling comfortable even though we were not on the plane. When the customer that was harassing me approach the management they laughed together and then management try to come discuss with me. They were very racist they canceled my plane 11 o’clock at night where I had my seven-year-old son with no place to go. They booked me a Marriott but in Fort Lauderdale and return I had to pay $48 to get to Fort Lauderdale and then catch a 615 flight which cost me $30 to the airport. It was a professional and unfair how the whole situation handled. They claim there was no cameras for them to run back to see how the man was disrespected me even though all the people there verify the information.Their service was very poor and prejudice
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Flight attendants were rude and unhelpful.  Plane was dirty.,"Flying with kids is a challenge.  Its even more of a challenge when an airline does not allow you to pick seats to keep your kids with you.  When we were boarding we were attempting to figure out how to be near our children.  Instead of helping, Riki, the flight attendant asked ""what are you doing?"" I explained to her that we didn't want the kids sitting alone so we were trying to figure it out.  She responded ""Well, can you figure it out, we'd like to leave on time.""  It would have been nice to have the flight attendants help with that.    A few things were wrong with this, there were still passengers behind us boarding the plane.  We were clear in the back so we weren't holding up those passengers.  She didn't attempt to help us in any way.  While I was working on that some passengers were struggling to put their luggage into overhead bins, the attendants made no attempt to help them so I helped them which took even longer.There was a dirty band aid on the ground from the previous passengers where one of the children was sitting so it makes me wonder how much cleaning/sanitizing was done between flights.  The snacks were shoved at us in a plastic bag containing a biscotti cookie, water, and hand sanitizing wipe.  We were offered nothing else nor any other options. Another man on the flight was also separated from his family, by 20 rows.  He had worked it out with the passengers near his kids to switch seats but the flight attendants would not allow it even after they had moved their luggage around. I had flown Delta just before and that was a completely different experience.  Flight attendants were accommodating. They handed out sanitizing wipes so you could wipe the area before sitting, and were very helpful to their passengers.  So maybe my expectations were set too high.  I will pay extra not to fly with American Airlines in the future."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Flight Canceled,"Booked airfare from Washington Dulles (IAD) to Puerto Vallarta.  Woke at 3am on travel day to a text message that AA had canceled our flight from Washington, DC to DFW.  We drove to Reagan National (DCA) hoping to catch a different AA flight to DFW.  AA customer service rep at the airport told us the flight from IAD to DFW was canceled because of weather.  The weather was fine and the flight from DCA to DFW had not been canceled. AA would not put us on the flight from DCA to IAD.  They offered to fly us on a later flight - TWO DAYS later.  When we insisted on getting to Puerto Vallarta same day, the offered to fly us into Guadalajara - a SIX HOUR DRIVE to Puerto Vallarta! We asked them to cancel our flight.  I booked airfare on Delta and we left that morning.  I've since learned AA has a reputation for canceling flights on the day of the flight.  Will avoid AA from now on."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,American Airlines: A CRAPSHOW,"We started with a departure of 6 AM, but they delayed it an hour to 7. They then switched it back to 6 AM with no explanation. THEN, they delayed it to 10 AM in which we had to get a new flight for our lay over. 5 minutes before boarding time, they SWITCHED BACK to 6 AM so we had to scramble to get our plane tickets back. DON’T RECOMMEND!!! Worst plane experience I’ve ever had. Get organized please!!"

Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible,We will never fly w them again. We picked specific flights and they kept getting changed. The app isn't very user friendly either.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible service.  ,"It was bad enough that they changed our seats even though we called customer service to be together in business class and paid a fee per customer in February for a May flight, and when we checked in, we noticed they switched our seats so that we weren’t even on the same row. When I called to ask them to honor their promise, I got a condescending, rude customer service employee that told me that just because I bought a ticket, I wasn’t guaranteed a seat ( even though we purchased first class and are elite customers).   Her name was Tracy and she claimed she is a supervisor in reservations. I was already appalled at the way she handled that call.  Then, on our way back from a wonderful vacation, American Airlines took FIFTY minutes to get our suitcases to everyone and they were drenched in rain. We ended up missing the deadline to get our dogs from where they stayed because of their lackadaisical attitude. Their service is horrific these days. We will be checking other options to fly from now on.  American Airlines needs to get back to caring about their customers!!"
n/a,10,Worst travel experience I have ever had ,"I travel frequently to different places all over the world. I also am not one to complain or review but after the experience with American Airlines I want to inform travelers to not choose this Airlines. My original flight was delayed 3 1/2 hours without any notification, then changed to the next day. I showed up to my flight on time and ended up missing my flight as well as over half of the people in line due to the website not working correctly and the staff not knowing how to handle such a crowd. After all of this i was then booked on a flight causing me to miss 24 hours in my destination and a very important meeting. Everyone except one very nice gentleman has been extremely rude even when i landed at my layover destination. I then asked to upgrade my flight and was willing to pay (even though I feel I should not have to) and was rudely told no with no explanation or anything. Do not fly with them, they will screw you over with no explanation."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Call wait time is more than 4 hours,They have bots running their customer service line. They advise that you call them to reserve an infant lap seat closer to your flight date but wait time is more than 4 hours. It's a joke.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,lost and found luggage,"last week we lost our luggage in chicago O'Hare airport while transfering by American airline to Qatar airways. the flight by Qatar never materialised bucause of Covid test type. I had to return to my hometown Nashville, but my luggage stayed with American Airline, We got a call from them last Sunday that they have found our bags but after all this time still I am not able to get these luggage back. I have called numerous times American lost and found, and left many massages but noone return the calls. I have filed on their website but nothing happens, there is no one to speak to . no one is willing to help, , it is like once they charge you for the flight, they wash their hands off. it is beyond comprehension. so disappointed."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst customer service I've ever experience,"I am so disappointed with the service that American Airlines has given me. I never write reviews so for me to explain how disappointed I am just shows how bad this was handled. 10 days ago, I booked a flight from O'Hare to Los Angeles LAX that will depart on Monday, May 24th 6:35 am to Sunday, May 30th 1:25 pm. I chose to pay through PayPal but never received a payment. I therefor called Paypal who said that the payment have been declined. I also called American Airlines who gave me the same response. I never received any notification about this transaction being declined. So, I was completely unaware and unable to rebook a new flight. When I log into my American Airlines account I can still find my booked trip with the status ''pending''. I need to have this flight confirmed so that I can fly on Monday. No one is responding when I call customer service and I have been waiting in line for 6 hours with no response. As I said I am beyond disappointed with the service that I have received. Please help me with this ASAP.Record Locator WXPLGJTrip name: ORD/LAXTicket number: --Status: Pending"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Dont use american airlines,I am writing this as we are rebooking our flight after 2 hours of waiting and missing our flight😍We arrived at the airport 2 hours before our flight. We were in the line for baggage check in for 2 hours because there was only 3 people working. About 50-70 people in the line and each group of people were taking about 10-30minutes which is extremely ling. I dont understand why it took this long. Half of the people in the line missed their flight because of them. Now the people that missed their flights are going to start rebooking and its gonna take even longer. The people that have flights at 9:30 is probably gonna miss theirs and this process will just keep on repeating. USE DELTA NOT AMERICAN AIRLINES. The people didnt even apologize 😍😍 Like an apology is the least you can do.i hate american airlines 🥺.  We were gonna travel internationally so we gotta pay another 200 to retake the covid test LMAOO. shoutout to american airlines for causing all of this mess 🤤🤤
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Disappointed within Customer service,This was going to be my first time flying with American Airlines. I had a vacation package booked for this weekend to Mexico flying out of MIAMI for my husband surprise birthday . All exclusive Resort (witch I was told AA was the best for these types of packages) All excited to go however the day before we leave an unexpected change (set back) happened therefore were unable to go.  Thursday 5/20/21 my travel agent has been trying to get threw to anyone within Customer service as soon as she does 7 HOURS LATER and that's waiting on the call back the phone was disconnected NO  ONE FROM AA had the curstey to call her back the professionalism was gone once that happened.. Moving forward to 5/21/21 at 7:30am let's try again but this time we need MANAGEMENT to be involved left a couple of VOICE MAILS and as of now still have not received a call back nor an email. (5/22/2021 1:30am ) still waiting.  The disappointment and sadness I feel as a new customer words can't explain . What hurts the most is the poor customer service that could've been corrected once the phone was disconnected. Now that no one has called my agent back makes me feel like my hard earn money and the excitement I wanted to see my husband have has gone Down the drain. The thing about this is I don't want the MONEY BACK we just needed a voucher so we can rebook Within a couple of weeks. The  Frustration the worrying of this whole situation has my anxiety on 10. So now instead of my husband enjoying his Birthday he has to watch me sit and worry if anything will happen if we'll receive a call back.. My fear is next week  comes and AA says oh sorry there's nothing we can do it's to late but we've been trying since Thursday. I truly do understand that people are busy but for a well known company to not have one person to do call backs or the Manager that was left the VOICE MAIL not return a call is unexceptable. To move forward with using AMERICAN AIRLINES/PACKAGES has really put me in a different mindset for this company.  #helpmeoutAmercianAirlines
n/a,30,Will not fly again with American,"We have not flown on American since before Covid and after this flight will not fly with them again.  I have never been so cramped in my life and I'm only 5'3"".  We had to claim our bags in Dallas (normal) for processing immigration and customs and rechecked our bags for Atlanta.   They had over an hour to get our bags on the next flight, but it never happened.  Upon arrival in Atlanta and filling out the paperwork,  the employer asked if we had actually got our bags in Dallas....dumb question.  Then after filling out paperwork  for delayed/lost bags, asked if we wanted to drive back from Florida to pick up the luggage when it does come in.  Never ran onto anything like this."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Never fly with American Airlines,Yes I will never fly with American Airlines!! Like 15 passengers including me and my 3 month baby miss our connecting flight because they want to give us less than 30 mins to get off one plane to get to the next gate without even knowing the gate number yet!! So we had to get off the plane wait in line to see which gate was the connecting flight and by the time we got there the plane was already boarded and doors was shut! They talking about it’s our fault we didn’t make it on time. Then I told them I was active duty military and that I have to report at a certain time. They said they don’t care about military personal. So I had to pay out of pocket for a hotel and Lyft because they wouldn’t refund me any money to get another flight same day even though I had insurance too!! American Airlines can rot in hell!!!☠️☠️
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Absolutely hated my first flight and this one is shaping up to be just as bad,"This company gives 2 caps about you or your business. I paid 580 for a ticket and can't even chose a seat without another 24 bucks added on. I will never fly this airline again. First time, I should have learned, this time I definitely have learned. Never again!!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,KDK,"Seats were horribly cramped and uncomfortable.  In air WiFi did not work.  Still using the so called pandemic as an excuse to offer No food or beverage service.  Handed out insulting little child size bottles of water and micro bags of pretzels.  Will not allow any alcohol to be brought on plane even with no beverage service.  Return flight was canceled due to disorganized response and inability to quickly inspect for damage due to a “suspected” lightning strike.  Forced to sit on plane for 1.5 hours and then deplane and wait in terminal for 6 hours while they figured out what the protocol should be.  Was then sent to a hotel and could not return home until the following day.  American also nickel and dimes customers almost as much as Spirit!  I can’t believe I’m saying this but Spirit actually feels like a more premium airline than American! At least you can get drinks, snacks and friendlier service on Spirit."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,An assured squanderance of your vacation.,"Showed up an hour and a half before boarding. AA computer system quit for 2 hours. Flight left late and we missed our connecting flight. We were wait listed on several succeeding flights and assured seats at the end of the day “if all else failed.” A completely false assurance. We finally got to our destination by splitting our party of 4, with all (including a minor) sitting alone and/or on separate flights.  Our trip was extended by a full day and plans canceled due to time.  With the duration of time spent waiting, it would have been as quick to drive—Pennsylvania to Texas. Not impressed with American Airlines."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst flying experience ever,"American Airlines is a disgrace. I am once again standing in line as I miss my plane. Our departure was out of  Oklahoma City. 3 AA workers were at the desk as over 200 people weee trying to check in. The kiosk line was over 100 deep. We just needed baggage rags. Arrived 2 hours prior to our departure. We were directed out of the kiosk line to a new line. The worker at the desk checked in 1 person and disappeared. 30 minutes later, we weee told that she was called to the gate. We missed that flight. The next available flight was 6 hours later. I drove to Dallas where our connecting flight was scheduled. Arrived before the flight, but we were not early enough for bag check. They tried to charge me $120 per ticket to get on the next flight.AA would not reimburse our flight from OKC to DFW despite the fact that it was 100% their fault that we missed our initial flight. Finally, got to Orlando on stand-by. Cancelled out return flight from DFW to OKC over the phone. We got to the Orlando airport over 2 hours early. The kiosk now states that we owe a fee. Have again been in line for almost 2 hours as 1 worker is tending a line over 100 people deep. Gonna miss this flight as well. American Airlines is the worst service industry I have ever encountered. I recommend people to avoid this company like the plague. It is a total embarrassment."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,HORRID customer Service,"Had to reschedule this trip from last year due to COVID Cancelling Flights...finally going on a vacation I've planned for 2 years...flying tomorrow at 7:30 AM and go to checkin online to get boarding passes and checkin my luggage and I get, ""Sorry - you'll have to checkin at the airport"".....what the heck does that mean?  Are they going to cancel my flight again?   This can't be happening!  I'm so upset.  I'm about to drive to the airport a day early just to find out what the problem is.  I tried calling but of course you can't get past the automated system.  They are HORRID!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Choose Any Other Airline,"Please fly with any other airline. American has been the most difficult, frusturating and unfair airline I have ever interacted with! They refused to give me a refund during COVID and now they are refusing to let my wife use my travel credit towards her flight. I hope their happy with their decision and customer service because we will no longer consider them for future flights. Enjoy the $200 you made off me, you lost out on thousands of dollars in the future - great business decision. Also, don't waste your time asking to speak with a manager/supervisor - they are of no help"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst customer service for disabled veteran,First time I have flown in two years.Alaska Airline assigned this flight without my knowledge.Alaska made every accommodation for PTSD mask restricted exemption flight  easy and uneventful.American Airlines had my primary care physician write four letters and changed the exemption definition every time including how they would receive the letters.After their final denial I said I would do my best to tolerate the mask.Because they fear I might “struggle” with the mask and be seen pulling it down to sip water or to eat we were changed to the back of the plane for our “protection”.Protection or punishment?
Date of travel: May 2021,30,Two  seats together was too much to ask....,"This trip was booked months in advance.  The fare seemed reasonable, but my wife and I were placed in different rows.  We made no request as to seating, but we assumed we would be placed next to each other, as our purchase was long before the date of the flight.  The flight was sold out, and hence I don't believe this had to do with COVID spacing requirements.  We are frequent fliers on AA, and I think this is no way to treat loyal customers. We make this trip twice a year; given the choice, we'll fly Delta.  (this has never happened to us with them. )."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Had forgotten how bad AA service is,"Flight AA2416 Miami to México City, only one restroom working since someone filled the other toilet with paper and excrement, this can happen anywhere, but what is appalling is that the flight attendants did nothing!!’ Did not try to clean the mess, did not advise the passengers that one restroom was closed, did not even apologize when passengers constantly opened the restroom door to try and use it, they just gingerly sat at the back of the plane playing games in their smart phones. Unacceptable"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Vacation,"I took a flight from Newark to Texas, it was terrible. Waiting on the plan to leave then we leave then back to the gate again and sat on the plane for 3hrs. So we were on the plane over 6hrs total. I asked for a refund or discount and basically they said no way. The flight back was also a nightmare."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,AA SUCKS yet again,"American over the past few years has become of the worst airlines. I’ve HAD to fly AA several times since 2018 and was either delayed from 1 to7 hours or flight canceled because a crew could not be found! missing connections.  Many years ago they were one of the best when, I think the CEO was Crandall.  Now I try never to fly AA.Today, a door won’t shut!!??"
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Pick another airline!,"Horrible experience. Book flight to suite my family’s needs.... only for the airline to change it a month away from travel to include a 3 hour layover. I arrive in Mexico and SURPRISE!... my luggage is in South Carolina (the people I traveled with, their baggage ended up in Texas... and we were all on the same flight? I don’t understand that but anyways.. ) the lady at baggage claim offered me a tiny bag of crappy toiletries to hold me over. Thank goodness I packed two bathing suits (one for me and one for The friend I traveled w that also had lost luggage). My friends luggage arrives 30ish hours later. Mine FINALLY arrives 36ish hours later. When I get it, I see the airline has completely destroyed one of my large zippered pockets on the front that I usually carry my stuff I need easy access to in the airport. (Thanks!) on the return flight, they load us up and then have us sit on the (HOT)  plane for 1.5 hours (With our masks on!) so they can figure out what they are doing. Very unpleasant experience on both my incoming and outgoing flight."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,The WORST airline you could possibly imagine.,Not only was my nonstop flight cancelled. I was rescheduled for another flight which was a connection and that flight was delayed as well. So much so we missed the connection. Asked for a refund and was denied. Tried multiple times to contact the airline regarding the issue and no one reached out to me. The service is completely and utterly horrible. We brought warm water which was spilled on me as well & the flight attended said “oops you moved” smh i will NEVER use this airline ever again.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,No one will help you,"They don't care. I got to the airport with my COVID test, ticket agent in Tampa reviewed my passport, test and immigration information and said I was good to go. It's my first trip post-COVID and I did my best to do everything right. I got to immigration in Bogota only to find out I had the wrong type of COVID test. Why did the ticketing agent say everything was ok? I could have gotten the right test at the Tampa airport. Or even in the Miami airport, where I had a layover. In Bogota, I was taken out of line by immigration, put in holding and berated for attempting to enter with the wrong test. American didn't send anyone to come get me from the holding area for 2 hours. When someone finally showed up I asked if I could get tested in Bogota as testing was offered at the airport. She said no. I asked if I could be put on a flight to Miami to get tested and return? She said no. I asked if she could do anything to help me? She said no. She did say that many people had been arriving with the wrong test but American was just returning them. No efforts to get their passengers the right test or any effort to help save the trip. I was made to wait at the gate without my passport or permission to leave my seat for another 2 hours. Without food or drink. When an agent showed up with my passport I was told I'd be put on a 17-hour journey back to Florida. I asked if I could be put on a shorter or more direct flight? She said no. No one lifted one single finger to help me. I lost my entire 2 week trip: hotel deposits and my other flights in Colombia. The staff in the Bogota airport treated me like utter garbage. I was told if I had a problem I could email American when I got home. No one deserves to be treated like a criminal or like garbage for an honest, and apparently common, mistake. American did nothing to prevent or remedy the situation. Why would you let people on a plane only to be humiliated by immigration and then send them on an unnecessary 17 hour journey? I paid extra to have the support of a major airline but that was foolish. They could not have cared less. I am so disappointed. No one deserves that. So, if you travel with American, buyer beware. Their indifference is shameful. NOTE: a 3.5-hour flight gets you a small bag of pretzels and a tiny bottle of water. A 5-hour flight gets you a cold sandwich and a small bag of pretzels."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible customer service & supervisors,When we landed in Dallas we were told our flight was delayed...for two hours we were told the plane would not cool down so we were waiting on crew to cool plane down. It was delayed SEVERAL TIMES from the original time at 8:15 to 11:45 Then they completely canceled it!!! Then when asked for vouchers for food or hotel we were told it was weather related ... a TOTAL LIE to keep from accommodating anyone. THE gate lady left the area because she said she was off work. The supervisor NEVER CAME OUT...Ramona at dfw. We FINALLY got back to lafayette the next day and have been sitting on the runway WAITING TO GET INTO GATE Because another plane hasn’t left !!! American Airlines can’t seem to get their S#^+ together! #flyunited #flydelta #flyanythingelseAnd the airplanes are NASTY!
Date of travel: October 2020,10,"Extremely unhelpful and rude ""customer service"" staff member.","I was due to fly in October 2019; due to illness I was unable to travel so I provided AA with a medical letter and they told me I could rebook within a year. However in March 2020 the pandemic struck and we were unable to fly for the next 12+ months due to being locked down. Instead of offering an extension to the booking period or any prior warning, AA simply ""expired"" my air ticket - without any notice or communication that this was their policy. When I contacted AA, the customer relations representative called me to tell me they could do nothing about it as the $600 ""ticket was expired and not valid"". She was unhelpful in the extreme, and rudely hung up the phone on me without making any effort to resolve the issue in a satisfactory way, or at all. No professional care, compassion or understanding. Unacceptable from American Airlines ""Customer Relations""."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst 1st Flight,"I will never fly American Airlines ever. My 1st flight as a Breast Cancer survivor nervous,  and scared because of me being high risk I did not want to fly. Then my daughter my Guardian angel who helps me with everything was on Delta flight so naturally I was nervous wreck due to not flying. Upon being wheeled in a wheelchair, the gentleman was a sweetheart wheeled me to the plane then once I got on the plane it was a TOTAL NIGHTMARE & I cried & was very angry at how the flight attendant with the ponytail treated me. I asked her politely can you help me to my seat because my glasses were in my daughter's purse & vision is bad due to chemo. Her response was cant you read? Then I sat near 3 Arabic boys that kept taking their masks off coughing & laughing & talking vulgarly & nothing was said. I have tried to call & email &  told their is no direct number for complaints! So how do I get refunded for this horrible trip? The flight attendant had NO EMPATHY for me & for me to have Survived the worst experience in my life and not die is a blessing! I have worked on the Customer service/Hospitality industry & this is not how you treat Customers or Human beings!! Maybe I will get a response soon."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,HORRIBLE,My friend was stuck in Miami because we apparently had a hand to hand ticket. Meaning if I wasn’t present she couldn’t bored. She explained her situation and begged for them to let her on. 3 flights had at least one open seat. She went to the front desk for them to sign the permission slip. They said they had to go on lunch break. They also accused her for sneaking in through TSA because once she missed her flight due to TSA shutting down for 30 mins (resulting in 70 other people missing their flights) her itinerary disappeared.It’s unfair and inconsiderate customer service like this that gives me trust issues. Why would we pay $500 of our hard earned money just to be ignored and then charged an additional $500 to locate where we need to be.I will never fly with American again and I will never go through MIA.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Not Good,"Going to try to make this short....booked trip with miles we had saved up for years well before Covid started.  Spent many frustrating hours on phone trying to figure out what to do or what we could do with flights since of course we couldn't take the trip.  Ended up with credits. Could only use the flights for the same people originally booked. Could only use for domestic travel.  Ended up having to spend $800 more in fees on top of the original 150k in miles already used.  Airport in Turks and Charlotte packed.  Flights booked solid.  On the way back we spent a ridiculous time in TSA lines which caused us to miss our connecting flight.  We asked many times if we could move to a different line for those with connecting flights leaving sooner but got no help at all.  Of course missed flight.  Arrived at door still 15 minutes before take off but they would not let us on.  Was told we would have to stay overnight.  We asked ourselves for an alternate flight to an alternate location.  Flight was available and we were booked to alternate airport where we rented a car and drove a couple hours home.  Took a total of 4 flights.  Was given a bag with a water and small bag of pretzels on 3 flights and luckily got an actual soda on one flight.  The airport was so packed in CLT that we couldn't get anything decent to eat, lines were too long.  Nobody ever said sorry or offered a little bit of empathy.  One flight was so bumpy I kept my head in a sick bag.  Neither airline or hotel were willing to give our money back and we had to travel before expiration dates.  The traveling was horrible.  We also did this with 2 kids.  I know that AA got millions of dollars in government money to help with the Covid situation.  Expected more.  Flying these days has dropped significantly from what it used to be. It is now basically a miserable experience. It is sad.  I do feel grateful that I arrived safely on all flights.  Not making any plans to fly again anytime soon."

Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible,"Me, neither will anyone I have the pleasure of speaking with will ever fly American Airlines. Their business is inadequate, they will give you the runaround as to why their bag crew messed up. Their timekeeping is poor, as our connecting flight began boarding 20 minutes upon our first flight arriving. As a result, our bags weren’t boarded. 24 hours later, there is a disconnection whether our bags have been retrieved or not. Terrible timekeeping, inadequate service, and they just suck at their job."

Date of travel: May 2021,20,First Class is not what it used to be!,"First class travel is not what it used to be! The most rudest, nastiest, ticket counter attendant I have ever encountered. She was at gate C11, checking in passengers. She was so overtly rude and when asked a question she never answered. She refused to show her name tag but she was the only ticket woman checking passengers in for their flight. Horrible flight and overpriced. There are no attendants and American wants you to do everything including checking your own baggage? Since when do people tolerate such subservient behaviors? NOT EVERYONE USES OR HAS A CELL PHONE. NOT EVERYONE WANTS THIER INFORMATION SOLD TO OTHER COMPANIES. WAKE UP AMERICA!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Never ever use this airline,"Waited on hold for 3 hours till they couldn’t find my flight info while I’m staring at my flight info confirmation email, then they put me back on hold for an hour, what a completely useless airline"

We understand this horrible epidemic and the rules that come along with it. I pulled my mask down for a breif second to sip water, he came by said mask up very rude. An hour later my husband fell asleep. Top of his nose showing he touched him woke him up said lift it now. Third time he came around he was so rude told me to pull mask up. My nostril were covered he said cover your nose ..it was completely covered beside the bridge of my nose ... We were not loud or rude  just kept stating loudly they are up. Meanwhile the two boys infront of us had mask fully down the whole time. They ended up calling from the air down to the airport for higher ups to meet us downstairs and give us a ""lashing"".the man was pretty upset with the airline that they called down to him to come up for somthng this unimportant..my husband was fired up at this point, understandable. The man stated to just not talk back. We get that but when someone is rude for nothing and telling us somthng we are doing already it's uncalled for. The flight attendant was out to get us from the start. Super nice to the man infront of us with his nostrils out !. Never flying here again. I do not recommend it at all."

Date of travel: May 2021,10,Delayed,AA is pathetic excuse for a service provider.  I will ALWAYS choose Southwest over this horrible company! Constantly delaying flights and changing gates.   Clearly not a dependable choice for transportation!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible is an understatement,"After a completely miserable experience with American Airlines, it got even better on my final flight home. To start, the flights I initially booked were selected for specific dates and times for a reason. I understand flights will change, but when a flight is changed to one I did not pick, and then when I correct the flight to meet my accommodations for the planned trip, I was forced to pay the difference. What sense does it make to be allowed to select flights, only to have them changed to ones that do not line up with any other part of the trip, and then force the customer to pay the difference? But, hey, I guess that is what I get for selecting this airline. So fast-forwarding to my flight home may seem insignificant, but it is really just the icing on the cake with me. I am traveling with the same CARRY-ON bag I have used several times, including this entire trip, and I never once checked my carry-on bag. So at the gate, they announce the flight is going to be full (okay, that's fine, no issues); they then announce that if you would like to check your carry-on at the gate, there would not be any charge for it (okay pretty reasonable). So I walk up to the heavyset guy wearing a San Diego Padres facemask around 12:45 PM to check my bag. I am then told that my bag is too big and that I am going to be charged an extra $40 because it is my ""2nd bag."" Keep in mind the bag that was checked was for my pregnant fiance, but I did it under my name. So after some back and forth and not wanting to cause a scene, I just said screw it and paid the $40 because these employees are on some sort of false power trip. I've already been denied a refund of the difference for my flight change (which I find to be complete BS!), but I want my $40 back for a bag that I should have never been charged for in the first place. The sheer rudeness and lack of professionalism that I have dealt with are mind-numbing, and I am about to file a complaint to the DOT."

As We Prepared To Board The Plane, A Young Lady Yells To Us That Our Bag “Will Not Fit In Overhead Bins” Without Confirming. We Ask Why And Her Response Was “I Don’t Know, It Just Doesn’t ”. She Grabs The Attention Of Another Employee Who Snatched Our Luggage Out Of Our Hands And Stated “I Don’t Have Time To Explain Anything To You Guys.” We AreExtremely Displeased With The Level Of Customer Service We Received, Especially Being GOLD Members."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Poor Customer Relations,"I'd like to say it was a bad flight, but I can't say that as I never got to take off. I received a call a week and half prior to our planned out vacation in Cozumel. They called and said they NO LONGER HAVE THE RETURN FLIGHT. Basically, tough sh*t and we don't care if it ruins your vacation. I found a return flight on United at about $500 additional cost. I called to cancel my return flight and keep my outbound flight. American said CAN""T DO THAT, BUT WE CAN CANCEL YOUR ENTIRE FLIGHT. Again, tough sh*t! I then had to book last minute with United at an additional cost of $1,100. They are awful!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Pay for upgraded seats you won’t get,"It is unacceptable when a passenger pays for a seat upgrade 10 days in advance, the money is withdrawn from the bank, we are sent a receipt and you still screw up the seat assignments and we are stuck in our original seats (so basically sitting on the lap of some stranger). They need to make this right."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Disappointed,"They don't offer coffee,water,soda,blanket,nothing.The fligth attendants where more preocupied about the mask cover your nose than to be more welcoming,I'll not recomennded and i wont come back."

Date of travel: April 2021,10,Flight attendant did not care about COVID rules or us!,I have a COMPLAINT about flight attendant ‘Bridget’She sat in seat 22A Flight SMF - PHXAA1862Seats 22E & 22DOur Record locator: KMNWXZEXTREMELY Rude. Not one greeting at all. Not even eye contact. Sat with her mask UNDER her NOSE. We were completely disgusted at her complete lack of proper Covid safety protocols!See photo below of her sitting there the ENTIRE flight with her mask UNDER HER NOSE! Absolutely ridiculous!! Especially since my husband is a Lifetime Platinum member with over 2 Million AA seat miles (was always EP but retired in 2018) and we respect the Covid safety rules on all of our travels and daily life!She also never asked us for the verbal response of ‘YES’ we can and will offer the duties of an exit row passenger. NEVER one peep! Her actions - and lack of actions - are totally unacceptable!!What is happening to you American Airlines???
Date of travel: May 2021,10,CEO OFUpstatefrenchies LLc,"I Will never take this airline again in my Wife, my experience was a complete nightmare ! Flying into New York for my daughter surprise birthday party just for my flight to be delayed for over 10 hours! Long story short I missed the party and they will not do anything to compensate me, I paid over $500 for a one-way ticket to New York and I am stranded at a airport in Washington for seven more hours, they are sending me to Philly in the morning to connect a different flight, I want a full refund immediately! This is hands-down the worst experience I ever had flying! DoNot!! Thank Me Later!!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,American Airlines it the worst,"American Airlines does NOT care about it’s customers at all. Multiple times that I have flown with AA they have delayed my flight, changed my seats (from a better seat with my partner to a worse seat with us sitting far from each other), and lost my luggage. They charge for everything and anything u may need on the flight including checked bags and seat assignment. It is insane. Even if you pay their premiums they will still not respect their agreements at the cost to the customer. After my flight being delayed FOUR TIMES today, I am officially swearing them off for good. If you are a prospective flyer be warned. They may seem like the best deal on Priceline or Expedia, but it is for a reason! In the end you will spend just as much but get less for it. I suggest spending a little more and going with an airline that will actually give you the service you pay for."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Trash airline folks,"On a scale of 1-10 definitely giving American a 2/10. No complimentary snacks on the plane. The plane situation was a mess. They’re micro-managing silly things like carry on bags when they could’ve not filled the plane up in the first place…my layover was in miami, fl. How stupid? Just overall a bad experience no thank you american."

Date of travel: May 2021,10,The worst airline ever!!!,"First of all, I do not recommend this airline to anyone who value their time! My route today supposed to be Burbank, CA/Phoenix, AZ/ El Paso, TX. Second, it took almost 2 hours to drop off checked in bag; then closer to boarding time they announced that my flight delayed which made me to miss my flight from Phoenix to El Paso! Customer service the worst!Relationship to their clients, passengers- the worst! This airline needs to go out of business and let others to fly !!!! So far got to Phoenix. Now in another line to find out what are my options to get to my final destination."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible Service,"If I could give American Airlines zero stars I would. They are rude, disrespectful and have zero options if weather related delays occur. They do not give any refunds for anything to accommodate the customer, if you have to stay over in airport, oh well, their not helping with anything, if they redirect you to another airport, taxi, uber is on you...Whatever you do, do not Fly American, book your flight with any other airline...."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Abusive, rude representatives at San Antonio Airport.","As a military member, I have to carry equipment in my luggage. They were nasty, rude and made me open my bag in front of every body and pull my military equipment out, and I had to carry it by hand. Absolutely humiliating. Never been treated like that in my 21 yrs of service."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst experience with an airline.,"We left key West and made it to our flight on time. They reassured us we'd make our flight to Miami. However.. we made it to the airport in plenty of time after literally running to the gate. The airplane was still on the tarmac but said .. flight already left. No it didn't! It was still there. We ultimately had to spend over $400 to find a hotel. That was even a nightmare! No water in the sink,shower or in the kitchen. Absolutely will NEVER fly with American Airlines again. Had no help, lies and complete discomfort all the way around. Priority boarding.. RIGHT! totally ridiculous. Never again."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Disrespect at its finest,"I will NEVER book with you again. You do not care about your customers. They do not value the customers piece of mind or time whats so ever. We waited almost 30 minutes past our departure time with ZERO explanation until a customer requested an update. Then after waiting all that time we had to WAIT FOR FUEL!!! If they valued their customers at all they would have fueled up while we were waiting instead of after. This is a 10 PM FLIGHT. I will never recommend this airline to anyone, I will actually go out of my way to make sure no one i know uses this company as I would never want someone I know treated this way. I also plan on calling tomorrow to discuss my concerns directly with the company. I am actually typing this up as I sit in the plane, almost an hour after my departure time with family waiting. THIS COMPANY IS A SHAM!!!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Flights Good Bad Luggage Handling,"The flight crews were all absolutely amazing. They were kind and courteous. The ticketing and desk folks were also nice enough despite the extra stress from COVID precautions. Our big problem came from the way our luggage was handled. We had new set of luggage on our way down, and they now look beat to heck.  One just purchased piece has a giant crack and a missing latch. Two others have giant scuffs and dings. Additionally, we had just bought special luggage tags and one of them is just gone. Every checked piece ended up at least moderately damaged including a bridal garment bag."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,They wouldn't let us leave St. Lucia because they didn't have record of our arrival,"We stood in line in St. Lucia for over 2.5 hours because they only had 2 windows open to check in people for 3 international flights. This was similar to our other 2 legs only worse leaving St. Lucia. When we got to the window the attendant didn't process us as expected and did not/would not tell us what was wrong. When we pushed, he finally admitted he couldn't find evidence that we had flown to the island on American a week earlier. We definitely had.  Our tickets and flight information on our phones, nor our stamps on our passports convinced them of this. We could hear overhead announcements calling us to board our plane so we offered to buy new tickets and work this out late, but the attendant stood with the phone to his ear like some inanimate object with. no ability of problem solve. After an hour with him, we insisted on speaking to his supervisor. A lady with better communication skills came out and only too one more hour to get us a room and taxi to overnight at Coconut Bay. I woke up the next morning with about 200 itchy bug bites all over my body. With no resolution as to what went wrong and now with expired covid tests they put us on a flight the next day, so that we arrived home in the midst of a blizzard."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,American is the worst airline you could ever travel with.,I have flown with American a handful of times and have not had a single good experience. I usually will only fly with them if I have no other option. They are ridiculously pricey for how much they don’t give a single care about you.
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Disastrous Experience,"Our flight from Miami to Aruba was exceptional. My husband and I were on the opposite side of the airport due to an airport representative giving us not good advice to get to our gate. So the aircraft waiting on us for 20 minutes to properly board and made sure we had water, and cookies to eat after a bunch of running. Side note, we would have been on time to the flight if they weren't always trying to leave before the time advised on our ticket.So yesterday we boarded our Aruba to Miami return flight. All passengers boarded the plane and we were to we would be moving shortly but 30 minutes goes by and no movement. The pilot announces that a passengers documents were not approved so we lost our clearance and had to wait on this passenger. So this situation gets resolved an hour later now the pilot announces one of the screens in the cockpit for the right engine is not coming up. So a technician comes and fixes it but another hour has passed by and we're finally cleared to take off. Our connecting flight had a departure time of 9:25pm, we don't get off the 1st flight until 9:15pm, we rush to the gate to find that the flight left 10 minutes before we got there. Why!?! We are on the same airline, why would they not contact the connecting flights and annouce the delay so people could still make it to their final destinations! We then had to go to the rebooking center to find that another flight that was going to our home state has closed their doors while we were standing in line but has not taken off yet and they won't open the doors for us. Now, our flight is scheduled for 8am the next day with NO hotel accommodations for the night! Instead we get to be nice, cold and hungry in the airport!! I call customer service to voice my dissatisfaction and they apologize and tell me to email Customer Relations. What's the point of the representatives if you can't get proper help or assistance. Severely disappointed in this experience today."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Shame on you,This airline has ZERO respect for our military.  They have NO programs to serve them or their families but they are FREE to fly safely because of our military members.  Drop the name American and get a new one since you are far from American. I felt like we were being militarized by the Natzi government the way the staff treated everyone.  Power trip.  You should be grateful you have a job and it's because people like me and my husband and the hundreds of others who you treated like crap today and last week.  I hope people will see this and you for who you are. Bye God.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Pathetic, even worse then before, which was bad.","On a recent trip to San Diego, we were put on the plane in Dallas, boarded slowly. Sat on the plane about 45 minutes at the gate. Pilot finally cam on and said there was a problem with a cargo door. About 30-45 minutes later, we were told we would have to deplane. About 2 hours later, we finally flew.Two weeks later on my return trip to Pensacola, from San Diego we were delayed several hours due to weather in Dallas. Finally landed much later in Dallas only to be informed most of our connections were missed. Gate attendant was very rude, told over two dozen people standing in line for new tickets for connecting flights, he couldn’t help us, we were “on our own”. Really? My flight to Pensacola was changed a few times then the last flight out was cancelled. The counter agent said it  was due to weather. I asked her, in Pensacola? She stated abruptly no, here, in Dallas. As i was waiting to talk her, I noticed the tarmac was mostly dry and saw several planes take off. She gave me a standby ticket for the following morning, and said weather delays didn’t qualify for a hotel voucher, I called AA 800 number to get a confirmed seat, which they did (as she could have also) and was informed the flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues (for which I should have received a voucher for hotel, food, transportation. Obviously the gate attendant lied and was apparently too lazy, and unpleasant, to issue the vouchers. this is about the 5th time in recent years i have had a problem with an American Airlines flight due to mechanical issues. NEVER AGAIN, I WILL TAKE A GREYHOUND BUS BEFORE I FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN,"I waited 2 hour just because they were trying to fix the TV and I have places to go so I missed my big job opportunity. This is ridiculous no one cares about the TV just where they got to go.  We were supposed to leave at 2:00 and left at 4:30, they didn’t even fix the issue."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible Experience.   No Accountability,"Where do I start?  I booked a family vacation to Disney World prior to COVID.  Had to move the trip twice.  I had seats for my our party of 7 for a year and a half.   A month prior to our flight the ""system"" wiped away our seats.  I contacted them immediately.  They apologized this happened but offered little else.   When you finally get to speak to a live person be patient because the first time it  took between 4 to 7 hours for a call back only to be told that their seating system will automatically put us together as we were a family.  We were traveling with children 8, 2 and infant.   As the date got closer, I tried calling them again but they kept telling me I had to resolve it at the gate.  We arrived hours early to PHL airport.  It was a nightmare from start to finish.  Not enough people checking luggage, security lines were ridiculous and we ended up having to run to the gate only to be met by multiple families with the same problem.   The attendant at the gate said he couldn't help us.  We had to speak to the flight attendant and to board the plane.  The flight attendant was little help.  Told us to take our seats and to ask people around us to switch!!   Luckily people were sympathetic and we found two seats together in pairs so the young children were not alone but we were scattered throughout the plane.   You can forget getting anything on AA.   Their charges for baggage and seats are considerably higher.  They don't even give you a bag of pretzels and you can request a beverage but you have to call for the attendant who acts like you are bothering them.  They literally all stood in the front or back of the plane and talked the entire time.  Worst experience I have had.  I understand that things might take a while to get back to normal but no one at AA tried to help us.  They just kept passing the buck on to the next person."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,If I only had a choice...,"I flew american years back and they were not nearly as terrible as they are now.  They've gone overboard in charging for everything!  They are on par for competing with Spirit airlines for extras. Craziness ensues when they charge for baggage then scramble at the gate to beg people to come forward and check their bags for free. Such a pain in the butt. They are on the bottom of my list for travelling on, on oar with Spirit."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,horrendous customer service experience,"Calling customer service is a nightmare and is the main reason why I will never fly on AA again. Wait times start at 1 hour(!), then go to 4 hours (!!!!) as the day gets longer. If your call gets disconnected, they will _not_ call you back, and you can only start all over again at the back of the line. It takes a day or more to get anything done."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Wasted vacation,"Today my husband and I were supposed to go to Los Angeles for our wedding anniversary/his birthday for 3 days and 2 nights. I was emailed repeatedly with the confirmation of our flights. Our trip was booked through Expedia and this is the first and last time I ever use them. Basically neither company wanted to help us, I was getting the run around. Neither one of them could give me an explanation as to why they canceled my husband’s flight without informing us. I asked an employee for help and he seemed annoyed because 1. I was asking him for help 2. He was just standing there speaking with another employee doing nothing. I won’t say that all the staff was rude because that’s not true. However, there were some rude employees and that ruined my experience with this company. No one wanted to be bothered with helping me get a ticket for my husband. It was a mistake made on Expedia and American Airlines side and they just didn’t care to help us. What didn’t make sense was the employee we spoke with in person said we were emailed a “ghost/shadow ticket”so technically my husband never had a ticket to begin with. What on earth is that and why is that even a thing? I’m just annoyed that I couldn’t get a answer from either side, extremely unprofessional."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Bad Partnership Decision,"The partnership with Jet Blue was a bad decision.  We have been loyal American Airlines customers for years.  However, when our flight to Boston on AA was canceled we were told of a partnership with Jet Blue so we chose a direct flight.  Terrible experience with Jet Blue.  We could not check in online nor on the app due to record locator and flight confusion between the two airlines.  When we tried to call Jet Blue to check in we experienced massive wait times.  When we arrived at Logan airport in Boston for our return flight to Los Angeles, we were told we had no seats (we were never told this by Jet Blue after waiting over an hour to speak with an agent) even though we had seats on the outbound trip.  We were ultimately banished to the last two seats in the row by the bathrooms.  I booked these tickets back in March.  This so called ""partnership"" with Jet Blue is yet another great example of decisions made by execs without regard for customer service."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,The worst!  If I could give them a zero I would but that’s not an option.  Do not check bags!,Flight got delayed- Waited 6 hours for help at DFW!  Bags lost and sent to different airports.   No help from customer service.   They suck!  You will have a better travel experience hitching hiking.    Seriously they suck!  While waiting in line we watched a person pass out and needed medical attention.   Two customer service people and then one leaves for a break while over 200 people were waiting in line!   If you have an issue you have two options.   Your mobile app or a customer service person who is looking at a cleverer.They suck!The 5 star ratings are fake!   They suck!

He continued drinking the flight attendant came back WITH SECURITY AND ESCORTED US OFF THE PLANE. Not only was it embarrassing it was absurd. He had a drink in hand . I will never fly them or recommend them ever . We are now stuck in a foreign city."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Never never again!!,"Rude and nasty employees from gate agent to what they like to call customer service.  Spend your money with any other airline but American.  No communication about a seriously delayed flight.  Bottom line is... they really don't care about their customers.  Sad fact is that the flying public grew your airline.  And change will only occur if the public votes with their feet.  Run, don't walk, away from a really sad excuse of a company!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Disappointed,Terrible airline. They did not let us board our small baggages and forced us to check them in because they said the cabines were full. We ended up carrying a lot of our small items and drag them through the airport because we needed them. I also found their staff to be rude and unprofessional.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Rude and discriminatory airline,"This airline is absolutely disgusting. We missed our flights because the kiosk downstairs were not working, the lines were long to see a ticket agen. They let a caucasian family of 4 pass through but did not let my travel partner pass through when we were running late for the flight because we were minorities. Their customer service was rude and blamed us for missing the flights with not taking any responsibility whatsoever. I will never take American Airlines ever again."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,The worst experience I have had for airlines in years.,"At a time when the Covid situation is horrible, this was by far my worst experiemce yet. Granted last min the captain got us safely to and from. The whole time I was praying that nothing happens. There was an engine issue to begin with first, and then they delayed and delayed for the next day, and then it was a weather issue? Granted they did provide hotel service for their customers bc of this delay, there was one flight attendee who was quite rude the entire time to a couple of folks. There were people who missed their connections and I was just lucky bc I live in Dallas. And the funniest thing was them landing us to a domestic gate in Houston delaying it even more and then you couldn't even get out bc it was a domestic gate. The dumbest way to handle a situation. At least provide people with meals in the flight if u are gonna delay it? Instead they have everyone f@$€king  biscuits? Even an airlines from a third world country was better than that experience. It should be called third world airlines, not American airlines."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst experience with an airline,"After having an amazing vacation in the US Virgin Islands me and my boyfriend had the worst experience with American Airlines ever. First, we were told to be at the airport 3 hours early to insure we would make our flight and that was ok. When time to board our flight the plane had maintenance issues so everyone on that flight had to be rebooked on a new flight out. The person that I had to deal with the rebook my flight had the worse customer service ever. She was so rude like it was our fault she had to get us on another flight. After about 2 hours we were rebooked on a flight to Miami where we would have our connecting flight to Cleveland. Our flight to Miami was delayed which we questioned if we would then make our connecting flight which we were told we would. After landing in Miami we of course had to run to our next gate which we were told they just closed the gates. So of course we missed our connecting flight. We had been sitting at the airport in the US Virgin Islands since 10am that morning. It was now 7:30pm at night and with nothing to eat since breakfast. We were told to go stand in the rebooking line to see what flight we could get home. Mind you it is several people from the US Virgin Islands that are in this same line because they too missed their connecting flight do to the plane getting there late. After about an hour of standing in line we were told there are no more flights going to Cleveland or Akron that night. We would have to connect to Charlotte stay overnight and then fly to Akron in the morning. On top of that we had to be at the gate to board our flight in 20 minutes. They did give us meal vouchers but since but after completing our second rebook we had to run to our gate before that plane left us. We got to Charlotte at 11:30pm and now all the restaurants was closed in the airport so our meal vouchers was useless. We then had to go stand in the customer service line to get a voucher for the hotel. At that airport another plane was delayed and people were standing in the customer service line trying to get a new flight and a hotel for the night. At this time I’m over it. I’m a diabetic and had nothing to get since 10:30am and I could feel my sugar getting low. There was no vending machines open for me to get anything to put some type of sugar in my body and my bag had been checked and I could not get that back. But, the bag situation is a whole different problem. After about an hour of standing in line I ask the representative if there was any orange juice, pop or candy they had to be told nothing was open and they had nothing in the back. Ok whatever. After the rep was on the phone trying to figure out why our flight we were on so many flights because she couldn’t just take our word for it we finally was able to get our hotel voucher. We made it to our hotel at 1:00am. Luckily we were able to find a food place to deliver to the hotel which we had to find ourselves because no one knew of anything was open and would deliver. Also we no bags since we checked everything so we had nothing to wear to bed but at that time we just did not care. The representative that gave us our hotel said that our bags would be redirected to Akron airport and would arrive their with us in the morning.  We ate and got to sleep about 3am and and had to get back up to catch the shuttle at 8am. Our flight back to Akron departed on time and even got us there 25 minutes early. If only our flight to Miami could have been that way we would not have to go through this. And our bags did make it to the airport thank goodness. We both missed another day of work. After this experience I wish I could give no stars and would never tell anyone to fly American Airlines. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone so that’s why I had to share my experience."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Outstanding  flight crew,"I recently flew round trip from DFW to Newark, NJ I was traveling for a very dear friend’s  funeral and hadn’t flown for a while . The return trip from NJ to TX was very eventful due to the airport closure in Dallas, because of storms and our flight diverted to  Oklahoma. The entire crew was wonderful. There was a flight attendant who stood out as exceptional, his name was Stoney. He was the most attentive, professional and personable flight attendants I’ve ever had the pleasure to fly with. I so appreciate him and his genuine warmth in how he provided customer service to a lot of tired and hungry passengers. The entire crew kept everyone in an upbeat mood, including our pilot. I really appreciated everything they did for us including finding  every  snack they could get their hands on to provide for us. I very much appreciate y’all getting me home safely after a very difficult week. Thank you so much!Sincerely,Sue D"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Not a problem solver with simple solutions,I had 2 small bags when pulled out of line to board the lady grabbed my luggage and said  I had to check in my big bag. I then said very politely that I can also just pack this small bag and double my other bag she said no until another lady told me I could do that. I agreed and told her that I was told this but she was very aggressive with her tone till the other lady said it was ok. I did tell her that I apologize for holding the line up and then she became a little better. She could have gone about things a little better instead of grabbing my luggage and making more of an issue about a small bag going into another. I won’t be traveling again with American because they weren’t very professional and germs are a thing so she shouldn’t have touched my property like that.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible Customer Service,"My sister was flying with American Airlines to Wichita, KS and had a connecting flight into Chicago. Her flight out of Michigan was delayed by about 45 minutes. She originally had an hour between connecting flights. She was physically at O'Hare at 2:58 at gate G14A. Her connecting flight was supposed to leave at 3:10 from gate G18. She ran to the gate only to be told that they wouldn't let her on the flight because she was 2 minutes after the gate closed, the plane was still at the gate. Also, her connecting flight actually ended up leaving 4 minutes early.I have never been on an airline that would not hold the flight for a few minutes to wait for connecting passengers. I understand 15 minutes, 30, an hour. But this was literally seconds of a difference - WITH THE CONNECTING FLIGHT LEAVING EARLY.Disgusting customer service overall and not a single person willing to help."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Total sh*t show,"This company has twice now pushed me around and blew me off. Last night we sat on a plane for 10 hours. The trip was less than 3. Then when we finally got to the airport in Dallas, my flight was canceled until 13 hours later. That’s not all. After waiting 12 hours it was cancelled again. So they put me on a standby flight, which I was turned away from. The people at the gate are condescending and rude with absolutely no accountability. I’ve been waiting in the airport for 15 hours now. I’m certain I’ll be turned away from the next flight and my 5:20 flight that’s supposed to be guaranteed will canceled also. This company has now costed me $900 in lost wages and they couldn’t care less. Do not fly with these scammers."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,AA avoided all responsibility and excelled at horrific customer service,"After a 3.5 hour layover at DFW I boarded the plane at 4:30pm for Sacramento. We sat on the plane at the gate for over an hour due to a ""paperwork issue"" involving a sensor on a tear cabin door. Finally we were allowed to deboard the plane to await further details.  At 7pm the screen at the gate says flight cancelled. About 10 minutes later it begins to rain. We are told to go to another gate about 16 gates down. When we arrive there is a very long line of people and 3 agents. After waiting in line for an hour and watching people cut the line and one of the three agents assisting customers while stuffing his face with french fries, I finally arrive to the unprofessional that calls me forward. He said I'm booked for the flight leaving 2 days later. I asked him to cancel the flight as I would be flying delta that next morning. I asked about a hotel for the night and was told NO due to WEATHER they were not at fault. I then explained that had we not had mechanical and paperwork issues we would have left  before any weather issues. For that I was told ""well we dont really know that do we"" and ""why are you wasting our time arguing about it theres nothing you can do about it"".I am in complete awe of what AA has turned into and will avoid flying them at all costs."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Made me Late for a Job Orientation and Potentially Lose my Opportunity,"American Airlines did nothing but tell me lies and reissue my ticket for the next day even after I informed them that I had a job orientation at 7:30AM. Bought flight insurance but it was worthless due to it being third party. I was not accommodated with a hotel room and no food or drink was offered on the main cabin of the flight. Everything was closed when I arrived so there was nothing to eat or drink. I couldn’t sleep and had to stay up all night at the airport to watch over my stuff. Internet was 20 dollars instead of the 10 advertised. Disgusting corporation who does not care about its customers. At all. (On top of that, my “reimbursed flight” did not have an economy seat, so I was forced to upgrade! Wow! I’m *so* glad this company had my back when I was stranded and honored the insurance I bought—not."

Date of travel: May 2021,10,Flight Change w/o notification,"We had booked a 10:46 am departure from Newark.  American cancelled the flight and rebooked us on a 5:30 am flight.  They did not notify us of this change which was made in March.  We got an email from AA touting lower fares for the up coming summer months.  We called Expedia, since we booked the original flights from them, and were then informed of the change to 5:30 am.  They had not notified us of this change prior to this call.  The first call to them I was given the option of a call back rather than waiting on hold.  2.5 hours later they called (caller id listed the as Spam? Travel.  The operator on the line researched it and was trying to get us on a 10:30 am flight.  She mentioned that she had our number to call us back in case we were disconnected.  Subsequently we got disconnected.  No call back.  I called them and proceeded to wait on hold for over an hour with no offer of a call back.  The second person we spoke to told us our only options were to keep the 5:30 flight, or change to a later flight, but at a significantly higher fare.  We were not interested in either solution an asked to speak to a supervisor.  After some time she came back to us and stated that the supervisor would call us back in 2 hours.  3 hours later no call back.  At this point I see no benefit for using Expedia.  I also am not pleased with American who switched our flights and then proceeded to lose some of our seat assignments as well as the lack of notification."

It could have been MUCH worse for me, thank God for the other airline!  I received nothing...not even a ""sorry for the inconvenience"".  They are all about the ""Benjamins"" and not customer service!  I'm through with American Airlines!  They could have cost me....."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Reservations Agent Rude, Condascending, and Hung Up On Me","After waiting 3 hours for a call-back from Reservations so that I could make a payment from an on-line reservation because for some reason they would not take an on-line payment, I ask the agent to send me an e-mail confirming I made payment - he says no can do.  I then ask if he can at least read my card number back to me so that I know we did not have a miscommunication, he says no can do because I will get the same service everyone else gets, and then he HANGS UP on me.  I guess we all get HORRIBLE service from them."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible Airlines,"They just left me at the airport where I transit and waited for more than 2 hours. The airlines knew I was there and already checked in. They can call my number but NO!!! they purposely LEFT ME AT THE AIRPORT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!!!! Never again fly American Airlines. In the cabin they didn’t even put the AC on, with mask and people sitting next to your face, I felt nauseated the whole flight. I rather fly Spirit if there is no other option."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,DISSATISFIED and UNACCEPTABLE SERVICE,"The American Airlines service at DFW was extremely inappropriate and unacceptable. I was not expecting them to treat my mother as God AWFUL as they did. Not one, but two American Airline service attendants walked away from her, basically told her “tough luck, oh well” they were unable to help her because they’re shift JUST ended and they DID NOT EVEN GUIDE OR POINT HER TO SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP HER. Absolutely unacceptable  service and attendance. My mother did not deserve the treatment she received. She also paid for a specific seat and for a checked bag on flight 2881 on May 9, 2021 and yet she was not only unable to receive the seat she paid for but also unable to board the flight because they wouldn’t check her bag that she also paid to have checked. While flights can be reworked what i find so detestable is the absolutely unacceptable treatment the attendants showed her. Absolutely terrible."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,AMERICAN AIRLINES,Worst Airlines I have ever flown with.. 3 DELAYS!!!! Missed my ride and other appointments. Never ever will I use American Airlines again.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Never use American Airlines,I will never use this airline or airport again if at all possible. They made us sit on the runway for over 30 minutes after we landed and we made it to our adjoining flight 5 minutes before take off and they would not let us board causing us to sit in the airport for over 2 hours and having to change our transportation arrangements. Customer service did not care that we were inconvenienced and did not offer to try and let us board the plane that was still sitting there when we arrived. Highly disappointed.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,I’ll never fly American again.,"My wife and I booked a trip from Jacksonville to Cancun. Leaving Jax, we sat on the plane for almost an hour while they fixed a maintenance issue. Finally get to Miami for our connecting flight, boarded the plane, and after an hour, had to deplane due to an irreparable maintenance issue on that plane. Delayed for 2 more hours, finally ready to board our new plane, now that one is delayed another 45 mins. UNBELIEVABLE. I’ve worked in aviation, I know it can be unpredictable but this is unacceptable. Horrible way to start a vacation. I will never fly American again. Ever."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,"Average Flight, Multiple Gate Changes, Long Trip to Remote Terminal","Arrived at LAX and found many of the check in kiosks  were broken . After using the Kiosk and its confusing menus ( Other airlines much better ), we received a boarding pass only and no bag tag. This required we go back again to the kiosk and redo the process to get the bag tags. Once checked in, we had to leave that terminal and then walk to Terminal 5. After a very long walk through Terminal 5, we had to get on a bus to get to the remote gate. Once at the gate , the gate was changed and then changed a second time in under 20 minutes. Onboard the flight, no snacks or drinks were provided. Only water was available on request. They did have power chargers in our seats  and every row was 2x2 arrangement on this small plane. There was some turbulence in air and landing was very rough ."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,I guess they don’t need to provide ANY customer service,"I am writing this while I am sitting in the airport waiting for my 2 nd chance on stand by.   I missed my 3:00 flight although I was at the airport in what should have been plenty of time. However when I went through security my bag got designated to the side of bags they were checking... with about a dozen bags piled up in front of it. I waited while they went through all the bags and argued with a customer in front of me, until they finally got to mine and re xrayed it to see that nothing was wrong. But by time I got out of there I had missed them closing the doors to my flight by one minute. I was told that the next flight was full but they would put me on standby. So while I waited for 2 hours I saw a flight attendant come up and say that she wanted to get on that flight as a passenger (which she did) and a gentleman come up and say he was trying to get on that flight. They gave him standby on the 5:00 and a confirmed seat on the 8;00. I am sitting here on standby for the 8:00 and it is the last flight out tonight and they said the day tomorrow doesn’t look good. But no one is interested in being helpful in any way. This is a MUCH different experience than what I’ve had with other airlines."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Never hear great things and experience sucked,I’ve never heard anything good about American Airlines but I figured I would give it a try. This will be the one and only try I will not be using them again. What a ridiculous airlines. Any other airlines is better.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Rude staff,"AA is my least favorite airline and for good reason.  The fleet is old and small.  Refreshments are no longer offered on flights.  The in-flight internet service rarely works and the staff can be a bit rude.  I have asked my travel agency to avoid AA whenever possible.  Frankly, I see AA as an airline in steep decline."

Date of travel: March 2021,30,Pretty standard AA flight with a frustrating arrival/baggage claim experience,"American Airlines Flight 1045SFO-PHL11:28 am-7:55 pm Airbus A321S My wife and I recently took a flight to return home to Philadelphia from San Francisco, and it was generally fine. We were glad to have a lot of space in exit row seats that we had purchased, but a rude/pushy flight attendant and a frustrating arrival process at PHL ended things on a somewhat sour note.When we arrived at the new Harvey Milk Terminal at San Francisco Airport to check our bags, I was surprised at how crowded the American Airlines check-in area was, and that it wasn’t particularly well designed for being in a brand new, spacious terminal. There were a good number of the self-service kiosks to check-in, and we were able to get one without waiting, but once you finished printing and self-tagging your bags, the setup was awkward. The way things are set-up, it appears that you should proceed directly with your bag to one of the employees just beyond the kiosks who will check your ID and drop your bag onto the conveyer belt (a common setup at other airports). If this isn’t how it works, there should be a clearly marked line to join for dropping off bags. However, when we (just like a lot of others before us) walked up to the desk thinking we were next to drop our bags, we were informed that we had to instead backtrack to a long makeshift bag drop line snaking across the check-in area that we hadn’t seen off to the side. It didn’t take all that long to get through this line, but the current setup isn’t good for handling the number of people there and it isn’t well organized. The staff at the check-in area was pleasant though, so that was a positive.Security was pretty busy that morning, but the wait for the PreCheck line was relatively quick-moving. The security checkpoint at this new terminal at SFO is set up in a way that should help move people through quickly, with bins available so that multiple people can load their things at once. However, this also makes it a bit confusing once you get through security, since several people’s bins get mixed together. A little more searching for your things is required than the usual setup where only one person is loading their items onto the conveyor belt at a time.As we had seen when we arrived at SFO a few days prior, the Harvey Milk Terminal is very nice. It’s brand new and well designed. There is much more ample seating by each gate than in the average terminal, and the overall vibe is more relaxing and comfortable than you normally see. The gate still got crowded when boarding began, but it was a bit more spacious than usual. Boarding began a few minutes early, and definitely was not the most organized boarding process. The gate agents didn’t do a good job of only boarding one group at a time or giving any breathing room between groups so that things don’t get so clogged at the gate. The machine to scan boarding passes also wasn’t working correctly at the time, so virtually everyone had to scan their boarding pass multiple times before it would register, which wasted time.After having chosen seats poorly on this same type of aircraft on our flight to San Francisco, we made sure to get better seats this time, and paid for Main Cabin Extra seats in the exit row toward the back of the aircraft. We loved that we were able to get one of the only rows on the plane that contained two seats rather than three, and we had a ton of legroom in front of us, which was a great benefit on a transcontinental flight. The only negatives of these seats were that there weren’t any normal windows to look out of (just a tiny window on the exit door that was only open during takeoff and landing), and that the seats were directly behind the mid-cabin bathroom. Being near the bathroom is convenient, but it also means that people waiting for the bathroom come into your space, and a lot of people on this flight didn’t bother to close the bathroom door after using the bathroom, which was frustrating.It was nice that our seats had a variety of amenities, including individual TVs and outlets for charging devices. Wifi was also available on the flight, with several items offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream, all in addition to what was loaded on the TVs.  We’re much more used to the legacy-US Airways A321 that is bare bones, so it is always nice to be on one of the legacy-AA ones that are better equipped.Boarding was also a bit of a mess, since it was a completely full flight where overhead bin space was at a premium. It didn’t help that a couple rows behind us, a couple of older passengers took seats that weren’t theirs and were refusing to get up and move to their correct seats. When the flight attendants tried to mediate the issue, the couple tried to act as if they couldn’t find their boarding passes to locate their correct seats, and basically just wanted the other people assigned to those seats to deal with it. However, the others had paid for those seats, and specifically paid for an aisle seat that they wanted to still have. It took quite a while trying to resolve this, and it wasn’t resolved by the time the aircraft was ready to push back, so the flight attendants vowed to fix it as soon as we were airborne. The couple who took the wrong seats ultimately had to move, rightfully so.The mix of flight attendants on this flight was a little odd. There was one who sat right near us for takeoff and landing, and she was younger. She seemed to generally just be nice and sweet, wanting to make people happy and have a good flight. However, one of the others, who was clearly a more senior flight attendant, was really pushy and a bit rude throughout the flight. During boarding, she was constantly yelling at people and making rude announcements about boarding and stowing carry-on bags, in a way that was beyond the norm. She was also just loud about the fact that she wanted to make sure we left the gate early so she could get to Philadelphia early and make it onto another flight she was trying to catch. I totally understand that desire, and I definitely wanted to get to PHL as soon as possible too, but yelling at passengers for this reason is odd. She was also just generally rude during drink service and another time bothered me in the middle of watching something on my iPad to find out why I was using my own device to watch TV, instead of using the personal TV on the plane. It was an odd thing to make me pull out my headphones to ask. She was just way too pushy.Shortly into the flight, the flight attendants came around to provide drink service and Biscoff cookies. Full drink service was offered, with the exception of alcohol, which was not available in economy. The flight attendants did come around one or two more times after that to offer just water if anyone wanted it, which was nice.There was bad weather in Philadelphia that night, so the pilot told us as we approached PHL that we were going to have to go into a holding pattern to wait for some thunderstorms to pass. Luckily, we only ended up in that holding pattern for about 15 minutes before being released to complete our final approach, and I appreciated that the pilot continued to give us updates throughout that process. We ultimately still arrived at the gate in Philadelphia 10 minutes early, even with the extra time holding.Arrival was a bit frustrating, starting with the fact that we arrived at Gate A24, at the absolutely farthest possible end of Terminal A-West (typically used for international flights in the past). That gate is just a really far walk from anywhere else in the airport, and both the flight attendant announcement on the plane and the AA app said that baggage claim would be in Terminal A at Carousel 2. Once we finally had made our way to an exit from Terminal A, which was a good walk, the exit was closed with a sign saying to go to Terminal B to exit. After walking even further to Terminal B, we were finally able to exit the airport, which took us to the Terminal B/C baggage claim. It was a good 20-25 minute walk from our gate to baggage claim, even at a brisk pace. We could not have arrived at a less convenient gate, which seemed like poor planning because the airport was not at capacity that night.Once we got to the Terminal B/C baggage claim, we realized that the previously specified baggage claim information didn’t make sense. There was no carousel 2 at this baggage claim, since the carousels were all marked with letters. Our flight was also not listed on any of the arrival TV monitors, so we couldn’t check to see if the baggage carousel had been changed. Most people from our flight just started waiting by the second carousel (assuming that would be equivalent to #2), but only bags for other flights were coming out after a good bit of time had passed. Looking at the app, I saw that the baggage tracking feature showed that our bags were on the carousel, we just had to figure out where.I thought maybe we actually had to go outside and walk to the Terminal A baggage claim that was originally specified for our flight. After trekking over to Terminal A outside in the rain, we found that Terminal A baggage claim was totally closed with the building locked and dark, so that was definitely not correct. We walked back over to Terminal B/C, and I was about to go to the baggage office to find out what was going on, when I happened to see our bags already on one of the other carousels. As we finally walked out with our bags, I finally heard them make an announcement that bags for the flight from San Francisco had been moved to a new carousel, but it was very frustrating that this had not been addressed much sooner, either by providing correct information on the app, the monitors in the airport, or earlier announcements. We wasted a ton of time just trying to find our luggage after a long flight, and I blame that on poor communication and organization by AA.Overall, this flight from San Francisco to Philadelphia was fine, given that we had great exit row seats, and we arrived on time. However, rude service from one flight attendant in particular and a hugely frustrating arrival at PHL made the experience more negative than it needed to be."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,American Airlines,Woww !!! This company don’t care about customers at all. Wait 1h to reach a customer service representative. I canceled the flight 4 days before the flight due to my wife test positive for COVID. They didn’t return my money. I don’t think this is the right way to treat people and customer. No the right way to make money. Please don’t flight with them. This should be illegal!!!
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Outraged,"First I would like to say that I booked a flight and the plane was delayed. We boarded the plane and sat on the runway for over an hour before they announced that the flight had been cancelled due to weather. We didn’t get another flight out until the next evening at 5pm. We was traveling to Florida for our son’s wedding but with the cancelled flight it caused us to miss the wedding. We had to find a hotel for the night and AA wouldn’t even accommodate us for that, After we finally got our flight on that Saturday evening, when we got our luggage it was totally destroyed. I have contacted AA and sent pictures of my luggage and the representative says she will send me a letter to drop off my luggage so they can clean it. They are not taking in consideration that I live 140 miles from the nearest airport. I will not never fly with AA ever again. They do not consider their customers"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Terrible Experience,"This was hands down the worst experience I’ve ever had on a flight! First, they weren’t even attempting to socially distance people. We were crammed in like sardines despite a pandemic going on. When I asked one flight attendant if the plane had been sanitized he chuckled and said “we aren’t doing that anymore.” This was a desperation flight because the Delta flight I was on was diverted here due to a suspicious package at the airport we were supposed to land at. All the way to Hawaii and back on Delta and they were taking great precautions to keep the spread of Covid-19 down and just be clean. They had sanitized every flight and were keeping people somewhat apart. So the American Airlines was a shock right off the bat.Then Cynthia the flight attendant was checking through people’s seatbelts and tray tables, etc. before take off. I was sitting in an exit row and I had a small plastic bag with a turkey sandwich I planned to eat. Instead of just telling me to move it she chose to BERATE me and scream at me for about 5 minutes in front of the whole plane about how I was putting everyone’s life in danger by blocking the exit if the plane went down (again I was about to eat the sandwich.) She screamed at me about her family wanting her to come home safe and if there was a crash I would endanger her and all the other passengers (again it was a turkey sandwich.) She screamed at me not to get attitude with her (I didn’t say one thing to her-literally not one word) because we would do things her way or no way. After this verbal assault that left me and several of the passengers around me (as they would tell me later) very disturbed she walks away. THEN she comes back and screams at me again that her name was Cynthia and I could complain about her if I wanted and her supervisor would back her up because it is a safety issue. Again, a turkey sandwich here. It was awful! I literally went into a panic attack because being screamed at and humiliated like that triggered me. The final insult was when she came around with her cart she didn’t even offer me anything. The people next to me were served but when I asked for some water she completely ignored me. I have no idea what was going on with her and neither did some of the other passengers. Three of them gave me their contact information if I need a verification of the incident and one said he videoed it but I told him I didn’t need it. After that flight I sent a complaint to AA and I got a quick response with a half hearted apology, like it was a minor issue. I don’t know if that is because they didn’t care or what but the Tracy the customer service person was obviously not concerned at all. She just said something about employee personnel files were confidential but I never asked to see anyone’s personnel file. I asked to be contacted on a follow up. The response was ridiculous.Do yourself a favor and fly ANY other airline when booking a trip. AA used to be a great airline but the conditions of the plane, no concern for stopping the spread of Covid-19, and the behavior of these employees tell a much different story now. Needless to say I am done with AA."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Delayed flight,"Bad customer service, bad treatment to clients while asking questions after unboarded the plane with no explanation of what to do. Supervisor rolled eyes constantly while being asked questions. This is a big airline, cant you select better your staff?

Date of travel: May 2021,20,Changed both my itineraries to much worse schedules,"A month after I reserved my tickets, AA emailed me updated itineraries that are significantly worse. I now have a flight leaving at 6:45am (instead of 9:45 as scheduled) and a 5-hour layover in Chicago. No communication other than the changes. No way to adjust the times. I'm just stuck flying on whatever planes they assign me, apparently?"
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Excellent Flights During The Early Stages Of The Pandemic,"Sorry for the delay in posting this review.  A crashed hard drive, misplaced travel notes and life got in the way.  We flew from Philadelphia to Chicago O'Hare TO Bozeman on July 28, 2020 and back again on August 3, 2020.   Checking in was quick and efficient.  Everything at the gates allowed for social distancing.  The boarding process was done with safety in mind.  The flights were smooth and on time.  Cabin service was minimal, but that was to be expected.  Onboard staff was friendly.  Really considering where things were in July / August of 2020 this was well done by American.  We felt safe as we could and there were no issues.  Well done."

Date of travel: May 2021,40,WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE IN PUNTA CANA,"We left an item in our transportation service that brought us from the resort to the airport.  We had no phone service and were not able to call the company.  We asked the representative at the American Airlines desk if she could ask her supervisor about whether we could borrow a phone to call the transport company.  She was given permission and we were able to call and reach the company, leading to the return of the item.  This turned what could have been a really bad day into a much better day.I will say that we had to stand in line an hour before we reached the desk to receive our tickets.  I'm not sure why it took so long as almost all of the windows were open to process tickets.  However, we had arrived at the airport three hours prior to our flight so we had plenty of time and this didn't affect our trip.  I would encourage anyone traveling from Punta Cana to be there three hours before your scheduled flight.  If you have time to kill after checking in, go eat, buy rum, or read a book."

Trying to rebook for this august and one of the people traveling with me last year can’t come with us this year. After waiting well over 2 hours to speak to anyone, I was trying to transfer a ticket to another name even offered to pay but nope they won’t do it. Really wtf you can’t do that, it’s transferring to a different name! I paid for the dam ticket and I’d pay for the change! Awful now I’m out that ticket and have to rebuy a new ticket! Should be so easy to and considering the pandemic you’d think they’d be more accommodating and transfer it for me! Not too mention all the flights they offer with credits is at least $154 more we have to pay per ticket, what a joke!!! Will never fly again with American Airlines!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible,Every time I’ve flown american they are terrible. The inflight service even pre covid is terrible.

I cannot believe they did this.,"On my way to the airport to catch my flight at 11:57AM I was emailed that my connecting flight was rebooked and that I wouldn't make it. This was pushed back 3 hours!!!! I then believed them.  3 pm departure.  Another delay and then, another!  It is now estimated 645 pm departure....getting me to my destination by practically midnight .. My family is so upset about missing dinner plans and we meticulously planned the entire week/week end.  And now american airlines is seriously tearing apart and ruining what was already a short vacation.  I used to travel so much for work with so many different airlines.  I have never had a trip derailed like this in my entire life.  And for sure have never been continuously misled like this.  Such a disappoinment.  So sad.American airlines sucks.  Terrible."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Racist gate attendants in Charlotte,"Charged me a $30 bag fee at the gate on the 4th leg of flights (after taking 3 previous flights) with EXACT same bag with NO PROBLEM.Almost lost it arguing with the lady at the gate in Charlotte airport, which appeared to have been a racial thing as I saw multiple other people with the same size bags have NO issues with their carry ons. Both gate attendants were different races than I was and had an INSTANT attitude with me when I tried to question/inform them that I had just taken another American Airlines flight with the same bag and had no pushback. I have a flight credit with American Airlines that I’m considering letting go to waste rather than fly with them again."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Garbage flight service,Rude as f**k Everyone. Wearing a buff and they said I couldn’t wear that. So I removed my face covering to put on another face covering. Make no since. I will never flight with this dog s**t airline again.
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Bad information  - Big expense,"My son and daughter-in-law moved to Costa Rica this past weekend and flew out on AA. They wanted to take their emotional support animal, Ruby, with them and were instructed by AA on the steps to be taken. They were told that the she could be checked as baggage and the costs. AA also explained that the Ruby would have to fly out of somewhere below 85 degrees with a direct flight. We live in Arkansas and there was not a direct flight and the temperatures were in the low 80's in Dallas so we drove 780 miles to Charlotte, NC in order for them to fly the Ruby with them. When they checked in, they were informed that the she could not go!! They said they had stopped transporting animals as luggage 2 years ago!!!! This was a HUGE error by the airlines. Not only were we out a lot of money for the trip, but my son and his wife had to board a plane in tears because they had to leave their precious Ruby behind. A manager at the airport could see all the documentation where my son had been told all of the details about what to do yet none of that mattered. Now we have to make arrangements to have Ruby flown as cargo which means another trip somewhere. It also means we have to have all of the paperwork redone since the dates of the flight have all been changed. This is TOTALLY unacceptable!! It's not like they were only going for a visit, they moved their entire life to another country and wanted their dog, a registered service animal, with them."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible Customer Service,American changed my flight without my consent. I waited over 2 hours to speak to a representative who would Not fix the situation after I was completely inconvenienced. They put me on a JetBlue flight and I lost my seat assignments. They refused to put me on a flight that actually cost the airline less money!! Now is not the time to loose customers American!!!!!!
Date of travel: May 2021,20,American really dropped the ball,"After a gate switch and 40 minute delay in Chicago, the pilots made up the loss, and we only arrived 5 minutes late in Cincinnati. But then that was blown by being forced to sit 50 feet away from our gate, for 40 minutes, because they didn't have a ground crew to direct us to the ramp? It's pretty bad when the pilot keeps apologizing for the airline. Just shoddy performance, and the airlines wants billions in bailouts again?"
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Boarding Miscues,"I've been flying a very long time and it seems that the airlines are getting worse and worse. I'm the person that usually puts headphones in to drown out the absurd comments made by people boarding the plane but now American Airlines has stated that for boarding priorities 7, 8, & 9, we are required to check our bags?There is a reason that I travel light. It's so I don't have to check a bag, and now I'm being forced to check a bag?I still don't understand why airlines don't load from the back of the plane first, especially during a COVID environment. Less contact for people moving through the plane, overhead storage would be much easier to control as well.Sure, having First Class, Economy Plus, elderly, children and military load first should still be a thing, but boarding everywhere else from the front forward is about as efficient as a pickup towing a semi trailer. Makes no sense.The airline itself is mediocre at best and why would I want to pay extra money for an ""upgraded experience"" if everyone from Comfort Plus back is getting the same treat?"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Satisfaction,"I can't believe it how this company works,  I was there for business but I decided to bring my all family with mi and they canceled the flight in the last minute and they don't support anything with hotel or transportation they just don't care about customers satisfaction. The person who help us first she tells me ask for the manager about the inconvenient and she was sure they gonna help us but the guy it was in Boston he just say he can't help with anything with no taking time to check another options... we had to spend the all night in the aeroport with my cousin pregnant in the uncomfortable chairs..Like I say they don't care customers."
Date of travel: March 2021,40,Allianz trip insurance NOT,We had a delay of two days which meant losing 2 nights of  my reservation in Roatan and booking 2 airport hotels.  My email went down and I did not have the COVID test results printed out so we got booted out of Roatan back to the states. AA did rebook us from Dallas to Miami to catch another flight that was sooner than one week out. Allianz did not pay for the extra expense incurred for the hotel stays in Dallas and Miami.  There reasoning for not covering the 2 hotel stays or meals was because of the pandemic COVID-19. I feel like I really wasted a lot of time and a little money trying to collect from Allianz for the unfortunate occurrance!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,BAD customer service for traveling young families,"Never flying American again.  A complete lack of sensitivity to traveling moms with young toddlers and a ""not my problem' approach to customer service.Our plane for a connecting flight in Dallas had been taken out of service for maintenance.  Totally good with that.  NOT good was the lack of communication, rudeness and incompetence of the gate agents in handling the situation.  We were a mom and grandmother traveling with a one-year old and a two-year old.  A total of 5 delays (3 hours) and 3 gate changes later - each  time dragging our toddlers and carry-on bags to a separate terminal via skylink - we ended up back at the ORIGINAL gate to board.  After all of that - when we asked if we could board early to get our weary toddlers settled in after the stressful shuffling - we were rudely told ""it's not American's policy to let families board early.""  We discovered later that is NOT true for families with children ages 2 or under.  But the worst is the lack of customer service for my daughter-in-law's solo w/toddlers return flight home.  The day before their flight - we discovered that the 1 year old had an ear infection.  Knowing the flight would likely aggravate and thus cause him to cry making for an unpleasant flight for everyone on board - our daughter attempted to see if she could take the same flight scheduled a day or two later - giving his medicine a chance to work.  She was told that it would cost $500 in additional fees to do so! In other words her helping to assure a better flight experience for other customers by not flying until her child was feeling better would cost her family an extra $500!   They couldn't afford that and so she flew when they were initially scheduled - sick child in tow - back through Dallas - only to learn that they had lost the stroller that was supposed to be there as they were deplaning!!  So, now delayed due to American's incompetence, she had to rush -  with two toddlers - to another terminal with NO assistance from anyone on the ground.  She made it with TWO minutes to spare before the doors to their connecting flight were closing.  Isn't Dallas American's home base?  Seems they can't keep their act together at their own headquarters... NEVER fly American if you have small children - they simply don't seem to care."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,LITERALLY THE FU***** WORST COMPANY!!,"I bought my ticket from American Airlines in May of 2020 for a flight in July 2020, I had to cancel due to getting covid. I called in to cancel and was told my voucher for my flight would be tied to my phone # and would not need anything else. Well I am now trying to book a flight and they say ohh that was incorrect information that we gave you so tuff luck. The lady I spoke to on my 3rd call was so rude. I never raised my voice or got rude due to me working in customer service myself I don’t like being that person. But this crap took me over the edge when she said well your just outta luck LITERALLY said that and hung up on me!!!! I will never use them again and will never suggest them for anyone to fly with."

Date of travel: April 2021,30,Enforcement of Wearing - that is not our Job - we check seatbelts,Although the flight attendants announced that mask were required except when eating.  I was sitting in the aisle seat in the exit row and both the passenger in the wind seat in my row and on the aisle seat next to me literally removed mask entirely while not eating or dropped it below their noses.   The flight attendant repeatedly walked by these passengers and said nothing -other than checking the seat belts.  I eventually asked the passengers to put on their face masks - which they reluctantly did.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Passenger,Absolutely disregard for human integrity.  How can you possibly keep people on hold for an hour.... Shame on you!  First you cancel my flight and then don’t answer the phone for me to
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst airline around ...,"Horribly rude employees, constant delayed flights, ghetto airplanes. Never flying with this airline again. Flying private from now on what a circus my experience with this airline was. Don't waste ur money or ur energy! This airline blows."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Bait and Switch - They sell good flight times and then change them.,"I booked in advance for good tickets and they changed.  I called to inquire about changing times as I now would miss my connection for group tour and returning would have to get up at 2:30 am.  They changed my arrival and didn't have good return.  I asked if I could check with my group and then call to change other flight.  I was told yes, however, when I called back they wanted $ 600.  I'll never fly American again.  This bait and switch has happened to my daughter as well."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,HORRIBLE SERVICE,"This was my first and last time i will be flying with this airline. An employee from American Airlines robbed from inside my suitcase after by bag was checked in. When I tried to report this theft, the airline did not took action nor took responsibility for their employees action. Even when I tried to report this, their costumer service was TERRIBLE. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AIRLINE EVER."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Terrible Customer Relations,"I was awaiting my connecting flight from DFW to FWA when I received a notification through the AA app that my ""...seat change request change has been approved"". The problem was that I did not request a change. This was received approximately 90 minutes prior to boarding. I located 2 gate attendants and asked why my seat was changed. They 1st thought it was an equipment change, but verified that was not the reason, and could not find out the real reason. My seat was changed from a window to an aisle, and 1 row forward. They were able to find another window seat for me but it was in front of the exit row and did not recline, making for an uncomfortable flight.I emailed a complaint to Customer Relations at AA after I returned home, asking who changed my seat, why, and why did they not contact me immediately to secure a different window seat. All I have gotten so far is a ""run around"" without answering the questions, except to say that ""...there wasn't enough time to contact me"" and also that ""...this flight information has been closed which prevents them from obtaining any data"".However, what really annoyed me is I was told that my reserved window seat was not guaranteed because it was ""included in the base fare, not individually purchased"". In other words, because I did not upgrade from the Base fare to Business or First Class, my seat was subject to any change the airline wanted to make without my approval.If you have an alternative to American Airlines on your trip, I advise you to use it."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Will not be flying AA again,I typically fly delta and will not be flying America. Airlines again. Both my flight in and flight out had last minute gate changes causing me to miss both flights. They managed to get me on a later flight out thankfully but this has been the most stressful flying experience ever.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Get your running shoes on.,"United changed me to American.  The first leg had me running from one terminal to another to catch my flight.  When I showed my boarding pass, it was exchanged for another one with a different seat. After I got in my seat, a stewardess came and told me I was in the wrong seat.  I showed her my ticket and she agreed that I was in the correct seat.  A few moments later, I was moved to my original seat.  this flight had no snacks, no beverage, no in-flight entertainment and a full plane.Upon arriving in Charlotte, there was no one available to provide any information as to where the connecting flight was.  After locating a departure screen, I discovered that my next flight was at the complete other end of the American concourse.Again, a delay and  then no food, beverage, in-flight entertainment in small seats on a full flight.Even with all the headache over ""canceled"" tickets, United is a better choice than American."
Date of travel: March 2021,20,"Disappointing seats, but otherwise fine","American Airlines Flight 2918MIA-SFO9:25 am-12:54 pm Airbus A321S My wife and I recently took a morning flight from Miami to San Francisco, and although the flight itself was objectively fine, we were very disappointed with our seats. Since we saw that the flight looked very full, we purchased Main Cabin Extra seats to have extra legroom for the 6.5-hour flight. However, we don’t believe the seats we paid for actually had any extra legroom, which led to a cramped and frustrating experience.Miami Airport was very busy on the morning that we departed, and we were surprised at how vast the AA check-in area is at that airport. There are a lot of different check-in lines and banks of self-service kiosks for American Airlines flights at MIA, so if you enter where the line is particularly long, I would keep walking to look for another area that’s less busy. By walking a bit further down past the first few doors into the building where everyone seems to get dropped off, we were able to find empty kiosks to check and tag our luggage without a wait. After doing the self-tagging, we just had to wait a minute or two to drop it off at the bag drop area.Security was also quite busy that morning, and even though we were able to use the PreCheck line, the line was pretty long, spilling out into the ticketing area. The wait wasn’t as long as it appeared, and we made it through security and to our gate at the far end of the terminal (D48) using the Skytrain with about 10 minutes before boarding, after having arrived at the airport about 80 minutes before the flight. As we knew, the flight to San Francisco was completely full, and boarding began a couple minutes early. I didn’t like that boarding wasn’t done in the most organized fashion. Boarding always seems to proceed best when the gate agents call one group at a time and don’t call the next group until the previous one has fully boarded, especially during the pandemic when there is supposed to be a goal of social distancing. However, the gate agents started calling the boarding groups in pretty rapid succession, which led to lots of crowding and confusion at the gate. When we were on the plane settled into our seats, I was immediately struck at how tight the space seemed to be, considering that we had paid $99 per person to upgrade to Main Cabin Extra seats that were marked as being in the exit row with extra legroom. This was Row 12 on the legacy American A321S, which is a row of three seats, where the aisle and middle seat have another seat directly in front, but the window seat has no seat in front of it, allowing for access to the exit door and tons of legroom. We were in the less desirable aisle and middle seats, which simply did not feel like they had extra space at all as compared to when we sit in standard economy. We looked over at a non-exit row Main Cabin Extra row across from us, and it was obvious that row had significantly more legroom than our seats. I’m pretty positive that our seats just had standard legroom, but were sold as Main Cabin Extra because they were technically in the exit row along with the spacious window seat. Cramped legroom aside, it was nice that our seats had a variety of amenities, including seatback TVs and outlets for charging devices. Wifi was also available on the flight, with several items offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream, all in addition to what was loaded on the seatback TVs.  We’re much more used to the legacy-US Airways A321 that is bare bones, so it is always nice to be on one of the legacy-AA ones that are better equipped.Boarding was also a bit of a mess, since the aircraft ran out of overhead bin space after many passengers had already boarded with their carry-ons. This led to major bottlenecks in the aisles, as well as some really rude passengers screaming at the flight attendants about it and just being generally rude and hard to deal with. I felt bad for the crew, who I thought handled it as well as they could. Once carry-ons were figured out and everyone was finally seated, we left about 10 minutes late, but took off quickly.Shortly into the flight, the flight attendants came around to provide drink service and Biscoff cookies. This was the first flight we’ve been on during the pandemic that included a more normal drink service and choice of beverages in economy (the only things not offered were alcoholic beverages). I believe I read that American’s return to a more normal drink service is only on longer flights like this one thus far. I did think it would have been nice if more drinks or snacks were offered later in the flight, since it was a long one. Even just coming around to offer extra cookies or water as an additional beverage would have been appreciated, but the only service was at the very start of the flight.After a generally uneventful, but not so comfortable flight, we arrived at the gate in San Francisco about 20 minutes early. This was our first time arriving at SFO on an American flight in a while, and we were very impressed by the new Harvey Milk Terminal that AA flights now operate out of. The terminal itself was beautiful, with lots of space and a surprisingly restful feel for an airport. We made our way to baggage claim and were very impressed to see how the new baggage carousels were designed, with bags coming out at multiple spots of the large carousel. Because of this, there’s no one “desirable” spot to stand in to be the first to get your bag, since you don’t know exactly where yours will come out. Checked bags came out quickly and we were on our way.Still frustrated about the seats we had paid for on this flight, I wrote to American the next day to complain about the seats we had paid for. I first reached out to them via DM on Twitter, which I know can help with certain customer service situations, but it wasn’t helpful this time. The responses I got were rude, and basically just said that because we sat in the seats we paid for, they wouldn’t provide any refund or compensation. They were totally missing my point that although we did sit in the seats we paid for, the seats themselves didn’t seem to have the main attribute of Main Cabin Extra, extra legroom. I then reached out to the airline via the contact section of the website, and I got a much better email response that way. I explained that I felt that the seats were mismarked as Main Cabin Extra based on their legroom, and I received an apologetic response saying that we were eligible for a refund of the seat fees if we submitted it on the refund section of the website. I submitted for our refunds and received them a few days later. It was a little unclear if the person responding to my request really understood the issue or if they’d look into it for the future (doubtful), but I was glad to get the refund we were hoping for. I actually would have preferred just having extra legroom on the flight, but getting a refund was a fine outcome after the fact.Overall, this flight from Miami to San Francisco was fine, given that we arrived early and the flight was smooth and uneventful. However, the poor space in the Main Cabin Extra seats we had paid for will make us much more careful when choosing seats in the future. Even if our seats did have extra space relative to standard economy (which I don’t think they did), it was truly so minimal that I would never have voluntarily paid extra for it."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Absolutely DO NOT take this airline!!! I recommend paying a little extra, I regret not doing it myself.","After squeezing thru the isles and having no leg room what so ever. Everyone's boarded and we're all ready to go. We waited over a half hour after our departure time to leave we finally got going, over mid way thru our flight the pilot told us there's a mechanical malfunction and had to go all the way back to Texas to get a new plane..... (30 mind from our destination) We waited over an hour for a new plane to have us all board back into the plane just to tell us they have a leak and they need to diagnose the plane AGAIN and it would be only 15 mins to repair. After an hr± they're still unaware and have no answers. This is the most inconvenienced I've ever been in an airport and they have no intentions of compensation. I will also add the flight attendant was very rude and unprofessional! Needless to say we're still waiting and still know nothing. A 2 hr flight has not even left 3 hours after we boarded and there's not one person who isn't livid on the plane. Multiple people have got off the plane because they'd rather pay for another plane ticket then wait any longer for people to not know what's going on. These type of malfunctions are not a joke they should have checked every bit of the plane before anyone boarded.(Both times) Please do not put yourself at risk to save a few bucks!!"

Date of travel: May 2021,10,American Airlines stole $1900 worth of flight credits,"My husband and I planned a destination wedding prior to the pandemic. When the pandemic hit, we had to cancel our plans. American Airlines stated that they redeemed our tickets with flight credit. Yet somehow we are not able to use them. When trying to use the credits towards an upcoming trip, they will only apply 97$ toward the new flight. We have reached out numerous times to customer service, and we have been told there is nothing they can do. This is the absolute worst airline and customer service I have ever encountered. As a side note: we even had trip insurance on our flights. Don’t be fooled into thinking that trip insurance will save you any grief. I hope this airline burns to the ground. No wonder they managed to make a profit during a pandemic, by stealing right from everyone’s pocket and not truly refunding any flight credit. So nice to see this is how they treat my husband and I, who are both nurses and have worked through the entirety of the pandemic. My husband has also been a member of the national guard for the last ten years. But no you’re right, American Airlines really needed our extra $1900 in their pocket. Thanks for stealing from Americans, American Airlines."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Charged for Cancelled Reservation,"Dear Mr. Parker, CEO of American Airlines:It saddens me to write this email but after 4 attempts, I'm completely done with your telephone representatives and supervisors. Here's my story and I'm requesting your help.In 2020, we had tickets to go to our usual vacation destination: Grand Cayman. Unfortunately due to Covid, Cayman was closed in 2020 so we switched our tickets to Cozumel. After enjoying Cozumel, about November of 2020, we once again rebooked a trip to Grand Cayman for this year and our reservation number was XXXXXX.In early 2021, we found out from a dear friend who is a supervisor with Cayman Airways that Cayman has a 14 day quarantine and we would not be able to come for our usual 7 day trip. We called American Airlines to cancel and rebook another trip back to Cozumel. Therefore the reservation of XXXXXX was cancelled. NO IT WASN'T because on 3/23/21, my credit card was charged for two tickets at $820.96 each for our trip to Cayman when we are already booked on XXXXXX (Spouse) ticketed to Cozumel and used two eVouchers for $254.70 each and paid $402.23 for his trip with the telephone representative on 2/20/21. My booking XXXXXX (Angry Lady) Ticket PENDING to Cozumel because I had to mail in two paper vouchers of $78.87. Why is my ticket STILL PENDING??? BOTH TRIPS have the SAME EXACT DATE!!!! HOW CAN YOUR COMPANY CONTINUE TO ISSUE TICKETS TO PEOPLE GOING TO TWO DIFFERENT DESTINATIONS AT THE SAME TIME???Today is my 4th call to your AA customer service. As of yet, I've been on hold for 75 minutes. Here's my problems that have not been rectified.1. My credit card was rebilled this week in the amount of $820.96 for the reservation of XXXXXX that was cancelled. I will be calling Chase tomorrow morning to re-dispute the claim a second time. Ridiculous!!!2. Our reservation is for June 26th - July 3rd. You ticketed the Cayman trip of the same date on March 23rd, but my Cozumel trip ticket is still pending and they are the EXACT SAME DATES! Can you explain that to me?What I need from you:1. Refund my credit card for the $820.96 for the reservation that won't go away.2. Ticket my pending trip to Cozumel XXXXXX and charge me the remaining $753.89.3. When I return from my trip, I will be cancelling my AA credit card because I will NEVER fly with your company ever again.4. I will go to social media and put this entire story of what I have gone through with AA for 2 years due to my real destination being closed because of using caution from Covid. I'm a teacher and will write about all of my experiences because I've been a Tripadvisor Contributor since 2001. I DO NOT want ANYONE else to have to go through this aggravation just to vacation.5. If your company is still issuing tickets to visitors to Grand Cayman and their trip is less than 14 days, then you will be having MANY MORE COMPLAINTS besides mine. I plan to write that as well in my Tripadvisor critiques since your company is not up on each destination's Covid policies. What a shame scamming tourists that have been locked down for so long. Then they will be given credit vouchers and go through my pain. You should be ashamed and I will make sure to voice all of my frustrations with your company on social media and Tripadvisor.6. Just issue me my ticket so I can finally be done with American Airlines!!I'M EXPECTING A REPLY WITHIN 48 HOURS OTHERWISE, I WILL CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVE AND REQUEST TO SPEAK WITH YOU PERSONALLY.Thank You,This was also sent to the following:2 of my local news stations (KVUE and FOX7)American Airlines Investor RelationsAmerican Airlines Facebook PageFaxed to American Airlines Customer ServiceReported to a Cayman Representative"
Date of travel: April 2021,30,Check all other options first,"Recently did  round trip flight on American Airlines Cleveland (Ohio) to West Palm Beach (Florida) April 15-April 21, 2021.  Knew going in that the flights were full with middle seats being occupied but ...   Very disappointed in American Airlines.  Announcement over the PA pre boarding of all flights was ""We've changed our service--we encourage you to purchase food and drink prior to boarding""   Took that to mean there would be no other snack pack/meal options to purchase once on plane.  Turns out that there was NO beverage or snack service at all.  On the first flight (full) there was one partially working restroom for a 2 hour and 5 minute flight.  UNACCEPTABLE.  The only one working at the front of the plane, had a stuck door.  It took a person on the outside to help the person on the inside get the door open.  A very unsettling experience.  On the first leg of the flight a flight attendant handed out pre-packaged antiseptic wipes.  On the other three legs an attendant stood there with a box and people choose whether or not to take them.  Did not feel confident about the ""cleanliness"" aspect.  Social distancing was a joke.  Ticket prices did not reflect service.  (At least with Spirit the tickets are discounted to reflect no beverage).   The only positive aspect was each seat had plug in capabilities for devices (cell phone, tablets, etc) and free movies to your deviceWon't fly American again unless no other option."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Terrible customer service!,"This was my first time traveling with AA. I have heard negative things about the airline but didn’t consider it when booking my flight. At JFK a black female AA employee was on the floor assisting customers. I made the line to check in but stepped aside to ask this employee if I was on the correct line. She then angrily said “I wish you wouldn’t make the line and then ask me a question.” I asked her “who was she talking to?” She responded rudely, “where are you flying to?” After she told me where to go, I told her that she shouldn’t be rude to customers. She just nodded her head. It was early in the morning, I definitely wasn’t expecting to deal with such nonsense especially with my children witnessing everything. I am disappointed on how things went that morning. Overall, the flight was okay. I wouldn’t travel with AA again unless absolutely necessary."

Date of travel: April 2021,50,Above and Beyond Customer Service,"We were so impressed with American Airlines Puerto Vallarta Check Agent ""Luis Espinoza"". We were flying Mexico via Phoenix ending Vancouver Canada and required a valid Lab Covid 19 PCR test result to board. It was our 3rd day waiting since our test, Test tent said they would email results at 10am, our flight was leaving at 10am, resulting in us having to miss our flight. Luis said that was unacceptable, took our test receipts, walked out of the airport, across the parking lot disappearing to the back of the result door. He was gone at least 15 minutes and returned with a smile and our printed negative Covid test results in his hand to board plane and enter Canada our final destination.  He said ""sometimes you just have to send a Mexican to do things the Mexican way"" He then checked us in and I asked his supervisor for his full name.Our whole experience with the staff all the way home was also excellent but Luis went above and beyond for us. We will be flying American Airlines to our Mexican home every year from now on."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,American Airlines,"I flew on American Airlines for the first time in a while, because a family member wanted to use miles to buy my tickets to attend my father’s funeral. The website wouldn’t allow me to book a ticket for anybody other than the owner of the miles. We connected in Chicago so we had a total of four segments. On three of the four segments, the planes were old and small, and the Wi-Fi didn’t work.There was no food or beverage service on any of the flights. On the return trip our bags were shipped to Charlotte, which was not on our itinerary. They didn’t even all go on the same flight. Two went on an earlier flight and one on a later flight. Overall, there was nothing positive I can say. I also made two trips to St. Louis earlier in the month on Southwest Airlines. Although I’m not a fan of the Southwest open seating, the overall experience was far better."
n/a,10,Absolute nightmare! Worst experience flying of my life. ,Showed up to the airport two hours before our flight. Only two people were working at the terminal checking bags. Two people! Helping hundreds of people in line. We've been waiting forever and our flight leaves in ten minutes and the line hasn't moved for thirty minutes... Never ever ever flying American airlines again. Never.

AA is rude and the flight attendants were extremely snappy! We paid a good amount to be able to see my wife and made sure to pay extra for the earliest arriving flight but now.....that money is waisted! all that extra money and seat choosing for NOTHING! and do they refund us no. Do not trust this flight with your loved ones or hopes because AA has seriously crushed ours."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Hour delay with no AC,"We are stuck on the plane with no AC waiting on a last minute crew change.   It's a hot day in Miami and the AC is not working.   The replacement copilot got here 30 minutes ago and the plant is still sitting.  NOW they start the safety brief.  More waiting.  2.5 hour flight is now 4 hours on a hot plane.   With NO SERVICE TO MAIN CABIN.   Big airlines bash the discount carriers as unreliable with poor service.  That define AA.   They KNEW the pilot was late, why would they load the plane.  Seems to be a pattern with American.  It's all about the employees doing what is easy for them."

Date of travel: April 2021,10,Mrs Lyon,"I had the worst possible experience with the AA agents at the gate for flight AA 20 out of Phoenix to LAX  on 4/29/21 at who almost forced me to check my bag which I was using to carry a breast pump for breastfeeding my baby. They were extremely rude, and forced me to repeat loudly what I was using the bag for in front of a crowd of people which was humiliating. The male agent gave me a look and muttered something about not believing me. After one female employee finally left me pass another employee almost chased me down the gate saying I couldn’t proceed until I had to embarrassingly repeat in front of a crowd that it was a breast pump, which I needed to prevent engorgement and infection after a day of flying. I finally was admitted to the gate and left in tears. American Airlines you should be ashamed of this sexist behavior"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Terrible,American Airlines is terrible. They made us late because of mechanical reasons and refused to hold our flight for 1 minute. I was literally standing at the gate and my wife was running behind. They closed it. Then they said the next flight to our destination was 3:00 pm the next day. Wouldn’t do anything to help. Put us in a hotel and just laughed at us. Sucks to be you. No restitution for losing a day of our vacation. Nothing. So terrible. Use any other airline but American.

We then are asked to get off and wait another hour in which we miss our conjoined flight again in Chicago.  We go to customer service to let them know our frustration and see if they can make things right, they act like they don’t care and got nothing in return but a sorry!

Date of travel: March 2021,40,Comfortable domestic flight on a wide-body aircraft,"American Airlines Flight 415PHL-MIA6:40-9:26 am Boeing 787-800 My wife and I recently took an early morning flight from Philadelphia to Miami on American, and thought it was a very good flight overall, particularly due to the aircraft. It was great to be on a 787 Dreamliner for the short flight to Miami, which provided great extra space in the premium economy section that was sold as Main Cabin Extra. The flight was departing from Gate A8 in Terminal A-East at PHL, but all ticketing and security in that terminal has been closed for most of the pandemic. There were signs outside to tell passengers to check-in at Terminal A-West (typically used more for international departures), which is what we did. I would currently recommend using Terminal A-West for all flights departing from any part of Terminal A at PHL.It was busy in the ticketing area, but there were a lot of employees around to direct us to open kiosks to self-tag our luggage. They also kept asking which flight we were on and directing us accordingly, so I’m not sure if the check-in area was somehow further divided up by flight that morning. The employee who weighed our bags and checked our IDs was particularly friendly and pleasant, which was a nice surprise at PHL and a very welcome start to our trip. The Terminal A-West security checkpoint isn’t the biggest, but it wasn’t particularly crowded that morning, with a separate PreCheck line that we were able to take advantage of. We were through security in only a couple minutes. From there, it was a quick walk to the gate. The flight to Miami was completely full, and boarding began a couple minutes early. We were very happy when we settled into our seats, which were located in what would normally be the premium economy section of the 787 on long-haul flights. These seats are essentially equivalent to first-class seats that AA features on smaller aircraft on most domestic flights. However, in this case, the premium economy seats were being sold as Main Cabin Extra seats as part of economy, rather than a separate upgraded class like they would be on an international flight. It cost us $25 per person to upgrade from standard economy to these seats, which are significantly better than all other seats in the economy cabin. Anytime we see that American is operating a wide-body aircraft on a domestic route, we look out for this great opportunity to upgrade to significantly better seats for a low cost. It was also nice that our seats had all the amenities we could need, including seatback TVs, multiple outlets, and footrests. Wifi was also available on the flight, with several items offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream, all in addition to what was loaded on the seatback TVs.This was actually my first time in a window seat on a Dreamliner, so I initially really liked the window controls, which allow you to choose how light or dim you want the view out the window to be, with no normal window shade. However, as the flight went on, I did not appreciate that the flight attendants took over the controls shortly after takeoff and locked all windows on the darkest setting, which prevents passengers from seeing out at all. I can understand putting the windows on this setting on a redeye where the cabin should remain dark, but this was a daytime flight. Not being able to see anything out the window for almost the entire flight was disappointing, and they only allowed us to control our own windows again a few minutes before we landed in Miami. Not having any ability to see out also made my wife a little dizzy at times. Shortly into the flight, the flight attendants came around to provide mini water bottles and pretzels. This has generally been the standard level of service on most shorter AA flights we’ve been on lately, except that the same items have been given out during boarding on most other flights. The crew was pretty hands-off throughout the flight, and we didn’t really see or interact with anyone much otherwise.The flight attendants did make several of the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and I didn’t see any non-compliance from passengers. However, I didn’t appreciate that when the captain made his own announcement about masks, there was a very clear negative tone to it, implying that he disagrees with the mask mandate. He was apologizing that passengers have to wear masks solely because of federal requirements, and said that he understands how hard wearing a mask is, so everyone should just try their best to get through the flight wearing a mask. First of all, with the flight being under 3 hours long, it’s hardly a major imposition to wear a mask. I thought it was also totally unprofessional that he added his opinion to the mask requirement, when it’s simply a federal requirement, regardless of how anyone feels about it personally. His announcement could also undermine the flight attendants’ ability to enforce the mandate, which isn’t fair to them either.After a very comfortable flight, we arrived at the gate in Miami just a couple minutes early. Unfortunately, the baggage claim process added a lot of frustration at the end of the trip. I find the baggage claim area at MIA to be too small in general, with too many flights arriving at the same time and all sharing carousels. That made it hard to tell which flight’s bags were coming out at any given time and made the area much too crowded. After multiple other flights that had arrived after ours received their bags, our bags finally showed up almost an hour after we had arrived at the gate. This was incredibly frustrating, and is one the slowest baggage claim experiences I’ve had on American or any other airline in quite some time. I’m not sure what took so long, but it made us late getting where we wanted to be in Miami, even though our flight had arrived as scheduled.Overall, this flight from PHL-MIA was nice, particularly given all the space we had in Main Cabin Extra seats in the premium economy section of the Dreamliner. Other than the inability to see out the windows during the flight and the overly long baggage claim process, we were happy with the experience."
Date of travel: June 2020,20,Flight Changes,"There has to be a way for American Airlines to keep reservations and not change the flight almost every time I schedule a flight.  They want our business but then they pull this crap and make the flying experience dreadful.  I had my husband leaving at 10:37 am from Wichita Falls Tx to DFW, DFW to Bradley arriving at 5:26 PM.  Now they changed it to leaving at 4:49 pm from Wichita Falls and arriving in Bradley at 11:09.  Now I have to drive around Hartford, a place I do not know, and try to find the airport and my husband at midnight.  I called to get help to get an earlier flight even leaving at 5 or 6 am and American Airlines said no.  Unfortunately I believe the only Airlines leaving out of Wichita Falls is American so I have no choice but to use them, but; if it is any indication of their terrible service like they have done so many times to us they in the past, they will cancel the Wichita Falls flight and my poor husband will have to drive to Dallas to catch his flight.  I really need to research a new Airlines.  Other people are so happy with their airlines...Jet Blue...Southwest.  Why can American be more like them?"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"Misinformation, Delays, and Mishandling Luggage","During a recent American Airlines flight from San Francisco to Philadelphia, I transported wine I purchased in Napa Valley. I packaged the wine in two insulated containers using copious bubble wrap to ensure its safety. I checked the containers for the flight and was assured by the baggage check clerk of their safe passage to my destination. During a layover in Dallas, I even saw the containers safely unloaded onto a cart for transportation to our next flight.However, that was the last time I saw the containers intact. When the containers arrived at the baggage claim, they looked they were crushed by something weighing multiple tons. The containers were contorted and deformed in different directions, soaked with liquid that undoubtedly belonged to the crushed wine bottles inside. One of the containers was wrapped in a plastic bag likely to contain the mess but without any indication that something was done to protect it. In totality, it becomes clear my containers were grossly mishandled in transit from Dallas to Philadelphia that resulted in irreparable damage.Unfortunately, this negligence compounded with the rest of my experience with American Airlines, which was unacceptably poor at every step in the process. I was guided to and waited in three different lines for nearly an hour to check my containers in the first place. The security line was also delayed, almost causing me to miss my flight. The flight itself was delayed multiple hours for unclear reasons, and the baggage claim was an utter frenzy without any regard for COVID-related safety precautions. Overall, my experience was nearly as bad as my baggage's, and I am strongly considering never flying with American Airlines again.When I contacted American Airlines about my experience, what was their response? We're sorry that happened. Do better."

Date of travel: April 2021,10,American airlines is the worste airline ever,"Worst airline I have ever flown with. Customer service is the worst....if I could give zero stars, I would. We checked in the night before and PAID for our bags. We arrived to the airport 1 hour and 5 mins before the flight. Stood in line to drop off the bags, that we had already paid for,  after finally getting to the front of the line and was told by the agent I needed to go to a kiosk to get a tag before checking my bag "" AFTER WAITING 25 MINUTES"". She said that she had no way of helping me and that I had to go to the kiosk.....This is the point where I should say that were ""NO"" signs to instruct passengers to go to the kiosk first, ""NO"" employee informing passengers to go to the kiosk first.  So we step out of line to go to the kiosk. When try to get our bag tag at the kiosk it says that we are ""2 MINUTES"" too late to check bags and we would have to rebook our flight. We still had 40 mins before our flight left. When we told the agent that was rebooking us that this was crazy and we only missed the cut off by 2 minutes due to the fact they had us waiting in line for 25 mins she said there was nothing she could do. With my family of 5 in tow, There was nothing I could do but allow them to rebook us. We were supposed to arrive in Miami at 9:30 on a non-stop flight and did not get in until to the 3pm due to the rebooking. Due to the delay, We missed a city tour that cost $225; So I am out the cost of that. To top it off, while boarding the rebooked flight, the person in front of us had a Carry-on that was too big. The agent simply said, ""Oh don't worry, we will check that for you and it will be at the gate when you exit the plane. WHAT?????  WHY DIDN'T THE AGENT AT THE BAG CHECK JUST TELL US TO BRING THE BAGS TO THE GATE AND THEY WOULD CHECK THEM FOR US????. Instead they made a family of 5 waste a whole day and lose money for a simple fix. Worst Airline ever!!!!!"

Saturday and Sundays are very busy travel days and the line was beyond long. Our family of five ended up missing our flight because of the long line. Hopefully American Airlines can get their kiosks repaired so it can work more smoothly. And remember Saint Thomas is a port and so there is also a need to go through customs. The short story is treated like an international flight.

Ran at top speed all the way to our gate and they closed the door. We couldn’t get a flight for the same nite and originally they told us they would pay for our hotel but then said they wouldn’t it made no sense and because we didn’t have any extra money we had to sleep on the airport floor.. no compassion was shown, no refund or credit offered nothing.. just a closed door to the face and a cold restless nite. Thanks for the horrible first experience American Airlines!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,DO NOT TRAVEL WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES.,I never ride a bad review for something unless it’s absolutely necessary. My family and I were headed to key west. As we were pulling out of the gate the whole plan shook and a huge noise scared everyone. Some idiot who works here forgot to unhatch the tow bar. We spent over two hours sitting on the runway as maintenance tried to fix it. Then they say we’re all set and as we’re pulling out they say “the paperwork wasn’t filled out correctly by maintenance”. We sat there for another hour. They gave a 20 minute period for people to get off and reschedule. When we got to key west our luggage was missing as the idiot again working for American Airline supposedly did not put our bags on the flight. So they were still sitting at our first destination. They gave us a toothbrush... that was it....Then flying back to flint Michigan from key west was a nightmare. There is problems with both of our laboratories on the flight so we sat in the airport for over for hours. No communication was made to anyone. We had a connecting flight leaving Charlotte that we missed because of American Airlines. They would not even help or talk to us regarding our missed connection until we got onto the next flight. Our luggage is probably in another state right now. Of course they couldn’t provide much information with that either. They put us in a hotel and gave us $12 for food. Enough to buy a pack of gum. We all had to call off work and spend another day traveling. I will absolutely never step foot on this airline again. Horrible horrible horrible DONT waste your money.

Was advised that she has covid along with pneumonia I called American to try and warn them to tell customers because there was children and babies on the flight that was also exposed even the staff they said they have no way to do that and is the cdc’s job to give that information I wouldn’t advise flying because you could be on a flight next to someone who has covid and has no idea like my sister. Many people more then likely will get it and expose others this is why it hasn’t gone away I feel if they can send emails to get people to fly they can email people and at least warn them that is not right of them.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst  flight Ever!!,"Let me start out by saying this is my very first flight round trip from Denver to Jamaica and on the way back the connecting flight was in Charlotte NC. I only do reviews if your really good or really bad. I will NEVER book with American Airlines or stop in Charlotte NC again. Our flight arrived a few minutes early only for us to sit on the plan for an hour due to whatever reasons the airlines were dealing with that had absolutely nothing  to do with the passengers, then we finally get into customs and the lines are so long and only four people were working it took 45 minutes just to get through there. So now we’re at an hour and 45 minutes of just waiting that’s out of our control, which is just about the time of the layover. We get to the bag check area we’re every person in there was rude for no reason only to run all the way to the gate for them to say we can’t get on but we get a free hotel. He looks again and is like oh sorry you don’t get a free hotel. You have to pay for a hotel or sleep here cus thats the last flight of the night the next one doesn’t run till the morning.

Date of travel: April 2021,10,Waste of Time,"I flew into Miami Beach, Florida on Sunday April 18th on flight 4044. The flight was delay almost 3 hours because of out of service parts on the plane aparently. This was frustrating because it delayed my pickup service and I wasn't able to be picked up from MIA until 7 pm, leaving me stuck there for hours. What was even more aggravating on the way back on Friday, April 23rd on flight 4171, the crew had the passengers board, just to have us get off because of more out of service parts on the aircraft. How could you not realize there out of service parts before you let passengers board? It's completely unprofessional and ridiculous. We all had to go to a completely different terminal and it took over an hour to unboard the plane, go to another teminal, and board the new aircraft. This also ended up messing up my pickup service again, to the point where they couldn't come, so I tried to take the LIRR, ended up missing the train by 2 minutes, and having to wait for over an hour for the next one. It's absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional. How could you have that many out of service parts and not notice until the passengers are ready to board and/or are currently boarded?"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Book a flight then they change it to have a seven hour over night layover.,Booked a  flight well in advice to get as good a flight as possible.  They changed it 4 times and now are left with big layovers and one in LAX for 7 hours over night.  They tell us under covid rules they can do that.  Give the choice of paying a lot more for a flight like the one we originally booked or cancel and pay the high prevailing current last minute booking cost with another airline.  Plus you have to deal with some barely able to speak English foreigner who doesn't care one little bit about your travel plans.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Unfair and Terrible treatment,"On our first leg of the trip everything went well. I was amazed at how smooth things ran, then came the return flight back home. We got to the airport and checked in, only to be searched “RANDOMLY” as many times as I travel American Airlines are the only Airlines I have this issue with. Then comes the bag search where they took items from my luggage and told me I couldn’t take on the plane. The same products they took are the same ones they sold before you enter the plane. While boarding the plane we were told one of our luggage had be checked. Which was BS because we didn’t check it on the first leg of our trip. Plus there were other passengers with bigger luggages that were able to board with no problem.Needless to say it was a terrible experience from check in to boarding. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND USING AMERICAN AIRLINES TO ANYONE."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,How can they be so irresponsible,"I was scheduled to fly home to Maine today from Orlando.  Flights were canceled due to maintenance and  they were overlooked.  They cannot get me another flight for 48 hours! I will miss two days of work and thus two days of pay. When I asked if they would fly me to Boston and then provide ground transportation to Maine they said I would have to pay for the ride. WTF? I'm already missing $400 in pay and they want me to spend more out of pocket to get home?? This is all  down to overselling flights.  Until they are made to stop these greedy jerks will continue this practice.  And because I used miles for my ticket,  that's the only compensation I'll receive.  American was the first to sell middle seats during the pandemic  (Delta still doesn't ). Fly another airline.  Any other airline and save yourself a nightmare like the one I'm in"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,ABSOLUTE WORST AIRLINE - DO NOT USE,"My girlfriends and I bought tickets fairly cheap to Miami for a girls trip - had to cancel due to Covid-so now we're finally trying to used the credits for another trip.  We paid more to get another ticket - and then AA changed our flight time which ruined our plans. Now most of us have to book United and have more unused credits (that we will NEVER USE) because AA service has been absolutely horrible.  You have to wait for 3-4 hours  on hold to talk to anybody and they are not accommodating at all.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Even if you see a cheap flight, it's not worth it because they will  not be flexible with you when they change your flight/flight times."

Very low number of staff, no customer support, and total intolerance on the part of the crew there. There were about 10 people, no more, waiting to be checked-in with a staff member for various reasons. Usually because of non standard size luggage. I had made it to the airport early to give myself plenty of time. Despite the horrendous wait (for only 10 people - about 1 hour!) I was fine with my flight. However, the lady in front of me who had also been waiting"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Horrible,I’d like to share my experience with American Airlines. This was the worst experience flying on an airplane to date for a multitude of reasons. The flight attendants were nasty and this airline completely disregards social distancing guidelines. They overbooked the flight and crammed over 150 passengers on a plane together. Not sure how this is even allowed when local restaurants aren’t even allowed to fill their tables that would give way more separation then on a plane. They are so strict with wearing masks unless you are eating or drinking something because apparently we can’t spread Covid while eating or drinking. They don’t take your temperature when boarding the plane and honestly other then the mask they do absolutely nothing to diminish the spread of Covid. This is stupidly at its finest and the fact that small mom and pop businesses aren’t allowed to come close to operating at this capacity speaks volumes of the corruption in our country and society today. This is disgusting and I’m completely appalled by this type of hypocrisy. It’s sad the amount of sheep in the world that follow stupid guidelines that are riddled with double standards. I strongly advise anyone who has the ability to use logic and common sense to find a different airline because this is downright dumb. It’s sad the it’s a federal law to wear your mask and yet again social distancing is deemed unnecessary while on an airplane. It’s only deemed unnecessary because the airlines stand to lose too much money. However a small local business is required to operate under all Covid safety guidelines and as a result many are losing their homes and so much more. We live in a corrupt society where the more money you have the more you can get away with. American Airlines is only concerned about $$$ and your safety is obviously of little concern to this multi million dollar corporation. I honestly prefer not to wear a mask. However don’t act like you are keeping me safe by sticking me next to someone I never met before shoulder to shoulder as if my mask has secret powers I wasn’t aware of. My next trip to Florida I will be driving because I just can’t deal with this level of stupidity. In Florida I had the choice to wear a mask or not in most places. That’s what freedom is all about and not this manipulative garbage.

Yes I paid the extortion to be with my loved one.  I guess American Airlines values money more then Family and doing the right thing.  I wonder if we will get to be on the same plane on the return flight.                          Should have flown southwest
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Mr,"Rude, argumentative , disrespectful. Combative! Lied right through their teeth right to my face. Never fly them again. Agent should have been fired on the spot."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Why Do I Bother????,"Cancelled flight and AA credited my account. Tried to rebook flight, was quoted a price, printed ticket with that price and it showed ""ticket pending"". Was assured the credit would be applied and everything would be fine! In meantime there was a schedule change by AA and they increased my ticket by over $200!! Called them and said their change, their mistake on price and they need to fix it, apply the credit and issue the final ticket! After 1hour and 10 minutes and numerous discussions with the platinum desk who was talking to supervisor and the pricing people, they ""honored"" the original price!! WOW like they were giving me something I didn't deserve!  They still haven't applied the credit in my ""wallet"" controlled by them but the price is now correct  BUT since they cancelled the original ticket that they set up, my original seats were gone!! I have to say that the representatives on the platinum desk have been extremely helpful BUT they are handicapped by a group of pricers, schedulers, systems personnel and management who continually create problems for customers and their platinum desk Reps!!! I feel sorry for the Reps as they have a difficult job trying to clean up the crap that the former groups create!!! If it weren't for them I would be long gone to another carrier!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,American Airlines expects you to teleport everywhere instead of flying,"American Airlines is probably the worst company I've ever had the pleasure of flying with. The flights themselves are okay, the inside of the plane is like any other. However, the employees are awful to work with, and their customer service is abhorrent. I tried to fly to Munich and had all the supporting documents I needed, and the airline refused to let me check in, and caused me to miss my flight. I had to stay another night and rebook to Frankurt where I needed to buy a train ticket to get to Munich. They did not reimburse me for the hotel or train ticket. On the way back, they cancelled a leg of my flight without notifying me and I had the pleasure of finding out a few days before my flight. I had to cancel my flight entirely and buy a new ticket with a different airline. The same thing has just happened again, where a critical leg of the flight was cancelled and nothing else changes. I don't understand how an airline can expect to seriously keep a flight going when an entire leg is cancelled. Am I supposed to teleport to the next location now? It's a complete joke. I will never fly with American Airlines again. You couldn't even pay me to fly with them. I would rather shoot myself in both feet and walk the distance rather than fly with AA again."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Horrible experience!,"First issue is that you don't get a break-down of what everything costs (flights, hotel and car rental) so I have no clue what's costing what.  When I went to pick up the rental car, I was told that I only pre-paid a portion of the car rental ($199.00) and when I returned the car I was going to be charged over $286.  Hidden fees?? The car rental was a disaster (Budget).  I was given a rental car that was filthy and clearly had not been cleaned...I thought because of COVID-19 all car rentals were supposed to be cleaning and disinfecting every car between customers.  That definitely wasn't happening.  The hotel was semi-decent, except that there was always a smell of marijuana on my floor.  I needed to change my return flight and was told I had to contact American Airline Vacation department.  I was left on hold for 3 hours and then after a recording that said something along the lines of, sorry we missed your call, the call was disconnected.  Horrible experience!!  I'll never book anything through American Airline Vacations again.  Lesson learned."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Mr. Reed,"Delays, cancellation, and then more delays what a way to spend a birthday. Never use American horrible flight service and customer service as well."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,NIGHTMARE,"Never again! Too many complaints to list. However, one I feel I have to mention is leaving a call back number. Tried to reach customer service to change a flight. Waited for almost two hours then got disconnected. Called again at 7:30pm to request a call back from reservations. They called me at 3 am. Seriously? Who does that?"
Date of travel: April 2021,50,American Provided A Good Experience ,"Flew American, when normally I have an allegiance to Southwest, because American offered a direct, non-stop early in the morning out, and later in the evening upon return. Given this was a four day weekend, we were trying to maximize our time. American was fantastic, but I have never understood why the non-Southwest carriers don’t board back of the plane first. Obviously, the airlines know their business better than me, but it always seems to bottleneck the boarding process. Although, it was a nice change to have reserved seats. I would fly American again if they have flights that accommodate my schedule and/or destinations better than Southwest’s options."
Date of travel: April 2021,30,Philly to Sarasota,"I got from Philly to Sarasota safely! However my experience was not so good. Part of it is due to my lack of experience on American. I did not realize that not paying for any upgrades relegated me to the 7th boarding group.  When I got to the gate an agent yelled at me ""over there!"" And it turned out he meant the agent next to him who put a tag on my bag without explaining that I had to check my bag. I figured that out on my own. Once onboard I was not greeted by the crew who were busy talking to each other. The cabin crew came by once with water and pretzels (not their fault, that is what is served, might as well be water and a crust of bread) then they walked through with garbage bags around 5 times. No interaction or smiles. It was pretty pathetic. I will admit I was a United flight attendant 30 years ago so I guess that colors my opinion. I also usually fly Southwest, where all those little charges are covered. I also realize that my flight was really Republic Airlines, perhaps a far cry from the real American.i am kind of stuck with American because they have the only non-stop from Philly. It is sad, when I worked for United I looked at American as a worthy competitor. I guess times have changed."

First attempt to fly, arrive early and online and kiosk to bag check are both down. have to wait in line, arrive at agent at 10:00 for a 11:00 flight. she is typing for a long time, then says ""its !0:01, you will have to fly standby tomorrow"". After a discussion with manager as well. agent issues standby boarding pass (issues no notes or record number to reference so their is no trail)  and we leave. The next morning, arrive early again. kiosk is working and check bag, go to drop-off bag and clears again. mistakenly, ask for a manager for the previous days experience and to get a confirmed seat. Manager Seth rolls out and pecks around on the computer and then says ""uhhhh, I don't like the look of your passport, it looks too old and used"". WHAT???? this was not a problem before. Goes and gets his manager, and she comes over after pow wowing with her cronies and says in a rude tone "" you're not flying today"". when voices were raised when we call BS, because 5 TSA agents said the passport looked fine and we spoke up, they all get together and say don't get so close and call the police. We go to TSA Immigration office and confirm again, no problem with the passport. We return to the ticket area and there are 6 police officers waiting. We speak to them, they also agree we are not wrong, but say no flying today and we leave. When we ask for a refund then for 2 flights, bag fees paid two times, they just say call American Airlines number. (Which if you have tried, you wait 2-4 hours for a callback these days). They also cancelled the flight, and sure they're are no notes again so probably will not get any money back, and probably will have notes on they're about an angry black girl instead of they're own incompetence. This situation also happened to others, and noticed there were of color too, coincidence? Just had to book flights on Delta now for tomorrow, hopefully third times a charm.

I asked to upgrade to business for me and my wife, could only upgrade me as advantage number was mine, then when i asked how much to upgrade to business for my wife the upgrade was more than the entire ticket going and returning even though i had already paid to upgrade the return flight.

I made reservations in March for a large group due to an event being held in Hawaii. For starters, my flight was changed without my consent and I was not even made aware that there were changes in my trip. I spoke to a Customers relations SUPERVISOR named Yanci Gonzalez in regards to this issue and how it could be resolved. There was no intent to help, she mentioned that I had to pay for the seats that were available on a flight that I had not chosen. Customer service was terribly rude. I then called again to be a translator for a family member that was also on the same flight and was a Spanish speaker. I spoke to Donna and again, very rude, as I was making the changes to select seating that I had to pay extra for, she said ""you have one second, because I have been on hold for too long"" as I had explained to her to please give me a few minutes because I had to translate to the mentioned family member, she said ""The most I can hold is for 2 minutes"". That is not the customer service a company should have. There was no intent to help. I paid for a service that was not given and on top of all the chaos, your employees are rude! I am highly upset. Never thought Id experience this level of disrespect!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,AA employees at CLT airport is non-caring and incompetent,We are flying from MCO to CAK with stop over in CLT. The flight left late from MCO and we ran thru the CLT airport and arrived at the gate E8 exactly 10 minutes before scheduled departure of 1:10 pm on 4/20/2021 .....but the AA gate agent Bernardo Porter had closed the gate already and was not about to reopen it for us....we could see the plane at 50 yards walking from gate E8....really?  ....we begged....nothing!.....we then watched Bernardo walk slowly to the plane to bring some paperwork.....when we asked him what his name was....he answered ‘what is your name’...what an antagonistic attitude of an AA employeeThen we went to ‘Customer Service’ to get rescheduled for the next flight....and the agent gave us standby tickets...BECAUSE WE DIDN’T SHOW UP AT THE GATE!!...what! Incredible....told us “ nothing I can do about it”...they just don’t care!!....we waited till he left the desk and went back to Customer Service: expressing our frustration....this agent seem to be able to assign seats for us...not together ( we paid for our original premier seats for the flight from CLT to CAK)Note: we both have Gold and Ruby status wit AA....it means nothing!!
Date of travel: April 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN,"By far the worst airline EVER, the employees are so rude just asking basic questions they will have an attitude & walk away. The man who checked our luggage made us wait 5 mins. Apparently check in is at a specific time & they’ll make you get back in line to do so. He didn’t have on a employee ID so his supervisor was asked. When I talked to them they could care less about our complaint & allowed the employee to talk back to the customers!.. NEVER AGAIN WILL I FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES!!! I would give them 0 stars !!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Useless customer service,"So where do I start. I was pulled aside at Heathrow by US Border Control Agents because I had no return ticket, long story short I had to purchase one on the spot, happened to be American.When I later wanted to change the date and destination on that ticket after spending the customary hour or so in line I was told that they couldn't possible make the change through the American customer service since the original ticket was paid for in British Pounds.And when the UK branch finally made the change the voucher for the price difference had to be mailed on a paper voucher from the UK to Miami.The paper voucher could obviously never be used to buy a ticket online or even through the agents over the phone, no it had to be at a ticketing office at an airport, luckily the baggage fee needed to be paid so that way the money wasn't lost.Unfortunately we had to change yet another leg of the trip and it was a 4 hour wait to get a hold of a customer service rep, and then another 2 hours mostly on hold to change the date for three passengers, that is completely unacceptable! How are they this incredibly inefficient? Close to a full working day on the phone to change the date? Unreal.During one of the changes of the tickets the auto generated email came back with partial names, so we had to call and wait for two hours again just to make sure the right name was on the tickets, and sure enough in their system everything was correct, so why are emails with faulty tickets going out to customers? So incredibly unnecessary. Hours spent in vain because of a really dumb glitchy system.And that pretty much sums up the entire customer experience. Just hours upon hours spent in line and on hold every single time we tried to reach them. Will probably  not be coming back, just not worth the hassle."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,THE WORST AIRLINE IN HISTORY OF THE WORLD! NEVER FLY AGAIN !!,"It started with a delay of taking off from Monetego Bay, Jamaica! They boarded us on plane and right before takeoff said our flight is delayed 1 hour due to storms in Miami. Then after 1 hour, then said it is another hour. At this point I decided to deplane and the gate agent said don't go far, plane will be taking off soon. Then 3 hours laters, all passengers deplanedand flight got delayed until 8am next morning!! The gate agent said there is another flight in the gate next to us that was leaving for Miami in hour and we could take that one. After waiting hour to board on that plane, they said airplane had delay, but we discovered secretly the fuel pump was damaged and they are moving our luggage and passengers to the original airplane. Finally we go the Miami 7 hours later at 12am, instead of 5pm! we missed our connecting flight to Baltimore and AA said there are no flights out till WEDNESDAY, 3 days later! I missed work, I had to pay excessive hotel fees, car rental, and food. AA didn't give a damn about all flights overbooked and delays for all its passengers!! it was insane! Finally, I paid for luggage to travel back to Baltimore, and on WEdnesday, the ticketing agent said I didn't pay! I had the damn payment receipt and were trying to make me pay again. They almos made me miss this new flight. Finally, after all that. a direct flight. AA lost my luggage and put on plane to NYC. I had to wait in Baltiomore for 3 hours just to get my luggage . They wouldnt delivery to my house! Insane! they still keep charging and crediting my ank card for seat upgrades I never got! If you call customer service its a 4-5 hour wait!! this airline needs to go bankrupt and go fast! for the love of god! I hope they burn in hell!"
n/a,20,Lack of communication,"While we were given 2 sets of documents to enter mexico on the plane, they failed to even mention the most important document, mexico attestation documents that you have to have to even get to customs much less through.

Date of travel: April 2021,10,These people just don't care about people!,While getting help from a American airlines employee for our booking tickets . He then told us you just miss the bag check. He then told us he was going to put us the next plane at 7:30 am and we would still be able to catch our connecting flight in Dallas at 10:30am so at 7:30 they told us they overbooked and we would have to wait on the next flight .we caught that one at 9:30 got to Dallas and missed our 10:30 flight because of this so now we're stuck in Dallas with no cloths and we don't have nowhere to go we don't know anyone out here. And the tickets they gave us say stand by so we might can't get on that one .
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Horrible Experience,"We went on a spring break trip and were supposed to come back Sunday and our flight was cancelled and their explanation was ""the flight was having engine problems"" when in reality they were overbooked and sent the smallest plane to come get us. Then they told us they will try to leave on Tuesday and the same problem happened again and this time apparently one of the toilets were not working so that stopped them from boarding us. People were sitting there trying to figure out what they could do since most of them missed work and school and had nowhere else to go. Some people had already left and then they announced the flight was back on when half of the people who were supposed to take the flight were gone. Also, they were not even thinking about refunding people which I find crazy considering we had to pay two times to check-in and for getting another ticket. American Airlines is horrible and no I do not blame the people who work at the airlines they tried their best even though they could not accommodate(find hotels or somewhere for people to stay) for people."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Criminal Behavior,This is the worst company on the planet. Customer service on these people is an unknown subject. They steal from you on your face and then blame you for it. Supervisors have attitude and treat you worst than customer service. If you have an option try never to use them to travel or you would end up loosing money. Avoid this company at all cost. Airline credit is never what they promise. They have to be a communist to treat people so bad.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Crooks and Extortion,This is the worst airline ever. I am disappointed in the way they try to get every nickel and dime out of every day Americans. And try to blame you. You punish me because I decided to stay at the last meeting in the city that I'm connecting to. You want to charge me.  I decided at the last minute to stay in the connecting city because I'm not feeling well and can't  take the full trip to Florida. So I decided to stay at my brothers in Charlotte.    They made me pay for extra free calling me a flight risk.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Save yourself a headache and money!,"This airline is a joke! Their attempts at providing professional customer service is laughable. I took a flight out of Sarasota and had a connecting flight to catch in Chicago. Well the flight was delayed and arrived  late, therefore we missed our flight and wa told the next one would leave at 9am the next morning. We were told the flight was delayed due to air traffic control however the airline would not take responsibility for that and passed blame on to us. They offered a discount hotel and a 800 number to inquire about a refund.  Now I’m stuck in a foreign place, uncomfortable and pissed off is a understatement!"

Horrible Greedy Airline!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,JOKE,"So, let me get this right...I booked a flight from Miami to Liberia Costa Rica. I pay for more leg room ""upgrade"", I choose our seats directly behind 1st class. There is no fixed wall that separates the cabin departments or class, we can see, hear, smell, everything in 1st class. I believe it was the Max aircraft. After waking from a short nap, I asked our flight attendant for a drink, he quickly returned and laid a bag with a small bottle of water, small bag of peanuts and a sanitary wipe. I then quickly stopped him, pulled my mask partially down and explained my confusion. He abruptly told me to pull mask up and that we don't get anything else. Meanwhile literally 8 inches in front of me sits every individual in 1st class intermittently wearing a mask, eating and drinking. Guess AA figured out that if you pay for 1st class seats you are Covid safe, nicely done."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Family Friendly NOT,"American Airlines does not have a way when booking online to identify that you are traveling with lap infants.  We just travelled to Florida with our kids and grandchildren (a 6-year old and twin toddlers). I called the airline after booking the flights to have them assign the toddlers to their parents as lap infants.  I was told that the seats I had booked for the parents could not be used for lap infants and that we would have to get seats reassigned when we arrived at the airport.  We did the but on one segment ended up with one of our party sitting away from the rest of us.  Depending on the flight attendants, we were told in one instance that the infants could not be seated in the same row, others gave different information.  On the return trip, they were traveling without us, and to prevent this type of thing from happening again, i talked to an agent who told me that dependent on the type of aircraft, that infants were limited to certain seats, but there was no restriction to them sitting in the same row.  The seats were changed accordingly.  However when they arrived at the airport they were again told that their seats needed to be reassigned, but had to be done at the gate for each leg of the flight.  Not only is flying stressful for a family, but now the airline has added even more stress with the unknown of whether they would be sitting together or not.  I would strongly recommend that families avoid traveling on American Airlines"

Date of travel: April 2021,10,The Uncaring Airline,"Booked this long haul international flight in January for departure in July'21. The cruise we had planned was cancelled as most of western Europe is closed to tourists and if you can get in, they require lengthy quarantine periods at exorbitant hotel prices. AA will not refund the  money nor was I asking them to. They  have waived the change fees BUT still require us to re-use the tickets by Jan. including paying any difference in price. They are requiring this despite  not knowing when we could fly into Europe given that virtually every European country is experiencing wave after wave of Covid, their vaccination program is anemic at best and most countries are in some sort of lockdown, yet AA still requires that I book flights there to be used by January!!! or lose the money!!!  Who wants to fly there unless you absolutely have to!!! We are multi million milers and platinum flyers with AA and always purchase tickets far in advance of a trip---the kind of customer most airlines love!!!

Date of travel: February 2021,10,don't use,Since my last review they changed another flight on me.  They will never never honor their original flight times. They did this pre-covid.  I had an offer from a third party come thru for 288 to Japan September thru March and I would never do it because it was with American airlines and I know they will change the flight 4 times messing up plans and eventually cancel the flight  so I will be stuck with one of their unusable vouchers

I sign up for airline specials thru a 3rd party and I had something come thru for only 288 from various cities to Japan fall thru Spring but I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because it was American Airlines and they will change the flight 5 times messing up any plans you make and more than likely cancel the flight altogether trapping you in one of their horrible unusable vouchers.

I asked the supervisor if she could waive the fee, to which she replied ""not able to"".  This is, of course, a flat out lie.

I recently purchased 3 adult tickets for our return trip from Cancun to Portland, OR for a trip in May.  I purchased the tickets 2 months in advance and never received an email confirming the entire purchase, just the additional $55 we paid for seat selection.  I needed to add an infant ticket to our trip, and called to do so.  The AA rep said she would charge my card on file for $16.95 for the infant fee.  I agreed and everything was supposed to be handled.  A short time later I received an email letting me know American Airlines had charged my card $1,609.00!  Because the authorized fee was so low, I had used my checking account debit card.  My account was not in condition to take a $1600+ hit and I called American and waiting for 3 hours for a call back.  After being on hold for 30-40 minutes and multiple people, they assured me they removed the charges and the money would not leave my account.  They said they could not offer an email confirmation , but rest assured, it was handled.  I checked my account today and the charges are still pending, nothing dropped off. My account is locked and I have no access to my funds.  I called AA again, and am waiting 2 hours plus for another inept call back.  Use this airline at your own risk!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Incompetent,"AA managed to mess up twice:- They cancelled our 2nd connecting flight on the night before; we had to fly out the next day. Ended up having to book a $200+ hotel for a night because the only remaining option was overnight flight. No mention of reimbursing or anything like that.- When boarding, they told me that the overhead bin space is all taken and that my bag will need to be checked in. I proceeded inside only to find out that the 2 bins ON TOP OF US were completely empty. I tried going back and asking to bring them in instead but the flight attendant was absolutely against it. I thought perhaps more people will fill up that space but no, the flight fully boarded, the doors closed, and we flew with 2 empty bins on top of us the entire flight. Incompetence at its best."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Lacking in every way.,"I am not one to usually leave a poor review unless I feel that the company really deserves it. I know that you often sacrifice quality for inexpensiveness, but, honestly, the lack of quality services was really astonishing--even for a basic economy seat. Our original flight was canceled. We couldn't speak to an attendant for more than four hours. By then, we had to book another flight because we were in a rush to get home on time. No refund. Then, during the actual flight, service was really poor. Some flight attendants were really impatient. When my husband asked for drink options, the flight attendant audibly moaned. Audibly moaned! When the lady next to me forgot to pull up her mask after taking a drink, another flight attendant scolded her pretty harshly. There really was no patience. And then the online services were totally down. I couldn't access any free entertainment or even pay for internet services during the long flight home. I honestly would not recommend American Airlines to anyone. Might as well pay a little more elsewhere for much higher quality."
Date of travel: April 2021,30,American Airlines On Time For BOTH Flights!!,"I've not had great experiences with American in the past as they are always late taking off for one excuse or another, so I was reluctant to book a flight back home with them. However, the price was better than the competition, so I booked those tickets with anticipation that I'd be later than expected arriving home. To my surprise, both flights I had from American that day took off on time and arrived early. They have in-flight entertainment available on your device for free. Unfortunately, they had no plugs to charge your device, so watching a 2 hour movie drove my battery down. They don't have the best choices of movies or TV to choose from. They are booking the middle seats and it was full planes. They do allow you to choose your seat for free. Due to covid, they just gave us small baggies with pretzels and a small bottle of water for snack."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Never Flying American again,"So flight was canceled on the 11th. No one to take to on the phone for 5 hours. Tried to book me to leave out 3 days later. I stayed at the airport for a day standby to get home. Customer service was bad, they do not care."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Lack of service,"Flew 04/12/21 and in business class and amazed at the complete lack of service during a 3 hour flight leaving at 1300. We received 1 drink, no snacks and nothing else. Not sure what the crew were up to but they certainly had no duties looking after the passengers. For all that extra money I would have appreciated at least a pack of peanuts."
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Unprofessional flight attendants- but one really phenomenal one,"On this specific flight the female flight attendant in first class on March 24th, 2021 was all around fabulous!  We thank her for making our travels amazing.  The other 6 flights we took, all on American Airlines and all in first class, were not amazing and most of that was due to the interactions we had with or overheard from flight attendants.  One suggestion I have is for flight attendants to express frustrations between one another in a quieter tone.  On every flight there was a lot of cattiness, power tripping.  I understand working with the public might be frustrating but there are professional ways to address situations.Another frustration was that on some of the American Airlines flights they would not allow us to check our stroller at the gate as an a la carte to pick up upon landing.  This made layovers extremely difficult with a toddler who needed a nap :(  In Miami we weren't even allowed to take the stroller through TSA.  We checked our luggage and the ticketing agent said the stroller was fine to take to the plane but we were stopped at TSA and told to check the stroller.  I thought this was a TSA issue but the woman demanding us to check the stroller was an American Airlines employee standing guard at the TSA entry.   The lack of consistency caused frustration and anxiety that was not necessary."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Paid for first class ticket and treated like 2nd class citizen,"I don't recommend buying a First-Class ticket with AA your better off buying a regular ticket. I had a carry-on issue on my return flight from LAX. I traveled from ORD-LAX-HNL then from HNL-LAX and had no problems with my carry-on, however when I got to LAX my carry on was to big?? and the gate agent said I had to check the carry on. I was elated because I had the same bag, same weight and had to check it. What made matters worse on the plane the overhead bin was empty over my seat 2D. I took pictures and video of the incident. It gets better, the second to the last person to board was not in first class and sure enough they put her bag in the empty spot and had to shove it in to make it fit. I was outraged!! I wrote to American Airlines and they basically said they would use this a training tool for the benefit of the air lines. I paste what they wrote, this was supposed to be a hassle-free vacation. Last, I have the nerves to be a share holder now that a bitter pill to swallow.From: AA (From what you've written, I do understand that you've been allowed to carry your bag aboard the previous flights you took to and from Honolulu. We aim to apply this approach consistently so that our customers know what to expect when traveling with us. Mrs. Shelton, I will be sure to document your comments about this incident. Your feedback will be made available to the appropriate management team for them to use and help make any necessary changes to how we approach carry-ons at the airport. I know this won't change the experience but it does identify an area of opportunity for us. WOW!!!!)"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Why can't I rate them lower????,"American airlines has the worst everything, constantly constantly running late for small flights from savannah to Charlotte for example, always have broken parts need replacing or waiting on parts paperwork before we can fly which almost Everytime is a wait of about an hour to two hours of passengers crammed full in a plane begging the gods to let these trogladites get at it already so we won't be late for our connection flight knowing were going to be late and miss that flight because of bad handling of parts and paperwork, our plane sat at the gate for 2 hours before we boarded and after we all crammed in they decide to start doing the job they've been hired to do. WORST AIRLINE EVER hurry up and go out of business already!!!!!"
n/a,30,Worst flight ever,"This 7.25 hour flight from Phoenix to Kona was dreadful. The seats were not comfortable. There is no inflight entertainment unless you are lucky enough to get into their entertainment service through your own electronic device. That didn't work half the time. The flight attendants did not seem like they would be much help in the case of an emergency. Kudos to American airlines for hiring older and overweight flight attendants. The flight went on and on and on. The seats are so thin in the back that not only could I feel the person behind me kicking my seat, I could actually feel their foot on the small of my back through the seat. I will avoid this route and probably American airlines as much as possible in the future."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Zero service to Orlando,"Early morning flight from Charlotte, NC to Orlando, FL, after having to stay overnight in Charlotte due to missing connections associated with AA’s poor operations (i.e., having an hour to make a connection and missing that connection due to sitting on the tarmac for 50 minutes “waiting for a gate” as we stared at empty gates).Lousy service.  On this segment of over an hour, NO service was offered—not even a bottle of water.  Compare that to Delta, where on a segment of shorter length, I was served a bottle of water and two snacks."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Horrible customer service during irregular operations,"I was on an AA itinerary from Rochester, NY to Orlando, FL, with a layover in CLT.We were delayed leaving Rochester because the flight was oversold and they were begging for volunteers.Due to weather in Charlotte, we then had to divert to Knoxville, TN.  We were then further delayed in Knoxville due to a maintenance issue with the aircraft.  This caused a missed connection.  AA’s app, to which you are directed in the event of irregular operations, was useless; it didn’t even realize we had been diverted.We arrived in Charlotte in-time for me to make my rebooked connection.  However, we then sat on the tarmac for 50 minutes, “waiting for an open gate”—as we stared at empty American gates.Upon deplaning, we had a longer-than-necessary wait for valet-checked bags on the regional jet (despite the lengthy delay for a gate, they still were not ready for our arrival); there were no staff on the jetbridge even trying to enforce social distancing.I ran like crazy through Charlotte’s airport to try to make my connected flight, the last of the evening.  I was met by a gate agent who raised her hand like a stop sign and screamed, “THIS FLIGHT IS CLOSED,” without so much as even acknowledging I’d tried to make it.  Then, without a word, she used her pointer finger and screamed again, “GO TO CUSTOMER SERVICE.”The lines at the customer service counters were 200-300 deep—with, of course, most of the stations open because AA only had 2-3 people working to assist the hundreds of passengers with missed connections.American cannot help the weather, but the lousy operation in Charlotte they can help, and the lousy customer service from all involved made it worse."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst airline ever. Rudest customer service I’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with.,"WWow, what a horrible all around experience with American Airlines. What a horrible horrible way to be treated by anyone. Airline? I’m not sure if you can even call yourself that after the way everyone in Miami was treated tonight. You knew there was a problem when you were offering vouchers the night before. But the whole next day. We were all lead to believe our flights were good to go. I’m guessing ya’ll new they weren’t. Not a peep from you guys. All the communication you have at your disposal. So instead of canceling within a reasonable time period. After letting everyone flock to a place with almost no cars, no hotel rooms. You just left everyone to rot for the night. No vouchers, no rooms, certainly no cars. But let’s not kid ourselves. Y’all really don’t care anyway. Airlines used to be committed to service. Over bookings were common. But airlines had the decency to compensate people for their lost time. Mostly people were happy to do it. Somewhere between then and now. Probably right around the time we saved your asses with your second government bailout. You just stopped giving a rip. You Americans Airlines, how can you even call yourself that. You just sentenced 1000 people in Miami to rot in an airport. With no hope of finding a bed tonight. We just get bumped and canceled.  No compensation. Not even an I’m sorry. Just a four hour line two get booked two days from now. Or get the hell out. That’s how you treated us. Mothers kids old folks. During a pandemic. You told an extraordinarily large group of people to f@#$ off. Were about to do the same to you. Americans against American Airlines is growing in popularity and traction. You can not continue to treat us like this. If I don’t get a formal apology for every man woman and child in Miami International. Some reasonable form of compensation would go a long way. If this does not happen. My boycott of American Airlines will be felt."
Date of travel: April 2021,40,Great Stewart Service,"I had a great steward on my flight  segment  from Flint, MI to Chicago on April 8th on my way to Greensboro, NC.  He was on top of his game and made the flight more enjoyable.  Way to go for making American Eagle customers feel well taken care of."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Ms,"I have never encountered worst employees in my life. These people they hate their job and they have no shame to show it. Ground staff by the gate (D1) totally useless, rude, disinterested (Rachel). Never again"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Separated from family,When we booked our tickets we had chosen seats next to one another. When we signed in we were separated. This is not acceptable!!! They pack the plan full to capacity durning a pandemic and then separate you from family.  The seating system is a crock of crap!!!!! Flights are always nerve wrecking as it is. They could at least allow us to keep our seats together!!!! This really ruins the entire trip!!!! All starts with American!!!
Date of travel: January 2021,20,The seats were very uncomfortable,"It was my first time on a plane and after I got off the plane my back was in pain because of the uncomfortable seats I just wish they had more space in between and leaned back a little bit more, even though it’s only economy they should still provide some form of comfort."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Terrible Airline,"This is by far the worst airline I have ever experienced before. This was our second time flying with American, we flew from Atlanta to Miami. No problem. Then, we flew from Miami to Marsh Harbour. 2 hour delay, no big deal. After our week stay in the Bahamas, we had no trouble whatsoever getting to Miami. However, there was a storm in Miami and they had to delay our flight multiple times to Atlanta, which was understandable. Then, they decide to cancel it. Now it’s understandable because of the weather, but you would think they could plan it out better. Atlanta is a huge hub for American Airlines so you would think they would find another flight for the 50+ people on the flight. Instead, they leave us all stranded, waiting in a never ending line of people. I kid you not, that night extended 2 miles down the airport. I can’t even imagine the amount of stress and chaos American Airlines put on so many families that night. Instead of helping us out or rebooking it, they make everyone fend for themselves. Now most airlines like Delta or Southwest would never let this happen and if it did, they would refund the passengers or reschedule. American did nothing AT ALL in this matter. We had to book a last minute flight to Birmingham with our luggage still stuck in Miami. It’s 10 at night, very stressful to book a flight last minute. Our car keys and house keys still in Miami. American did nothing to help out.  So now we’re stuck here driving 2 1/2 hours to Atlanta from Birmingham with no help from American Airlines. This happened to our flight to Chicago. That got cancelled too and we had to drive 10 hours to Atlanta. Again, American did nothing at all about that flight. They didn’t even refund us. I’m not even mad about the weather cancelling the flight. It’s just so disappointing that they care so little about their customers, who pay a lot of money to fly their airlines. They don’t help reschedule the multiple flights they cancel on a daily basis, and they don’t care about their passengers AT ALL. The fact that they were so disorganized to allow this to happen in the first place and they put multiple people through this chaos is so frustrating and disappointing. I will never fly with American Airlines again and I will make sure other people hear of these multiple incidents as well."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"When you  have a choice, fly with another airlin","I had paid for a ticket using my Chase Credit Card portal and and to cancel a flight since it was during Covid. I spoke to American agent at the time of cancellation and he said that the flight amount would be credited. I received a call back 5 hours after I made the call and the agent Heather told me that they would charge me $50 to rebook the flight that would cost $130.  After I informed her that at the time of the booking last year, they had a waiver in place.  She started to lecture me about how they normally would not even allow for a change or credit and the $50 was because I used a vendor through my Chase rewards. She told me that there was nothing that she could do after rubbing it in that American Airlines was somehow gracious that they allow for a change.  I guess she must have not heard about Covid.  I know for certain that it was on their site that all change fees were waived.  Next time I will take the rewards as cash and book it with directly with an airline and definitely no with American Airlines.  I hope one of the AA executives reads this and perhaps review AA's policy on the meaning to waiving all fees!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Hell has nor fury like American Airlines,"My first class flight got canceled so I had to rebook, now back to main cabin with no options to find any other decent seat. 2 hours worth of delays. Reschedule the connection flight. Finally make it to Dallas and one guy says I need new tags for my bags. Counter lady says no. I said “are you sure because I can’t risk these not making it”... you see I’m a golf pro heading to play in a tournament so I NEED my clubs!  But she says no problem! They’ll be there!Well guess what, THEYRE NOT HERE!I’m done with AA. No more, they just don’t care"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,HORRIBLE,"Absolutely the worst airline I have ever experienced in my entire 27 years of traveling. I’m shocked that I even have the energy to write this review but holy crap. Lost my luggage, canceled 3 flights, sat in the airport for 12 hours, would not give a hotel or a food voucher. Eventually I decided to spend $500 to get a rental car so that I could get to my destination. Which, ended up changing since we got stuck in Charlotte, NC and not Fort Myers, FL. So, thank you American Airlines. For really wasting my time and my money. I will never be back. (I’m sure you don’t care since you rob people blind everyday)"
Date of travel: April 2021,40,More money = Less Covid,"First class was allowed to obtain drinks on the flight, yet those in coach were not allowed to have drinks due to covid. This doesn’t make sense logically. You’re already packing everyone into a plane and allowed people to take their masks off to eat or drink, but you’re not letting members in non-1st class seats procure drinks?!!! Makes no sense. Yes it’s minor and i wasn’t very upset at all.. just an observation of something that doesn’t make sense."
Date of travel: April 2021,40,Great Problem Solving,"I wanted to think Wayne, Supervisor  of Philadelphia International American Airlines baggage claim department for understanding my taken bag and personally retrieving it from a customers home, who was otherwise unable to transport it to the airport. Thank you so much for your patience, understanding, and determination to make sure your customer was well taken care of. THANK YOU for your EXCEPTIONAL customer service!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Never flying with this airlines,"Rude staffing, greedy carrier with no flexible cancellation/credit options. They gave me flight credit and it seems like they inflate their prices when you call to apply the credit so they can make their initial profit. That’s scheming in my opinion."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Don’t do it.,"I travel for work. I am often on 8 flights a week. American Airlines has been kind enough to furnish me with the absolute worst flight experience I have ever had. The seats are cramped, the over head bins are small, they gauge you for what they call over weight checked bags (over 50lbs), and the staff is unremarkable.As if all that was not enough, they stuff the flights full, I mean every seat during a pandemic.Thank You American Air, for narrowing my list of flight options. Never again!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst scam of the day,"The likeliness I will recommend is actually a ZERO!!! I fly A LOT. The check bag policy on American Air is deceiving and difficult to locate through their app. The weight limits are low and their “overweight” fees are high ($100/bag over 50lbs).  Additionally, I could not book a seat without paying extra. I was told a seat would be assigned to me. Finally, in a time where people are being advised to “social distance” and stay 6 feet away from each other, American Air seems to think that “shoe-horning” every inch of capacity is a good idea, filling every seat.I was traveling for business, and the usual airline I use did not have a last-minute available seat so I shifted to American Air. I fly over 350K miles annually with well over 130 flight legs per year. I will NEVER FLY AMERICAN AIR AGAIN. I caution anyone looking to book a flight... use any other carrier, just avoid American."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,American Airlines is the worst!! Never again!,"I have never been so frustrated in my entire life! This is my first bad review I have ever written and I’m 36 years old. I’m the most patient/kindest person you will ever meet but today was so emotional for me! It started in Montego Bay Airport. We arrived 2 hours before our flight that was headed to Dallas. We received notice of a delay due to mechanical problems and our flight moved from 10:45am to 2:00pm. Then to 3:45pm. We got in line to see what our options were because we were also told this flight could be postponed until late and we needed to get back home to our kids plus my husband has to work the next day! It was also my sons birthday and his party the next day so we needed to make it home! After waiting 2 hours in the slowest, longest line ever, we were told that others would be boarding that gate soon for the next flight and we needed to move to another gate. Everyone started running and people at the very end of that line were able to make it to the front of the line! After hours of waiting to change our flights, this was very upsetting! People way behind us were now in front of us and we were pushed back even farther! So again after waiting at this new gate line for another hour and 20 minutes, we were moved AGAIN! So that another flight could be ready for boarding! So now we have waited over 3 hours and now are running to another gate! This time we were 4th in line and also found out that the flight to Dallas is now moving from 3:45pm to 6:00pm but not confirmed for that time either for departure and our connecting flight will now be changed to the next day making us stay in Dallas! So now after 30 minutes at this 3rd gate line, I finally get waited on after issues with computers being down! (I didn’t think this day could get any worse)! A gentleman helped me name Orland. He was frustrated and rude when he got to me and told me i should wait for the Dallas flight and stay there overnight. I explained we would rather leave sooner and see what else we could do to get to our final destination of Nashville. He said our only option was to leave on the Miami flight at 5:30pm and we would stay the night there and leave the next day to Nashville later than what Dallas would be. He was so rude and unapologetic for the situation and said there was nothing else available although he didn’t take the time to check, we were dismissed quickly. As were others that he waited on. Several people complaining! Frustrated, I took my tickets back and walked away. As we were looking for somewhere to charge our phones, we seen another American Airlines gate and a lady behind the desk with no one in line. We decided to ask her to see if she would be able to help us! Her name was Gracian! She politely said she would look and within literally 2 minutes said you can leave on a Miami flight and get to Nashville. I said oh the one where we would arrive at 7:45pm the next day? And she said no, you will arrive to your final destination tonight! My eyes teared up and I couldn’t believe after everything we’d been through, all the hours of waiting, this sweet wonderful, kind girl found us a flight that quickly bc she took the time to help us! She was the ONLY good thing about Montego Bay Airport with American Airlines! So she set us up to leave at 5:30pm! Finally, after being at this airport since 8:30am! I called my son to tell him the happy news and our sitter! Then the delays start coming through in my email! Delayed until 5:45pm, delayed until 6:20pm until finally they say 7:02pm departing! My stomach was literately sick! We would now arrive in Miami which is an hour ahead at 9:30pm! Our connecting flight was 10:30pm! We still tried to be positive! As soon as we landed, my husband and I as well as 7 other passengers for this flight took off running! Rushed through customs, ran up and down stairs, down the long hallways all the way to the bagging area to get our checked bag. We made it there at 9:50pm. At this point we are all dripping sweat and of course out of breath with masks on trying to get to this flight! It look 13 more minutes before the bags started to show! Grabbing ours at 10:10pm we took off running again to the gate! We made it at 10:18pm!! 10:18!!! And were told Sorry, too late! I could have fell to the floor sobbing. I could barely catch my breath! So you mean to tell me after we waited ALL DAY! Delay after delay, gate line to gate line, HOURS STANDING WAITING! This flight couldn’t wait just 10 minutes for 8 passengers that have went through hell to let us board on a plane that was scheduled to leave at 10:30pm! It was 10:18pm!! This was so devastating! Then we are given a voucher for the hotel and told to wait outside for the shuttle to pick us up to take us to the hotel American Airlines Chose for us! After waiting outside for I don’t even know how long, exhausted and defeated, we ask another hotel shuttle if we were standing in the right spot for ours and was told that hotel doesn’t have a shuttle! ARE YOU KIDDING ME! My husband goes back in and is told how sorry they are and we now have to pay for taxi! The taxi ride was $57.22 to the hotel they chose for us and we have to pay for a taxi again to get back to the airport in the morning! So now we are out $114.00 so basically we are now paying for a hotel! It’s now 11:45pm and we have just now made it to our room! We left Sandals Ochi resort at 6:45am to head to Montego Bay Airport! It was a 2 hour drive from there! We have been up since 4:50am! And now finally laying at 1:25am! This Airline just ruined our perfect vacation! I will never forget how they made us feel today! Like we weren’t important at all! And now we are dreading tomorrow getting back on this Airline to try and make it home. We have a 2 hour drive from Nashville to get home to Kentucky. I pray for no delays tomorrow, I truly don’t think I can take anymore at this point and I will have a devastated little boy if his birthday party is cancelled!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Passenger,"American Airlines was an epic fail from start to finish  of our planned vacation. You name it from sending us out on a flight without enough foresight to cxl because the connecting flight had been cxled. Overbooked flights, not putting us up in a hotel and losing our luggage. If not for the attendants behind the counters  I would give the worst rating possible. We heard worse or just as bad stories from other passengers . Whatever is going on with them I would not trust them to fly you in the air if they are this mismanaged. DO NOT TRUST AA TO TAKE CARE OF YOU"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Don’t fly your pets with American,"I had a flight leaving Thursday night with my dog because she was getting rehomed. They told us to get there 2 hours early to check in. We did our paperwork and went to inspect the kennel, one lady said it was too small for our dog while the person taking the cargo approved it and said it was ok. Ultimately they said no to crate and we asked if we could run to Walmart 10 minutes away to grab a new one, they said no you won’t make it back in time we’re closing. We were upset because we were rehoming our dog but it was okay since we could spend 2 more nights with her. Saturday rolls around and this time she gets onto the flight. They say to give food and water and they’ll clean out the kennel on the connecting flight. When she arrived at her destination her kennel was full of pee and poop and her water hasnt been open or given to her. Never fly your pets with American."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,WORST SERVICE!,"When I say HORRIBLE, I mean just HORRIBLE!!!!  Customer service. With a line of 10 people trying board before flight takes off they took their sweet time with people who were there like 20 min before us. They made us lose our flight and then made it seem like it was our fault after standing there 45 minutes . They took NO ACCOUNTABILITY. They showed no empathy! Horrible. Never again."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Bad Experience: Budget Rental via American Airlines,"My flight to NC was canceled late on 4/9/2021. I called the Budget rental car counter in Asheville, and told them I’d need to pick it up the next day. They said no problem.Next day, I had to fly into Knoxville, because there weren’t any flights into Asheville with available seats. So my daughter picked me up and we drive two hours to Asheville to pick up the car. I got there and Budget DOUBLED MY RATE!!! 6 days cost went from $406 to $963.So I can’t ever recommend Budget/AVIS to anyone.The person behind the counter was supposedly powerless. I called Budget customer service, and they blamed their system and said they could NOT help. I obviously chose not to rent with their changed terms.This is the very definition of treating a paying customer terribly. I had set up the rental through the American Airlines website. I’ll be leaving a review there, as well."

Date of travel: April 2021,10,LDRs Need Better Reliability Than This!,"My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. This said, we desperately need airlines to be on top of their A-game without costing us an arm and a leg. Every. Single. Dang. Time. We have flown with American Airlines, we have been horrifically screwed over. Take today, for example, when his flight out of RDU was scheduled to start boarding at 5:30 (taking off in just enough time to make his connecting flight in Miami- he has work tomorrow morning and cannot miss his second flight)... and he has JUST NOW, at SIX FIFTEEN P.M. EST, STARTED TO BOARD THE FLIGHT. THIS IS NOT OKAY. This is the 6th time this/something similar has happened to us while flying AA. I wanted to leave this review everywhere I could to deter anybody from ever flying with them. I would absolutely never ever recommend it. This is not a one-time mistake. This is appalling and I cannot believe this airline is still running a business. FIX this massive timing issue and disrespect towards your patrons, or we will never fly with AA again!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst First Class Service,"I traveled from Denver to Dallas on American First Class, but when I arrived to the lounge, I was told that I couldn’t access even though I am a Gold British Airways member.I was told by the lady at the reception desk that “fly other airline next time”. That is what I’m going to do next time, unfortunately I didn’t do it this time.I will only fly American if I have no other choice,"
Date of travel: January 2021,40,Enjoyable,"My flight from Mazatlan was actually 2 flights with a change of planes in Dallas,but basically a short stop and then the same business class seat arrangement form DFW to Chicago.In any event,2 by 2 seating with pleasant flight attendants and a couple of cocktails so enjoyable enough experience."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Left cameras on plane,I took my go pro out to film us landing soon so I deplaned i realized I left it told customer service I left it can I go check they said they will look for me came up nothing i don’t understand I was not off the plane for two minutes before I realized it let everyone deplane then we will go look for you no luck finding it told me to file a report online and they will keep searching for it 500 dollar go pro setup yeah right felt like I was flying with spirit airlines all they had to do was let me go back and check for my self the cleaners off the plane will check for it that’s what in was told if they find it they will turn it I  to lost and found  So at this point I just filed the report online and took it as a lost I just couldn’t understand why they would not let me go check for myself after the plane deplaned Suspicious especially after I told her what was left why would you report it over a walkietalkie instead of letting me go right back and check
n/a,20,Airline allowed non-masked people on flight,"On our return flight from Dallas to Madison (originated in FT Myers), we heard the Federal mask policy. We then saw the pilot wear the gator-type of mask which was banned. He was is the cockpit as we boarded, mask off, eating a sub sandwich. We were also told zero tolerance for not wearing masks on the flight, and masks have to cover your nose. We saw several people who would put the mask up/on ONLY as the flight attendant walked by. As the flight went on, they became more brazen, and would not even pull up/on the mask. The attendants totally saw, but did NOTHING! We also heard them say on the flight to ""observe social distancing."" How could we do that when the flight was FULL! There were ZERO empty seats! We did NOT feel safe!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Left with no money or ability to fly,"HORRENDOUS customer experience.  I booked a flight for my daughter to come home at Thanksgiving.  Circumstances prevented her from doing that.  After a few additional failed attempts to bring her home, she went missing.  As a result, I reached out to both American Airlines AND Priceline to obtain either a refund or to transfer the tickets to someone else in my family.  As I am sure you are aware, persons that cannot be located cannot board one of your flights.  After in excess of 10 phone calls, emails, forms, and chats on your website, each company told me to contact the other and that there was nothing that could be done on their end.  Priceline had no difficulty charging my credit card but quickly passed the buck when asking for assistance in these very unusual circumstances.  American Airlines was no better!  Responses, treatment, and unwillingness to assist by both organizations was disgusting!  Anyone out there looking to book with either of these companies should expect that if everything does not go according to plan, you are simply left to deal with that on your own and will fully absorb the costs.  Don’t book with either!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,I thought United was bad until I flew American Airlines,"Staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. My husband and I who were on the same reservation tried to change seats so we could sit together. We were told that the computer, despite us being on the same reservation, randomly picks seats and if we wanted to sit together we would have to pay, even though there was seats together available and the flight was already boarding. Luckily humanity is still kind (even if America Airlines is not) and a lady offered to switch so me and my husband could sit together on my birthday flight! I used the think United customer service and value was bad, now I see that compared to American Airlines they are amazing. Although, the only US airline that is actually good, offering amazing service and customer satisfaction is Alaska Airlines. Flying in America continues to disappoint and I would advice anyone to stay well clear of American Airlines."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Weather and communication,DFW held us in COS for 2 hours and then we were held in DFW.  Signage is bad in DFW.  No one communicated what was happening.
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Pauline from AA customer service is AWESOME,"A note of sincere and heartfelt gratitude to Pauline, a customer service rep with AA.First, my family and I have been AA travelers for over 15 years. (We have flown many other airlines. Most airlines have the good with the bad; AA still provided the best service most of the time.) My family encountered an issue with a scheduled flight.  Pauline immediately recognized my level of distress and went to work. She very carefully researched my situation. It took some time together on the phone; however, the situation was completely and most satisfactorily resolved. My family and I are grateful to her and to her supervisor who worked dilently and mindfully."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,BUY FROM ANY OTHER AIRLINE!!,"PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY FROM ANY OTHER AIRLINE!Once again, American airlines disappoints!After boarding into the airplane, they tell us we have to wait an hour for a ""light that needs maitenance"". Then, 40 min before arriving into Lima, they tell us that due to a ""communication"" issue, the airport is ""closed"" and they need to reroute us to another Eucador. Once we land in Ecuador, they tell us that they are taking us to Lima but we ran out of fuel so we have to wait for american airlines staff to get to the airport from home, because they are not on site.we were in a FULL FLIGHT (no social distancing) for AN EXTRA 3.5 HOURS DURING A PANDEMIC!!To make matters worse, when I call to change my return flight, they tell me I need to buy ANOTHER FLIGHT, because I bought economy. WHEN IT CLEARLY SAID ON THEIR WEBSITE that they offer free change of flights. So they want to charge me 700 usd to buy another return flight when I explained I had a medical reason to change my flight.NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE THIS AIRLINE.ITS NOT WORTH IT! Pay the extra bit of money and save yourself the nightmare!American airlines customer service does NOT care about customers."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,They Suck!!!!!,"Seriously before boarding the plane they asked...”do you have any items with batteries in your bag” we said yes. So they tagged out bag. Later they stopped takeoff and called out my husband asking what would be vibrating in his bag my vibrator or his razor 🤷🏻‍♀️ “acting unaware there was anything with batteries” then called him out in front of everyone on the plane as the reason the plane was late for departure. Um, no, sorry dumbasses - our bag was tagged for items having batteries before we boarded the plane. Not to mention switching our flights lists minute. I’ll never fly with this piece of crap airline again. Frontier is way better than this."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Dirty and crowded!,Despite claims that they clean thoroughly after each flight we found  this to be a big lie. The tray at my son's seat were not cleaned as there were visible crumbs on it. My son also tried to use the vomit bag but we found the bag already having been used by another flyer and then put back in the pocket. Imagine how things were like pre-covid if these are the standards they go by!
Date of travel: April 2021,20,A downgrade from Delta Airlines,"We choose American Airlines to get to a wedding in Las Vegas since Delta’s tickets are too expensive for the Easter weekend and looking for a cheaper way to get there, But I was worried that it would be a huge downgrade from Delta due to “Project Oasis” where there are no IFE’s and lack of legroom inside of their planes and I was right. Despite most our flights being early, we were tightly packed like sardines and you have to bring your own device for entertainment, a huge downgrade from their previous cabins. And adding to the pandemic, they lack social distancing measures and still call groups instead of boarding from front to back, and so the COVID virus could cause outbreaks on certain flights. I am not happy at American Airlines about their service the lack of IFE and their new oasis cabin cramming more seats and less legroom. It’s like flying in the 1980s. Until American can address these issues, I may not fly with them again."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,No flexibility or helpfulness whatsoever,"I have anxiety. Which is why I choose seats that are window seats. Instead I got a seat next to a wall that increased my anxiety. Had I not taken my benzo I would have experienced a full blown panic attack. My flight was switched by the airline after I had specifically picked seats that were supposed to by by the window. On my second flight I purposely asked if I had a window as I have a diagnosis of anxiety. The check in person flight 866 disregarded my concerns and was not helpful in the least and then abruptly just turned to another person to have a conversation l. American Airlines is the worst. I have a diagnosis of panic attacks that is a symptom of my anxiety. I choose a window seat to alleviate those symptoms. And they are condescending and unprofessional. Also, during a continued PANDEMIC all seats were full. How is that social distancing. Worst airline ever."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"Unprepared, unorganized and bad customer service","Put on a plane that had mechanical issues, had to change planes resulting in a missed connection. They did not even try to help the 140 passengers, went to several agents who told us we had to go to customer service. We couldn't get a flight online or by calling either. The rebook line was an hour long. I have never seen such an unorganized place. They should have been prepared with rebookings when we landed, i will never fly this airline again. They only care about filling the planes to maximum!"
Date of travel: April 2021,40,More ammenities,"Could definitely tell the difference between this airline and some of the budget ones starting with the fact that they still handed out snacks.  Although I can’t figure out why they handed them out on our flight from Cozumel but not from Dallas.  There was lots of onboard entertainment options.My only complaint is that our luggage did not arrive in Chicago at the same time.  They did have someone deliver it to our home the next day.  However, it had our wet snorkeling gear from our last morning snorkel trip and now our suitcase smells very musty.  Praying we can get the smell out- it’s brand new."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Flight change ,"Customer service was unprofessional and inconsiderate. This is the worst airline to travel with and I highly recommend not traveling with AA. I called to change a flight and was told it would cost $111 by one representative. After giving some thought I decided to pay the $111. When I called back, I was told their would be an extra charge of $50. This business needs to be consistent and professional. The representative I spoke with lacked compassion and understanding and should not be in his position. He seemed frustrated and put out with helping me change my flight. Don’t fly American. I never will again!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Never will fly American Airlines again,"My flight for the 2nd time in 3 months was delayed. This time due to maintenance. Flight was to leave at 2:30. Flight now after the 5th delay is set to leave at 8:15. I was told they would provide me w a hotel room in charlotte. I dont want to go stay overnight in charlotte. Grace at the ticket counter in Mobile told me maintenance “ wasnt an american airlines issue”. And when i questioned this threatened to call security on me and was extremely racist to me, an Asian american. When i asked for a voucher or something for my inconvenience i was told they dont do that. This is the second time i was unable to g home due to AA delays. Will never fly again."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,The most incompetent service,"American Airlines changed our flight number and in the process screwed up our ability to check in online. We have called them multiple times, all four of us, and they have not helped us one bit. This is the worst service I have ever seen. I do not Recommend this airline. They have totally messed up everything but are too incompetent to fix it. The SVP of customer service needs to be fired immediately."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,I’d rather walk,"Rude employees. Always late. Does not follow CDC guidelines. Each and every time I’ve flown American, it was never my choice and always the last resort. I have never been impressed these city buses with wings. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst experience,My flight was delayed because of COVID 19 because of results it turns out it was fine I lost my flight it took a couple of days to get to El Salvador one of my packages then I paid $300 to take to a Salvador came a week late because it got lost on the way here from Houston I received my box and it was crushed side to side top to top and all I received from the airline don’t bring anything fragile through the airport they’re not liable plus all the money I spent and what I had inside the box was broke crushed I wouldn’t recommend this airline ever to anyone or my family!
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Airlines care about nobody,They Denied passage to visa users who respect every rule about traveling. Immigration airlines just denied their passage . Didn't let me speak to my family members nor contact them since they took away their communication devices. I feel soo much happy that I am not able to speak to my love ones nor find out they are actually safe and fine. Even the immigration airline have to regards to Americans citizens nor respect. Gladly spoke to them and at the end they will disrespect you and hand up on you. While they go home and sleep as of no worrys  is going on to others.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"American Airlines has HORRIBLE customer service!!!! Lengthy, but worth the read!","So yesterday, we booked the last flight out of New Orleans to come back to Texas. We flew American Airlines. We were completely checked in but I got hung up at security because if an issue with my ticket/ID. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 5:40pm, we made it to our gate right after they announced the final boarding call, right at 5:30pm. The lady (we now know her name is Tatiana)at the gate was assisting a man in front of us, then pushed us back, moved the sign and said its too late, the flight is closed...we tried to ask why the man directly in front of us was allowed on, but she slammed the door in our faces and was gone. We stood there asking for assistance, people waiting on a different flight were appalled at what had just happened and how we were treated and tried to help us by getting someone to come over and help us. Finally, the person taking tickets at the next gate got a supervisor to come over to talk to us. The supervisor said they had already dropped the seats and did the weight (we found out later that was a lie)and thats why we weren't allowed to board. Justin explained to her that Tatiana had allowed another person to board directly in front of us, so that didn't make sense. After a back and forth between them, she finally tells Justin that the reason we were denied boarding the plane was because the gentleman Tatiana had allowed on had been waiting standby and she had given him one of our 3 seats, so instead of telling him he wouldn't be able to fly, she left the 3 of us (one of which is a child) who had PURCHASED our tickets stranded. The supervisor then gives us tickets to North Carolina to connect to a flight there that was heading to DFW. So, we get to North Carolina, get to the connecting flight, only to be told the flight is full and there were no other flights out that night, so we would have to stay and take a flight out the next day. We had to spend $110 on a hotel, $60 on ubers to and from the airport/hotel and another $60 on personal hygiene product and food. We were treated HORRIBLY by American Airlines! Our seats were stolen and resold(with ZERO compensation), we were left destitute and stranded in 2 completely different states, and there was ZERO effort to make anything right with us! I had to miss work, Kyra had to miss another day of school, not to mention the extra $200+ dollars we were forced to spend to stay the night in North Carolina. American Airlines should be ashamed of themselves for having employees like Tatiana who think its amusing AND funny (yes, she smirked and made it a point to stay in our line of sight while I was panicking not knowing what to do or where to go or how we were going to get home) to leave a family with a child stranded because she gave away purchased tickets to a single man flying standby. The kicker.... When we were checking in at the kiosk, another American Airlines worker walked up and asked us if we wanted to voluntarily give up our seats to standby for $200 vouchers to use later and we said NO...when Justin asked about this, the supervisor told him that since they took our seats and we didn't voluntarily give them up that that was no longer an offer for us."
Date of travel: March 2021,30,Decently standard cattle bus,"I had a very few flights with AA. It is (I would say) decently standard cattle bus. I don't have interaction with their customer service, since my company takes care of that little nuisance. Crew does their job without much of excitement. I have to admit, the pilot was in his NASCAR mood. He pushed that 737 to the limit on take off and did some speedy landing at DFW. Otherwise, few other flights were nothing to write home."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Aggressive gate agent,"This past week I travelled from DFW to LAX. My husband and I were traveling with our kitten and were pretty overwhelmed. I made it to the gate by the time they were boarding group 6. My husband was taking care of the bags & kitten while I was holding our tickets. I was trying to scan our passes in but the lady behind me was trying to scan hers when I wasn't even done. The agent did not say anything to her.  After I scanned in both passes I made my way to the airplane thinking my husband was behind me. On my way to boarding the attendant was screaming for me to come back. As I returned to the agent she asked me If there was a problem. I was a bit confused because I was too busy making sure we got to our seats safely with our kitten and luggage. I responded simply with no there is not. I proceeded to go back to the bridge to board the airplane and the agent again told me to come back, asking again if I had a problem when I responded yet again, no I do not but is there a problem here? She proceeded to take our tickets and asked my husband and I to sit down. At this point, we were confused as to what was going on. The agent after boarding the other travelers stated that I ""ripped"" the tickets out of her hand and walked away so she wanted me to apologize. She was very aggressive in tone and kept talking over us. When my husband said she embarrassed us she said ""no I didn't""... A far cry from someone who is well versed in customer service should say. She proceeded to say she would not let us get on to the flight without acknowledging “my actions.” At this point we were very concerned about making our flight as well as feeling threatened. You see we have spent thousands of dollars as @americianairlines gold members and remained loyal to AA without issues in the past.Furthermore, as two working professionals #nursepractitioner #businesssystemsanalyst we have never been in such a predicament. We asked to speak to the supervisor because we could see that this agent had no intention to de-escalate the situation, however she said she was the supervisor and she ""determines who gets on the plane"" In the end we got on to our flight and made it home safely. My husband and I had written to AA and both received a cookie cutter response (exactly the same email). For this reason I am posting this to get their attention. As a health care professional I practice with humility, and care, I read the room and as stressful as an agent's jobs can be I felt attacked and discriminated against. This agent had every intention of picking a fight and getting a response out of me but I held back. Never once did I raise my voice, call her names or even utter a curse word.  People are going through tons of adversities in their personal life and one interaction can easily be misunderstood. But as a long time customer of @aa I am gravely disappointed in the lack of professionalism and code of conduct displayed by their staff. Your staff is a representation of your company, and the email response  I received was a pathetic sorry. This needs to be rectified as no individual should feel bullied, singled out or discriminated against. You no longer have my loyalty AA. I will be taking my business elsewhere. @AMERICANAIRLINES #americanairlines #cookiecutterresponse #discriminiation #getyourdepartmenttogether #humility #professionalism #healthcareprofessional #techguy #travel #nursepractitioner #dissapointed"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"Horrible customer service, Racist, rude. AA had myself plus 1 on standby for 12hrs, while every Caucasian that missed a flight gets prioritized. Never again!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,A poorly managed airline in virtually every way,"American Air is a poorly managed company.   It is so bad that it needs to be regulated, graded, and penalized.   Check-in online is aweful, too many bugs to begin.  Check-in at ticketing is poor, little help and they have a terrible attitude.   Bag check was a helpful attendant but the lines were way too long.  Pre-boarding was a circus more for the benefit of AA's on-time departure than customer service.  The meal for a coast to coast flight was a very small bottle of water and some pretzels.  The attendants acted like thugs.   One literally berated me and prodded me on the shoulder multiple times for having my mask down to take a drink.   After multiple iterations of it, I went to the attendants area at the back of the plane and explained how disrespectful and improper she was.   It took an extremely long time to de-plane, no guidance, no organization, no instruction.   We all commented that this was the longest de-plane process we had ever experienced.   The cumulative flights represented behind this review by my family are hundreds, probably thousands. Finally, the seat comfort and leg room are unacceptable for a cross-country flight.   Amerian, just because you can get away with it does not mean it is a responsible business practice."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,DON’T DO BUSINESS WITH AMERICAN,"It’s sad that I have to spend anymore time out of my day on American Airlines but the service was/is so absurd that I hope this review prevents anyone else from wasting their time and money. From the beginning to the end of our trip it was absolutely horrific due to the lack of customer service as well as the lack of knowledge of every employee we had an encounter with from American. We got to the Nashville airport on March 27th to set out for our journey to Aruba, our flight was delayed due to severe storms (not an issue, this is beyond anyone’s control). When we finally depart and land in Charlotte we were told that it was too late to board our connecting flight as it had already left the gate. We were told there were no more flights out to Aruba for the day so we would be staying over night and the next flight wasn’t until 9am on March 28th, we had to go pick up our baggage and book a hotel room in Charlotte for the night. When we arrived to the baggage claim my brand new suitcase had a wheel broken off and we had to drag it through the airport...shortly after we received a text message on our phones from American that our flight that we had so called “missed” was delayed and we had 15 mins before departure...we ran straight to check in and the lady proceeds to tell us that we cannot make the flight and refused to call and have them hold the flight given the circumstances that were beyond our control. A manager came out and again tells us that we cannot board the flight and meanwhile we received yet another notification that the flight had been delayed once more!! Come to find out it had mechanical issues and returned to the gate but they would not let us in. We then complain that we were missing one night in Aruba, one night of our house rental, and had to pay more money to book a hotel room...the manager hands us a voucher but it didn’t give us any better of a discount than hotels.com. March 28th, we arrive to the airport several hours early to make sure that everything was square. It took the man at check in 30 mins to check our family of 6 in. We get our boarding passes and move along. When we arrived to our gate a lady brought us my daughters passport, the man who checked us in forgot to hand it back over to us. As we were about to board our flight the lady at the gate stops me and proceeds to tell me that we cannot board because we did not have a boarding pass for my one year old daughter when in fact I had both mine and my daughters boarding passes in my hand and mine clearly said “includes infant boarding pass”. I stood there as they held up the line for several minutes to find out that we needed to pay taxes, $16.95 to be exact - why didn’t the man at the front collect those before sending us on?! Not to mention - I called American weeks in advance to add my one year old daughter to our reservations and the woman over the phone assured me that my daughter was all set round-trip. We waited awhile longer, my entire family is on the flight and the attendants are saying they are closing the gate, the lady couldn’t figure out how to correct whatever issue they were having entering this information into their system, the person on the phone was unable to assist so she asked if she could write my credit card information down that way we could go ahead and board and they could run it once it was all straightened out. I gave the okay only because I was quite frankly over it at that point and I shut my card off once we got to our destination - but really, all of that nonsense over $16.95?! We landed in Aruba and went straight to the American office to file the claim on my damaged suitcase and before I could provide any information the man basically told me to shut my mouth and at this point I was About to lose my mind - my dad came over to handle the situation as I was fuming and he was given a “Damaged Baggage Receipt” and was told that we would need to contact customer service once we arrive back to the U.S. to have my bag sent out for repair. April 4th, the dreaded day of leaving Paradise arrives, and what’s worse is the thought of having to go back through American Airlines to return home - I was hopeful that it would be smooth this go around and we would make it home without any issues...It gets worse. We arrived 4 hours early, it took 2 hours to get through customs and then we waited. I checked our stroller in at the gate (it was pink ticketed - we had no issues with this the first go around) the man tells us that we would have it waiting for us when we stopped for our layover in Miami to catch our connecting flight to Nashville. Awesome, everything was going smoothly. We land in Nashville, myself and 2 other families with infants waited around for 20-30 mins for our strollers, and were given the run around about where they were until finally we were told that the strollers were sent with our checked baggage and we would pick it up in the baggage claim area when we get to our destination (pretty odd but didn’t have any more time to waste as I had an hour until my connecting flight departed, not to mention the fact that I now had to carry my daughter and two bags all the way through the Miami airport from gate 10 to gate 60J). Once we got to Nashville I had another long distance to the baggage claim, again carrying my daughter on my hip and two bags all to get there and the stroller didn’t arrive. I went over to American’s customer service office and the man told me that I should have gotten my stroller in Miami at the gate, they never would have put it with the regular baggage and all he can do is have it shipped to Nashville and I would have to come back to Nashville and pick it up, at this point I’m going off. I apologized as I knew it wasn’t his fault for all of the issues along the way but I live and hour and a half away and I should not have to make a trip back because they made an error and can’t seem to get their crap together. He goes on to tell me that if I didn’t want to proceed that way then all I can do is call customer service and didn’t bother to help me with my damaged suitcase. I got home around midnight last night, I had a fussy baby after traveling all day and work this morning - once I got off work I made the call to customer service...I waited on hold for just under an hour when the message on the phone continuously repeated that my wait time should only be around 10 mins, once I finally got through to a representative she tells me that all of the information I was given in Nashville last night was incorrect and the man I spoke with should have filed a claim. I then go on to tell her about my broken luggage and she tells me that even though I have an incident number they should have accessed my bag, given me a replacement or sent it out for repair (none of this happened) I drug the thing through the airport with a missing wheel, a baby (no stroller) and 2 other bags. You would think American would give a hand but clearly they care nothing about their customers. I explain everything to this woman over the phone, she basically tells me there is nothing she can do other than call the central baggage department and transfer me over to them once she gets ahold of them - false, she transferred me right over without providing them with any information and I was back at square one explaining everything to yet another lady and bless her heart, she was the FIRST and ONLY employee (not with the airline) who was able to help me. Thank you Melanie Vincent, for your support and I hope that they commend you for your service!! Now, let’s hope I can get my suitcase repaired and my stroller back in one piece.To say the least, don’t even think twice. Save yourself the massive load of crap - even if you have to pay extra for a different airline! Oh, and let me just add - my brother posted on Twitter about our experience and American sent my entire family $100 vouchers besides me, when I was the one that had encountered all of these issues. But honestly, what is a $100 American Airline voucher going to do for me other than provide me with another awful flight and rude, ignorant employee customer service? It’s funny they can pass out $100 but it is only good for their services. Never again."

Date of travel: March 2021,10,Surly customer service reps,"Original trip home was booked and paid for through DFW. with a connection on to Boston, Then AA notififies me the flight from DFW has been cancelled.  So they put us on a flight to Phoenix and then the red eye to Boston and charged additional for the ticket change. NEVER again."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Spent money for a First Class Seat and Flight Attendant Laughed in my Face when I Asked her to Enforce Mask Policy .,"I booked in first class only after calling American and being reassured that in First/Business Class there were dedicated flight attendants for the few seats and they were vigorously enforcing the mask policy.On my flight, the man next to me had his mask on his chin the majority of the trip. I asked him to put it on, and he did, once.The flight attendant, Trudie, knew him, as he obviously flies often with his business.She served him 8 glasses of wine, and they were using huge cups, not the regular small size. He was visibly intoxicated. She even opened another bottle for him, at his request, as we were landing. As she stood and talked to him, she had to notice he had on no mask, and he was poking me repeatedly, he was so drunk. She stood in the aisle many times chatting with him, with his mask off.When I asked her to enforce the policy of wearing a mask she told me she did not notice he did not have one on???? and laughed at me.I also wrote to American and got a very standard response reciting the federal law and their policies and telling me how seriously American takes mask wearing, but indicated they were not going to do anything about this.They are not taking the pandemic seriously, misrepresented about enforcement and could care less about their passengers."
n/a,20,Are you kidding me???,"Paid a full fare in Business class from the Dominican Republic to Miami, almost 3 hours AND an international flight. Guess what? Not even a snack!?? A small tiny pretzel packet? Anything? Nope, sorry Mr. Rainville, due to covid, we're not doing food service on this international flight. What? Even Spirit and Allegiant offer some type of snack. Completely ridiculous and unacceptable."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,American Airlines are Puling a fast one on passenger travel,"AA took my reservation and when my credit card provider declined due to needing verification for amount, the airlines dropped the reservation. They said they emailed my 3 times (kind of hard to miss that!). I never got any emails and now when I need to make the reservation again, the flight went from $1900 to $2500.  This trip  is to memorialize my mother. She died of covid over the holidays.  Wen I called to complain, they sent me to their site to email them the complaint. I keep trying to do that but the site only says ""oops something went wrong"". This is the worst airlines and I wouldn't travel with them again!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Unexpected bag AND seat issue.,"I have been frying with American Airlines for a while now, and have always had a pleasant experience until this flight. I have been on MULTIPLE flights with American, and have always flown with the same small suitcase and purse every time. This time, I was asked to check my bag. This was a huge inconvenience because I have NEVER been asked to check my bag, as I have always flown with the same bag. I also had a lot of work to get done during my 2 hour lay over that I was therefore not able to complete because it was in my suitcase. The other issue I had during my flight was that I was basically forced to move seats. I was in my chosen seat for the flight, buckled and ready to go, when a man with the American Airlines crew stopped at my seat, and told me I was in the wrong seat. I then realized I was supposed to be one seat over, so I started to move over. He then pointed to a gentleman behind me, told me it was his seat (even though it was my seat) and told me I needed to move because he and his wife were going to be sitting there for the duration of the flight. Instead of telling me where I would be sitting after that, I awkwardly stood in the small aisle waiting for about 5 minutes for a new seating assignment. I was also not impressed because instead of putting me in an empty row, which there were 2 available, they put me in a full row. I have never been inconvenienced by American Airlines like this, and I am not impressed. This could have been handled MUCH differently."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,AA is the Worst airline ever,"American Airlines sucks.  There is just no other way to describe how bad they really are.  Delays.  Lies.  Poor employee morale.  Horrible management.  This might be one of the worst American companies in existence.  Let them go bankrupt.   On Easter Sunday they changed an 8am flight from Philly to Chicago without notice and rescheduled it for 3pm.  Then failed to communicate that until everyone was at the airport.  Had no employees at the gate. Lied about the reason for the change.  Had flight screen say the flight took off when we were all seated at the gate.  Delayed the flight another 1-1/2 hours to 4:30 then, after people left the gate area, boarded us early without half of the people.  Taxied to runway then back to the gate again to get the pissed off people.  This airline is a JOKE.  The FAA should have fine the crap of them.  Horrible horrible horrible!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst airline ever,My family and I had a round trip flight from Denver to Arizona. Both flights had mechanical issues. The flight to AZ delayed us for hours. The flight back to Denver the mechanical issues were so bad they had all of us get off. I will never choose to fly with American airlines again. Avoid this airline at all cost. I wish I had.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Extremely disappointed,"I normally don’t write reviews but i believe the way our situation was handled is reason to bring awareness. We were headed back from Honolulu to Tulsa and has a connecting flight at DFW, when we went to board the plane they said we didn’t check in - which is impossible considering we had just flown and has boarding passes with our exact seat on them. Instead of trying to help, the attendant pushed us off to the side and said a supervisor would be here but “since you didn’t check in there are no seats for you” when i tried telling him we clearly checked in and we have the proof of our boarding pass and our seat assignments he really just wanted me to sit to the side and be quiet. The supervisor finally showed up 30 minutes later and after being called 4 times and told us it was a glitch in their system and that they gave away the seats we paid for and she confirmed we were in fact checked in. We had to catch the next flight, thank goodness we didn’t HAVE to be home at a certain time. I understand technology glitches but she said if we wanted to put in a request for a refund we can online. Then customer service said since we still got a flight that day we can’t get a refund and the supervisor would have to hand out any voucher if that’s what they chose to do in our situation. So in all honesty if AA would have been the slightest apologetic and tried to somehow make the situation even just a tiny bit better for us since it was the airlines fault, that would have been extremely nice. I’m really disappointed and will continue to fly Southwest for this exact reason."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Horrible Customer Experience,"Worst customer service ever, they don’t even deserve to be in business. I will never fly with American again. My family sat in a line with 20 other people that had missed the same flight for hours. American then refused to help and we booked flights with Delta. #deltaforthewin"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Passenger,"We have two kids, 2 and 4 year old and they gave us seats 20, 25, 29 and 31!!!! And not willing to resolve this at all. The flight attendant lady was the rudest person in my life. And we did check in two days before the flight and we had normal seats on time of check in, so we were super surprised when got on the plain. Worst flight in my life!!!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,y’all can kiss my 🍑 all the way,"extremely rude, racist to white people and black people, missed tons of flights and tell people to basically “suck it up <3” slept two nights in the airports, waited for the bus for our hotel to come and it never came :) should’ve went home on friday. it’s sunday."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"Did not have any COVID restrictions whatsoever!!  Pilot was entirely cavalier about ""new federal guidelines"" for COVID.","American airline has absolutely ""O"" COVID precautions other than to wear a mask.  Pilot  was completely cavalier about the new federal guidelines requiring passengers to wear masks.  He was clearly put out by having to inform an absolutely full flight that you should keep your masks on and follow the guidelines put forth by the federal government and CDC.  What a jerk.  I wondered what guidelines he actually follow when flying a commercial airline.  Vet your pilots American Airlines!!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,N/a,Fly with any other airline if you can. Horrible experience. Poor customer service and poor organization
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Angry flight attendant,"The flight attendant at the back of my plane seem to have a problem with certain people unless you were female I'm taking it. If she doesn't want people to look at her then maybe she should find another job. I also recommend she don't wear a short skirt and then be offended when people look at her.  People spending money don't care what AA thinks, especially your unprofessional flight crews.  Especially since your industry is struggling."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,One of the worst airlines,AA does not enforce health guidelines. Customer service is awful and they did not respond to my complaint. I will never fly with them again.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,You overbooked. Don’t get an attitude with me.,"Purchased a flight months in advance, showed up to the second half of our flight (layover) and attempted to be assigned a seat. They told us they would let us know when they figured out our seats. When they started boarding, we went up to check. The woman at the desk told us, “you must be standby.” We we’re not. We later found out that they had overbooked by ELEVEN people and had to wait for them to keep asking for volunteers, and anytime we had a question, we were met with rudeness, as if we had done something wrong. A Good Samaritan volunteered at the last minute and we were able to board, but will NEVER fly American Airlines again."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Mr. Dennis  Masters,Worst cust. Service lost luggage meds.looked thur you make it very difficult  to even do a poor review
Date of travel: April 2021,10,I will never be using American Airlines again,"I had a terrible experience with American Airlines on 4/2 flight from Cabo to DFW connecting to MSP yesterday.  My mom and brother are now stuck at DFW, because AA didn’t have a seat assigned for my 11 year old brother after we rushed to get through customs for our connecting flight to MSP.   They told us he wasn’t checked in for the flight even though we checked him in at the San Jose/CABO airport plus his record number wasn’t connected to ours like AA PROMISED he would be. My mom had to stay behind to try to get my brother on the flight then they bumped them to standby and now may not have a chance to make it home.   We were told this was AA fault; however, I am haven’t been helped at this time.  Will never fly AA again if someone doesn’t resolve this issue."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Nope,"Horrible service. We were in standby because a plane broke down and all the other gates were taken when we landed. We missed our flight back home because of this. That’s okay, what is there to do? So the staff gave us food tickets and everything was closed, and made us sleep in the airport. Next day. We were on standby (first people on the list) and this party of four got in. (They were behind us).. The four got in because they complained SO much, so they magically got “confirmed”. And after that, two flight attendants took the empty seats, so there was no way for us to get in anyway. Usually always late, crew is rude, or not helpful. wtf😹🥴🤚🏻"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Hot old plans and rude attendants and no drinks,"Theres something about being in charge of “mask” regulations that has made AA flight attendants insanely rude. Every other airline (including the economy airlines) has offered some sort of beverage service, but AA seems to be using COVID as an excuse to skimp on service and leisure. The lack of anything else to do has motivated the attendants to be, quite frankly, rude. The plane from Charlotte (a connecting flight) to San Diego was consistently hot, stuffy and the attendants gathered in the back of the plane to cackle and glare at passengers. The plane was very old and had none of the creature comforts usually noted by 5+ hour flight passengers. The flight from San Diego to O’Hare was on a cooler, newer plane but the entertainment centers were out of service and the wifi was spotty. The flight was four hours, so bearable without wifi, but still a long stretch for a measly micro bag of pretzels and six ounces of water offered in their snack bags. They do direct you to buy food before coming on board, however most airport stores haven't unshuttered their wares at five am. Honestly, Ill stick to some of the economy airlines and get my glass of wine on flight, since I cant expect the comfort or luxury of the big flight companies. Sucks, but American has never really been top notch."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Rude ,Flying from Phoenix to Chicago. Boarding the flight attendants were asking a question and I wasn’t sure what they were saying because they were talking too fast. They were asking if I was willing to help since I was sitting in an emergency row and I misunderstood. Two flight attendants immediately began yelling at me in front of everyone. Then continued to yell at my son for the same reason. Never again.
Date of travel: March 2021,20,take greyhound or amtrak,"if american airlines spent half as much time trying to improve their service as they do trying to be a political lobbying group, they’d be better than singapore airlines. but they don’t. some people are nice and try, others don’t care. the plane wasn’t clean and nobody seemed to care. we were on time, but that’s about the only highlight."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Never Again!,Customer service is horrible and the staff at the counter were nothing short of rude with no regard to how their lack of service effects people’s lives. Three hour delay because they failed to properly schedule. How can an airline of this size not be able to figure this out? I fly more than 5 times a year and I will never fly American again.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE EVER 0/10 stars,This is the WORST flight I ever took! Wasted 14hrs and Everyone was very Rude.. #CANCELAMERICANAIRLINE Waste Airline
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Cancelled & Changed Flight,"My wife and I were scheduled to fly from Hartford to Belize City on Friday, March 19th at 5:30 am.  At 7:30 pm on March 18th, 10 hours before our scheduled departure, American Airlines informed us that our flight was cancelled.  We had reservations to go to an island off of Dangriga Belize and had to be there on the morning of the 20th.  After a call to AA, we rebooked on a flight from JFK to Belize City at 6 am on the 19th.  Instead of a 1 hour drive to the airport, we had a 2.5 hour drive.  Instead of paying $130 for parking at Bradley, we paid $234 at JFK.  Our return flight was also distrupted.  Instead of arriving at Bradley at 8:21 pm on March 31st, we arrived at JFK at 12:25 am on April 1st.  Instead of a 1 hour and 20 minute layover in Charlotte, we had a five hour layover in Charlotte.  In addition, the US legs of the flight were totally full.  And, we spent over an hour on hold in Belize trying to rebook our return flight.  We finally just gave up."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Do not book with these guy,Do not book with these guys if you dont want them to steel your money. I will NEVER FLY WITH THESE GUYS EVER AND I MEAN EVER AGAIN. If I could I would give them a. - 20
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst airline experience ever,"American Airlines was the worst air travel experience our family has ever had.  Delayed indefinitely in Honolulu, no lunch/dinner provided on a seven hour flight, no updates from pilot about length of travel time remaining, uncomfortable seats, and no seat back monitors for the lengthy flights.  Very disappointed.  Won’t use this airline again."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst travel experience of my life. So many thing went wrong with AA. Save yourself the NIGHTMARE travel with someone el,"They never checked me into my flight,  our layover left us and the following flight they put us on to leave was over booked.  After waiting for hours they left family our family with kids stranded at the airport because the hotels they booked for us were all sold out.  AA NEVER AGAIN!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Stranded for the 2nd time with American Airlines,"The seats are okay and the on-flight service is fine - to be expected. However, their administration of flights and customer care is severely lacking. I should be at home asleep, however I am sitting in the lobby of the Miami airport at 2:50am because of this. It isn't the first time I have had these issues with them. I booked this flight three months prior and checked in the day before with no issues or warnings of potential problems. Standing in line to check my bags, I received a notification that the flight was delayed. It happens. However, the flight kept getting more and more delayed. Finally, they told us that the plane was on its way and we would be headed to our final destination soon. Shortly before boarding, they announced we would have to stop in Miami for Immigration. Thus making our arrival to Charlotte even later. It wasn't until we had already taken off that they decided to announce that we would have to wait for approximately 4 hours in the Miami airport in the middle of the night. They didn't offer hotel vouchers or even a simple blanked, only food vouchers where the only restaurant open was subway a 5 minute walk away. We had to walk about half a mile from the plane to the ""check in counter"" only to wait in a line for about 30-45 minutes before being given food vouchers and boarding passes to enter the gate. However, the entrance to the gates closed at 1am and we received our boarding passes at 1:05am. I understand that things happen, but it seems as if we were basically tricked into this situation instead of being able to just have a direct flight the next day or some safer option. The airplanes themselves are not bad. The snacks are limited due to covid. I paid for an afternoon direct flight and it turned into a red-eye lay-over. The last time I flew with American was 5 years ago and got stuck in San Jose. Since then, I haven't flown with them until now because I was afraid to get stuck again. Unfortunately, they seem to be one of the few airlines flying in and out of Costa Rica at the moment. Other airlines are having more options and I would suggest choosing those."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Never again.,This is my second time missing my flight due to American Airlines plane. With there being maintenance issues it prevented me from catching my next flight on times. This has happened to me 2 weekends in a row. The worst airline. Customer service does not care at all. Not even an apology.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,I only selected terrible because horrible wasn’t an option...Amercan Airlines,"I’ve never posted a negative post about a business so this is an opportunity for improvement post.I recognize CV-19 has wreaked havoc on businesses, especially the airlines, but...So I spent an 1.5 hours on the phone with customer service after waiting for an hour for them to return my call. At the end of my call I was assured that the issue was resolved. So, per their direction, off to the airport I go.I went to the ticket counter, as directed, to find a skeleton crew. After 45 minutes at the ticket counter I’m on my way back home with my suitcase in hand. #customerservice #opportunity  #airlinesI don’t expect the efficiency of a automobile coming off the assembly line every 55 seconds but they really, really need help!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,My assigned seats were stolen 2 days prior departure date,"I've booked my trip to Florida four month ahead of the travel date, choose seats for my entire family and was happily preparing for our first family trip in a long time. To my surprise 2 days ahead of my trip seat assignments for half of my family evaporated without any good explanation from AA's side. Needless to say, a call to customer support proved to be a waste of time and I still do not have 2 seats for me and my 8 yo son. My only hope is they will find 2 seats at the airport."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Upset,Showed up 40 min before my flight and was told I was too late and they completely ruined my entire day putting me in multiple flights that kept switching me around on standby. Was in airports all day and almost had to buy a hotel in a state I never been in
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Absolutely Do Not Use AA!!,"AWFUL to work with!!! I had booked a trip for the summer of 2020 and added insurance to the plan incase something went wrong. We had to cancel because of COVID. Since I paid for the insurance I tried to get my money back because we couldn't travel and they said the money was non-refundable because COVID wasn't in the guidelines. Well clearly no one experienced COVID before last year. So they said they would give me credit. I try to plan another trip and change the dates and they can see the trip I booked but want me to pay again and not use my credits that are on my account because they can't be certain that those are my credits. What?? That seems like an organizational problem on y'alls end, not mine. So for the third day in a row I am going to continue to see if I will ever get to use the credits or if they are just going to stash the money. The only reason this place is still in business is because they keep cheating people out of their money. Even if you can only get to your dream destination through American Airlines I would advise to pick a new dream destination."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,What Service,"Tried calling the platinum desk to find out about cancelling and rebooking my business class flights and the wait time was 23 to 32 minutes. And this is for their most frequent fliers (I am platinum and have 5 flights booked all in business or first class and several are long haul international flights)!!!! These days if you fly more and spend a lot more you get the same lousy service as anyone who booked basic economy. I am not elitist but if you are that loyal, fly that much with this airline and purchase their much more expensive seats you would and SHOULD expect a class of service that recognizes that fact. Not with this outfit and I can trace it back to the USAir takeover of American as it was then that AA's service began its steady decline which has continued to this day.. Why I have stuck with them is beyond me--it is time to for me to move on---Hello Delta."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Major fraud scam!!!!!,"We booked a flight to Cancun with a 2h layover in Dallas, via Tui.com and we were not accepted at check in, because only American residents can transit USA since Jan 24 2021.The flight we booked 48h ago is now nonrefundable, so American Airlines just cashed $3,000 for a service they never offered.To me this is stealing from your pocket by intentionally hiding this information at the moment of booking."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,cancelled flight and found out at check in,If you have a choice do not choose this airline. My family had a vacation to see the Northern lights booked with points nine months in advance. It was cancelled without any notice and we found out at check in!! To try to book again required a  2hour wait for a return call. They rescheduled and cancelled again. Not due to COVID but due to incompetence. Buyer beware with this company.
Date of travel: December 2020,30,The crew are nice - until they shut the aircraft doors,"They have new aircrafts on some of their more premium routes and their safety measures seem pretty good in current conditions. However, its the crew for me. Demons-in-waiting like other reviewers have mentioned. They are all nice and friendly until they shut the aircraft doors and you are at their mercy.  Don't expect them to do their job - you know, that stuff they get paid to do. They act like they are doing YOU a favor that they got a job with American and are being paid to serve YOU. I mean the smallest request is met with a glare or a huff or like you have a life threatening disease (last time i checked i did not). I fly all over the world and American Airlines have, arguably, the worst customer service and the worst part is, this is our national airline - you know, our so-called representatives to the rest of the world."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Hell,Do you or one of your family members or friends want to experience hell on earth?just board this airline and you will be greeted by demons that constantly will harass you even while you sleep! with the long waiting lines for no reason and food that can't even feed your dog! it's just perfectly wonderful!
Date of travel: March 2021,10,AA is ALWAYS DELAYED.,Every. Single. Time. I fly AA and they are delayed. So frustrating. I hate AA. Unreliable. Southwest Airlines is waaaaaaaaay better.
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Not customer-focused,"Despite Covid, American Airlines DOES NOT implement Covid prevention efforts.  I purchased a round-trip flight, and both flights were jam packed full of people; we were packed in the plane like sardines.  My friend, on the other hand, booked her flight on Delta; they keep every other seat open.  I'm not sure if airlines are required to enforce spacing between customers.  However, it is nice to know that Delta cares enough about its customers to enforce spacing.  In addition, the two flight attendants on our return trip were obviously not happy about their jobs.  Neither smiled the entire trip, and when they handed out snacks, they did it ten minutes after take-off and distributed the snacks so quickly that it was obvious they were just trying to get the job done.  Disappointing because I always like to chat with the flight attendants and appreciate having a personalized connection with them."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Web and Customer Support Shortfalls,"Tried booking AA flight in business to Santiago and could find NO flights on 1/27 in business on the AA website but they were available on Expedia!!! How does that happen??? Called AA and they  put me on hold for more than 30 minutes and  gave me the option for a callback in 30 to 41 minutes. Got a call after 30 minutes  announcing that their callback option was being shutdown for maintenance and I should call back later!!!!! When I did finally get a hold of their customer service rep she couldn't tell me why there were no business class seats but she could see them on her system. I declined her offer to transfer me to tech support knowing I would be on hold for another 30-60 minutes.  I then decided to use Expedia or switch to United!!! No wonder 30-35% view AA service as poor or terrible!!! And the worse part of all this is they clearly exude the attitude that ""they don't care"". WOW!!! And this attitude is not reserved to AA alone as I find this in most companies' customer care organizations that I have to interact with these days!!! It's a shame but that is where American service has evolved to!!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst company ever,My flight was canceled while I’m already inside the aircraft and I was put on a different flight to a different airport I had to wait 6 hours for the other flightBecause of that I missed the Holiday dinner of Passover which is the reason I bought the ticket from the foray place! The worst thing was that my baggage didn’t arrive I had to wait 2 days for and I had literally no clothes with me so I had to spend money on clothes and when my suitcase finally  arrived  at 12 am! She was completely damaged!I’m never using this company again when I tried to speak with them over the phone it was a nightmare to try reach a representative and the guy told me I can help you unbelievable!!!!!!!!!
Date of travel: March 2021,10,American Airlines doesn’t know how to service,2 hour flight and no water or snacks.  What is wrong with this airline.  I fly Southwest Airlines all the time and they can serve a drink and snack on 40 min.  I don’t want to hear covid excuses.
Date of travel: March 2021,30,Well American....,"American  Airlines, is one of the  best  for many people,  but   I  am still  trying to figure out why is the best,    hope to ......see  another  one  ......"
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Poor scheduling of connecting flights and misrepresentation of baggage procedures,"March 27:  We arrived 2 hours in advance in Salt Lake City to take our flight to DFW.  The flight was delayed more than 30 minutes. All would have been fine except the connecting flight from DFW to Raleigh Durham was scheduled to leave at 6:40 pm and we arrived after 6:00 pm. We had a long walk and train ride to reach the gate and arrived after almost everyone had boarded the flight. As I was in the process of scanning my boarding pass, I asked the two desk attendants if our luggage would be delivered to our home near RDU the following day and they said that the baggage would be transferred to the flight from DFW to RDU that same night. I did not understand how this would be possible but believed these two individuals. Upon arrival at RDU, we went to the baggage office to register our baggage claim tags after being informed our bags had not arrived. We were told our bags would be delivered on March 28. Today, March 28, we were informed that the bags (including skis) would be delivered after 4:00 pm. It is now 8:00 pm. We have remained at home the entire day waiting for the bags to arrive. We have not received any further notice of the time they are expected to be delivered. I have to drive almost four hours tomorrow instead of today to reach my final destination. I have difficulty understanding why the time between connecting flights was so close especially since so many passengers are flying again. I would appreciate an apology and a promise to train the staff not to misrepresent the facts. And to please deliver my luggage tonight so I don't have to file a lost luggage claim and file a complaint with the appropriate government agency."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Never again!,"We will never travel with this airline again. On our way from Houston to Bozeman, we had a connecting flight at the DFW airport. The plane arrived late and the pilot told us all numerous times that we wouldn’t be missing our flights! Upon landing our flight had left already. We had to wait ten hours until we could get on the next available flight. Customer service was helpful, but seemed irritated that they had to help a bunch of people get on other flights. I don’t understand why there was no communication between the Houston plane to Dallas and others. Other airlines call to have a hold, I’ve seen it happen. On the way back from Bozeman to Houston, they cancelled our flight from Dallas to Houston. They just flat out cancelled it. There were no flights available until the next day. The airline says it was cancelled because of the rain in Dallas. However, southwest, United etc all had flights to Houston and none were cancelled. The girl at customer service said American does that when there’s not enough people on the flight. So basically it wasn’t convenient for them since they wouldn’t make money! When we got off the plane from Bozeman and tried to figure out where to reschedule etc, the lady from American just walked off from us. Extremely rude. Then when we got to the customer service floor, the line was packed with people that had been in line for two hours waiting. American didn’t just cancel the flight to Houston, but they cancelled multiple flights across the country. So chaotic! Horrible airline and service."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Leaving Belize vaccinated,"Leaving Belize? VACCINATED flyers beware!Although American DID not mention to my husband when he called for instructions on getting into the country—we found out when we tried to leave Belize, that the vaccination card that got me so easily into the country is not valid when trying to depart?  Something the hotels, resorts, cabdrivers, airlines- no one tells you.  Which can only mean this is one last money grab for the $75 it costs to get a Covid test when you try to depart this country.  I hope this review helps other vaccinated travelers  to properly prepare for the extra time and expense  when leaving Belize."
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Terrible service ,I was flying on an empty 777 to Rio de Janeiro. Only 35 passengers. I am executive platinum and tried to pay for an upgrade to Business but was not allowed. Company policy!!?? Really?? Although the flight was empty you would expect better service but it was not the case. Food was terrible and both dishes had pasta in them. Sincerely not good to be a frequent flyer in this airline
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Mean Flight Attendants,I witnessed a young lady get snatched off her flight! The flight attendant reached over her basically grabbed her up about a seltbelt she couldn’t see! She could of asked you don’t just grab on people! Then another attendant came and he was very rude he laughed at the young lady which set her off in a different attitude because it was not funny being disrespected once he saw no one was laughing wit him he began to stumble his words and went to have her remove because she said she was making complaint. Rhonda hughes came and snatch her off!! Without question our plane was already delayed and to have to turn around and wait again I am furious!!!! Me and four other passengers watch this happen and  two of us recorded it!  I would like to upload it so you all can see how we are being treated! None if this was fair the lady could have apologized and left it at that because she was wrong!!!
Date of travel: March 2021,10,THE WORST AIRLINE!,"The worst airline ever!!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡 our flight was delayed 3 hours because ecause the airplane bathroom was not working, after that the same flight got delayed again due to weather, after all we couldn't get to our destination and they didn't want to give us any accommodations. Run away from this horrible airline."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Booooooooooooooooo,"Coming of a blissful vacation in St. Lucia snap to a jaring reality of American Airlines chaos. Not sure what I liked more the 2 hour wait to get boarding documents while inefficient and ineffective customer service was on full display, all the while watching the Delta counter run as an airline should with proper staffing and good procedures. Cut to an hour wait on the runway in charlotte and while departing noticing about 3 American Airlines flights that did not have delays on the screen. Not to mention as I am writing this at gate E30 watching the AA staff turn away a customer with complete disregard after he tries to tell them he was late due to his plane also being delayed ON THE RUNWAY!!! Just not a well run airline. Save yourself some time and stress and go with another option. I know they have lost at least 2 customers tonight and judging by the talk in the terminals probably many more."
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Poor service,Bought our tickets on Expedia and we flew to New Orleans on United and they were awesome the coming home on American was a travesty. The airline is terrible. Had seats assigned sitting with my wife then the night before we got an email stating the seats were changed and would be reassigned at the gate but if we paid an additional $75 we could chose them then. So we paid their blood money only to have multiple gate changes and delays. Is this the type of service we can expect then it’s a travesty for our government to bail out a failing company. So disappointed
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Itinerary nightmare,American Airlines has effectively turned our travel plans upside down by continuously changing our flight itinerary.  Horrible customer service with basically a shoulder shrug as a resolution. Incredibly stressful ordeal.  This was our first time with American flying international and will most certainly be our last.  HORRIBLE.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,The Worst of Airlines,"I consistently receive the poorest of customer service on American Airlines.  It’s been a few years since I’ve flown.  Alaska Airlines is the best at taking care of customers so I try to stick with them.  After being spoken to rudely by two flight attendants today, I will avoid American Airlines like the plague in the future.  I should have learned from my prior experiences of them misplacing my luggage and showing complete apathy towards me afterwards.  The worst!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Still the worst airline,"They manages to use all their normal tricks on a single flight - rolling delays, false information, blaming FAA, poor communication, apathetic service, etc.   there is no good reason for this airline to still exist it is so stunningly incompetent."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Horrible service and people,We were waiting in the check in line for 3 hours causing us to miss our flight. Very rude people there
Date of travel: March 2021,40,Quick Refunds for Seat Changes,"Since I earlier left a scathing review of AA regarding our recent flights to and from Mexico, I thought I should give credit where credit is due. Changed, delayed, and canceled flights meant that the extra money I had spent getting better seats (next to my wife) seemed to have been wasted. None of the gate agents or customer service people on the phone could help me. But I finally went through the long and complicated process of requesting refunds online for those ""lost"" premium seats. In my opinion, since AA already has all the ticket information, flight/seat changes, and final schedules in their database, customers shouldn't have to spend hours finding and entering 13-digit numbers for every flight and every traveler when a refund is plainly warranted. But because it was either that or lose over $100, I spent the time doing what was required. (Honestly, I think most people would simply give up in frustration--as I almost did several times.) BUT--to AA's credit--after I filed four separate requests (one for each of us on two different flights), the refunds began hitting our bank account within a few days. So I will rate the speed of their refunds VERY GOOD even if the process should still be made far less complicated."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Bs,Stuck at the airport in Dallas from 10pm to 9am do to weather delays an they wouldn’t give a hotel voucher I’m new to flying still only done it a hand full if that but still it’s bs not gonna b able to sleep or anything flights crap won’t recommend save your money go through a different airline
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Terrible Experience. Do not use AA!!,"Will never travel with American Airlines again in the future. I traveled from Dallas, Texas to Denver, Colorado with AA and had the worst experience that waisted a whole day. Got on the plane in Dallas and sat on the runway for over two hours with no explanation and no air conditioning because the plane wasn't running. We just waited and waited and waited while sweating the whole time. Finally was able to leave. Upon arriving in Denver, the flight attendant told us the wrong baggage claim carousel before getting off the plane. All passengers on the plane were at the wrong carousel number for over 30 minutes, until a passenger finally found the correct carousel and informed every one else. Because we waited at the wrong carousel so long, we ended up missing our shuttle to our final destination. All in all, this was the worst experience and will not plan to use American Airline again in my future travel plans."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Vacation,I've been on almost every airline flying international and domestic for the last 12 years and the first time flying American airline and I will never in my life do it again. From rude staff to other passengers made us uncomfortable. Even the checking inn process was unprofessional to say the least. So our trip to Mexico was amazing until we had to deal with AA...
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Never using this company again!,"I wish that I could give a negative review. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had with an airline. As we boarded the plane on March 19th in Seattle (AA 1471), the first thing the pilot said overhead was ""the back engine IS broken, so you will hear some loud noise, but it will be fine once we are in the air"". After we pulled from the gate, we sat on the tarmac for about an hour and were surrounded by two fire trucks, a fire SUV, and police patrol. The engine was inspected, and we were indicated to have further inspection at a different location. After another hour, the plane was pulled out of commission. I am unsure why a fully booked flight was put onto an aircraft with a knowingly broken engine in the first place, risking all of our lives, however, nearly all the passengers had connecting flights in Miami. When we finally arrived in Miami, I missed my connecting flight to Grenada (flight 1546), by only 15 minutes. Since this flight only happens once per day, I then had to face a 24-hour layover. I was the second person in line at customer service, ready to be booked a hotel and meals, which was the very least that could have been done. After pulling everything up, I was told that every hotel in Miami within a 20-mile radius was booked, and there was nothing that could be done. Not only was the staff extremely rude and insensitive, but they also offered zero solutions. I, as a 22-year old sleep-deprived female, was then expected to spend 24 hours during a PANDEMIC on the filthy floor of the airport with only $24 worth of food vouchers. I did not have access to any of my clean clothes as all of my luggage was checked in at that point, nor did I have any of my toiletries. I was unable to sleep as I felt vulnerable and unsafe, and I was supposed to be preparing to meet the dean of my medical school for the first time upon my arrival in Grenada. This experience was disgustingly unprofessional, and I am requesting not only a full refund but also compensation on top of that to make up for the horrific 24-hour layover I endured. After reaching out to customer service, they only offered a $125 voucher for compensation. $125 would not even buy me a one-way ticket back home! I was not given a hotel, enough vouchers to cover food, 24-hours of COVID-19 exposure, grossly inadequate service, and now a pitiful response. I had to make complete rearrangements in a foreign country due to their negligence after sleeping on a filthy concrete floor and they think $125 makes up for it? Absolutely disgusting!!!!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,If You Wanna Reach Your Destination …,"If you wish to reach your destination hours later than scheduled, or reach your destination the next day, or not reach your destination at all, or reach your destination but not with your luggage then by all means: Book With American. No more chances with American, we’re done."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,"Bait and switch, archaic website, horrible phone support","I found two tickets online and when I went to purchase them, got redirected to different fares. I tried called American Airlines and told the wait time would be up to an hour. I selected the auto callback. However, an hour later, I got the callback and told to select option 1 when I was ready. IT DIDN""T REGISTER my selection and then disconnected me for lack of a reply. About 15 minutes later I got another call back with an automated voice telling me the same thing, but that the system was down and ""goodbye"". So I made another call, waited 52 minutes for an agent who not only failed to listen to what I had to say, she took the lead, giving me a completely different flight at twice the fare. I told her I wanted her to locate the fare advertised and she sent me directly to online tech support because she said even though the site was apparently not working, I needed to book the ticket myself online. I seriously don't know why this airline still exists. I have years of experience with them and none of it has been positive. Unfortunately, they are the only airlines that flies into a regional airport I need."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Horrible and hot,"Worst airline!! I thought Spirit was bad. Sat on a hot plane for 30 mins with zero explanation of anything. Hot as in I was sweating profusely. Still hot when we got to altitude. People complained and again no explanation. Also had to walk to the plane outside of the airport around some random gates and felt lost and weird. I will NEVER use them again. Avoid! I fly cheap and crappy airlines usually but this has been the worst by far. $150 to be absolutely miserable. I would have rather drove 15+hrs. ""Biggest airline in the world"" and they can't even keep up with the cheap airlines. Disgusting."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Horrible experience ever,Not only was my flight from durham nc delayed I almost missed my flight from charlotte nc to manchester nh. After boarding the flight found out the seats are almost to small. It's very cramped and uncomfortable.so much for social distancing. We had a delay as well. It's been almost an hour delay so far. Would rather drive then deal with this hassle again. You expect everyone to be on time and if we mess up you charge us for it. So why are you not responsible to make it right when you mess up?
Date of travel: March 2021,50,A Great Flight From PHL To ORD and Back Again,"We flew on AA 445 on Thursday March 18 and returned March 22. The review is for both flights. Check in was easy even though on both occasions we mistakenly missed the priority check in desk. Staff was friendly and helpful. Boarding was orderly and efficient. We took off on time. The flight was smooth and the seats comfortable. beverages were made available. We landed early and disembarking was a breeze. Our bags arrived shortly after we did at baggage claim. This is what a flight should be easy on, easy flight, easy off. American continues to serve us well. Thanks."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,"Worst service ever, way too expensive to be that sorry","My Aunt flew from Killeen, TX to Dallas TX to Fresno, TX. Let start off with the fact that they told her if she wanted to skip the flight from Killeen to Dallas that there would be an additional charges in  the $200 range. Okay policy is policy but let's get to what angers my soul and why I am so angry at them as a company. They do NOT care about the handicap or disabled. Why do they even ask about such accommodations if they are going to treat you like crap. Twice have we bought her plane ticket with American Airlines and twice have we had to BEG for a wheel chair or any personnel to help her to her destination. They made a woman with one knee walk from Gate 38 to Gate 14 and told her we can't help you. She waited 45 minutes for help and when he arrived, he wheeled her to the bathroom and left with the wheelchair while inside the bathroom. She then had to walk the rest of the way until her knee gave out and then they found her with another wheel chair. She told them she had been there for hours, can she please be assisted, they told her ma'am we stay busy, but you were the two leaning against the wall talking about how their children spent money on spring break and trying not to make eye contact. When she finally made it to the gate, she was told to please sit down. She needs info HELLOOOO, ma'am please go sit down somewhere! How about American Airlines goes and sits down somewhere, because I am done."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Confrontational Gate agent,We were forced to board late onto our plane because the gate agent was misinformed about the Alaska and American Airlines partnership. After boarding last we were forced to check our bags despite plenty of overhead space and meeting the carry on size requirements. I will not be flying American Airlines in the future as this is one case in the pattern of poor service I’ve received from them.
n/a,10,Tired of feeling like a 2nd class citizen!!,"I fly for work every week, and I have definitely noticed a steady decline in the Quality Customer Service that I've received! They have taken their employees and flight attendants, and turn each one of them into hall monitors. If that's not bad enough then call into customer service, and you are greeted with attitude from every single level!! So in response to the declining treatment I will be looking for a status match for a different airline!! This company should look at the actual reviews from their paying passengers and take it to heart!  I also noticed that they have almost as many 1 star reviews as 5 stars! That's just pitiful, and something needs to change!! Sooo think twice before giving American Airlines your hard earned money!!"
n/a,10,So sick of being treated as if I am a 2nd class Citizen,"So, I have to fly for work every single week, and I've noticed a steady decline in customer service with this particular airline!! The flight attendants have turned into a nightmare, because they feel as if they can talk to you any type of way!! Just the most disrespectful, and completely, unacceptable way of talking to people!! They've effectively turned a customer service position into a hall monitor position! I get that they have to monitor the mask wearing, but they shouldn't talk down to you or be condescending in the process!! I will be looking to take advantage of a status match with a different airline in the near future, and I highly suggest that anyone reading this should think twice before handing over your money to this company!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,"Delayed departure, NO HELP","HORRIBLE! We were on flight number 277 from CUN to DFW on 3/18, which was delayed. We missed our connecting flight in DFW to MCI (as did many other people flying out). We were told there were no flights from DFW to MCI that were open until Sunday/Monday but we could wait on standby. We flew with 2 little kids and had no intentions of staying in the airport in hopes of someone missing their flight. We were told we could alternatively fly into a different airport. We opted to fly into Columbia, Missouri. We had to out-of-pocket pay for a hotel and a very expensive rental car to get from Columbia to MCI to get our car that was parked there for the origin of our trip. We were told we could submit a claim for out of pocket expenses due to the delayed (About $430 worth of unexpected expenses). Our claim was submitted and denied! Passengers who missed their flight to PV, MX were placed in hotels, but we cant be reimbursed? What a joke. Will never fly AA again."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst first time flying for my Wife and kids,"My wife and kids experience were the worst for the first time flying. So, wife had issued in the flight from DFW to MSP and from DFW to HOU. First from DFW to MSP there was a 2-to-3-hour delay. They were supposed to get to MSP around 1:30 and did not end up getting to MSP until 4. We had planned that day to go site seeing but we had to cancel our reservations due to that and had to push it to next day. On the flight back from DFW to HOU there was about a 2.5-hour delay. Plane arrives from MSP around 1:57 and their next flight leaves at 2:30. The onboarding takes about 20 minutes, so my wife had to run to catch her flight. In the process of her rushing to the gate for departure, my son fell twice and of course they missed their flight. So, wife talked to American Airline counter Lady which was very rude, but they gave her a new ticket. It was supposed to leave 3;30, but then delays started happening. First it was 3;30, then 4pm then 4:30 and last, they finally took off around 5:00pm. All this happen while it was my Wife and kids first time flying, worst experience ever. I honestly will never leave my family in hands of AA because they do not care about their customers, they care about money. I have flown Delta and Southwest and if there is a delay, they let me know ahead of time and really work to get my on a different flight. I will never fly AA again and I don’t recommend AA to anyone."
Date of travel: March 2021,30,"On time flights, horrible seating","Flew AA for the first time from RDU to LIT for brother's wedding, with a plane change in Charlotte. First flight to Charlotte was OK, but parked on the runway for 20 minutes before takeoff due to air traffic at CLT. Connecting flight to Little Rock also arrived on time, but the no padding economy seat had my lower back in agony by the time we landed. No water or snacks for us peons in economy.Customer service was OK, but I'm thankful I took another airline (Southwest) back home."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,I Am Done With AA (and so are others),"A wonderful, relaxing week of vacation in Tulum, Mexico was bookended with horrible, stress-filled experiences (going and coming back) with American Airlines. They had already changed the flights I had carefully booked months in advance. (Later flights into Cancun and earlier flights out meant we got to spend less time at our resort. But they also changed PLANES, and left my wife and I sitting apart from each other! I called to complain and get help, but was told to use the automated system. Doing that got me a form letter email that basically said, ""Sorry. You can try to make changes at the gate, but no guarantees."" Frustrated, I paid extra to get reassigned seats so we could actually sit together. It didn't happen. We were scheduled on the first flight on Tuesday morning. We checked in early, got to OKC at 5 a.m., we're told on email and app that all was on time. Then, we found out there was a maintenance problem with a bathroom, but we would still board and depart on time. Then, we were told we may be a bit late, but we'd all make our connections at DFW. THEN, it became evident we would NOT make connections, whereupon the original gate agent simply disappeared for over an hour--no more updates, announcements, or offers to re-book connections. Two poorly trained agents were left to cover the gate desk until she returned, waved some cards that had a number we could call, then rushed everybody on board to leave. We were in the middle of working out another flight and were told we were CONFIRMED. (We were not, we found out at DFW.) The gate agents there just kept telling us we could take the late afternoon flight, but they couldn't help us otherwise. I was surrounded by angry customers facing the same problems. Long story short, we FINALLY made it to Cancun (after badgering a customer service rep and having to reschedule ground transportation, arrival events, etc.). After laying out extra money, my wife and I flew to our resort vacation on opposite sides of the plane. It was a cluster disaster. On the way home, we arrived at DFW to learn that our flight to OKC had been canceled due to weather. (OK, I don't necessarily want to fly through storms, either, so fine. But app alert and email said, cick here to ""Choose Another Flight"" (which led in turn to the message: ""There are no other flights."" What???) We had to get our bags, go through customs, and were then told we could take the NEXT day's flight (since other flights that evening were also going to be canceled). Would they put us up for the night? Refund what we paid for seating changes? Nope. It was again, ""Sorry. Good luck. And sign up for this AA credit card so you can enjoy all the AAdvantages of earninf miles and flying with confidence."" We were griping about our troubles with the hotel courtesy van driver (who said he heard such stories daily), and the couple who had just been picked up said, ""Let me guess: you were flying American Airlines, right?"" They then shared THEIR horror stories, concluding that what had once been a trusted, well-managed airline was now becoming a joke. They and their friends never flew American anymore. And since we had an even worse experience two years ago (same AA, same destination), I guess we've learned our lesson, too. We will drive to DFW, take a cheaper, more reliable and more helpful airline to Cancun, and stop believing that AA really does want to offer its customers quality and confidence. If you can't even talk to someone on the phone or in person who can actually do something about these unfair, recurring issues, then it seems to me that customer service has already taken a back seat to careless corporate greed."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst Customer Experience,Don't expect to get any travel credit if you cancel a trip. It does not allow you to book online with travel credit and trying to book over the phone will cost you more of your life and sanity than the flight is worth. Sat on the phone with customer service waiting for over an hour just to speak to an agent for 1 minute and be transferred to a different department where I sat in another queue and the call dropped before I ever spoke to the next department.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst Customer Service,"American Airlines has literally the worst customer service in the history of ever. Flight 277 into Dallas sat on the tarmac at DFW for 45 minutes after landing, causing approx 30 people to miss the connecting flight to OKC.  The associates at gate E34 @ DFW for connecting flight aa2955 were unhelpful, and  not compassionate in the least.  I was finally able to speak to a person on the phone and was told to file for refund, which I did due to involuntary change of flight, turns out, our flight is ineligible due to not being cancelled by the airline. Among the group of people I was with, were a business owner that had an 8am court hearing, a shop supervisor who has a shop to run at 6am in the gas/oil industry, a nurse, and medical assistant. Others consisted of a teacher and other professionals. The “feasible” option we were given was a flight at 0845 this morning. Again, not acceptable as one could have been held in contempt of court, a shop of workers would have no direction, and in the middle of the covid 19 pandemic a specialists office down one worker. the teacher had to get a substitute, which not only costs her PTO, but also has to pay the sub, in a time we are already short teachers/subs.  our party of 4 ended up getting an Uber, which was around $300, but worse than that, now we cannot speak to a person, OR get directed to the right people to give us a refund for the flight that left us at the airport at no fault of ours. Our driver got us home around 1am, risking his life, and ours. Do you have ANYTHING to do to rectify this situation?!? Eagerly awaiting any sort of human response.Share away friends. American Airlines has been terrible in rectifying this situation. Maybe social media is the way to get some attention."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,RUDE REPRESENATIVE/FLIGHT CANCELED,"I was to fly out of Puerto Vallarta on March 18th 2021 but my flight had been canceled. I called the airlines and spoke to a representative by the name of Jessica to find out what I was suppose to do to get home I was suppose to be at work by March 19th 2021. Jessica  was very rude to me and stated that I would have to purchase another ticket from another airline in order to get home I not understanding why I would have to go to another airline since my return ticket was through American airline . I asked Jessica if there was something American airlines could do to help me out since I was not the one who canceled that it was the airline that canceled. Jessica stated that there was nothing that could be done being that there were no flights going out that day and hung up. I called back and it was Jessica who answered, I asked why she hung up she stated that it was a bad connection. I tried to explain to her that I was wanting to know if there was another flight for the next day and again she was rude and would not let me talk. I asked Jessica if I could talk to some one else and she gave me a number to call. I called the number Jessica gave me and spoke to another representative, she was very nice and courteous and gave me a flight for the next day. That flight was also delayed but i did finally make it home. This was a very bad and stressful experience for me since I have never had this happen to me."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,They stole my IPad!!!!!!1,The first flight got delayed for an hour and I barely was on time for the connection. When I arrived at my destination my luggage was not there cause it was still on the connection place.  I had to wait a whole day to get my suitcase and they made me go to the airport again to pick my suitcase. I came back home and the first thing I was looking for was my Ipad cause I do my homework there and it did not appear.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,worst customer service ever,Heaven forbid you have to change your flight - you can kiss the refund for your first preferred seating selection goodbye. They just get double the money from your original seats they reassign. Such greed
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Couldn't possibly be more disappointed,"I have worked in hospitality for over 15 years and I am blown away with how disrespectful American Airlines customer service is.  If you have the option to go to a different airline please do. Trust me something will go wrong during your flight. 80 degrees is not an appropriate temperature to have in an airplane,  and it should not take 3 tries to fix the problem over the course of 2 hours. Unacceptable! Not to mention rude staff, unnecessary waiting time for baby stroller and 0 refund. NEVER AGAIN! Jet blue did a much better job!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,American Airlines doesn't enforce Covid mask wearing law,"I flew American from NY to SF and was shocked at the lack of concern by the crew about mask wearing compliance.  The flight was completely full - frightening enough. But the crew never looked to see if masks were on or being worn correctly unless urged to do so by a passenger.  From my seat I could see multiple people with the mask well below their nose or under their chin. Throughout the flight the crew did nothing to ensure the safety of passengers.   They were so disengaged, they didn't even check that seat backs were up before take-off (the one in front of me was reclined).  American is turning a blind eye to the mask wearing mandate."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst people to deal with.....,The personal in this airline are nasty with bad attitude 😒no good customer service...they just get paid to be rude to people and no manner to treat u with respect...all of them act like they giving u the ticket for FREEEEEE like wtf.....i will never recommend this company to anyone..
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Just don't fly with American airline domestically.,"I am usually not one to take the time to complete reviews or even the one to care about leaving a review. However, this time I felt compelled. I was recently a passenger on a flight from Saint Pual, MN, to Midland, TX.  I was boarding the plane with my two bags: a carry-on and my back bag. By the way, I travel a lot due to my work circumstances. I always take the same carry-on, and I flight with American Airlines with the same carry-on. However, this time, the counter agent was rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional,  asking me to check my carry-on bag, claiming it's larger than what American Airlines allow. I didn't say anything, and they charged me $30 for it. I boarded the plane, no social distances for sure. Then, when I sat, I noticed that someone had vomited on the chair right in front of me, and one cleaned it. With Covid, and there is no one cleaned the seats was a shock and deal-breaker to me. I will never fly with American airline again."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst service ever,Customer service is horrible lady at desk very rude told lady I had a emergency something serious happen back home in Dallas she look and smile and said ok smart attitude talking about 75 dollars on top of that American is just horrible I satay with delta and southwest at lease they care about there customers.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst experience ever!,"Following a major snow storms we can all expect a few issues/delays, but not to the extent of my flight out of colorado springs on March 15.  I started to question my safety with all of the mishaps.Our flight boarded on time, following boarding the pilot informed us we'd have to go through de-icing, as expected.  Followed a short time later with another anouncement that there was ice accumulation in the engine which would require maintenance.  We waited for maintenance for over an hour, because, as stated by the pilot 'the roads are bad getting to the airport so maintenance is on his way'... no kidding! everyone on this flight literally just drove to the airport on the same roads, and we we all were on time!!!!  Maintenance finally arrived following some communications with them we were told we'd be pulling out of the gate.  To only be followed by an announcement that the jet bridge was stuck.  We waited again for maintenance to return... in the meantime, i had missed my connection and scheduled another later flight.  Maintenance actually had to connect a chain to the jet bridge and pull it far enough away from the plane so we could depart the gate.  Has nobody every heard of heaters or heat guns?Finally we are on our way... nope.We spent over an hour at de-icing!  I could hear the pilot discussing it with the ground crew which, if not for the circumstances, would have almost been commical.  In the meantime, I missed my next connection forcing me to schedule the next available, creating a now 6 hour layover, vs the original 40 minute layover.Never in my life have i seen such incompetence as with American Airlines during this trip."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Typical Terrible AA Service,"Why I continue to fly AA is beyond me, I guess I like the feeling of unimportance, being ridiculed and shuffled around like a peasant. I fly every month and any time I fly AA I will always manage to run into a rude and self righteous person and this morning was no exception. Gate changes, long lines and rude AA personnel at the counters are the norm with American Airlines. They are the oxymoron of Anerica(n). Guess I will be adding the extra 30 minute drive to Love field to start flying Southwest Airlines moving forward."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Travel changes,This has nothing to do with the service inside the plane.  This has to do with American Airlines being the absolute worst airline for changing your flights on you.  I have flown them multiple times and never once flown them  where they haven’t changed the flight on me.  They do it in a way where there’s nothing you can do because it’s not over four hours so you can’t get a refund. I once took a 30 day trip to South America and had 13 different flights with over 10 airlines and my flights changed only once. Booking this trip to Hawaii American Airlines has changed my flight times four times. It’s not Covid. They did this to my other flights pre-Covid.  Horrible.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Nightmare,"Connection both ways (going AND returning) was delayed. Thursday AND Sunday were terrible experiences and we have flown a lot, but this was the first try with AA. Had to spend hundreds extra in transport because car rental agency was closed by the time we arrived Thursday. On Sunday, we were treated with unbelievable disrespect by staff when trying to find a way to get home after yet another delayed flight and missed connection.  God only knows if we will ever get our suitcases. We will NEVER fly with AA again. Do yourself a favor and choose any airline but this one."

Date of travel: March 2021,10,Horrible service in Chicago! ,First of all was put in 3 different flights. The last one we finally got home on. The customer service areas are rude and very unprofessional. We have been in OHare for 12 hours! These people are not helpful and rude! Three of the customer service agents at gate G14A were laughing and talking so loudly about their private weekends and about other employees. Everyone at the gate could here them. Just a very bad experience. Recommend another service.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Never again will i fly on this airline,"If i could give a 0 star I would... worst experience ever! First off, they had me separated from my daughter who is a minor but had me and my fiancé together. I spoke with customer service multiple times when booking both tickets separately, we had to book them separately in order to use the credits. They guaranteed me that we would still be together as if it was one ticket, but guess that was a lie! I check in the day before and I noticed I was separated from my daughter. I called customer service and they told me that once i get to the airport that they would be able to put my family together. Another lie! It was literally a hassle to get the first flight to be together, but they were able to move seats around for it and made it happen. Now we had a layover and same issue, I was separated from my daughter so I went to the gate and explained what customer service had told me and that the last flight was able to move things around because she is a minor but nope not this time. All they had to say was the flight was pretty full and that me or my fiancé would have to take her seat! Like are you serious!? This was the airlines fault for miscommunication from the start! I have high anxiety with flying and so does my daughter! I’m furious and this has been the worst experience of my life! Not to mention on the first flight, They literally asked my man to cover his shirt because it was offensive, and then they’re harassing an Arabian family because their 5 year old is being disruptive.... like I’m sorry but when did our freedom of speech get taken away, and do any of them have kids? Sometimes kids have a bad day and act out. Is that any right to move them to a different seat or kick them off of a plane!? Discrimination at its finest and honestly If I had a billion dollars right now, I’d make it a priority to sue these companies with these broken and dumb ass policies."

Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst Airline,"If you want to get terrible service and sit on a plane that goes nowhere, this is the airline for you.American Airlines is a JOKE!  Will never fly on American again."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,You get what you pay for.,Flight was change within 1 week of booking and flight to Miami was delayed(not too long).  No problem with that but the flight home from our trip was a disaster. They delayed our flight 3 times causing us to miss our connecting flight out of Miami. When trying to get another connecting flight out of Miami they were all full and we had to wait until the next day to fly out. Only explanation was it was Air traffic controllers. Let me be clear EVERY flight out of Turks and Caicos no matter the destination were delayed. There were many people left high and dry in the airport to fly home the next day. I highly recommend not taking a connecting flight on American Airlines. I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap tickets means cheap service.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Horrible,My flight was canceled because of weather and no one helped us get a flight back home they basically said screw you find your own way home so I had to book a flight with delta which was much better service. When we were on the plane flying to our first destination they made us sit by strangers with this whole covid stuff happening and they made minors (under 12) separate pretty far away from the parents.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,DO NOT FLY WITH AMERICAN IF AT ALL POSSIBLE,"American airlines delayed our flight (all seven of us) within 7 hours of us taking off. Then they cancelled our flight due to us missing a connecting flight in phx to PVR. Because of that we were forced to buy tickets with another airline at triple the price to catch their leg in phx. We should have cancelled them all together realizing what a mess this would turn out. Here we are back at home and not only will they not refund the leg we did not get to use. On the way back flight 2917 the staff spoke so ill of other passengers and their inability to use wifi along with speaking about a co workers voice, personality and I could go on and on. Both woman and man that were the stewards on this flight were so unprofessional to do that. But for us in the back trying to rest and enjoy the flight could not. I won't American letting them know what took place. And while they title the email with ""valued passenger"" the only part they refunded was my first class upgrade. AS THEY SHOULD I paid for it and didn't get to fly that leg. I only upgraded so my brother and I could enjoy his birthday flight down. We all were so unimpressed with American and their follow up customer service we do not suggest anyone flying with them unless you want their stewardess' talking crap opening about you, delays and cancellations with no refunds and an overall bad taste in your mouth. American airlines shame on you. After working the covid unit for over a year with no breaks. This was not the trip I expected when booking with you!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Never Again - American “Greed” Airline,"Charged me for bag both legs of trip. $30 each way. Suitcase has been on several airlines prior and never an issue. Also told me neck gaiter unfit for covid travel. Had to wear one of their masks. Never an issue on other airlines. On flight, they charge for wifi and pretty much everything else. When checking in online, if you buy economy ticket, your chance of getting an isle seat are non existent. Must pay upgrade fee starting from $18 to $40 for any decent seat. This fee is each way. Everything is a fee. I’ll never fly American again and will tell as many people about the terrible experience. Their overhead bins could fit Andre the Giant and they have the audacity to say my bag is over the size limit?  That if I don’t pay the $30 fee at the gate, that my other option would be to exit back through security and go to check-in and then board a later flight. I said thanks for the tip!  Overall worst flight experience dealing with airline staff in my life. Never again American Airlines."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,American forgot about COVID,"Flew on Delta last week and the middle seat was left open.  Flying American today and they pack you in like sardines.  I always flew American before COVID but because they care more about money than the safety of their passengers,  they have permanently lost this customer. Note: they pack you in then make you get off the plane in single file.  What a joke..CEO should be fired!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Mr,"I was given middle seat B and requested to be on next seat same row by window. I was told have to pay fee to go one seat over when airplane was half empty. It is the most silly think that I have heard. Not to mention they want to charge for checking in one luggage on international flight!!!!  I sat in my own seat B, and both left and right side of me had no passenger. I will never fly with them again. No wonder they have a very weak financial stability. I see the day that they will be announced bankrupt. Rude staff is another remarkable quality of this airline. They truly suck."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,A JOKE,After my flight getting pushed back farther and farther due to AMERICAN AIRLINES not having a PILOT to fly a SCHEDULED plane. I had to fly to the closest city to mine. What an inconvenience!??? Not only did I have to spend the night in the airport but my bags got lost! And they sent them to a different city that I had to drive to! ANOTHER inconvenience. I probably would’ve made it home a little faster had I WALKED from Texas to INDIANA. This establishment is an entire joke and a poor excuse for a company.  Save your money and TIME with ANY other airline. HELL IS HOT.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Mr,Wow where do we begin flight delayed for 2 hrs which was fine Mother Nature we can’t control but when you land in Charlotte at 7:15 and your next flight don’t leave till 9 they cancel you and leave you stranded in airport over night with hopes of getting on standby😡😡 they where really unhelpful with this as they wanted to send me to Dallas for a night then to Memphis on sat for a day then we would head home on schedule and to make it worse we had hotel for Thur thru Sunday so we would only see hotel for 12 hrs and pay for 3 days...... THANKS AMERICAN AIRLINES😡😡 by the way you will be getting your credit card back ASAP and will never use you guys agin and that’s a promise  I know you hear this from a lot of peopleBut keep it up and you will be out of business sooner then later👍🏻 Sorrrrrry company
Date of travel: April 2020,20,Don't Fly Unless You Have To,"My experience with American Airlines has not been great. I have been on 2 flights, one from Phoenix Sky Harbor to SFO International (San Francisco) and one from Phoenix Sky Harbor to General Mitchell International Airport (Milwaukee). The flight to Milwaukee, round trip, was fine. Seat was pretty comfortable and landing and takeoff were smooth. But the one coming back from San Francisco was not good. First off, this flight was only 2-3 hours. I was visiting family. First off, flight was delayed (typical American) on both flights. Flight was delayed 2 hours on Wisconsin flight and 1 on San Francisco. On the San Francisco flight, when we got on, we sit down, and I notice that my tray table is very dirty with crumbs and a sticky substance. I wipe it off. After that, flight was relatively smooth, received complimentary Lotus Biscoff cookies and a drink. But the landing was very scary and I ended up vomiting due to how rough it was. When landing back in Phoenix, the plane was going up and down and up and down CONSTANTLY during the landing. I soon became very ill and even with motion sickness medication still effective, I vomited. There was no bag in my seat's sleeve (the one time there isn't) So my mother gave me her's. This is the only experience I have ever had on a plane of becoming so ill to the point of vomiting, I do not know why the landing was so rough. This flight was not a good one, and my business with American Airlines is done. Only fly on this airline if you have no other choice."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Corporate Comes First,"I boarded a flight that was delayed due to a paperwork issue, according to the captain. After about 10 minutes, the attendant came and asked me if I was sitting in the wrong seat. I was not but it turned out they gave out my seat number to more than one person. This complication caused a 25 minute delay but after landing, taxiing, and waiting for our gate checked baggage, it superseded the 34 minutes I had between flights (arrived at 2:31 and next flight departure was 2:39). Unfortunately, there were no other flights to my destination (home) that day. They asked me if I wanted to be routed to an airport 3 hours from me (uh, let me just make a phone call and ask who wants to make a 7 hour round trip to kick me up!?!???).  I am stuck waiting until 11:35 the following day so I asked if they could provide a hotel voucher. Nope! Not for weather related delays!! Whaaaa??? It was never announced as a weather relay. The customer service rep lied to me. There have been weather delays all afternoon since I’ve been here but my flight was not announced as nothing more than a paperwork issue which included my seat being assignment being duplicated. The customer service rep at the airport, along with the call in, were very unsympathetic. I wager they deal with this DAILY...hourly, no...minute to minute! The customer is not valued. I rarely fly this airline and it will continue to be so. Delta would have given me a hotel room. How do I know? Every time I’ve ever missed a flight on Delta, they kindly offered a voucher. However, that said, I’m pretty sure quality customer care is a thing or the past for most airlines. Where’s Piedmont when you need them?!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Poor Service all the way around. ,"To save a few bucks on a family vacation I chose American Airlines of United.  I immediately regretted it once we landed at DFW on the first leg of our journey.  Flight was delayed for over four hours.  The most frustrating part was the lack of communication from the Pilot.  As a frequent flyer with United for business, one of the things I appreciate most is how communicative the pilots are if their are unforeseen challenges.  At American they seem to like to keep you in the dark and only tell you what’s going on when absolutely necessary.  On top of that, one of the flight attendants seemed to have a beef with three female passengers who were seated next to me.  Two of the ladies were frequently adjusting their masks below their nose for fresh air.  They were warned once to comply or face removal.  From that point on, they appeared to be following the rules.  After deplaning due to delay, the ladies boarded the plan and were immediately asked to leave the plane for non-compliance.  Seems like AA has enlisted the hope of flight attendants who also act as the mask police..."
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Daughter/Mother trip:  March 6 - met the captain Big Mac and it was the best/most memorable  flight experience,"My 16 year old daughter, Brooklyn, and I took a Mother Daughter trip to Phoenix, which was really wonderful.  Probably the best part was the ending - we got to know the captain while eating in the airport, his name is ""Big Mac"" or ""Mac"".  He was a really nice guy.  He knew my daughter was possibly interested in flying someday and I'm always so interested in everything, I asked him a bunch of questions about himself.   When he got up to leave, he asked if we wanted to see the cockpit.  While boarding, he came out to find us in line and waved us in to go see the cockpit with him.  He taught Brooklyn some things.  We got pictures and had so much fun seeing it.  He proceeded to tell us he would buy us a drink.  I thought I won the lottery.  15 minutes later the stewardess came back to tell us we had been upgraded to first class.  It was our first time in first class.  The crew treated us like royals the rest of the trip.  It was beyond such an amazing experience and we wish we could have thanked Mac more than a wave goodbye and ""thank you so much"" when getting off the plane, but we knew we had to get out of the way for other passengers.If there is a way to reach out to Mac, we'd appreciate it.  Thank you so much for an experience we won't forget!  Kari"

Date of travel: March 2021,50,"Despite my fears, we LOVED flying with American Airlines!","I could go on for days however I’m a mom of two and don’t have a lot of time to myself... so here we go!Myself, my husband and our 2 children (2.5 years old and 9 months old) were traveling to Corpus Christi from Norfolk to visit my parents in March 2021. I suppose given that we booked basic economy and they were domestic flights, if we wanted to check baggage, we were going to have to pay per piece. So along with our 4 bodies we had: 2 carry on suitcases, my husbands backpack, our children’s diaper bag, a duffel bag for the kids clothes, a double stroller and 2 car seats 👀 talk about wishing I had 14 arms! Layovers are never long enough with all this baggage and 2 kids! We arrived to our first flight just in time and of course stressed about how we were going to get down the aisle.. the flight attendants were lovely and there was space in the overhead compartments in business, so they took some of our baggage and stored it there for us. The flight was enjoyable and I am happy to say that the flight attendants for our connecting flight were just as amazing! Now fast forward a week and to our return flights 🤦🏼‍♀️ We must have jinxed ourselves because on these flights, we were “those people” with “those kids”... after what felt like 2 very long and very exhausting flights, we were now faced with a toddler who had peed in his car seat while he was asleep and an infant who I had to wake up to get out of the plane... our poor cabin crew of course has to wait until we are off of the plane to leave themselves, so that adds stress to us. Not because of them, but just because we feel bad. So while my husband changed our toddlers clothes, I was wearing our infant and decided I’ll start taking baggage out of the plane. I grab the 2 suitcases and place them right outside of the plane... big mistake.. once you exit, you can re-board.. they saw the concern on my face for my husband and asked, so you have 1 bag left I take it? I said.... let me check.. 2 suitcases here and my baby, so that leaves, my husband, my toddler, a duffel bag, 2 backpacks and a car seat. The pilot heard and along with flight attendants, all assisted in grabbing our belongings and bringing them out for us 💙 they were so lovely and so helpful, without as much as a question or a complaint. It was heartwarming and allowed this stressed momma to relax a little! Once off the plane, we were faced with a small meltdown because our toddler wanted to go back on the plane.. after trying to calm him down, the pilot comes running up to us and presents him with his very own set of wings!! It was so sweet and considerate.I highly recommend flying with American Airlines!!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,They Couldn’t find a pilot to fly a scheduled flight.,"Flew half way around the world on multiple flights and connections on other airlines and on my last flight on my way home, American Airlines caused the only delay. In fact, the flight was cancelled when American Airlines, a major carrier, could not even manage to organize a pilot to fly a scheduled flight. How ridiculous is that? Well it gets worse. Upon canceling the flight, AA was supposed to organized a hotel for me but didn’t do that either. So after having my flight canceled due poor organization and management, the hotel wasn’t available either, leaving me to sleep in a chair  in the airport half the night."
n/a,10,Nazi steward guy,Steward with a power problem.   Couldn't tap my daughters arm across isle.   Said it was a saftey issue.  Constantly on intercom telling people keep your feet and hands out isle in case there is an emergency.   Wife Couldn't have her purse because it could be a chocking hazard in case of emergency .  This guys name was Eric and needs a new job.  Definitely not a people person.  Has issues.  Talk about an uncomfortable flight.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Terrible Customer Service!,"AA does not care about families or children. The flights in DFW were a complete mess. We had a connecting flight that was delayed. We were scheduled to arrive 30 min before our connecting flight departed. The airline did not allow those passengers connecting to exit first and did not make any attempt to contact the gate. We arrived at the gate at 5:43 and the connecting said 5:48 departure. They would not let us on. 13 or more of us missed the flight. They rescheduled us but it was delayed, changed gate and finally cancelled. We were told we could get a flight 2 DAYS LATER! Not to mention that they kept changing the gates every 30 minutes causing hundreds of people to run all over this insanely large airport. I’m so tired!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,30,First Class DFW to Honolulu and return,"AA5 to Honolulu, AA8 from Honolulu- each seat is configured for privacy and has individual screen.  Wifi worked great but was $19 for the flight.  Meals were reasonable in quality and quantity.  Bought a cheap coach fare and upgraded via points and dollars for a very reasonable  First Class fare."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Lack of respect,I just wanted to be respected. People in the airport blow you off when bringing up issues on how to get home with delays increasing. And callimg is worse because the employees on the phone sound mad that you are calling to get new connecting flights. Yes weather may be out of your control but training employees to have care and compassion is. After this I would rather drive cross country 28 hours than fly with you. And thats not a lie or understatement
Date of travel: April 2020,10,American Airlines is dishonest and unethical,I flew on American Airlines from the United States to Jamaica in December 2016. American Airlines lost my luggage. They promised me that they would compensate me but they never did. I recently complained about them still not having compensated me even though it has been more  than four years. A representative from American Airlines telephoned me today to discuss my complaint. This person told several lies about the history of this issue. It is bad enough that I have had to wait so long in order to be paid such a small amount of money;  but on top of all that the unprofessional behaviour and the brazen evasion of responsibility are just unacceptable.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Waited until plane was loaded to announce an hour delay,"They waited until boarding was done to tell us there was going to be an hour delay. Asked the flight attendant about needing to make a connecting flight. Was told by staff that they didn’t have time to check that we were going to be taking off soon. Thought okay great, then we will make our flight.....Wrong after pulling away and taxiing onto the tarmac there is an hour wait.  Talk about crappy customer care. Will never be using American Airlines again."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Don’t EVER Fly With American Airlines!,"American Airlines Don’t ever fly with them.Booked flights over a year ago... was cancelled/changed THREE times since booking.Fast forward to today... plane totally boarded and ready to go, they announce a tire issue was spotted during a finally walk around... the entire plane has to completely unload - luggage and all - all 312 of us. We are told it will take an hour.Update... will take longer than expected... and you have a new gate, in a whole new terminal - literally at the other end of the airport, you board in an hour. As the first group of us reach the new gate they announce we are to go to yet another gate... RIGHT NEXT TO THE FIRST ONE.The entire time we are waiting... we were told over and over again to just wait it out, our connecting flights would be taken care of and rebooked while we were in the air. Don’t change anything or your whole trip will be erased, just wait, we will automatically change it. If you can’t get a flight AA will take care of everything. Don’t worry.Should have never listened!!! Upon arrival we all lined up in a single line because, joke was on us... none of our flight information was redirected while we were in the air.You would think they would have a staffed customer service center waiting to help... 😂😂😂 American Airlines - your so funny... one attendant and over 100 people lined up.You want stand by?! Stand by... with a child, who may or may not get on the same flight as us... yeah no we are good.Here is a flight for tomorrow 11:04, here a hotel voucher to a less than mediocre hotel and a WHOPPING $12 a person for food. Your free to spend it here at the airport on one of our $15 cold vending machine sandwiches.Ps... arrive extra early tomorrow for your flight, we anticipate the airport being extremely busy and backed up.Customer Serivce is horrible with American Airlines At Miami Int'l Airport American Airlines-Charlotte Douglas Int'l Airport"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Agents gave us wrong information and the company will not back up what we were told,"Since customer service will not provide any help or support I have to use social media and see if anyone from American Airlines will respond. I am ready to file a complaint with the Department of Transportation based on documented misrepresentation on receiving a refund on a flight that there was a significant time delay. Two of your agents noted my account, told me I would get a refund, and walked me through the refund process only to get an email telling me that the information was wrong and I will not get a refund. Apparently the time delay was off by 15 minutes for a refund and the agents were probably thinking of how it used to be not how it is now. Too little information too late as we had already canceled the resort, transfers and excursions. It isn't like we made this all up, it was documented. I have a manager tape recorded saying we should get a refund. The reason why I recorded this conversation is based on the fact that they could not find the information documented and implied that I was lying. So I asked the supervisor why is it that when I call American Airlines that I cannot trust what I am told by an agent. I was sarcastic and asked if I should record my conversations since they have an issue with finding what I was told. He stated that I probably should. I am sure he did not think I would but when he transferred me to his manager I recorded it when she stated that I have been treated horribly and should get a refund. Sounds great, right....yes, until the manager is from customer service and customer relations is the department that provides refunds. She too noted my account and told me she was going to research everything to help me, but I had to email customer relations. Customer relations responded that they are sorry that I was given wrong information but they will not help me. I then asked to be escalated and she responded back that she has the authority and will not escalate my complaint. SO American Airlines are you willing to help me????"

We never received new flight time and ""technically"" we needed to be 45 mins. early, departure was delayed due to mech. issue and they ""arranged"" to accommodate, all the while trying to give the impression they were going out of their way to work with us when they neglected to inform us of change of schedule. After 2 hours finally boarded grandson and ended paying 5 times parking rate for ""short term"" parking. WE are paying customers and shouldn't have to be cowered by rude staff.

He was short tempered, and got mad and slammed my ticket down as I couldn't get it to scan. It was so hot on the plane I could barely breath, and the smell was outrageous.

These planes are cramped and uncomfortable. Cool view of the city at night I guess."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Absolutely horrible,"So I flew from Dallas to Tampa back in December and then back to Dallas.. then Jan 31 flew back to Tampa and in coming home to Dallas last week they refused to let both of my cats fly.. in the exact same airline approved bag that they had just flown in 3 other times on American. The manager on duty wouldn’t even try to assist. They tried to bring me the paperwork of what is required, I said sir i understand because I’ve flown with them 3 times in the last few months and it was fine every single time. Each flight the people near me had no issues whether I was i. Economy or first class. They said my container was “too big” and “too small” it is a backpack made to unzip and go under the seat. That’s exactly what it did on all 4 flights. I had to leave one of my cats in Florida with my mother because the manager who refused to help me just walked away. I had never felt so disrespected in all of my years in customer service it was the worst human interaction I have had. After the manager had walked away, I kept waiting and asked a man working if he was getting another manager or someone to help me figure out what to do (my cats don’t live here and you let them fly here) he said he had other things to do.. we hadn’t come to a solution. It was like no matter what I said 1+1 would never equal 2 with him. Pretty sure he called the girls at the ticket desk because they “kindly reminded me” that I can’t open the container or what it’s made to do.. I took one cat, put her under my seat, opened her up like I have done every other time. Specifically asked the people around me if it was a bother, they loved it. They don’t make noise, they don’t take up space, it fits perfectly under the seat. Just irritating I had to separate the kittens and at 32 years old my mother is still right. Never fly American. Lessen learned. If it had actually been a problem why was it okay for 3 flights and you let me bring them across the country and then walk away when I ask for you help. Oh, I forgot.. after I insisted he come back to try and help, his suggestion was to fly southwest. Which I will do, and I suggest every single person does. Definitely worth the extra money if there is ever a cost variance to not be so disrespected and ignored"

One who sat there with his mask off as the attendant walked passed and paid no attention. The guy next to me had to alert someone to have him to put it on. Then the guy starts coughing and blowing his noses. The worst part he starts talking to me to basically describes his occupation as a mule and says he travels to Florida to make $7500 every week!! Now you want to know how the virus spreads!! It wasn’t bad enough my husband paid extra for set preference only to have someone sitting in my seat. How is the plane sanitized once someone else has placed themselves in that chair!! It was so hot on the plane I asked for a extra bottle of water and the attendant never came back, I was willing to pay for it but she act as it was the last days. This airline is trash!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Flights always delayed,"Have taken 12 flights with American. Every. Single. One. Of them have been delayed. You get packed in the sardines. The last 20 people always get stuck having to check the carry ins, because they over fill."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,So disappointed in American Airlines,"American Airlines was such a joke to fly with. Their booking for a party of 12 was fairly easy, just called the customer service line and was booked with no problems. We booked and paid for this flight over 6 months in advance and we still got every single seat changed the day of. My husband and I weren’t even sitting next to our TWO CHILDREN. A four year old, and 23 month old. Even after waiting in line at the airport for an hour to get this taken care of we were told there was nothing they could do and our best bet was to ask people to switch us seats. My four year old is developmentally challenged and cannot just sit with strangers, and do you think two strangers are just going to take care of my 23 month old baby for 6 hours? Why would all of our seats be changed after booking them specifically to sit altogether? WITHOUT NOTICE. I understand things happen and maybe a seat or two could get switched. But the entire party of 12?! And our children not being able to sit by their parents?! Ridiculous. I will never fly with AA again with how poorly my family was treated. I was told by multiple people on this flight their seats were switched for no reason so most of the plane was sitting away from who they booked to sit with. What was the purpose of this?"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,AA takes your money and refuses to give it back. No customer service!!!,"So I bought 2 ticket to fly from New Orleans Myrtle Beach, cost me $850. AA took the $850 out of my account which I expect. Two days later AA took another $850 out of my checking account for no reason or authorization!!! Tried calling AA and that is a complete joke!!! No customer service at all!! Every time I call I get put on a call back list. 3 to 4 hours later AA calls me back then transfers my call and know one ever picks up. I am having to dispute the charge with my bank.Not to mention the flight insurance they offer is a joke. Only pays out if a death or national disaster happens!!!! Oh and don't forget that AA robs you again when checking in your luggage!!!!Do yourself a favor and fly Southwest!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,American Airlines blows,Third time is not the charm. Never again. Every flight has been a bad experience. No interest in customer service. This time they delayed my flight 4hrs. (First flight in the morning mind you). Then rebooked me to a flight that would not get me to my destination in a reasonable time. Cost me a hotel room for the night. Called customer service and was hung up on when I requested compensation of any kind.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,First class is no longer worth it on AA,First class is no longer worth the price - with no drink or beverage service - all you pay for now is bigger seat during covid - delta one still provides all services
Date of travel: March 2021,10,OVER - PACKED and MASKS OPTIONAL,"I guess AA thinks COVID is no longer a threat. First, the plane was overpacked. No space left between people which meant bags had to be checked, as well as no enforcement of the mask rule.  Flight attendants had a lackadaisical attitude towards the whole experience. They say it in the announcements that they enforce it but they acted like they couldn’t wait until their shift was over. I guess AA is more interested in $$ and less in people. I just hope I didn’t contract COVID after having to take a test so I could fly home.  I will fly Delta from now on."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,For AA Vacations specifically. Absolute worst customer service experience ever.,"This review is specifically for the AA Vacations customer service, not the airline itself. For the last 3 days I have tried to get a hold of an agent to change my vacation booking. I've been on hold for over 4 hours until I gave up, I've used their call back option only to get an agent just when their systems crashed so they couldn't help, or an agent that absolutely had no clue to how AA or AA Vacations functioned so they were totally unable to understand anything about the current booking, or what I needed changed. Three entire days wasted with ZERO progress. I am really hating myself right now for being a loyal AA priority member and customer. I hate companies like Priceline but I'm beginning to think their customer service is better. I am beyond frustrated. I am going out of my way to travel and use AA's services at this time but they are not putting any effort in at all to maintain their loyal customer base."
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Return flight changed last minute to fill seats despite covid.,On our return flight back to Houston our flight itinerary was changed last minute. We were separated and seated amongst a different group of people although when we paid for our seats and we selected to be seated together. When we inquired about changing them to be seated together we were told that it was an additional 65 dollar charge to change the seat. This was ridiculous because we had already purchased the seats we wanted.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst service ever BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,"This trash service dosnt even work,  never have I had to be at the airport more than 1 hr prior to boarding because we had check in bags.  They shove everyone in standby and don’t even mention your flight is no longer guaranteed.  Did I mention when we arrived at the gate THEY WERE STILL BOARDING!!!!!! Jet blue or forget the rest"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Horrible,"They must have the world's worst mechanics, every flight has a mechanical delay for a least a couple of hours"
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Website Issues,"Tried for over 12 hours to see my trip details on my account  for one of my future flights and continually got the message ""our system is experiencing problems, please try again later!"" I periodically check to make sure there have been no changes as AA often fails to notify me of changes! I actually tried 15 times between 10:45AM and 6:14 PM and encountered the same issues. I called the platinum desk and the rep indicated she was having similar problems and that I should continue to try to access my account!! I guess AA thinks we have all kinds of time to compensate for their inability to satisfactorily serve their customers!! The proof is that 32% of the respondents to TA reviews rate their service as poor or terrible! That tells you not to expect much!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,"Terrible, worst airline in the USA by far- Lost checked carry on.","I sent my 22 year old daughter as a gift to SC and she had a connecting flight in Charlotte, When she walked into Providence airport they told her she needed to check her carry on (which we fly into Mexico and Florida all the time with it never had to check it) they never gave her the bottom tag receipt etc, when she got to NC its lost now. her medicine was in the bag and it was the only piece of luggage she brought with her so she had to go to SC with nothing to wear but what she had on no toothbrush nothing. The AA acted like they could care less and said if they find it they call her and that was it. This is a trash airline and i will never use this airline ever again we will use Jet blue form now, this is a ridiculous way to to run an airline."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Business man,First and last time the worst airlines ever now I know why they only got 3 stars I will never use this airline again
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Very disappointed,"Terrible employees. They don’t care about the customer whatsoever. We flew from Panama City Beach to Minneapolis and had the worst experience. We were supposed to leave on Sunday, Feb 14th but weather was bad so our flight got cancelled and moved to Monday. On Monday we showed up to the airport and the gate agents were rude to us about our options since our flight kept getting delayed because of bad weather again, so we would’ve missed out layover in Charlotte, NC, so we switched our flight to Thursday, Feb 18th. We got to the airport in Panama City Beach on Thursday and the employee at check in said we weren’t even on any flights. The gate agent on Monday cancelled our flight instead of rebooking us for Thursday! We explained that to multiple American Airlines employees and NONE of them were willing to work with us to pay for our hotel at least on Thursday night for their screw up! They made it seem like they did nothing wrong when they cancelled our flight. We missed 4 extra days of work because of their screw up and we weren’t compensated whatsoever. I will never fly through American again. Companies are supposed to put Customers first, but they put themselves first."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Nightmare with American Airline callback and flight reschedule,"Booked my flight SFO-Doha(Qatar)-Kathmandu via justfly.com. Got Qatar airways/American Airlines joint flight from SFO to Doha. Flight is run by Qatar, but, bookings handled by American airlines. All legs of the flight itinerary looked perfect. We had two bookings - one for myself and second for my wife and son. Few days later, got email from justfly.com to visit AA to change flight. Could not contact Justfly.com (no mention of any phone number, email etc). Called AA at 800-433-7300. Could not reach anybody. After whole day of setting up AA callback. Their callback does not accept pressing 1 and it keeps calling back 3 times, then I had set up callback again to wait another 45-60 minutes. Finally, by fluke, it accepted pressing 1, got a lady agent. She said the SFO-Doha flight will be delayed and scheduled next flight. She also said Doha-SFO return flight is not available for my wife and son on May 1. She changed to Doha-Chicago-SFO to take AA flights. Qatar Airways website still shows direct flights. At airport, my wife's ticket could not be located on system and after waiting, the Qatar agent issued a ticket for her. At Doha airport, they tell us that my wife ticket was for next day. Somehow they issued another ticket for my wife so that three of us could fly together.Now, for return flight, my wife is not listed in the itinerary. AA even changed my return flight without my permission to fly from Doha to JFK and then to SFO exposing me to more people in this pandemic. Qatar airways also does not list my wife name in the return flight now. Now I am trying to reach AA via phone and the callback has not been working for two days.If I contract Covid after reaching SFO, my family is going to sue AA for mishandling our flights. Such a lousy airline. I will pay more but will never take AA again ever in my life. I will be posting this in multiple complaint sites and will report to TV station in SFO when I get there. Still I need to sort out my wife's return flight, but, don't know how. Worst case, I will book with Qatar airways locally."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Always a problem,"Never flying this airline again. They found a dead bird before take off and took absolutely forever to get it handled. Still waiting on the flight an hour after scheduled takeoff. They are the worst, not at all customer friendly."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Nope. Rip off.,"So all the in-service in-seat TVs and the charging outlets  will not work. They announce that over the PA. Then they say, don’t worry, you can still use WiFi but you will have to pay for it. Really? Not cool. Seems like we are being played. Southwest would give you free drinks, and cover the WIFI. American Airlines? Never again. Do not fly AMERICAN."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,The Rip Off of the Century,"I had a bunch of credits from 2020 which now they no longer want to honor. Also, every time I change a flight they want to charge me. Also, when you change a flight they refused to apply your seat upgrades but send you a credit which you can only use on another flight. I have gotten ripped of for thousands. DON'T FLY AMERICAN!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Horrible!!,"Each person is allowed 50 lbs of clothing so my husband and I combined to 1 suitcase for convenience.  It was 57 lbs for 2 people. Our choice was pay an extra $100, upgrade to first class at a cost of $93 per person or empty 7 lbs out of our bag in the middle of the airport.  So we paid $93 per person so at least we had something to show for it. They saw us coming!  We have flown Delta and United and this has never happened!  We will never fly American again and we are letting people know. This is outrageous!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!,", I flew American Airlines yesterday. When I went up to the gate, the woman checking the bags told me that my carry on was too big but it was smaller that most people’s on the plane. She told me she had to check it. I politely told her that I have been using this carry on for 10 years and it fits everywhere. The woman rolled her eyes, grabbed the bag out of my hand, put a tag on in and walked away. .She was extremely rude and unprofessional. Unfortunately, I was not able to get her name.I walked onto the plane and most carry on sizes were bigger than mine. Me and my friends are RN’s coming in for the weekend on an assignment and are time is limited. I am extremely upset about the way were treated and will sure to be passing this message onto family, friend, and fellow nurse colleagues. I am not the type of person that ever complains, but had say something about this.Thank you for your time"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,I have been on hold with reservations for almost 4 hours.....still holding.  HORRIBLE customer service!  After I cash in on the vouchers I will NEVER fly AA again.  The flight was fine but their customer service is atrocious.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Leesa A,"I travel monthly by airline and have never had a worse experience than flying with American Airlines!! First time flying with American in year's and everything about it was sub par to the other Airlines. First off, I was traveling with my minor child, and both to and from our destination they did not sit us together. I called customer service 24 hour's in advance to fix it, they said they couldn't fix it except to upgrade my seats by $38 or $97 a person. Went to the airport early for our flight and the main ticket counter said they couldn't fix it, we would have to get the agent at the gate to fix it. Gate agent said there was nothing they could do. They would not fix the situation but a nice lady allowed me to switch seats to be with my child. There were numerous couples on my flight that also complained they were asigned seats separate from each other. On the way back they separated us again. Putting us in 14A and 20F. Not even sort of close! I purchased these tickets together 3 months in advance. Picking out my seats together when I made the reservation. Zero reason to not have us together other than corporate greed! Only way to change our seats again was to upgrade to higher priced seats at $38, or $97 a person. My second complaint was that the economy seats were so close together you literally had to climb over the arm rest to get in your chair, and the tray when you put it down was physically into your body. I will never fly American Airlines again!"
n/a,10,Horrible Customer Service Horrible attitude ,"On March 5th Flying home from Dallas I came across the worst F/A in 20 plus years of flying for work, She was absolutely horrendous. Why do people stay with jobs that they blaetnly hate. I get that F/A are there for safety but they are also in the business of customer service and they are the face of the airline. Service on American is awful and it continues to get worse which is a shame."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,"It's gona be a no for me, dawg","We arrived at the Key West Airport with plenty of time to spare. We checked our bags, got through security, and then arrived at our gate. Our boarding passes stated that we needed to see a gate agent for a seat assignment. My husband and I waited in line for 30 minutes before we got to the counter, only to be told by the gate agent that she was ""too busy and could not help us."" That's cool, I love just wasting time."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Worst airline experience,"AA was my worst nightmare experience I’ve ever had. My flight was originally from Boston to Chicago and than from Chicago to Honolulu. AA overbooked their plane from BOS to CHI, provided very small plane from the 80s, then start asking if someone wants to cancel their trip to Chicago, go back home and wait for a new flight. Obviously everyone denied that idea. On the flight from CHI to Honolulu was NO food served, and the flight is 10 hours! For 10 hours no food!!! Pretty much every company adapted to Covid rules and provide some sort of food on such a long flights. I got a better meal in JetBlue flying from Boston to Miami during Covid than an AA provide on 10 hour flight. I’ll never fly again with AA! Worst airline experience in my entire life"
Date of travel: March 2021,20,No Wonder 32% Rate AA Poor or Terrible,"Tried planning a Europe trip this AM with multi city stops and AA's web site kept denying access with message ""our system is having problems, please try again later"". After trying 10 times over a twenty minute period I gave up. How can this airline assure its customers that they can operate their airline safely, on time and with customer satisfaction as their goal when they can't operate their system. I went on 2 competing airline sites and Expedia and had no problems with fast response times! When 32% of respondents leaving TA reviews rate AA terrible or poor over a long period of time, I believe they don't care! And what does that tell you!!!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,HORRIBLE! Never ever fly with American Airlines,"Where do i even begin? They cancelled our flight about two hours before we were suppose to leave and would not give us a new flight so we had to buy a new ticket through Delta. Then coming home they delayed our flight two times so we missed our connecting flight (also our flight was 1000 degrees and people were getting sick they were so hot, flight attendants were VERY rude about it). When we missed our connecting flight because of them we had to stand in the American Airlines line for 5 HOURS for them to tell us they couldnt do anything for us not even get us a meal ticket or hotel. We had to sleep in the airport and finally got another flight schedule for the next day which was also delayed two times and was 10000 degrees. They wont even give me the partial refund for the flight they cancelled let along a dang meal ticket? HORRIBLE!!!! never ever fly them, 700 dollars down the drain for us to sleep in a freakin airport."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,What cheese balls,"I booked a ticket for my 81 year old mother to go to my sons wedding. Her plane was supposed to leave at 10:43 in the morning.  Without warning they changed her flight to 7:00 am.  She needs a ride to get to the airport but there is no way to get her there at 5:30 am.  Even though they made the change, they refuse to refund the ticket.  Their policy is it has to be 4 hour change to be material.  3:43 minute change to 7 am isn’t material to them.  What jerks.  Don’t trust your loved ones to this horrible organization."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Horrible customer service!!!!!!!!!!,They have some of the worst fare service ever! We’re very rude to everyone while boarding about their bags!!! The on flight staff was very nice. Will probably never fly again!

Date of travel: March 2021,20,No Meal Service International Flight,"This complaint is due to an upcoming flight I have from Miami, Florida to Sao Paulo, Brazil from 7:50 p.m. to arrive at 5:15 a.m. I booked this trip in January 2021 and since I wanted to place a dietary meal on the flight, I decided to call American Airlines within the 30 day period they allow for these additions.  I called AA and the agent explained that this leg of my flight does not offer meal service.  I was shocked because in September 2020, AA provided me with a special meal on the overnight flight, but now they don't.  She explained that this was a policy that if you are flighting late evening, meals are not provided.  I fly often ..to Europe, Africa, and South America and I am usually given a dinner service and some kind of breakfast service.  However, on this 8 hour flight, AA will provide nothing... I was mouth agape!! I would recommend anyone flighing AA that you call the reservation clerk to make sure the international overnight flight has a meal service provided before you sit in your seat.  Now, I'll need to grab food and snacks for this flight which is so unfair considering the amount I paid for the ticket.  Covid or not, Airlines are getting cheap with their service and we, the passengers are the ones feeling the penny pinching policies."
Date of travel: February 2021,40,Great in-flight entertainment!,"I checked in easily for this flight via the American Airlines app. I knew the flight would be full as every seat on the seat map was taken when I checked in, and American was offering to take bids for volunteers to be bumped at the gate or change flights free of charge. I decided to wait until the gate to see what they would offer. Security was a breeze, though there was no Clear lane at this terminal at MIA, which was disappointing -- at least TSA Pre-Check was open and there was no line. I waited out my time before my flight at the American Express Centurion Lounge, which was nice and I enjoyed several drinks and a warm, hot buffet meal before my flight. I proceeded to the gate extra early to inquire about whether they would need volunteers and what they would offer. I was told that they were offering $675 to take a later flight, but that it wasn't likely that they would actually need volunteers -- in fact, the gate agent seemed surprised by my inquiry. The gate agent told me that she would all me about 10 minutes before boarding and let me know either way, which was appreciated and meant that I wouldn't have to board last to find out if they'd in fact need me. Sure enough, the gate agent called me as promised to tell me that she wouldn't need me, but that my upgrade to First Class had cleared. I felt as if I had won the lottery and was quite grateful. Soon enough, First Class boarding was called and I boarded the aircraft to my aisle seat in the second row of First Class. There was no pre-departure beverage but headphones were handed out before departure for the in-flight entertainment. I SO appreciated the personal televisions on this aircraft and the high speed wi-fi. American has just ripped these out of their 737 aircraft, which is a major disappointment and downgrade relative to their competition including Delta and JetBlue. Once in the air, the service was pretty bare bones, but still better than Delta! I was offered a turkey and arugula sandwich, which came with a delicious chocolate chip cookie. I sincerely hope American brings back the pre-pandemic in-flight service to domestic First Class soon, including hot meals, a towel, and hot mixed nuts. Drinks were proactively offered, including doubles, though in plastic cups, not real glassware, which was disappointing and hardly premium. Overall, this was a good flight, but there are certainly areas where American can improve if it truly wants to be the best US carrier."

Date of travel: February 2021,10,Flight experience was great under the circumstances.,"I am writing this due to the fact that I was charged 4 times for my seat selections. After staying on hold for over an hour to get a refund, the woman on the phone was of NO help. She told us to go to the website to request the refund due to the fact that my bank statement only had 12 (out of 13) numbers for the confirmation number. When I informed her about the specific numbers I was given on my bank statement, her response was ""You're going to have to call your bank"". Now, If AA is unable to give me the confirmation numbers, why on EARTH would Chase have any idea's on the AA CONFIRMATION NUMBER."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Thieves,"When I was on flight 5003 February 26th 2021. Coming from Miami to RDU. There was two flight attendees a young male and a older woman with long gray hair. They stole my whole purse out of my bag that was in the overhead. I had wheelchair service and as I was being rolled out I forgot my bag overhead. I realized and turned around...as I was turning around a lady ( another attendant) was bringing me my bag, but no purse was in it. They are sick people. They stole my money, my passport card, my credit card and debit card. They are trifling and unprofessional and I wish nothing but the worse for whoever stole my stuff."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,MONEY hungry,"Not only does American NOT block middle seats ( especially disgusting during a pandemic), but they also do not even give you the bare minimum of a pack of water and snack like all other airlines. This is a 3 hour flight and they expect you to go dehydrated. No excuse and ABSOLUTELY no excuse for not blocking middle seats when LARGE companies such as delta have been doing it and are a billion times more accommodating. Delta also makes sure you have snacks and water multiple times in flight. I should have gotten my skymiles card with delta instead clearly. I don’t know how the CEO of this company isn’t embarrassed by how much of a joke they are. The only reason they wouldn’t care about Covid transmission is because they are obsessed with money. Nasty nasty nasty."
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Disappointed,Customer service is useless if you can get past the robots.  Least flexible airline when reservations are modified or price drops occur.  Our flight doubled and tripled in the few hours we were trying to book an additional ticket.  The price then plateaued to its original amount after a week and few days before trip.  Makes you wonder about tracking browsers and cookies. Promotion on American advantage credit cards almost impossible to use.  Not impressed.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,One too many times American Airlines cannot get me to my connecting flight,I've been flying for 40 years.

Date of travel: February 2021,10,"Horrible AA personal treatment, lack of compassion and empathy towards customers.","AA-FLIGHT 1096 – MIA TO DCA – FEBRUARY 28TH, 2021 – 3:46 PMA few years ago, I wrote an article after a flight I made on American Airlines praising the airline and especially the service that a specific flight attendant provided to a helpless person. My writing earned this employee a decoration and I was very happy, because she deserved it.Today I am writing another article, but unfortunately it is not to praise the airline but to express my discontent ... almost my indignation.Yesterday Sunday I went to take a Miami-Washington flight for a medical intervention that I had on Monday morning. I always get to the airport early, but this time I left my ID at home by mistake. A friend with access to my house caught up with it, but between one thing and another I arrived at the first class desk at 3:07 pm, the flight left at 3:46 pm.My wife had already done her paperwork, only I was missing, but to my surprise the person who attended me, named Richard, told me that it was late to check my suitcase and that therefore I could not leave on that flight, that I would have I had to get on the waiting list for the next one at 6:30 pm, and if I didn't reach that one, there would be another one at 9:00 at night.I explained to him of my medical intervention the next morning, but my desperation was only valid for a quick consultation with a supposed supervisor who did not even take 3 seconds to deny any attempt to help me.In the midst of such a situation and with time running out, the alternatives are scarce and the concern at the lack of guidance and help becomes complicated. They did not give me better options and when some superior, dressed in a suit, approached, he also denied any alternative of help to board the plane, despite the medical condition once again explained. I saw him leave disinterested in the matter, without the slightest show of compassion or solidarity with my case. I went after him, begged him for help and finally asked him to let me travel and they would send me the suitcase on the next flight. His response, which was followed by another employee behind the individual, was << The passenger has to travel with his suitcase. COMPANY POLICY >> They said.I am not going to count the number of races and misinformation that I subsequently received at the counter inside the airport while seeing myself at number 8 on the waiting list. I will end by saying that I did not reach that plane and after being sent to another section where they could guide me (I do not understand why they did not do it from the beginning when I once again explained my case to young Nelson at gate 36) they put me in another waiting list for the 8:40 pm flight. In that I finally managed to get on, obviously in coach.What is the paradox of this ending? that when I arrived in Washington and went to pick up my suitcase, (incredible) I received a note from the airline telling me that my suitcase was in the luggage office, because it had arrived on the previous flight. Really? And what happened to the company's policy?It seemed implausible to me. But what most negatively impacted me was the disinterest and apathy with which each of the American Airlines employees treated me.Rest assured that while I can avoid it, I will use another airline.Armando Perez Aleman		AA CUSTOMER SERVICE’S ANSWER	March 1, 2021		Hello Armando:	Thank you for contacting Customer Relations.I'm sorry you weren't able to board the flight to DC, especially having a medical procedure scheduled. One of the biggest challenges for our personnel at departure gates is to accept customers as close to departure as possible, complete the last-minute activities that are necessary before a flight is ready to depart, and still dispatch the aircraft on time. If we can accommodate late arriving customers without causing a delay, we will do so. We know it was frustrating not to be allowed to board the aircraft, however, there was insufficient time to enable you to board without delaying the flight.I am sorry our agents weren't able to provide a better solution at the time. There is simply no excuse for our agents being unhelpful or not showing compassion. Our customers should always experience polite service from our employees, regardless of the circumstances. Armando, again, I apologize for the difficulties this caused you and thank you for being one of our AAdvantage® Platinum members. We value your long-standing loyalty and support and are eager to continue the relationship we have enjoyed over the years. Please be assured we are all working hard to provide the high quality service you have every right to expect when traveling on American Airlines.Sincerely,	Sharon Sharp	Customer Relations	American Airlines		AA Ref#1-29616728719		RESPCONID: 1-DLT9NOW:RESPID:1-DLT9NOU: TID:1-DLT1A4V:PROCESS: Response: CONTACTID:1-D47BWRN:MY RESPONSE – MARCH 1ST, 2021Dear Mr. Sharp:Thank you for your quick response. Unfortunately, we buy business class tickets, to hopefully get better service, but I find that it is to no avail with your company. My wife was treated rudely before me by the same employee.

Unacceptable at any level.Additionally, the policy that your bag has to travel with you when rudely out the window.My wife and I realize that you must be overwhelmed with complaints working for American Airline.Your response is not adequate, since it give us an excuse for your employees but no accountability, this treatment will go on and on forever if your employees I have no liability.For the first time I realize what a bad reputation, unfortunately, American Airlines has. When I reached out to my very large family and told them about our experience they all return texts with similar instances.It is incredibly sad for a company as large as yours to have such a horrible personal treatment, compassion, empathy, and any other word that you could use.Since this was such a horrible experience, and we pay business just for the sake of hoping that in business class they treat you better, this complaint must be raced to a higher level. We will not accept a simple excuse from you, we would like this incident to go in the employee’s record.We will not stop until the employees are identified and spoken to. We have already put our complaint on Facebook and will go online to do all possible way to expose this maltreatment.SincerelyArmando"
Date of travel: February 2021,20,Flight was delayed over a hat,"Honestly, the flight itself was smooth and we had comfortable seats. We also had friendly passengers sittting all around us. We were quite happy. Unfortunately, things turned sour from the minute I saw their ticket agent at the entrance to the plane. He was not in a great mood and he did not make us feel welcomed. in fact, I thought that he was very rude to the African male that was in front of us. Apparently, it is illegal to board a flight with neck gator face masks, The ticket agent was not respectful to the African male and made it seem like it was a total inconveince to give him a replacement mask. This is when the fun began.     We got settled into our seats and I guess it seemed like we were going to leave a little early. Then we heard some bickering in the rear of the plane. We were seated in the middle section and we could see people in front of us looking towards the back. Next thing you know, the pilot announces that we aren't going to leave until a passenger removes his offensive hat.  People then became upset that we were being delayed for a hat and were yelling ""we don't give a Fbomb about the stupid hat. Lets go!!"" The passenger was allowed to board the flight without crew saying anything, so in my opinion, it is the crew's flight for letting him through and they should not have fought to get him off. Flight attendants dropped the ball and lost control of the situation.      The flight attendant told us that she is worried about going up in the air with 32 rude customers. That was total BS and uncalled for. When I turned around to see what was really going on, I noticed the same rude ticket agent in the back making a scene. This caused us to be grounded for 45 minutes. Passengers were pissed because this was going to delay us from making connecting flights.      Once we got to Phoenix, we left the plane and we noticed that several passengers stayed behind to see the customer with the ""offensive"" hat. To my surprise, it was a African male wearing a black hat with words that I could barely make out. I approached the male and asked him if that was the hat that they were upset about and he appologized to me and everyone else that had to wait. The letters were less than 2 inches tall and in Old Eglish print. You would have to get real close to the male to be able to read his hate.      My observation leads me to think that your ticket agent has a problem with African males. In fact, the 2 other African males told me that the American Airlines agent was very rude to them as well. The African male continued to explain that he wore the same hat three days ago on the same Airlines. Where is the consistency? Address the situation before the male enters the plane. Not after he has taken a seat in the rear of the plane.      Considering what is going on in the world today, I think the agent and the flight attendants dropped the ball in the situation. Some updated training and some general polite customer service would have fixed the problem before it got out of hand. This does not look good for the company and I am sure. On another note, the flight attendants on both our outbound and return flight were not nice. Made use feel like they're doing us a favor and no politeness at all."
Date of travel: February 2021,40,No Major Complaints,"Another successful, mostly pleased flight on AA!  This particular flight is the 6th flight I've taken with AA since the COVID pandemic started.  I wanted to take a few minutes to comment overall on how my experience has been, with a multitude of flights booked/cancelled/rescheduled/flown over the past 12 months.Cancellations, Refunds, Credits and Rebooking:We've had a total of 12 flights that have been cancelled and/or rebooked over the past 12 months.  Overall, I've been relatively pleased with how AA has handled every transaction.  I've had one incident that was not initially handled as it should have been, and it did take me 3 phone calls and a threat to report to the DOT to be resolved.  Outside of that issue, AA customer service has been nothing but professional and easy to work with.COVID Flight SafetyIn November, we flew round trip to Aruba.  None of the legs of any of the trip did we experience a full plane, so we had zero trouble social distancing and in almost every flight, had an entire row to ourselves, and well as several rows in front of and behind us empty.  In November, we were also given wipes upon boarding each leg, and a small snack bag with biscotti and a bottle of water.  In November, crew was mindful of boarding and deplaning process, with announcements and monitoring to ensure there was limited/no crowding in aisles.In February, both flights were booked to capacity, with 100% of the seats having a butt in them.  There was no announcement boarding MIA to CLT about social distancing, nor was there any order to the deplaning process...  the pre-COVID free for all was the process here.  Upon landing in Columbus, OH, we were deplaned in an orderly fashion, with limited/no crowding as we all got off the flight.MaskingWe found crew on all of our flights to be mindful and aware of mask compliance on our flights.  I had no issues with how the time on the plane was handled.  However, at the gate, in both MIA and CLT, max wearing was very lax, and there were zero announcements about it until announcements were made during the pre-board and boarding process.Gate AreasKudos either to AA, or the respective airports in CMH, MIA and PHL.  In each of these airports there was adequate space for social distancing, no issues being able to stay away while we waited.  However, CLT needs to be addressed.  In every AA terminal except this one, it appeared as though every other gate was in use, chairs were marked to remind people about distancing, blocking seats, etc.  CLT was the single place where I felt the most anxiety and at risk during any of these flights and the travel process.  There were almost zero signs there was a global pandemic when you were in any of the AA terminals/gates in CLT.  I have also flow another airline during this time, and felt that the process and policies were similar between these two airlines.  Overall, I do feel safe flying during COVID times, but would appreciate knowing that even within the same airline all crew and agents are following the same policies and procedures, with consistency."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,2nd class citizen,American Airlines fees are ridiculous. Just charge the fees in the ticket. I board last because I couldn’t afford the large fee to pick my seat. And then a large fee to check baggage. This is not right!
Date of travel: November 2020,10,After 4 month I am still waiting for my refund from AA airline with PDP travel insurance,"I had purchased a travel package for 2 from AA  including a PDP insurance for this trip. Today is  3-1-2021 and I still don't have my refund. When I  called to cancel the trip I was told that it could  take up to 12 weeks. 16 weeks have gone by, and I  still don't have a refund. How long are they  allowed to keep my Money?"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,worst airline experience to date,"DON'T FLY WITH THIS AIRLINEThis was supposed to be a very short, easy, travel day. Unfortunately it was not.... Originally flying to my destination, they ""forgot to put the checked bag"" on my plane to San Antonio Texas (flying out of Alabama).... Then were not able to get the bag to San Antonio a full 24 hours later. My returning flight back to Alabama, My flight was delayed out of san antonio, to dallas. The people at gate said it was due to weather. The hour delay cause by weather made me miss my connecting flight in Dallas. My connecting flight was at 8:50 p.m., I arrived at 8:30..... Customer Service was an absolute nightmare. Ive never seen or experienced Airline employees be so rude and condescending towards clients.  I was 1 of about 100 people that were not being compensated for delayed flights caused by weather, the best they could do was to rebook for 24 hours later. No hotels were offered, not even discounted vouchers were offered. Im not the person to get angry with comstomer care often, but this was infuriating to say the least."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Do not travel with American Airlines,"American Airlines is the worse company to travel. If you are thinking to book a trip with them, you rather not. I’ve had 6 trips cancellations and they don’t care about passages. They only care about them. Their policy is unfair and insane. I won’t never travel with them."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Can't take off on time,"3 out of 4 flights I was on were delayed by at least 1 hour causing missed connections, several rebookings (which were also dslayed).  @AmericanAirlines get your sh*t together"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Worst airline of all time,"Been sitting in a place for 4 hours now refueling. Every time they announce that the plane is gonna take off, they add another hour. Worst airline!!! Worst business!!! Don’t book flights with them."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,First time flying American...will not be doing it again.,"My first flight was delayed 40 minutes. It was the first flight of the day, so I’m not sure how that happened. Thankfully, I had enough of a layover to not stress about making it to my next flight. It turns I wouldn’t have needed that longer layover as the next flight was late to arrive, therefore my flight was late to take off by 30 minutes. We taxi’d on the runway for another 30 minutes before we were told we needed to turn around and get more fuel. Once we got to the gate and sat there fueling up our pilots told us that due to the delay they had “timed out,” so another crew was going to come on and fly us to Omaha. I am sitting here writing this as I’m waiting for that crew to come. At this point we will be at least 2 hours late.Good thing I ate something before getting on the plane since they aren’t serving food either.My boyfriend also experienced similar delays and issues when he flew American. I’m going back to Southwest after this."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,this is a long and horrible story,Bought my tickets through Travelocity in July 2020 for a great price.  AA changed the return flight times from 1:10 to 3:28 back in Oct 2020.  I never received any notification.  That change left me with 1 hour and 14 minutes to go through customs and meet my connecting flight in Miami.  I contacted AA and they put the blame on Travelocity.  I understand Travelocity should have notified me but AA made the changes that are impossible to keep.  AA customer service wouldn't even talk to me.  When we arrived at the FPO airport to come home the AA ticket person looked at this ridiculous schedule and changed us to a flight where we were now leaving Miami the next day.  Keep in mind I am 59 and my husband is 63.  I asked her if we are supposed to sleep on the airport floor.  She told me to talk to the people at Miami.  Because my tickets are now not connected I had to pick up my carry on in Miami and have it rechecked.  AA wanted to charge me a second time for my checked baggage.  I had to talk to those folks about the horrible mix-up that is all AAs fault before my baggage was accepted.  Then they made me leave through a locking door into the terminal.  I am no longer in the secure area.  So now I not only have to sleep on the floor but I am now unable to access food.   I tried to reenter but TA would not let me pass because our tickets were for tomorrow. The only saving grace for your horrible airlines was the manager in Miami.  She was the first one in all of this nightmare that even bothered to listen to us.  What should have been an easy flight home from a great vacation turned into hell!  You really need to have customer service that listens to your customers instead of blowing us off to the next  stop.  This could have all been avoided if you didn't allow changes that were impossible to keep.  That is all on you!
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Racist,"Racism towards African Americans. We also found out today this is not the first time this has occurred. Very unprofessional, hurtful and we will never fly with this disgraceful so called company again."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Scott Solomon HORRIBLE,"Terrible customer service!!! Don't waste you're time... Stay away form him!!Very quick in temperament. Given state of the world, a man with these types of anger issues and need of attention should not work with people, especially in an airport."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Can it get any worse?,This was the worst flight I have benn on in twenty years. Can we get these seats any closer to each other? The plane had approx four inches of legroom. I could not move at all throughout the flight. I was in pain and panicked a bit due to claustrophobia. This arline keeps pushing seats closer and closer. Hopefully on day we will be laying on top of each other as they have almost gotten it to this point. Despise American for crushing people. I'm 5'7 208 lbs weightlifter and felt I was inside a 2x2 cubicle. Pure greed.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible,"Social distancing? Absolutely none. Normally I wouldn't comment but they make several announcements on practicing Social distancing and wearing masks but don't push it. We were standing on top of one another while boarding and unboarding,  in restaurants,  etc.  Customer service? Staff have no personality whatsoever.  If you are anywhere but first class,  don't expect to get any service at all.  Out of 4 stewards,  we saw 3 twice.  We were two seats behind first class and their service was nonstop,  offering food and other drinks besides water.  Guess us 3rd class steerage aren't worth much.  One walked by collecting garbage,  my boyfriend had his hand extended to give it to her,  she looked right at him and kept walking.  Delays? We had a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes of delays with 1 hour of this sitting on the tarmac. 25 minutes waiting for ground crew because,  as the pilot put it ""they didn't know we were coming"". How does this happen?Boarding? We were group 7, seats 6A and B. They called group 1, 2.... when they called 6, we got ready to get in line.  He skipped 6 and called group 8 to board.  Again,  what?Just horrible.  Will never fly AA again."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Worst Airline Experience I’ve Had In 25 Years,"We got dropped off for a 6:30am departure time and waited in the airport for hours, only for the flight to be cancelled at 6am with no warning. Rescheduled (on my own dime) for 7pm that evening. Spent the day stressing that this departure flight would be cancelled with no warning, too. Return flight a week later was also cancelled only hours before takeoff, leaving dozens of passengers stranded in Florida with nowhere to stay and not even an estimated time or date for a flight home. I’ve flown a dozen times internationally, and I’ve flown with eight or nine different US airlines, but in all my years on this Earth I’ve never had an experience as awful as I have with this airline. I will never fly this airline again, and neither should you."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Social Distance ,"We flew from Pittsburgh to Aruba and back on American Airlines. We flew first class from Pittsburgh to Charlotte and business class from Charlotte to Aruba. The lack of social distancing upon boarding and on boarding the plane is atrocious. There is absolutely none. People standing in the aisle over us while boarding for twenty minutes or more standing as close together as they possibly could. Also, when you fly first class you expect to get your luggage first, however we received our luggage last upon our return home to Pittsburgh."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Terrible pet policy,"They have been very inflexible with flying with pets recently, to the point where booking on another airline is the only reasonable option. I booked a flight and was unable to book my service pet, due to recent policy changes. When I arrived to check in, they would not allow my pet onboard due to her back hitting the top of the bag. She lies down during the flights, so this is nothing new for her. Otherwise, they left no alternative option, forcing me to cancel my flight and waste several hours of my day. DON’T FLY ON AA!"
n/a,10,Worst Customer Service Rude Agents and Supervisors ,Rudeness is not even a good word to describe how awful these people are. I suggest you use anyone but them. Even the budget airlines treat their customers better what a disgrace.Their agent gives incorrect information and they don't apologize or correct the situation but rather say I should read the fine print when their agent blatantly told me differently on a recorded line.
n/a,10,Social distance,"I was amazed American Airlines was concerned with my well being they boarded by social distanced groups and also didn't serve any beverages or food. They also enforced strict guidelines of wearing a mask at all times.Their concern has limits, if it impacts the bottom line then damn the rules.Once boarded on a completely full flight they informed us we would be waiting approximately an hour before leaving due to mechanical issues. Lessons learned for the day,Care until it effects the bottom line."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible experience,Horrible experience with personnel. I got to my flight 1 hour early and nobody was at the check in area then someone finally decided to get there 24 minutes before my flight just to tell me I was late. Never again will i fly with american airlines
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible Experience,"Horrible experience, every flight arrived late, flight attendants were rude and useless, plane dirty and lacked modern amenities. Very disappointed, especially for the premium price. Will definitely choice a different airline from now on."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,"AA is an OVERPRICED airline, sub par performance","American wants to act like a top of the line airline. Ot is far from it, after years of being a AA member, having credit lines with them. I will be dropping everything that had to do with American Airlines.They have planes that need to be better maintained last couple flights have had multiple issues taking off. Causing delays in vacation plans & costing us money. Does American take responsibility? NO, they mive you to the next flight on a standby & there you go. That's it, no compensations for inconvienence or the fact they cost you time & money. There a joke & I will not be letting them steal money from me while ruining a hard planned vacation. Keep your miles, keep your credit, and keep your sub par service & planes.I absolutely hate AA. Rarely use hate as its strong word. But I HATE YOU AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!!!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,God-Awful,"Not exaggerating, I cannot remember the last time I had a flight with AAL and nothing went wrong. Rarely on time, often cancelled, incompetent staff, rude customer service, etc. I cannot understand how they keep getting these government bailouts. They are an awful company that should have gone under long ago. The average rating on here would be between 1-2 if they didn’t have their employees give false reviews."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Customer Service is incompetent,"Terrible airline. I decided I wanted to use my $500+ credit to fly me and my boyfriend. I booked my travel online and received an ""error"" asking me to call ""Customer Service"" to apply my travel funds. I called. The first lady assured me that my credit card would NOT be charged. I wake up the next morning, my credit card is charged. I call again for the 2nd day. After being on the phone with them for 90 minutes they assured me that I would receive a refund and my boyfriend would NOT lose his flight. I wake up the next morning to a ""Trip Cancellation"" email?? They canceled his trip. Called today (3rd day) and customer service tried to cancel my trip. What the hell is going on??? Now flights are more expensive and we have to pay out of pocket!"
Date of travel: February 2021,20,Waited too Long ,"Leaving Key West airport, the lady agent checking is in told us to come in closer in line, we were packed in line like sardines. The signs all say our well-being is their priority so how is cramming us in line safe?AA requires us to wear masks and then has us waiting so close together! There were a few people in front of us in line and we waited 25 minutes."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,I will never travel with this airline again!!,"Actually the crew and everything in Colombia was fantastic as soon as I got to USA it was awful, first I lost my connection then the lady helping me “Lucy” was so rude and the way she was talking to me it was awful for being a customer service person I don’t know how she is working with the company, next day they send me in the worst plane I have ever been I have a lot of delicate stuff in my carry on and they were putting all the carry on away when I asked nice about me having it cuz I have a lot of delicate stuff I brought from colombia their answer was “that’s not my problem we don’t have space in the plane” I just hated everything about my flight with this airline."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Truly the worst travel experience,"I don’t like writing poor reviews, but we’ve had a terrible few months booking and rebooking flights with American Airlines. I’ve flown at least 2-3 times a year my entire life and haven’t experienced this much heartache. We’ve had 6 flights cancelled and each time we receive a voucher that cannot be used in junction with another voucher or transfer flight. In fact, to transfer a flight, we had to pay an extra $600 even though we had $300 in vouchers. Why?? We’ve spent over 3k with this airline to secure flights that are still delayed. I understand there’s a pandemic that makes travel difficult, but the least we expect is our money back or one voucher that we can use on future flights. We have also rescheduled numerous flights that we didn’t receive confirmation emails for. We had to call them to ensure we had seats, and they ended up telling us we did not have seats and we had to pay more to get them. At one point, I spent 10 hours on their messaging system attempting to switch a flight and spoke with over 4 representatives before having luck on a simple transfer. Even still, we ended up with yet another voucher that had to be used without combining it with another voucher. What good does 5 $115 vouchers that we have to use within 12 months do us? I’ll tell you now that we won’t be using one of those vouchers and will never book with American again."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Can't Get A Business Class Seat To SA,"Have been trying to book a business class seat to SCL but only economy and Premium economy comes up on their website over numerous different dates in Nov/Jan..  I know they have them as I can book one on Expedia!!Maybe I am lucky since after reading the incredible number of their dissatisfied customers on this site I may be lucky and give my business to another airline (Delta here I come!!!). Can't believe how many folks have endured disastrous services, cancellations, unresponsiveness, and worse yet uncaring, rude and dismissive American Airline employees. Not an airline that evokes confidence in me."
Date of travel: February 2021,50,Mr. Kahn set the bar,(American Airlines flight 132) 22FEB: Cancun to DallasFlight Attendant Kahn was extremely personable and empathetic to the customers in his care. He displayed superb tact and poise when communicating with all passengers. Mr. Kahn’s overall professional appearance and demeanor should be a model for all junior flight attendants.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Won't Fly with them ever again,"My family and I planned our annual snowboard trip to Park City and we chose to fly American because they had the latest departure on our return flight home.  We always snowboard the last day of our trip and then fly home in the evening.  Well, American messed that all up for us.  Both of our initial flights were changed and the only flight they had available to return home was so early that we were not able to board the last day of our trip, even though we purchased tickets in advanced and had to eat almost $600 for our entire family.  The only concession American was willing to make was to put us on a flight the next morning- which would mean we would have to pay for an extra night at our hotel, which was sold out.  No refund or credit was given.  We won’t be flying this airline ever again!"
Date of travel: February 2021,20,Didn't Feel Covid Safety Precautions Were Being Followed,"Ours was a packed flight. Naturally masks were required. MANY people during the flight (while seated) had their masks pulled down below their noses or under their chins. Flight attendants would walk by and never said anything to anyone about this. Seemed they just turned a blind eye to avoid the hassle. Would not fly American again during the pandemic as it felt too lax.Also, on this two hour flight not even water was offered."
Date of travel: January 2021,50,"Clean & comfortable, but snacks should be free","I always like flying American Airlines. Clean and comfortable, good leg space. I just wish they would provide free snacks. You have to bring your own or purchase from them currently."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,If I could rate 0 I would,"American is the worst airline. Everyone who has been on an American airlines flight or dealt with their joke of a phone line agrees. This should be enough, but lets continue. The airline never refunded a cancelled flight, and stole $150. The customer service line is a complete joke. After waiting over an hour on hold, the representative hung up. This happened twice. Garbage airline that does not care about the customer in the slightest."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Worst flight of my life,By far the worst flight of my life to start off the representative for check in sent us to the wrong Security checking in line we have both a baby and a small dog with us after waiting 45 minutes in line she didn’t even give a crap and told us we just have to wait in a different line and wait again After complaining to the manager also said all he can do is have us wait  in line again we almost missed our flight because of them Then the flight attendant was the most route flight attendant I have ever met in my life I’ve actually never met a route flight attendant other than her When the flight was done and we were gathering our things we had quite a few things together and she needed to wait for all the passengers to leave the aircraft She started making hisses and faces because she had to wait my opinion is if she doesn’t like her job she should quit this is the worst a line I’ve ever been in and I wouldn’t recommend it to my enemies
Date of travel: February 2021,20,ZERO social distancing + Damaged Bag,"The only reason the flight got any stars was for safety. Never felt uncomfortable and the pilot got us to our destination on time despite being delayed. However, upon arriving to check in our bags, BOTH employees (on our way to Orlando and on our way home) must have seriously hated their jobs -- The least bit helpful and SO RUDE! The flight was PACKED. There was zero social distancing whatsoever. Since the flight was so packed, the offered complimentary checked carry-ons, so I volunteered since I had a toddler and a bunch of stuff to carry. When I got my bag from the carousel, the ENTIRE HANDLE was ripped off. Gone. Nowhere to be found. I actually attach the carseat to my carry on bag to make it a stroller because I can't possible carry all of our bags PLUS a heavy carseat. Well, since the handle was broken, I can no longer do that.Our ride was waiting for us at the airport, so I called customer service and they pretty much told me I was S-O-L unless I drove back to the airport (in a different state...with a toddler and all of my stuff, during a pandemic.. convenient, right?) to show them the damage. They said I could send an email, which I did, and now 3 days have passed and I never even got the courtesy of getting an email back."

They were handpicked to work this airline that has zero empathy and no regard whatsoever for humans like them....sorry I forgot they ain't humans...bunch of evils! Wicked souls! Never ever flying american airlines again.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Social distancing,In the airport everywhere signs of social distancing and on the plane everyone is on top of each other there should be a seat empty  in between . But they want to make the money and they can care less . And to top it off flights are pricey and no food on the plane only a bottle of water and some nasty pretzel . Instead of giving out juice with chips or cookies . This airline uses the excuse of COVID for their convenience . Not content with this new way.

Had to get an uber because my arranged ride wasn't available the next day.

And then they had to de-ice the plane??? After that... they said the Deicing Truck was broken and we may have to deboard the whole plane for our comfort??? I was sitting in the front of the plane beside a stranger and my husband was sitting in the back. We were an hour late and missed our connecting flight because their shenanigans. There were people on the plane that missed their flights going to work... It is really sad and they could care less. On the way back from our destination - we were on the plane and they made everyone deboard because a drunk lady wouldn’t pull her mask up over her nose. We were coming back from Punta Cana where you have to have a Corona Virus test before you even get on the plane. Again everyone was missing their connecting flights, we had to run and almost missed ours???? And for what????  I took my mom last week to Punta Cana on Delta... Noo problems... they assign you seats so you are not sitting by complete strangers, they give you sanitation wipes as soon as you board, they have a seat empty beside you, there was noo unneasary drama, we got to watch a movie, and they were friendly and happy we flew with them. I am sorry American Airlines you have lost my families business. If you continue to treat people like you do noo one will use your airline."

The flight took about 1 hour and arrived on time. COVID-19: The crew wore masks and all passengers were expected to do the same throughout the entire flight.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible service,We were delayed going to Atlanta for 4 hours because the crew was on another flight...... they lost my bag coming back.. no type of communication with the passengers I had a horrible flight
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Worst Customer Service,"I will never fly American Airlines again. Delayed flight because of a sensor. No mechanic at airport. They had to get one to drive in over 6 hrs away. Changed flights 4 times. Won't give refunds until travel is over. Charging for seats together when they are open! Downgraded on 2 flights. They gave me a hotel to stay in Durango until the next day and then on my way to the hotel, after paying to rent a car I got a notification my hotel is canceled. Not to mention the rude service from every airport employee. Was told they didn't have time to deal with us. I understand mechanical failures but the rude service is unbelievable. To be told they don't have time to deal with my problem is unacceptable. Now I am driving back to the airport again. Wasting my day just to get a hotel."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Would’ve rather swam home,"Do NOT fly American Airlines. My family of 5 had a connecting flight from St Thomas to Philadelphia to Boston that was supposed to take place, however, the plane did not fuel up enough from taking off in St Thomas. Instead of landing in Philly to catch our next flight, they told us that our plane was “low on fuel” and that we had to take an emergency landing in Baltimore to refuel. Because of this, we had to go there first before Philly and miss our flight. Furthermore, we took off an hour late and instead of it being a 3.5 hour long flight, it ended up being close to 7 hours. Not only that but we missed our flight to Boston and we DID NOT get reimbursed. We had to drive from Philly home and rent a car. We did not get to our hotel to sleep because we were extremely tired until 3 in the morning. We were also supposed to have a carry on for the 5 of us, like we had on the way down with JetBlue. Instead, they stopped my daughter with her bag and forced her to check it. Because of that we still do not have her luggage and they had horrible service. We still don’t know how to get her bag. On the 7 hour flight they gave us nothing but a half sized bottle of water and a tiny bag of Pretzels. We probably caught covid on that flight and there were also two babies SCREAMING on the plane which made everyone go crazy. They had to shut down the tarmac in Philly because a plane had the same issue as ours. American airlines only cares about money and not their customers. Well, we are not their customers any longer. The pilot sounded like he had no education and the flight attendants were rude AF. We did not get to eat dinner until midnight. American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown and we will never do it again. I would have rather swam home from St Thomas than fly on that airline. Whatever you do, DO NOT FLY AMERICAN!!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: September 2020,40,"Early morning flight from Richmond, Virginia to Chicago-O'Hare, Illinois","The boarding process went well. Passengers were given a sanitary wipe upon boarding.

There was no entertainment provided except for the airline's app on your own device. There was no food or drink service during the flight. The flight lasted slightly over 2 hours and arrived on time.

Date of travel: March 2020,10,Poor customer service and management.,"I had a flight booked for March to take a cruise out of Miami.  The cruise was cancelled.  I re-booked for December.  The airfare was a total (for 3 of us) a savings for us at $217.50.  I had to fight for the credit to my credit card for the pre-paid seats, which I finally received.  I called many times to get the credit for the difference in airfare credited to my credit card.  I never received a call back from a ""manager"", and even emailed the CEO three times to get a credit rather than a voucher, which I can never use before the expiration date.  Contrast to Delta, they were so nice and did whatever was needed to accommodate the disruption caused by covid.  Very satisfied with Delta's handling of the other travel plans, credits and unending voucher.  AMERICAN AIRLINE SUCKS!!!!  Will never use them again!  Laying off 13,000 people already.  Get ready for another 5,000.  BTW, the CEO makes $12MILLION a year.  His email addy is doug.parker@aa.com phone is 888.214.3282 (not direct, and they will make up stories they can't get hold of him).  Feel free to email him your complaint."
n/a,10,Worse Airline Ever!,"Worst airline ever! There is ALWAYS an issue. 6 weeks ago had to se board flight for 2 hours  , barely got on connecting flight and then had to sit on runway for an hour once we reached our destination. Today was 2 hours late leaving AGAIN! Then, lost our luggage when we got to destination . NEVER again! Will I set one foot on American Airline - and the staff is rude"
n/a,10,Very disappointed ,Horrible experience.  I was supposed to flew back from Las Vegas to Canada with one stop in Philadelphia.  Upon my arrival in Las Vegas airport I was told my flight didn't exist.  I have asked for an alternative and was given a flight that was taking off the next day . Of course the personnel was rude and dismissive.  I have politely told them that they should at least have announced me of the change so I could have kept my hotel room at which they just shrugged their shoulders and told me I can sleep in the airport on the bench. I figured out a better route back and at my request they agreed.  Of course I had to spend almost 20 more hours on the road at my expense. I also want to emphasize the fact that their employees were abrupt and dismissive. This was the worst travel experience I've experienced in my life. Be careful when choosing their services.
Date of travel: September 2020,40,"Late morning flight from Charlotte, North Carolina to Richmond, Virginia","The boarding process went well. In main cabin the seating was 6 across with comfortable seats and adequate leg room for my 6'2"" frame. The was no entertainment provided except for the airline's app on your own device.

Date of travel: February 2021,10,Terrible Service,"Our flight from Bahamas to JFK was split into two, the second one being cancelled due to weather. American Airlines decided to randomly split our group and put half of us on a flight to New Jersey, and leave the rest stranded in Charlotte, NC till the next flight which they said would take 3 days. We explained that we were registered nurses and had work the next day, and they responded with a negative attitude and said we have to deal with that ourselves. The service was terrible and they forced us to find our own way home."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Rude and uncaring ,"On my flight out of Ft Wayne to Dallas the temperature on the plane was freezing!! It could not have gotten above 60 in the front of the plane. Everyone in the front half of the plane was freezing and numerous people asked to turn heat up. The two airline attendants, who literally talked the ENTIRE time to each other, so loud no one could even think about sleeping, were rude and said there was nothing they could do because it was warm in the back of the plane. They told us they could not serve any beverages - not even water - on a 3 hour flight AND even in 1st class!! It was horrible. Never again. Oh - and it was 100% full. Not one empty seat. My opinion of American has gone down drastically the last couple years!!  And WHY did I spend the extra money on 1st class??!!! Avoid American if you can!!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,The worst!,The worst experience ever today. DENIED us on our flight and kept our bag on the plane. Worst experience and the attendant at the terminal was the rudest lady I’ve ever encountered. Had no care for us.
Date of travel: February 2021,50,"Outstanding service by Albert of American Airlines at MCI, Kansas City.","One of the crew members called Albert at the check in at MCI was exemplary awesome. There was a little trouble with the timing for the Covid-19 test results and Albert was really informative on how to go about it and get another rapid one explaining precisely on how important timing and traveling works. His patience, willingness to help, keen to detail and generosity was beyond impressive. Also, he was training a new crew member and he was really good and thorough at it as he walked her through the check in process. If American Airlines would have anyone to train the new crew members then I would definitely pick Albert to be the person to lead on for training every new crew member. I was very impressed."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Poor service at Airport,We waited over 2 hrs just to check bags at airport.  JetBlue and next airline was getting customers checked in quickly.  American Airlines waiting line was out to the street.  Very disappointed in the service.  I would not recommend using American Airlines out of Punta Cana.  I can’t imagine the wait at peak capacity.
Date of travel: November 2020,20,"Don't fly during covid, Delta are the ones to go for","I've flown with AA a couple of times across the Atlantic and couldn't fault them, in fact I recommended them on account of the brand new 787 they always had us on. However, I booked again during Covid and when, as happens now, I needed to change the dates they were trying to charge me over £1000 extra just to swap. I took a flight voucher hoping to book it again through Skyscanner, knowing that prices were lower on there, but they added a clause that means flight vouchers can only be used on straight AA bookings, so there was no way around the £1000 charge. Knowing when I was beaten, I booked with the slightly more expensive Delta, who I have flown with twice during Covid now, and every time I have needed to make a date change for my flight Delta have either made the change for free or actually given me money back. It's a no brainer, go with Delta if you're flying right now."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,The usual.,"As always I have found myself making the regretful decision of flying with American Airlines. As with every time I’m the past yet again there is flight changes, cancels and sitting on the tarmac for 30 min as 7 other American airline flights land after and let off passengers before. The pilot sounded like he had a fourth grade education and provided no information as to why we sat for so long or why other flights were let off before us. Just blamed tower and slow workers in the airport for delays. Hand to god. I would rather have COVID while being trapped in a cell with Jeffery Epstein than ever ride with this $hit hole company again."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,American Airlines stole my bag!,"I have been trying to find my bag which was supposed to be on a nonstop flight to Cancún. The bag is supposedly still in Dallas. Every time I contact someone about the whereabouts of my bag, I’m given the run around. I was told it would be on the 3:00 flight that didn’t happen. I was told it would be on the 440 flight that didn’t happen. Then told the 8:00 flight. Still no bag. I’m deviated about the fact that I have medication that I need and they will not give me my bag. I believe it has been stolen. How does a bag get lost on a nonstop flight. The customer service i have received has been awful. I’m literally in tears because i have been treated so poorly. I arrived at 11 am. With all the flights to Cancún why was my bag not placed on any of them. I will be reaching out for legal counsel at this point because I have not received my bag and I will be reporting it stolen."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,American Airlines Vacations DON'T USE!,"WORSE vacation booking I have every experienced. They have No customer service or support. You book and you are on your own. No follow up, no check ins, no anything. You book and you are no longer of value to American Airlines. If this is the best that America has to offer, we are doomed! My resort had closed down and no one contacted me. Luckily I called the resort directly and they told me. Called American Airlines and they still refused to cancel my flight. I had to make several nasty phone calls before they agreed to cancel my flight and rebook."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Worst flight I have ever taken,To start off this flight I tried calking AA to see if there were any issues regarding my flight and they said no but once I got to the airport I discovered there were many. Eventually we got on the plane and made it to Chicago where I had to sprint to my next flight to then get a call that my baggage isn’t on my connecting flight. Not only did I have these issues but also discovered their lack of regard towards covid and cautions taken to protect their passengers. Each flight was packed unlike southwest who doesn’t allow anyone to sit in the middle seat. No one was helpful or kind. I will never fly with American Airlines ever again.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,American Airlines...you should be ashamed of yourselves!,I cannot believe in this time of Covid 19 that you are flying at FULL capacity! I guess greed outweighs people's safety and peace of mind. It seems that you are trying to get all of $$$ you lost when this pandemic hit by just packing passengers in like sardines with no regard for social distancing at all! SHAME ON YOU! I WILL NEVER FLY AMERICAN AGAIN and will work hard to convince everyone else that I know to do the same. How dare you!
Date of travel: February 2021,10,"AA, you need to correct training for your employees","Customer Service -"" We changed you to the same day later flight Standby.""Ticket counter - ""I never heard about it. Pay another 230 or no ticket/flight""Customer Relation Call Back - insulting customer. Yelling. Where and what is the customer relation!!! End of phone call in the middle of talking. No solution.Do they have any training for their employees?AA, step up and train your employees correctly, otherwise, they will make your whole company rotten and all gone in no time."
Date of travel: February 2021,40,Good Airlines,Good Airlines will only fly American Delta United and southwest wish they had soft drinks or had a section like delta comfort
Date of travel: February 2021,10,"Profits first, People second","Kiosks we’re running at snail speed. Took me 40 minutes to print my boarding pass with four people in line before me. Flight was FULLY booked despite ever rising covid cases. At least 20 passengers w masks around their necks and no one instructing them to correct their selfish mask etiquette. Per usual, it’s profits first, people second. I highly recommend booking delta if you value your health, safety, and comfort."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Sexual Harassment- AA does not care,"My fiancee and I were flying home for Christmas and our flight attendant had sexually harassed us the whole flight. He was making crude gestures with his hands (scissoring) and kept making jokes about my fiancee having sex with someone while I was deployed. He then proceeded to talk down the military and told my Fiancee, ""you look like a crayon eater, you a crayon eater?"". After we got home, I submitted a complaint. They replied with ""there is not enough evidence so we can't do anything"". I am appalled knowing that this was how they handle sexual harassment and harassment by their flight attendants in general."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,AA never fails to disappoint,Moved our flight time 4 hours earlier without notification the night before. Only reason we noticed is we checked in early online. Arrived early just to run into mechanical problems. We understand things happen but they never communicated to anyone what they were going to do. After waiting 4 hours and taking time to eat we decided to ask what the plan was. They told us they were rebooking everyone on United Airlines with a layover in Denver. No apology of any sort just here are a few food vouchers 20 min before we are set to board. They were only good the day of and only at that airport. Useless! American had become an airline that is comfortable with terrible service. We had others traveling with AA also and they had a very similar experience. The flight back was a little better only because of the flight attendant (Patrick Arendall was AWESOME and went above and beyond for everyone. He made up for the other staffs lack luster service) never again AA!
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Not Impressef,"For years AA was our go to airline. Last few flights we were disappointed. As we needed a direct flight, since I use a wheel chair and wearing a mask for an extended time is hard fir me as I have severe claustrophobia and vertigo, and AA had one we booked first class tickets. A few weeks before leaving got an email that our direct flight was changed now we had to make a stop. Had a mask on for two hours before flight and another four during - direct flights would have taken me home after four hours! Stewardess offered us drinks and either a cheese and fruit plate or a sandwich. The platter was served on a tray and looked appetizing . The sandwich was in a bag wrapped in plastic that wasn't even tight. Two pieces of bread - not a roll or baguette - a piece of turkey n cheese. Also a cookie wrapped the same way. As drinks were flowing the entire flight I think a regular meal, or at least a decent  sandwich on a tray, could have easily been served. Went through customs in Charlotte and sat in a crowded airport for two hours. By this time my claustrophobia was getting the best of me. Boarded flight and we were shocked to see plane was packed - all seats taken  Again drinks were flowing but not even a peanut was offered. When we landed stewardess announced that everyone should stay seated until the row in front of you was out. No one listened and everyone was on top of each other trying to get off plane. No other announcement was made. Had the mask on for almost 10 hours. Would we fly AA again? Probably not."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,"Worst AA - Booked Business Class, their system automatically rebooked by flight in economy on the same flight. no refund","When saving up enough cash for a nice experience all year. Ends in American Airlines Stealing my hard earned money. Every single American Airlines representative i talked to 5 in total said to call another department to fix the issue. pass the issue rather than follow the issue to completionI ended up paying for the entire ticket. Shame on American Airlines. Fly Delta, United or Virgin. As an American citizen, I am ashamed that the Airline Airlines carries our Flag and our name.  You cant steal from us, it's not right."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible customer service.,"Canceled a flight and only offered upgrade seats at my expense, for the following day, or a flight to a different city (can’t see how that is at all helpful). When I spoke to ticketing agent I was told that was not their problem, do I want the tickets or not. Took it to customer relations and was told too bad. In addition to the original cost of the tickets, their cancellation cost me an additional $540.00. Would never fly American again."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Refused my Emotional Support Animal - Stranded in another state,"We flew American from Phoenix to Mobile, Alabama. My dog is a registered emotional support animal, but we had to register him as a pet and pay for him to fly due to American's policy. The Phoenix airport measured his kennel and watched him turn around in the kennel and said it was fine for their regulations. Then, on the way back, Rebecca (supervisor) at the Mobile airport refused to let my ESA on the plane due to kennel size, saying it was too small for him, even though it was approved in Phoenix. I NEED him to fly. The supervisor was rude and unsympathetic. We had to return, so I had to leave my ESA in Alabama, on the other side of the country, and pay for his care there. Now I have to figure out how to get him back to Phoenix at my own expense. Either way, my dog should've never been allowed onto a flight and then not allowed on the return flight. One of the employees was wrong, either way. Customer service agents refused to do anything."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Worst customer service and flight compensation,"Canceled my flight and left me stranded for two days with no offer to compensate. Didn’t care at all and said they had to help other customers first who had purchased flights, even though I had purchased my flight a month prior with insurance."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Will never book AA again,Will never book a flight through American Airlines ever again. Booked our flight and both times they changed my husbands seat on both flights even though we had payed almost $40 per seat per flight to secure our seats.
Date of travel: February 2021,20,The worst damn airline operating the worst flying artifacts.,"This airplane had an airplane operating without proper inner pressurization, my ears were about to explode cause of it all the time. They left the heat running excessively, no AC nicely blowing, the plane layout was more for gnomes not people. This company Management should revise their investment and operate something to mitigate people's suffering. They should be banned to be in service."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Worse experience and stuck losing more money,"Never fly American Airlines again. Their customer service sucks. Stuck in AZ until Thursday, lied to by their employees while at the airport multiple times. Told my flight was rebooked to another day, it wasn’t. The new flight canceled again. Not being reimbursed any hotel fees or anything. Missing work now the rest of the week. Biggest money loss and lying company ever."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Bait and Switch,"It's probably normal for airlines to cancel flights and put passengers on alternative flights, I don't expect these things aren't for good reason. However! When booking flights we always book early flights outbound and later flights for the return trip. Doing it this way always costs us more money but we have more vacation time in the end so it's worth it to us. This time AA changed outbound and inbound flights, which tickets have less value, however they have decided not to reimburse for the difference or offer a credit. They sold us more expensive tickets and have unethically decided to give us the cheaper tickets is what it boils down to. We understand our travel time increases by 5 hours and vacation time actually is nearly a day shorter, but I don't understand why we aren't credited for this when we paid more to have those times. ...back to Delta or SW for us!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Don't book them!,"worst service, worst employees from costumer service to flight attendants, worst costumer service by phone, mail in person or how ever you can try!SIMPLY DONT BOOK THEM.always delay always canceling, always lying can't even organize the employees to lie in our face right. they'll tell you every excuse on the book and still not answer your question! or help you in any single way.they are definitely the worst and i flight a lot!! texas has one of the worst staff members!never in my life have i had so many issues with an airline. may god help you if you loose your loagagge. and also sometimes they seem to cancel on purpose so you got to pay out of your pocket after waiting for hours of delay for the closest hotel they recommend you!! they are awful!Also my rate is 0000000 but they make me tap a circle!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,1 STAR,Delayed 7 times and horrible service during the 8 hours in the airport. We had to move ports 3 times. Which meant the train they have at DFW is FAST.I fell in to a random stranger twice while riding it while moving from Port to Port due to not knowing where which plane is going where.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Better Off Walking,"The one thing I will credit American Airlines with is their ability to play games.  There's nothing quite like the expectation of a promise of delivery of you and your luggage to a destination, only to sit in an aircraft on the tarmac for the better part of two hours while they figure out that the aircraft, which was sitting at the airport for the entire day in winter weather, needed to be de-iced. While in flight, I asked a flight attendant about whether he could tell if the connection I was supposed to make would be held or not.  He shrugged and said I'd be better off checking the app online.  It was pretty clear that a two hour delay in departure ate up the 90 minutes I previously had for a layover, and 15 minutes before our arrival my connecting flight had already departed.  The gate attendants directed me and many of my fellow passengers to the growing line at customer service (which only had one person staffing it for quite some time).  Eventually, more American Airlines staff members began to ""help"" stranded customers.  My plight was not as bad as those pitiable families with children who clearly needed some good news.  I hope they got better than I did.  The news I received was that American's failure to figure out de-icing was not their fault, but God's, and that they had coded the delay as a weather delay.  Mind you, many other airlines managed to get their planes in the air.  Given that American Airlines has their own de-icing operation, it seems like an organization issue and lack of customer service.  All that said, I got the privilege of paying for a hotel room and 24 hours of waiting for the next flight.  As I sit in an airport with minimal heating, I'm hopeful that the snow storm raging outside the DFW airport windows will not delay them yet again.   Thanks for mostly getting me where I needed to go, American, sort of on the timeframe we'd agreed to.  Next time I'll fly Southwest."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!,The lady was so rude that checked us in. She rolled her eyes .We had a family trip of 9 people. She sat us next to strangers  during Covid how smart. I am now sick. Very very rude and very unhelpful. I will never fly this Airline again . Our flight was 2/8/2021. If they are so worried about covid yet do nothing to protect people. The guy I was forced to sit next t o was clearly ill.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible,This was the worst flight I've ever experienced. The service and quality were subpar at best. I'll never fly with them again. The only way to get out of Portland was too get a delta flight and now fight with Alaska airlines to refund the insured tickets. Ridiculous
Date of travel: December 2020,40,Pretty good,We had a flight at 7 AM and there was no delay and the flight wasn’t too long. It was a pretty good experience
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible experience!,"I usually don’t write reviews, but my experience was so terrible I had to say something. The check-in agent and her manager wrongfully denied me from flying (I'm an American studying in Canada and they falsely claimed international students weren't allowed in). They were extremely rude, unsympathetic, and dismissive; much more so than any other airline workers I’ve ever encountered. I have never experienced anything like this before! By the time I had a higher-up sort out the issue, it was too late to check in and they had to transfer me to a different flight. I lodged a complaint and so far have not heard back, but I hope they get a stern talking-to about this so that no other international students ever have to deal with this."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Airline choice of disappointment,"A disaster from the start. Our first flight was delayed an hour without any reason given (the attendant at the counter commented as we checked our bags that they might not even fly us for an entire day (as if this were a joke)) the attendant messed up the flight chart and spent an extra 20 minutes doing role call in search of a missing person who was actually seated 4 aisle down. In Dallas things got even worse. Since our flight was extremely delayed the connection reportedly held the flight for 10 extra minutes for us (although they were departing earlier than scheduled anyway) and as all 26 passengers who were delayed for American Airlines reasons were denied entry and were forced to wait outside of the gate and watch the plane sit on the tarmac for half an hour before departure. American personnel offered no help and without a connection, sent us a voucher for a hotel near the airport. We arrive on day 2 at Dallas airport early and quickly pass through TSA and arrive at our gate early. Come time for boarding we are delayed again and again abecause our flight attendant is “missing”. Our flight has yet to leave, and American personal has assured us three times that they have no idea where this person is, or when they will arrive and they aren’t doing anything to replace her absence. I’m done with this airline company. I should have saved my money and stayed home because I spent my vacation weekend in the Dallas airports TGIF restaurant."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible all around,"Flight 6062 on Feb 12. Long delay on the ground after we boarded on what’s already a stuffed, tiny plane with people coughing and almost zero concern for coronavirus. The heat was turned all the way up (despite several requests to cool it down). It took 40 minutes AFTER scheduled takeoff time for anyone to mic up and tell us what the problem was (overweight) and then it took another 45 minutes to defuel the plane. I usually fly Delta and it is 100% better than this crap show."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,AA deserves the bankruptcy,"Dirty plane, visible build up of scum on and around the seats. We sat on our packed flight with no updates for over 3 hours parked in terminal because of mechanical problems. Attendants were condescending, disrespectful, and unhelpful when confronted with basic questions by the passengers. Then they gave everyone free snacks (as if that makes up for it) so the full plane could take their masks off to eat at the same time during a pandemic. It’s not humane to treat people like cattle, that’s what this experience get like. I also never received a refund for the WiFi I paid for, for a flight that didn’t take off. Very disappointed, will likely never fly AA again and will spread the word about my experiences to my family and friends"
Date of travel: August 2020,40,"Mid-morning flight from Phoenix, Arizona to Los Angeles, California","I was bumped up to first class so I did not get to experience much of the boarding process or get a look at the main cabin.

The flight was about 90 minutes and arrived on time. COVID-19: The crew wore masks and all passengers were expected to wear masks throughout the entire flight."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,COVID-19 Unsafe,"I’ve flown other airlines during the pandemic but this is my first on American. I experienced lack of effort to limit numbers on the aircraft. I feel like they could limit it a little. But the flight was almost completely full. There were no wipes passed out while we boarded or other safety gestures. The worst of all, passengers with masks below their noses were not told by attendants to pull up their masks. I witnessed that I wasn’t the only passenger to attempt to draw an attendant’s attention to this issue. However, we were literally waved off by the attendant and told she was getting to it. Finally another attendant “got to it,” after we had been sitting by this couple for over 20 minutes on the tarmac. She never checked back to see if they were compliant, which they were not. Irresponsible amd lazy come to mind. If there’s one useful thing they could do, it would be to enforce something so simple. Shall I do that as a customer? That’s really not cool."
Date of travel: August 2020,40,"Early morning flight from Las Vegas, Nevada to Phoenix, Arizona","I was bumped up to first class so I was deprived of observing the boarding process and experiencing the main cabin.

The flight attendant stood over him while he was looking for another one telling him he would be removed from the plane & put on the no fly list in a tone that made everyone around us feel like the flight attendant was looking forward a fight. Aren’t these attendants supposed to be in customer service? They obviously need training in how to be nice & civil. American Airlines should be absolutely ashamed they let their employees treat customers, who pay high fees their services, to act in such a disrespectful manner. These people are drunk are on their new found power & it’s disgusting. Never again will we fly AA."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Flight delay,Because my flight was delayed 2 1/2 hours I missed my return flight home and no one would help me get a returning flight because I had booked it with another airline so I ended up paying 570 to get home all American Airlines fault do not ever want to fly again because of how I was treated
Date of travel: February 2021,10,I will never fly with American airlines again.,Flight delayed nearly 5 hours. Due to snow but there is no snow. No explanation. No lunch or snacks or anything offered. No apology.Never again.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Extremely rude customer service.,"This lady rudely explained to me that neck garters are no longer acceptable in place of face mask. I have been flying weekly since December. This is the first time I chose to fly American instead of Delta. She said they changed the policy 2 days ago. I will NEVER fly with American Airlines, again!!!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Delays and poor service guaranteed,"I’ve been traveling for years, AA is by far the worst. Since this site makes me type 100 characters, here."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible service,Will not ever recommend to fly American Airlines.... you want to talk about people who waste time and cause you to miss your flight well your looking at the right airline. I will never recommend this airline or will not ever fly with them again.  After the lady checking in our bags decide to help us there was still time to check our bags in after waiting in a line (we were the only people in line) for 25-30 mins were told that we missed our flight check in by 3 minutes but we wouldn’t of missed it if the lady at the counter would of done her job. After all of this I asked to speak with a manager and low and behold no manager could be found even over radio.. so we haven’t gotten to talk to anyone we just missed our flight and stuck in the airport due to pure laziness of American employees.
Date of travel: February 2021,50,Careing flight attendents,"American Airlines flight 4763 from Charlotte to Hartford, February 9, 2021. The flight attendants on this trip were AMAZING! The young lady in front of us was NOT a happy camper and from just after takeoff began to have panic / anxiety attacks. The rear area attendant spotted her distress and started to try and calm her and assist her. There were soothing words, offers of encouragement, cool compresses and eventually an ice bag. There were also calls to the flight deck that seemed to alter the altitude off the plane and condition of the cabin air (pressure and or oxygen). A second attendant also appeared and offered assistance. Eventually the first attendant sat in the seat next to the distressed passenger for most of the flight. The other flight crew covered for her and none of the other passengers were neglected. My thanks to the entire crew of AA4763. Job well done!"
Date of travel: August 2020,30,"Morning flight from Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas to Las Vegas, Nevada","The boarding process went well. Passengers were offered as snack pack upon boarding the aircraft. There was no other food or drink service during the flight. Seating was 6 across in main cabin with comfortable seats and adequate leg room for my 6' 2"" frame. There were entertainment consoles in the seat backs as well as the availability of the airline's app on your own device. Departure was delayed due to a mechanical problem with the aircraft and arrival was about 20 minutes late. COVID-19: The crew was masked and passengers were expected to remain masked throughout the flight."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Unsafe - COVID Regulations Ignored,"If you don't want to wear a mask on an airplane this is the airline for you. Watched a passenger go without his mask after being reminded twice before takeoff. It was ignored by the flight attendants who collected trash. When I confronted the flight attendants at landing they made it seem like a non-issue. I will not fly again with American Airlines after this experience. If they ignore this, what else do they ignore when it comes to your safety?"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Extremely rude Ticket agent in charlotte,Older african american in her 50s or 60s at ticket agent “helping” with checked bags was apparently having a bad day or just hates her job. Was very polite to her and greeted her and asked if she wouldnt mind helping me please put my sticker on my checked bag bc I always put it on wrong. She bluntly replies “yeah i actually do have a problem with that” so i put them on myself and she throws my bag onto the belt as obnoxiously as possible. Yeah we get it cause of covid you dont want to touch my sticker but your literally about to touch my bag. Rest of the trip was great but first impression with this ignorant person was a joke
Date of travel: February 2021,30,Frequent flyer,"I am an AA advantage but, they made me board 8 I received zero points for the trip which started in Cincinnati Ohio round trip to Punta Cana. They checked bag at terminal on way home. I was searched at every point. I have my Global Entry card and pre check approval.  Twould airports allowed my gifts 3rd took it"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Why do we have flight attendance,This lil power they have aquired with these mask mandates has gone too far without food or beverage service what purpose do they serve. I fly once a month which isnt much but this is a constant on every flight. Haven't seen an instance yet that wasn't resolved or helped by fellow passengers in regards to seat issues.  Save money and get rid of the most unpleasant part of the flight.

Date of travel: February 2021,20,Horrible customer service,My husband and I were flying to Michigan to attend his grandfathers funeral. Our flight from Amarillo was delayed a few minutes but we arrived in DFW and hauled butt to our connection. We arrived at the gate at 2:35 and the scheduled take off was 2:45 and I know the cut off is 10 minutes prior to departure to close the door. Well we were there and nobody was at the gate so we missed our flight and had a 6 hour layover. I called customer service and the guy was rude and uncaring. Fast forward those 6 hours we are ready to board the next flight when the gate agent announced we are delayed because the flight attendant is late! Ok hold the plane for them but not your paying customers. Geez get it together American!
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Mad,They moved my daughter dad to a nother seat and he was in the right spot and we were going as a family .
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Packed plane and delayed as usual- after we were on the plane,Not one open seat on the plane!! So much for social distancing at the airport to then sit and inch from the stranger next to me for several hours.Plane got to the runway then turned around and went back due to a passenger issue?? Two people just walked off and one person got on. The pilot left the cabin for over half and hour.!!It’s always something.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,I'll never fly American again,"I have not traveled this flight yet, so I may update. I booked this through Capital One travel, another one I'll never use again. I added up the time it has taken me, phone time only, to book this. Total 9 1/2 hours over 3 1/2 days to get things resolved. The first issue was getting money I'd paid for a trip to Germany applied to this new itinerary. At first Cap One told me I couldn't use that credit for Hawaii. The TVC to Portland part was fine, but at $800.00 for first class for that, they wanted me to ""donate"" the remaining $1200.00 to AA. After that 3 hour call, I had my flights booked, so I thought. I called the next day to get my seats selected, and they said there was a problem that the flights had not been ticketed and didn't exist. Another 3 1/2 hours ON PHONE to get that resolved. I called AA the next day to get my dog booked, and the AA rep asked how I was getting to Hawaii. I stared at my confirmation, but she said the Hawaiian leg of my trip had been cancelled. NO NOTIFICATION. No text, email, phone call. I called Cap one to rant. I told them to just cancel my Hawaiian leg and keep the return flights, but AA wouldn't allow that. The only itinerary they had for me, in order to make my dates booked, was a flight from PDX to Phoenix that arrived at 9:49 with the next flight departing at 10:20. What are the chances I'll make THAT connection, do you think? AND, it doesn't even get me to Kauai, only Honolulu, and I was told I'd have to book my own flight to Kauai. I am wrung out after 9 1/2 hours trying to deal with these greedy, inflexible, irresponsible companies. I usually fly Delta and I'll stick with them. Cap One Travel and AA are the worst booking experiences I've ever had.   I know... rich peoples' problems... but some of us still want to go some places before we die. I've had my two shots and am ready to meet with family, I'm optimistic now, but that's 9 1/2 hours I'll never get back."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Pay a little more or take longer trips to avoid this carrier,"I quit flying American in 2012 - 2013 after getting stuck on the tarmac at DFW for 3 hours, in the middle of the summer, in TEXAS, because they didn’t put enough fuel in the plane! Well flying for work I needed to go to DFW and it being a major American hub I thought what the heck let’s give them another chance. Booking travel for work I have to use a 3rd party site and somehow (this has never happened before and I fly weekly) my rental car got booked but my flight didn’t. When I finally received an email from them that they cancelled my flight, my fare had gone up $120! On top of that we board the completely packed plane for an on time departure just to get delayed for another 45 mins, for “paperwork” wth? Makes no sense. Sitting on a plane in those cramped seats for an additional 3/4 hour for them to do paperwork? In future I will pay a higher fare or take a longer route to avoid this airline."
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Flight cancellations and rescheduling,"I booked a flight from St. Kitts to Tucson, Arizona back in December of 2020.  The flight was cancelled several times without notification.  The only reason I found out was because I was monitoring the flight on my app.  When I called to reschedule, I was told different information by each representative I spoke to.  After the flight was cancelled twice, I was no longer able to sit in first class because it was sold out.  I was told that I couldn't get a refund on that portion of my ticket and that I had to obtain a voucher for future flights.  I was so frustrated at this point that I didn't want to be forced to purchase another ticket through American Airlines in order to not lose the difference in my ticket.  I asked to speak with a supervisor.  I was upset but I was not yelling or calling the representatives names.  The supervisor I spoke with told me I had to take the voucher and when I said this was the worst customer service I have ever had, she told me I was being rude and didn't have the right to speak to her that way.  I filed a complaint with the BBB and got a call back from another supervisor.  This supervisor was very understanding and agreed that it wasn't unreasonable to request my money back because I wasn't the one who initiated the change.  He followed up with me and took responsibility for the issues I had communicating with American Airlines.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because the last supervisor I spoke to had excellent customer service skills."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,useless voucher and lost money,"what a disgrace, flights cancelled last year due to covid. was forced to take a voucher, can't use the vouchers on baggage or seats and they won't let me use the remainder. now set to expire and won't let me use over $300 in vouchers.

Date of travel: February 2021,10,I was lied to about a refund and given a useless voucher!!,"I will never fly with American Airlines after my return flight home! I asked for a small refund of $92.50 as I was told would be refunded by the crew at PWM for the flight cancelation because the ticket should not have been sold to me since they knew that this flight was highly unlikely to go out on February 1st! Maybe if the CEO's sopped pocketing the money they received from their bailout and stopped layoffs, their relations would be better with the public!February  7, 2021Hello Ms. Tucker:Thank you for taking the time to write to Customer Relations. I apologize for the confusion caused by our rebooking and appreciate your continued patience with us. As the initial charge of $92.50 was appropriately collected for the voluntary change, it would not be considered for a refund if we had to rebook you on the original flights due to a flight delay or cancelation. Still, I certainly understand how frustrating this whole experience has been for you. As gesture of goodwill, I've made arrangements for a $92.50 eVoucher (via a separate email) for you. The voucher will be valid through February 7, 2022 and can be used toward the purchase of flights for yourself or others. I know this won't change what happened but I do hope it will be a mutual resolution we can come to. Thanks again for reaching out to us, Ms. Tucker. Although travel plans didn't go as planned, I do hope you have a great trip!Sincerely,Carlos SanchezCustomer RelationsAmerican AirlinesAA Ref#1-29583030629All of this after I was exposed many times at CLT to people not social distancing and not wearing masks, Then on the Jet bridge at CLT and RDU their was no AA attendant making sure people were 6 feet apart. The agents at CLT acted as if myself and a few other people were putting them out of the scope of their jobs when we asked why they were allowing so many people to through at one time. Clearly you could see that their were way too many people on the Jet bridge. LESSON LEARNED!! DELTA WILL GET MY EXTRA MONEY FROM NOW ON!!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,All time worst flight attendant experience!!!,"After my husband used the bathroom to blow his nose, a flight attendant, who was seated directly behind us (Krystal), used the intercom to announce, in a admonishing, condescending manner, that ""If you use our bathroom on this flight, clean up after yourself, this is not your home, do not pee on the toilet, and if you do, clean up after yourself.  Be respectful to other passengers on this plane.""   After she ended her announcement, Krystal proceeded to tap my husband on the shoulder and tell him to go clean the mess he made in the bathroom.  My husband told her (Krystal) that he did not relieve himself in the bathroom, but used it to blow his nose.  My husband, not wanting to bring more attention to himself, me and my son, told Krystal,  ""fine, I will clean up some other person's piss"" and he proceeded to clean the toilet.  After my husband returned to his seat from cleaning the toilet, the second flight attendant told my husband, that she told ""Krystal"" that it was not my husband, and after a few minutes, Krystal, apologized to my husband and offered to buy him a drink.  My family and I were humiliated by Krystal.  We have never flown American Airlines before, and after this experience, I will make sure that I never do again.   When I made a complaint, I was told it would be handled internally.   I am beyond disgusted with the way we were treated on this flight!!!"
Date of travel: February 2021,30,So So,Over crowded flights not enough moving space definitely breeding grounds for covid being so crammed full but other then that It got me there.
Date of travel: August 2020,30,"Early flight from Providence, Rhode Island to Charlotte, North Carolina",The boarding process went well. The seating in main cabin was 6 across with comfortable seats and adequate legroom. There was no entertainment provided except for the airline magazine and their app on your own device. There was no food or drink service for this 2 hour flight which arrived on time. COVID-19: The flight attendants were not very good about enforcing the mask policy.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,American Airlines just lied to me about Refund,"I booked a First Class ticket.  AA changed departure time and now I can't travel because flight arrives too late.  AA Reservation Agent said I would get full refund to credit card.  Now AA is only giving flight credit.  I complained and they won't do anything because they claim flight schedule change was less than 4 hours.  I'm a Platinum, and previously an Ex Platinum with AA for years.  I just booked Delta First Class."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,"Force to wear an American Airline ""approved"" mask since they want to ban neck gaiters","I was forced to wear an American Airline approved mask since my neck gaiter was deemed ""unacceptable"" at the gate. I emailed corporate and of course received back the standard canned response so I will take it to the people of the nation now. American Airlines THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO proof that a surgical mask which says right on the box ""does not protect against corona virus"" is any more effective than a neck gaiter. I will NOT be flying your service even after we have returned to ""normalcy"" which at this rate will be in 2025 or after. You have lost a passenger for life and I will be sure to voice my opinion on social media and if I can cost you even one or two ticket sales----then my goal is accomplished. Also since you didn't address my concern of why you are making such demands when O'hare airport has the following sign up that I am including? Basically the sign says that ALL masks are satisfactory. If its REALLY a ""federal law"" which is what I was told by American Airlines then I would think that O'hare would be complying? So someone is lying? Is it you American Airlines or O'hare?  You corporations need to realize that you need ME more than I need your airline. You will be made an example of. You have a terrific day now!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Poor customer service,I had a ticket and was not able to travel due to COVID. I was moving and ended up driving. I called to refund and was even willing to transfer to someone else since I couldn't use it and I was told I had to travel by 12 2021 or I would lose my money nothing they could or would do. If it were my fault I'd understand but we were all told not to travel by plane it due to covid if possible so I take the advice and. Now I. Out 300. Definitely not caring about customers. I called and emailed over and over now almost a year later still no response until I called again today and they aren't willing to help in any way literally said I have to.make a trip or lose my money.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Awful customer service,"Flight got delayed by 20-40 minutes at least 8 minutes times and when I go to see what's going on they barley acknowledge me, them ask me to measure my bag...again, even after I explain that this is the second half of a connecting flight. Also this company is tanking fast. No food or drink on flights, constantly delayed because they can't pay mechanics. Flight delayed because it hasn't left the other airport and no inclament weather. That means they do not have the man power or recources, to get you to your paid for destination on time. Keeping that in mind, they did find time to Hassel me about wearing a bandana over my mask several times and even told me not to argue with them when I simply asked why security let me through as is. They will play you repeated then try n make you pay. Sad to say but unless they get billions of dollars from taxpayers again in a bail out, this company won't last til 2030. Val is the supervisor from DC. American airlines who asked me to check the size of my bag when I asked if the flight was going to be delayed, didn't even answer my question, just instructed her worker to check the size of my bag. The bag were not even going into overhead bins, it was a small plane so they all had to b checked, she was just being rude. Also when I asked her name she got all defensive and started saying things under her breath to her co workers. When I asked what she said because she was literally directly behind me when she said it, her reply was, I was just telling him I don't mind  giving my name.....ok,why you have to say it under your breath. This ""customer service"" and piss-poor corporate management is why your company is going under.CHECK RECENT REVIEWS FOR AMERICAN AIRLINES, LOWEST RATED AROUND, RUN FAST."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,very unpleasant,I flew out on Delta and my returning flight was on American. Let's just compare.Delta-all middle seats were empty. American-100%  full flight. make sure you social distancing but ignore that stranger's head on your shoulder.American is worried about Covid (hence the full flight)so no food or beverage service. They will hand you a baggie with a tiny bottle of water and bag of pretzels on boarding.Delta handed a bag on boarding and about 2 hours in. Nothing special but was gourmet compared to American.Delta had in screen televisions and working wi-fiAmerican had no screens and spotty wi-fi.Delta let me choose between checking my bags at the counter or kiosk. The American agent forced us to use the kiosk only to wait in that line and then stand in another line to actually weigh the bag. Seems pretty pointless to me. Delta agents were friendly. American agents acted like we were annoying them.This was a business trip and I usually fly other airlines but every now and then I get stuck with this worthless airline. I slew on Allegient a couple weeks ago and they also block the middle seats and offer food for purchase. American just has to step up their game or step aside.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,they literally stole from me,"I always have a terrible experience with American airlines, but I use it because I have to fly in between home and school and it's (not surprisingly) the cheapest option. Amongst everything else though I am actually so in shock about my last trip. When I got my checked bag off the belt thing, it was COMPLETELY unzipped and the pocket i had two brand new perfumes in (expensive ones!) was also unzipped and both perfumes were missing. When I called to complain and hoped to get compensation or my perfumes or anything, they said they don't do anything about missing items. From the time I checked my bag with y'all to when I got it back....someone stole my items, that is clear, and you don't do anything about that?? Basically, if you check a bag everything in there is free game for whoever wants it because they don't do anything about it;) seriously will never fly with them again after this, last straw!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Fly another airline!  Avoid American!,"My trip, due to the death of my mother, began horribly and ended even worse,  A counter agent at departure caused me to almost miss my flight and was horribly rude.  Then the worse was to follow: in addition to the actual ticket cost of $700, I paid well over $500 for seat upgrades.  I changed my flight to avoid LAX due to an upsurge in Covid rates and was refunded a scant $200.  The remainder of my costs were not refunded since I changed my flight voluntarily.  I still do not know why a portion of the costs were refunded and others were not.  DO NOT fly American.  The flight was dismal: no social distancing unless you consider the flight attendants admonishments to stay seated when exiting the plane.  What a dismal and ridiculous way to fly.  NEVER, never buy upgrades for seats.  Just another way to charge more for the cattle cars of American Airlines.  Actually, avoid the airline entirely.  There is a better way to travel."
Date of travel: January 2021,50,I had a very positive experience,"I'm pretty surprised to see so many negative reviews. I flew there and back on AA, each flight having a stopover. So a total of four plane rides and every one of them was a good experience.Obviously I didn't feel like a god flying basic economy, but even at the cheapest seats available I felt respected and comfortable. But the decent legroom, kind staff and free pretzels and Coca-Cola all made long travel times pretty bearable.I also had to change my return flight date, and due to poor phone service where I was staying, I lost connection three times. But you know what? All three agents I spoke to were nice, and when my phone finally pulled through, the last agent made it really easy to change the flight date.I'll definitely fly American Airlines again."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Funeral Again,American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown with. 14 years ago made the same trip they wouldn’t help when dad passed to extend my flight. We had to buy a new ticket. Now this time 14 years to the day my brother passed. Again the most horrible airline ever!  Rude flight attendants rude gate attendants and counter agents!  We love our Alaska airline but we won’t be using Alaska due to the American portion.of the trip. Thank you once again American!  We learned our lesson!  Won’t be seeing you again!  United or Delta will be our choices! To bad I had to select 1. They don’t deserve even that!
Date of travel: January 2021,10,I WOULD GIVE ZERO STARS IF I COULD,Flight from Miami to Boston at the end of January did anyone else test positive for COVID?!? I am ashamed of this airline I will NEVER fly with them again. Absolutely NO social distancing on this flight. Every single seat was taken I am disgusted. Not to mention our flight was delayed YET AGAIN due to the plane being unfit to fly seeing that this is a trend with this airline inconveniencing every single person on this flight. Disgrace. Never again. Flight crew are trash and don’t give a damn. Will never fly this airline again.
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible,"American Airlines seem to love delays. I’m going to make sure to NEVER fly with them again. I’m going to miss my next flight in Dallas due to a delay, some problems with a tire. I now have to get a hotel pay for a taxi to and from the hotel and get another flight for tomorrow morning. This isn’t the first time I’ve had problems with this airline before. During Christmas time I went home and on my way back I was catching a flight from Dallas to Richmond and they had us in the taxi area for HOURS before taking off. Im in the military so you have to check in before midnight at your base/unit. Thanks to American Airlines I didn’t check in until 5 in the morning."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Poor Customer Service,"I changed my flight from Wednesday, February 3rd, 2021 to Monday, February 1st,2021 and was charged $92.50. The flight was canceled and I was then placed on my original flight on February 3rd. I I called  your customer relations at 6:34pm on Monday February 1st, as instructed by the flight crew to reschedule my flight and ask for a refund. The agent really did not have any any good reason why she could not partially refund me my $92.50 and told me that the land crew would need to reissue my ticket. Then the land crew reissued my ticket for my original flight on Wednesday, February 3rd and told me that because a weather advisory- no fly was issued by the airlines, customer relations can now issue me my partial refund. I called customer relations again at 6:44pm on Monday, February 1st and was then told that I would need to go to the AA webpage and request my refund from there. At this point, I am getting very frustrated with your airlines inability to effectively communicate the correct information. So, at 7:05 AM today, Tuesday February 2nd, 2021 I went to the website and received a message that I need to cancel my flight in order to continue with my refund. My flight was canceled and rescheduled! I then called again  at 7:13AM and I was told that I would have to wait until all my flights have been completed before I can request a refund, even just the partial refund. This agent was very informative and I appreciated her ability to service me accurately. I have only been asking for the $92.50 change in flight fee that your agent willing took. Delta Airlines handled their customers with much better care and diligence than American. I should have paid the additional $100 to them instead of messing around with American Airlines that clearly is in this business for $$ and not customer relations or even a decent customer repour. Repeat customers are the bread and butter of any company, especially the airlines during this Pandemic. After typing all of this in my complaint directly to the airline, I received an error message and was asked to download their app. SO FRUSTRATED!!!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,No support for 23 hour delayed flight,"Flew from Miami to NYC today. Departed at 1 pm, arrived to Dallas around 3:20pm. Supposed to have 1 hour layover in Dallas. When arrived to Dallas received an update from AA that my flight is delayed for 23 hours due to weather conditions. Meaning that airline decided to give this update 3 hours before the flight. Interesting fact, like they haven’t seen the weather conditions before. Snowstorm began much earlier and this update could have been made at least in the morning. When I arrived to Dallas help desk at airport had only one answer - all expenses at the cost of client. I lost workday, had to pay for the hotel, cab and food. When I have called customer service heard the same answer, moreover, Kristine offered me an option to fly to Philadelphia instead, so I can get stock a little bit closer to NYC. Unpleasant experience:("
Date of travel: January 2021,50,Flying the way of today!,"During this Covid-19 lockdown time, I wanted to share my experience of flying. The airline check my temperature, and my paperwork for my clearance to travel to Jamaica. Not one employee was rude of hesitant of providing service to everyone boarding the plane. I was seated, but then informed the flight wasn't full, so I could move to a seat if I wanted to. They handed out zip lock bags with water, our inflight snacks, and hand sanitizer wipes, and how convenient was that? perfect for me, because I feel they try to do so much when we are flying."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,They don't care when they inconvenience you,"Although this will probably be a continued waste of my time with American Airlines Customer Service, I find myself doing it anyway.I am really finding hard to understand the complete lack of concern from their ""Help Desk"" folk regarding the extremely inconvenient cancellation and rescheduling of the flights for myself and my family (6 tickets total). We had booked direct flights on 12/28/20 leaving at 7:00 in the evening on 4/1/21, primarily due to the fact that all of us work full time+++ jobs. We then get an email today that not only has the flight now have a 2 hour layover in Chicago, bit it was moved up 3.5 hours. And the icing on the cake was that the two adjoining seats that had been chosen for the direct flight for my wife and myself were changed to 4 seats separated by multiple rows on the new two separate flights. And my wife had the pleasure of being in the aisle directly across from the bathroom. Of course the excuse was that this wasn't personal, it was an algorithm that did it. Sorry, that's crap.So after multiple calls and times on hold this evening, the only solution that was offered was for me to move from the preferred seat that I had paid for with the extra leg room by the window behind the aisle seats unless I wanted to pay the extra $12.50 for the middle seat next to me for my wife. So I paid it with the customer service agent who had the misfortune to have to explain the complete lack of concern from whomever mans that phantom help desk that she referenced (clearly a misnomer). Frankly, they should be ashamed of themselves. I understand that things happen that may be outside of one's control, but to do nothing to fix it? That’s just flat out wrong!Possibly in the future there could be some connotation next to certain flights that it will be in danger of being changed, possibly even an orchestrated ""bait and switch""."

Date of travel: February 2021,10,Rude Flight Attendant,"Wow! It’s getting more and more unpleasant to fly with American Airlines due to their RUDE flight attendants.  Apparently my mask wasn’t fully covering my nose (I assure you it was over my nose, maybe not quite to my eyeballs) so she came over and told me to fully cover my nose. So i did. Later in the flight I was eating my recess pieces candy as I have in other flights and she came back and said “I don’t want to play games with you pretending to be eating the entire flight” I was confused as I actually had candy in my mouth and in my hand when she stopped by.  I looked at her with a confused look to what she continued and said you have to put your mask back on between bites. (Really?!!!)  So, I said ok, and she continued by stating the rules as if I had said or didn’t comply, to which I said “I said OK”.  Then she finally left.  I honestly felt harassed! I totally want to change airlines because this isn’t the first time the flight attendants act like teachers to little kids by down talking and treating us like they are put out that we are in their flight! What ever happened to customer service? Maybe Alaska or Delta haven’t forgotten who the customers are and how to treat them!"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Delays,First flight delayed an hour for no reason. Caused us to cut it close to departure time for final flight and would not allow us to board (plane sat stationed for another 20 minutes) thanks a lot American!
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Never sent voucher!,I called to book a flight. We have vouchers they sent my wife’s info that you have to have from customer service to book flights with ticketing. This process is worse than making an insurance claim. They never sent mine. So I’m told I have to email customer service to get them to resend info they never sent to begin with. I am given an invalid email to send request. Then send via my wife’s email. It’s an auto response with link but it still doesn’t take you directly to customer service. We sent hoping it gets to the right place. We are still waiting have not been sent a response. Meanwhile after reading reviews about covid precautions and another bad experience to years age with flight delays due to maintain issues 10 hours worth showed up to our destination in the middle of the next morning! We have decided they can keep our f**7ing $! We will be driving! I can’t believe the government bailed this S**lhole company out! They are the worst airlines in the world. Take my advice drive if you can leave the greedy ba*****ds the stinking money. They have blood on their hands.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,DON'T TAKE CARE OF CUSTOMERS,"We booked a flight in November to fly our family to Cuba on Jan 15.  We lined up childcare for our toddler. Our parents took time off work to keep him. American Airlines calls 11 days before departure and cancels flight, rebooks us for Jan 31. My parents take the week off work AGAIN to keep our son. AA calls 12 days before departure and cancels flight, rebooks us for Feb 13. Parents take the week off work AGAIN. Twice prior we had been offered a refund instead of a credit should we choose not to rebook. But this trip is important to us, so we remained dedicated to American Airlines and rebooked.Yesterday we found out that Cuba now requires a one week full quarantine. We cannot sustain this because of our kids. So we have no choice but to postpone our trip until regulations loosen. This was no fault of our own. Since we had been offered a refund over a credit with the previous short notice cancelations, we called to request one now that travel regulations had become impossible for us.We were told that the refund was no longer available, only a credit. When we were able to go, we had out flight canceled on short notice again and again. And now we are unable to go when we would have been able to go the previous booked dates. It is only because of out of the blue, short notice cancelations on the part of American Airlines that we are now unable to go, for we would never have been pushed back this far (to the date when new COVID regulations were put in place in Cuba) if we hadn’t had all of those flights canceled and then unable to rebook for a date close to our original departure dates.We asked for a supervisor and explained the situation (everything I wrote above). We were told we still can’t get a refund. We are not choosing to cancel because we just changed our minds. We would go if we could, but it’s not feasible right now because of the new restrictions placed yesterday. And we would not even be in the situation of having to deal with these new regulations if American Airlines hadn’t canceled on us twice, on short notice, back when the regulations were find for us to go. It was because of YOU delaying us that we are here. It is not our fault. It is YOURS. Therefore, YOU SHOULD be the one to do the right thing and return the money for the trips you have not ruined. A credit will not suffice. That is not how we expect to be treated. That is not how we have been treated by other airlines in the past. We travel a lot and give good money to airlines that treat us well. If this is not made right, American Airlines will not be one of them. We book large groups for these trips, and if things are not resolved properly, then American Airlines will not get our business our the business of our large groups ever again. Make it right. Please refund our money in full."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Flight from Dallas to Huntsville 2/1/21,On flight was scolded when I removed mask only to eat food. Was told to put mask back on and when I explained that I was eating flight attendant was VERY rude and said make it quick. I was VERY compliant with all rules the entire flight. Feel like this was over kill and very unprofessional. Wish that I had the name of this flight attendant because she was probably the rudest human I’ve ever come into contact with.
n/a,10,Delays due to airline and they won't hold a gate,"Mechanical problems leaving 10 minute delay, sitting at CLT gate to get off, moving ramp will not work 15 minute delay...  Run to gate phone says E23, then at gate it changes to E12, run to that gate and door just closed... screwed...  Customer service has 50 people in line.... Never again will I fly them.  Attendants are rude and act like nothing is there fault."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Experience consistent with poor reviews,"The day's adventure began at the St. Thomas airport when AA computer systems went down as travelers tried to check-in. After over an hour, they finally decided to check us in manually...despite the fact the majority of passengers were boarded on time, we were delayed an hour, allegedly due to the computer system and extremely slow airport screening procedures. Missed a connecting flight in Charlotte after sprinting to the gate...was told they had to release the plane on time, even though they knew at least 10 or more of us were delayed. All of a sudden, on time departures became important to AA...there's a reason why AA continues to come in last in customer service!"
n/a,10,AVOID AMERICAN AIRLINES AT ALL COST,"First of all they don't even offer drinks or snack...NOT EVEN WATER. Probably the worst flight EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD. THEY PACK YOU LIKE SARDINES AND DO NOT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. They made me check the bag even though it was the proper size. The flight attendant rudely tracked me down to make me track my bad. They only offer you one louzy little hand wipe and I'm pretty sure they DO NOT sanitize their airplane before and after flights. American is cutting cost, packing plans, and increasing the spread of COVID-19."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,They Don’t give a S:1t about you,"Paid full price for first class tickets. Loaded and unloaded three times. Got us half way and threw us to the wolves after a 10 hour delay. Basically told you  good luck, find someplace to stay with your two children and maybe we can accommodate you in the morning.  No directions, no help. I can only hope to find someone who works for AA in my ER at some point in time to pay them back."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Stupid flighy service I. The history of US,"Worst Airline in the world. I am from Texas, my daughter goes to college in East Coast, she’s been flying on American Airlines from Texas quite few times and always the flight delayed some how. So now we thought they cleaned up their act, Today she was traveling from Houston to New Jersey and  her flight got delayed from Houston 1 hour for no reason,  so she missed the scheduled flight from Dallas to New Jersey.  So she got reservation for the 5:00 pm flight and she checked in now they’re saying an hour delayed. Now they’re saying it’s delayed till 6:45 pm don’t think they’re ever fly on time at all. Don’t fly American, they delay the flight for new reason. Stupidest flight ever in the history of the world. Hopefully they get bankrupt and stop this stupid service. THIS IS IT ME AND MY FAMILY EVER FLY AMERICAN AGAIN!!!!!! VOTED WORLD’S NUMBER ONE STUPIDEST AIRLINE."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Worst experence flying EVER,"We get to the airport 2 plus hours in advance. After about an hour of waiting in line we get to the front with only 2 people in front of us. American airline employees then stop movement on the main line and start pulling people out of line behind us. Around 12 to 18 people where pulled out of line and put in front of us because they where all about to miss their flight leaving in 30m. needless to say this causes me to miss my flight. When i started question them on why they did that they told me that I should of been there earlier. I said it doesn't matter how earlier I get there and wait in line if you are just going to pull people out of the line and put them in front of me. TLDR American Airline employees pull people out of line, put them in front of me then act like its my fault that I didn't show up earlier enough. Causing me to miss my flight"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,They treat you like crap,"Flight delayed due to weather causing me to arrive at my connecting flight exactly at departure time. The plane was still at the gate. I was refused boarding and told my seat was given away to a standby customer. Can you believe this? They knew the flight was delayed, they knew when we landed and that we all rushed to get there only to be told basically too bad. Now I’m waiting"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Worst Airline in the world,Please don’t book with this airline! The service is the worst and the employees are absolutely overstrained. If they make any faults they will not admit it at any cost. AmericanAirlines are scammers and the worst airline I’ve ever seen!
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Horrendous Customer Service,"Guess the new communist attitude in America is spreading like wildfire... My boyfriend & I were just kicked off of a flight because the over zealous flight attendant thought we had an attitude with her! No one raised their voice, no one was aggressive or derogatory yet they delayed the flight to have security remove us! Unbelievable, we are sitting in the airport selling off all of our AA stock right now!!!!! DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,First Class MIA to GEO fly with someone else,The plane ride terrible as we were not offered food and when we were they only had crackers and cheese.  The other option was a turkey and cheese sandwich but they only had 2 to offer customers.  I could't believe after paying so much money for my son and I to travel first class we couldn't even get sufficient food and I have a toddler. There was no entertainment the whole flight no TV or radio.  The air steward was also terrible chose to cough without covering his mouth during a pandemic.  This is not the standard to which we are used to nor is that the service we expect when traveling first class and having your platinum card. Extremely disappointing and distasteful.  Two suite cases where also damaged one was completely cracked. There is no AA baggage claim IN GEO and i did not travel back with two broken suite cases.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Shady maintenence scheduling and booking flights that they know will be canceled,American knew 3 days before my flight that the entire bombardier line would be grounded but did not cancel the flights until we were at the gate ready to board. Faa warned american on the 26th and they still took in the revenue by having people book flights they knew were not going to leave. BS at the least..... I and none of my family or friends will ever book with American or a subsidiary ever again. Might go to the FTC for more immediate action..
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Terrible Customer Service & No Social Distancing,"We will not be flying American Eagle again on any of our future travels.  They were rude, unhelpful, and were not willing to help in any way, shape, or form."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Passengers,So I thought American Airlines is strict with COVID but guess not I had four gentlemen in front of me loud and but wearing the mask for 5 hours of the trip none of the flight attendants said anything to them ... won’t be flying with them they don’t take the COVID seriously 😐
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Poor Customer Service and Lost Luggage,"Had a connecting flight with a 4.5 hour layover. Arrived at the final destination, Oaxaca, Mexico, to which none of my checked bags arrived on the plane. Contacted American Airlines the next day to which they said, ""it went to Mexico City, should be at your final destination by noon."" Contacted AA again at noon to which they said, ""you bags have never left Dallas and should be in Oaxaca at 5:00pm."" At 5:00pm, I called AA one final time to confirm that my bags were at the airport, to which they said: ""your bags are in Mexico City."" As you can see, poor communication. I called AA the next morning (day 3 of my vacation) and they said that our bags have arrived safely from Mexico City to Oaxaca. I then spent $50 in taxi fares to retrieve my baggage. When I got home, I noticed that the lock of one suitcase was broken off and the other suitcase had $80 of cash stolen from it. I called American Airlines to report the theft, express my concern of mistreatment of bags, and asked for compensation of taxi fares. While I was refunded a total of $60 for the bags, I emailed customer service representative, Melanie Wots, to ask for a refund of the plane ticket. I was told by Melanie: ""Fill out the form when you get back home"" and told me to enjoy the rest of my vacation.When I got home, I emailed Melanie and expressed difficulty in filing the form for a refund as there was already a baggage refund tied to the ticket. Her response is: In researching your reservation, I did see that your ticket has been completely flown and has no remaining value. While I understand your disappointment in the experience that you had, I must respectfully decline your request for a refund of your flown ticket. It is not our practice to offer a refund on a ticket where transportation was provided and the ticket was fully used."" Overall, I feel violated that my belongings were gone through, money has been stolen from me, my boyfriend's suitcase was smashed into, a small compensation, and poor customer service."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,AA put me and my family at risk,"I am 7 month pregnant. I boarded 6 flights, 4 layovers and TWO mechanical issues... in ONE day. It was originally supposed to be a two hour flight.  We never made it to our destination. They put us on a plane that was PACKED and we are in the middle of a pandemic. My bag also ended up in a city that was not on our itinerary. The flight attendants ran around panicked and worried everyone something was wrong. I got so scared I got off the plane and drove home. Someone who experienced what I did would never have flown. It was scary! But nope! They won’t refund anyone. Money is more important than the safety of their passengers. I wish I would have taken a photo of the flight. There was over 200 people."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Traveler,"Can’t get a hamburger in a restaurant but, AA airlines has you sitting on a co passengers lap.  Overbooked to the point they are offering flight credits if you would be willing to take a different flight.  The little guy had to stay home and collect unemployment while AA airlines is allowed to be a super spreader and risk many people’s lives.  Their brochure talks about their outstanding sanitation protocol but you still find garbage in the cubby from the previous flight.  Never again will I fly.  Also,  flight delayed by 5 hours.  Should not be able to have “Amercian”as part of their company name.  Embarrassing Shame !!!"
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Terrible flight attendants.,I can understand someone having a bad day.  But 5 out of 6 flight attendants were just flat out rude and quite frankly substandard.  I remember when all attendants greeted you with a smile no matter what.  They were trained about presentation and service.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Flight attendance are extremely rude refused to help passenger put the luggage on the cabin,Flight 1930 02/25/2020 - 7:08pm. My seat is 25D. There is one employee refused to help me put the luggage on the cabin. He literally stand there and watch me struggle. My arm sore because i work out the day before. So i was unable to lift thing. This is rediculous. I would never flight with American Airline again. I will file a complaint to American Airline later to night once I find out his full name.
Date of travel: January 2021,20,"Pretty standard flight, until we hit unexpected severe turbulence","American Airlines Flight 2334DFW-PHL4:40 pm-8:48 pm Airbus A321My wife and I recently took this flight home from Dallas/Fort Worth to Philadelphia after connecting from an American Eagle flight from Aspen. For the most part, the flight was standard, with lots of extra space on a mostly-empty older A321. However, some severe turbulence before we arrived in Philadelphia led to a surprisingly scary end to the flight.We had no problem making it from Terminal E to Terminal A at DFW for this flight using the Skylink train. Our connection was slightly over an hour and we had plenty of time to change terminals and stop for a quick lunch before boarding. The far end of Terminal A where this flight boarded (Gate A11) was also spacious between gates, with lots of space to spread out while waiting.The flight started boarding early, but we didn’t rush to board, since I knew it wasn’t going to be a full flight from looking at the seat map. Boarding was very civilized and calm. During boarding, a flight attendant handed out the standard bag that includes hand sanitizer wipes, a small bottle of water, and Biscoff cookies. As we made our way toward the back of the aircraft, it was obvious that some of the other flight attendants were doing the bare minimum, standing in their assigned spots of the aircraft on their phones, not even looking up at all to greet or assist passengers.We had a row of three seats to ourselves with standard legroom in the middle/back of the plane, and there were lots of empty seats and rows around us, so everyone was able to have their own space. The aircraft was one of the older legacy-US Airways A321s that we often have on flights to/from Philadelphia, which have basically no amenities at all (no power outlets, TVs, etc.), but we’re used to them and usually find them to be comfortable enough with ok legroom in economy.We left the gate about 5 minutes early and took off very quickly. Wifi was available on the flight, with some items offered for free, including a variety of movies and tv shows to stream. The flight was totally uneventful for the most part, until the pilot made an announcement as we approached Philadelphia that the seatbelt sign was going to be turned on early for the duration of the flight, due to potential turbulence as we began our descent into PHL. I expected this turbulence to be the typical bumps on any flight, but I was definitely not prepared for how intense it became. Out of nowhere, the sky got extra dark and clouded-over, and the plane started dropping and then lurching pretty violently from side to side. There were several drops that had a distinct roller coaster feel to them, and some of the side-to-side movement was pretty intense just from looking ahead and seeing how tilted the cabin was in front of us. At one point, some sort of red emergency lights came on in the cabin, and we were honestly quite scared and holding on tightly to our seats. We were in this intense turbulence for probably about 10 minutes, but it felt like much longer. I normally don’t get scared or bothered at all when a flight is turbulent, but this felt like nothing I had experienced on a flight in the past. When we finally got out of the turbulence, the pilot came back on and apologized for the scary ride, saying that none of their forecasts had shown any turbulence to that extent at any point on our route. As we continued our descent into PHL, there was still quite a bit of turbulence, which now felt much more like the normal kind, and I think everyone on board was relieved when we touched down safely. I know that we objectively were probably never in any potential harm based on what I know about airplanes, but it was the first time I have ever been on a flight and wondered if we’d make it to the ground ok. I know that it wasn’t just us who felt that way, because I saw one of the flight attendants, who also appeared shaken, make a call to the cockpit once we landed to ask what exactly had just happened.Despite the harrowing end of the flight, we made it to our gate in Philadelphia 30 minutes early, which was great. We landed in Terminal C, but the airport exit in Terminal C was closed at the time, so we had to walk down to Terminal B to get to baggage claim. By the time we got there, which didn’t take particularly long, our bags were already out on the carousel, which was very impressive. This flight from DFW-PHL started out seeming like a very standard one, with plenty of space and a standard bare-bones A321 cabin. However, the unexpected severe turbulence as we approached PHL was quite scary and unlike any flight we had been on before. I could not wait to get off of the plane."
Date of travel: January 2021,30,Very Average Regional Flight,"American Eagle (SkyWest) Flight 3111ASE-DFW12:04 pm-3:23 pm Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ) 700My wife and I recently took this flight on American Eagle from Aspen, Colorado to Dallas on our trip home, before connecting onward to Philadelphia. Just like the flight on the way to Aspen, we found this flight to be uncomfortable on a bare bones old regional jet.We arrived at the airport about 75 minutes before the flight departure time, and there was just a short line to check bags at the American counter at that time. American does not offer self-tagging for checked bags using kiosks in Aspen, so it was necessary to stand in the full-service line and talk to an agent. The agent who assisted us was friendly and helpful, and we were off to security very shortly.  Security at Aspen does have separate dedicated lines for regular screening and pre-check, although I found that the pre-check line moved surprisingly slow, not nearly as efficiently as at larger airports. Once you get through security in Aspen, the gates are literally just a few feet away. This was our first time departing from the tiny Aspen Airport, and I was surprised at how cramped it is. The gates are maybe 10 feet apart from each other, with each one having really minimal seating. I would not recommend getting to the airport too early in Aspen, since there is absolutely no space between gates or anywhere to really go. It didn’t help that large groups of college students who were there at the time appeared to have been dropped off all at once, including some on flights several hours later, further clogging up the terminal with too many people.The flight boarded right on time, which required walking outside to the plane and valet checking our carry-on bags on the tarmac. The flight attendants handed out hand sanitizer wipes as we boarded, but no cookies or water like on longer flights. As we walked back to our seats, I noticed that the other flight attendant wasn’t even bothering to greet or assist passengers, and was simply standing at the back of the plane on her phone.I knew what to expect from the CRJ-700 from our flight a few days prior, but I was still dreading a flight on this aircraft. One of the few things I like about it is the 2x2 seating layout, which allowed us not to have to sit with anyone else on a full flight. However, the plane just felt so old and cramped with very poor legroom.Most of the passengers on our flight were loud college students returning from trips to Aspen. Just as we had noticed on our flight going to Aspen, this demographic was not very good at wearing masks properly, especially in the airport. They did get a bit better once we were on the plane, and most of them seemed to fall asleep once the plane took off.Although the plane was fully boarded well in advance of our departure time, the pilot said that we had to get clearance from Aspen Airport if we wanted to leave early. We ended up leaving the gate in Aspen about 5 minutes early (although it could have been even earlier), but the pilot then said we would have to wait another 15 minutes to take off at our pre-assigned departure time, even though there was no other air traffic in our way. I’m not sure why Aspen seemed so restrictive with regard to departure. We finally took off and were on our way, with gorgeous mountain views in all directions for the first portion of the flight. Wifi was supposed to be available on the flight, but I could not get my phone to connect to it at all. There was otherwise no service or any amenities provided on the uneventful flight. We ended up landing early in Dallas, although we had a pretty long taxi to our arrival gate in Terminal E, which included some delays just waiting for other planes to clear the taxiway in the direction we needed to go. We still ended up arriving at our gate about 10 minutes early. After that, everyone lined up on the jet bridge to get our valet-checked carry-on bags, which took another 10 minutes or so until ours were there. We then had plenty of time to make our connection in Terminal A using the Skylink train.Overall, this flight from Aspen to Dallas was mediocre, which I expected based on the flight we had taken on the same aircraft into Aspen a few days earlier. This was actually better than our previous flight on the same aircraft, but it was still on an uncomfortable regional jet with no space to move and no service or amenities to speak of."
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Unprofessional and dishonest,I flew from Denver to Sacramento with 1 stop in between fine with no problems.  My way back from Sacramento the person checking tickets saw me approaching and immediately started hassling me about my bag and size and asked me to put in on the display to check size. Instantly said your bags are too big I need to pay $30 for each bag to check and was rude about it as well. I informed her I checked the bags at check in and was told I was fine by multiple people and had already flown in with same luggage.  Rudely she stated I got lucky and stuck out her hand out and asked for my credit card to charge multiple people before me had bags bigger than me. I hate to add race but it was obvious she had a problem with me. then after a delay in boarding from Phoenix to Denver I was told my 2 children were moved cause their seats were disabled yet after I sat down there were people in the seats we were originally supposed to be in. Unprofessional and dishonest and they don't even care.  They say especially now more than ever they appreciate us choosing American Airlines but I can't say that they truly do mean that.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,“Go Somewhere Else”,"From start to finish - this is a Trash Airline. I wasn’t greeted- not even checked in by the front desk lady for AA.I was told to “go somewhere else” at the check out and given absolutely disrespectful customer service. I had to go out of my way for them to even help me. I was Overcharged $230 for a bag that was 75lbs, I only know this because baggage customer service representative told me so. My bag didn’t arrive until a day later. When it did- AA’s delivery guy said I should make a claim because of how badly the package was damaged. So I did. I asked to be reimbursed for the trouble and horrendous service. Their app is trash- good luck with the run around they will give you. American Airlines service agents are consistent in that they pass the buck endlessly. Every single person I spoke to- same thing- passed the buck and never sought to fix the problem. I was told by their customer relations agent that - it was my fault my bag was damaged, my fault that my items were broken and damaged. They even blamed TSA.When I gave them all the evidence of what happened, they told me they don’t cover “art work” but will pay for plywood? After - everything I went through with this airline - I am so offended by how much they will NOT help or even try to fix the problem!!! Garbage service and garbage experience with this airline and their “customer relations service”It’s been a nightmare dealing with them! I lost my patience even dealing with trying to make this right - with everything that went wrong. If you’re a part of AAs customer service team and you’re reading this- you are TERRIBLE at your job! I have no issue sharing that with you or anyone I come into conversation with about who to NEVER FLY WITH. My answer will be American Airlines is a Garbage airline and they don’t care about you or your time or your money. AVOID THIS AIRLINE IN EVERYWAY YOU CAN!!!!!!"
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Great customer Service,"Scheduled a flight to Cebu with the family which was later cancelled by the airline due to COVID-19.  When I requested a refund from the travel agent, they said they would refund only a portion.  I emailed American Airlines customer service, and they walked me through the refund process without using the travel agent, and refunded 100% of the tickets.  I was later able to book a flight (directly through AA.com) and arrived safely in Manila (CEB was closed to inbound international flights at the time)"

Date of travel: January 2021,10,Covid -sad !,"Was so happy to fly again for the first time during the pandemic ! The first leg went well, except someone on the plane in the aisle next to us vomitted and the seat mate to her tried to get get up too early, per COVID During the flight prior to landing the staff was strict with reminders in regards to masks etc. My husbands has points b/c of business flights and moved us up to 1st class after the situation - I usually don't have that perk ! I sat in the first row, we took off and the staff in the front buckled herself in - the gentleman next to men ( in the single seat) decided he didn't need his and didn't wear her mask for the entire 1 1/2 hour flight, I watched as the the staff picked up trash and many times walked up and down the aisle. Upon landing, as the staff sat DIRECTLY across from the maskless man again, sadly 1 1/2 later, I did point out the concern of no MASK for 1 1/2 to your staff - NOT much reaction !AA - the fact that my husband wasted points ( money) for us to move up (?) to first class was a waste ! Wondering what you are going to do? I look forward to comparing the cost, your staff that handled the business class was much better ! So many companies are TRYING to survive during this difficult time - your flight staff on this flight was a waste as was the cost of the upgrade - I am a pro business person esp. during this time -you don't get my help !"
Date of travel: November 2020,20,Have to Connect with BA or Iberia,Can't fly AA exclusively to numerous major airports in Europe without connecting to British Air or Iberia. Haven't had a lot of positive experiences with either of those airlines but am forced to fly them if booking through AA! Not happy as Iberia's idea of business class is an economy seat in a front row where they block out the middle seat!! Not comfortable at all!! BA has not allowed seat selection at time of booking through AA even in business class in the past--had to pay for seat selection on the BA site as AA defaults to BA! Not Happy!!
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Baggage claim,"I will never fly AA airlines again and will tell family as well. Simple flight from Tampa to Houston during COVID....1 bag checked just 1. It did not make it to Houston with me because of Dallas baggage handlers. I received my bag the next day. My trip back to Tampa...stop in Dallas 1hr and 30 min layover. My bag did not get on the plane with me...it went to Phoenix AZ and then to Charlotte NC then back to Tampa...it was supposed to be delivered...been sitting in baggage claim since 11am here it is 4pm no bag. Now I go online to check, because you can not talk to anyone, and it tells me to come pick up my bag at 1030pm or it will be delivered by 430am TOMORROW! Really American airlines you need to really stop this madness. Never ever again. I hope I get my bag very soon.Jayne Sweatte"
Date of travel: January 2021,30,Inflight food,"Inflight  foodI hate airplane food.!! So, so much, that I carry my own sandwich, grapes and water- regardless the length of the flight. Granted, am not a frequent flyer, so I have not sampled each and every airline’s gourmet appeal but rumour has it. Such data does exist albeit subjective. Now this is my own experience; North America airlines do miss the mark on this particular aspect of flying experience. I tend to go to America once a year for Christmas - family ties- so I do have some experience- not so good most of the time.The choices is limited- meat dish that has either beef or chicken and pasta for the non meat eaters. Now both these choices come in some sort of sauce or cream, accompanied by a sorry sight of appetisers and a very creamy stuff to act as dessert. Why oh why is the bread roll always frozen?? Surely if you can serve a warm main dish, you can give us a warm bread roll?? Is it not freshly made?? Let’s not go there..further inquiries pending here.Surprise surprise!! I travelled from DFW to London on American, premium economy. The flight was half empty. There’s a pandemic after all. Thank goodness for bailout monies. Without which, we would have to devise another mode of travel. These are hard tines people. So anyway, as usual I ordered my meat dish- beef with rice and vegetables. I had no expectations. Over the years, I have learnt to expect the worst. Lessens the blow.. The appetiser did not surprise me at all. Couldn’t touch it. Up to this day, haven’t yet quite figured who can mess up a starter that much. I don’t know what it was. I shan’t try to do it justice by trying to describe its lack of curb appeal but shame on whomever prepared it😡😡My beef was not only well displayed, but was aromatic. The taste was equally as good- a hint of Chinese sweet and sour sauce: the rice was Jasmin, still warm and abit sticky. The one spoonful of bell peppers and edamame beans, satayed with tomatoes was tasteful. The seasoning was just right. As for the bread rolll, well, old habits die hard😠Well done American. A new year’s resolution? or a sign of better yet to come? Whichever it is,"
n/a,40,comfy flight and fast hotline response ,"American airlines have budget friendly international flights and I love how they partnered with Japan Airlines!! The food in economy was average, staff are somewhat okay. And also, they have the most accessible customer service hotline. They are easy to reach or contact if you have changes regarding with your travels."
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Terrible ,"We just returned from vacation and we are amazed at how terrible the stewardess’s, service, support, website and communication are with AA. We upgraded our seats on the first leg of our journey only to find they had changed the plane therefore our seating upgrade wouldn’t be honored. I asked the stewardess about our upgrade and she told us of the change in planes and it was our problem to deal with and walked away. Then on our return trip our flight was delayed, thus causing us to miss our connecting flight. AA did give us food vouchers (fast food only) and put us up in a hotel. However, we had to stand in the cold for 1 1/2 hours waiting for the shuttle service ride to the hotel then a 20 minute wait to register. We finally made it to our room after 11:00pm that night. We found the entire ordeal with AA Terrible at best and will not use AA again.... Their website isn’t user friendly at all and the main thing you get from it is a revolving sales pitch for, credit cards, wine, buying miles, upgrading to first class, etc...STAY AWAY from AA !!!"
Date of travel: January 2021,50,Kiran - the AA desk worker that saved my trip!,"The only reason I am leaving a 5 star review is for the AA desk worker named Kiran. When my passport was left on my layover flight in Miami, and I needed it for my following flight in 13 hours, she was the only worker that listened to me. Not only did she help track it down, but helped me through the process for the 6 hours I was waiting in the airport since 4am. I was very stressed and scared, and Kiran was the ONLY one who would hear my struggle and help me out. She went up and beyond to make sure I got back my passport and ensured that I was able to get to my flight with no other issues. She is a 5 star worker for this company."
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Uncomfortable American Eagle Flight,"American Eagle (SkyWest) Flight 3044DFW-ASE10:50 am-12:26 pm Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ) 700My wife and I recently took a flight on American Eagle from Dallas to Aspen, Colorado, after connecting from Philadelphia. We both found this flight to be very uncomfortable on an old plane, which was not helped by the fact that it was completely full. The flight boarded right on time, and flight attendants handed out hand sanitizer wipes as we boarded, but no cookies or water like on longer flights. Since we were on a smaller regional jet, we had to valet check our carry-ons at the gate, to be delivered to us as we disembarked in Aspen.I don’t think anyone is a fan of cramped regional jets, and this one felt particularly grim. At least we didn’t have to sit with anyone else, since it’s a 2x2 seating layout, but our row was toward the very back of the plane and felt really cramped, partially because that row was missing a window, and partially because the legroom and seat width are very tight on this aircraft. The plane just felt old, dirty, and small, and I was not excited to spend 2.5 hours on it, which is somewhat long for a regional flight.The clientele on the flight was mostly all vacationers like ourselves, and was heavy on groups of loud, obnoxious college students who were taking ski trips. I don’t mind the excitement, but I did mind that these groups were very lax about wearing masks properly, especially as we first boarded the flight. I did appreciate that one of the flight attendants confronted a passenger in the row in front of us who wasn’t wearing his mask properly, and offered him a new mask if he wasn’t able to get his current one to fit over his nose and mouth.We left the gate in Dallas right on time, but quickly got delayed before take off, since it had just started snowing (really just minimal flurries), which caused the airport to require us to get de-iced before takeoff. We were one of the very first planes to get to the de-icing pad that morning, so we didn’t have to wait to begin the process, but it still took almost half an hour to complete. After that, we took off immediately and were on our way. We ended up still making it to Aspen about 5 minutes early, despite the extra time on the ground at DFW.Wifi was supposed to be available on the flight, but I could not get my phone to connect to it at all. There was otherwise no service or any amenities provided on the flight at all. It was very bare bones.When we landed, the flight attendants instructed everyone to stay in their seats after the seatbelt sign was turned off so that passengers could de-plane row-by-row and not clog the aisles. Everyone did actually follow this, so I was glad we had a civilized process of disembarking the aircraft. By the time we disembarked, which is directly onto the tarmac at the very small Aspen Airport, our carry-ons that had been valet checked were already on a cart waiting for us.Additional frustration came after that, when we went inside to baggage claim to collect our checked bags. While we were waiting for bags to start coming out, I happened to check the luggage tracking feature on the AA app, and noticed that it said our bags had not been loaded onto our flight in Dallas. It turned out that our bags didn’t make it from our first flight to this one, which was surprising, since they had been priority tagged in Philadelphia that morning. We had also arrived in Dallas early on our first flight, giving plenty of time for the bags to be transferred. It turned out that our bags were loaded onto the next flight to Aspen, which was about two hours behind us. I’m not sure what the reason for the delay was, but it was annoying not to have our luggage make it to Aspen with us.We stopped at the AA baggage counter once we realized our luggage was missing, and the employee there was very nice. He apologized for our bags not making it, and said that is a relatively common occurrence for flights into Aspen. He immediately filed a delayed baggage claim and said that the airline could have the bags sent directly to our hotel. However, once we said where we’re staying, he said that our hotel usually comes to pick-up delayed bags for guests more quickly than the airline would deliver them, and he said he would call the hotel on our behalf and let them know. The bags did ultimately make it about two hours late on the next flight, and our hotel picked them up for us, so we had them by that evening.Overall, this flight from Dallas to Aspen was not the best, on a really tight, uncomfortable regional jet, and it added extra frustration that our luggage didn’t get loaded onto the plane with us. It was also the fullest flight we’ve been on since the start of the pandemic, and we didn’t love being in such crowded quarters, especially since many of the younger passengers around us were not taking the Covid precautions seriously."
Date of travel: January 2021,50,Good AA flight between hubs,"American Airlines Flight 872PHL-DFW6:45-9:42 am Airbus A321SMy wife and I recently took this morning flight from Philadelphia to Dallas/Fort Worth before connecting onto an American Eagle flight to Aspen. This was actually a very good flight that felt a bit more normal than some other flights we’ve taken during the pandemic, at least based on the service in first class. We were originally booked in economy for all legs of this trip, but when checking in for the flight online the day before, we were offered a paid upgrade to first class for the Philadelphia to Dallas leg for $95 per person. I thought this was a little pricey, but I was eager to have extra space and a guaranteed private row for the two of us, so I decided to pay for the upgrade. We arrived at PHL about an hour before the scheduled 6:45 am departure and had no wait or difficulty when checking our bags using the self-tagging kiosks in the Terminal B/C priority check-in area. The Terminal C security checkpoint, which was previously for pre-check only and is usually our preferred option, had been closed for other flights we’ve taken during the pandemic. This time, I saw that the Terminal C checkpoint was open again and figured we’d use it, even though our flight was from Terminal B. However, it unfortunately appears that they have opened this checkpoint to everyone and it’s no longer for pre-check only. They had lines for both regular screening and pre-check at Terminal C, which slightly slowed things down as compared to past trips. Regardless, we were still through security quickly and off to the gate for boarding.The flight must have started boarding early, since we arrived at the gate right on time for the scheduled boarding and had missed Group 1–they were already boarding Group 4. During boarding, the flight attendants handed out the now standard bags that include hand sanitizer wipes, a small bottle of water, and Biscoff cookies.  We settled into our seats and appreciated that this is one of the better A321s, which includes power outlets at each seat and individual seatback TVs. This is unlike the legacy-US Airways A321s we usually have on flights from Philadelphia, which have basically no amenities at all.We left the gate 10 minutes early and took off very quickly. Shortly after we were in the air, the first class flight attendant came around and took our drink orders. I was pleasantly surprised that drinks were offered, since I know most service has been cut or severely limited during the pandemic on AA flights. The flight attendant was very nice and addressed everyone by name while taking orders, before coming back shortly with the mimosas we had requested. After that, he came back and offered everyone in first class a choice of two pre-packaged Zoe’s Kitchen meals, either a turkey and swiss breakfast sandwich or strawberry yogurt with blueberries and granola. We had one of each and were happy with the food. It was basic but good enough, and we were just glad that food of any type was offered. Since the flight was over three hours, I think a second round of drinks would have been nice, but this was not offered. However, I do think if we had asked the flight attendant for another drink, he would have been happy to get it.Wifi was available on the flight, with several items offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream, along with lots of entertainment and a flight map with flight connection information on the seatback TVs.The flight attendants did make several of the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and I didn’t see any non-compliance from passengers.  We made it to our gate in Dallas about 15 minutes early, giving plenty of time to take the Skylink train from Terminal C to Terminal E for our next flight.Overall, this flight from PHL-DFW was very nice, with good service from American. The plane was clean with comfortable, large seats and good service in first class, so we were very satisfied with the experience."

Date of travel: January 2021,10,Incorrect flight departure time on ticket and at the airport ,"So I had a flight with departure time of 2:45pm. My boarding pass along with the information on the tv screen in the airport shows departure time at 2:45pm. I arrived at the gate at 2:20 and was told that “my flight isn’t ready yet”. Only to check the tv screen at the gate that showed “Boarding Complete” flight closed. No one was there to assist me, not even the other reps at the other gates. A representative finally came outside and I tried explaining to her what happened, but she made it seem like I was late. She offered a new boarding pass to the next flight and insisted that I was late. Thank God the supervisor came to the front and saw what was going on, did some investigation which showed that the departure time changed in their system but was changed on the screens at the airport and I wasn’t even alerted of this change, the passenger who really needs this info. She apologized as she realized that it was a system issue/error and has been happening. It’s ridiculous because they expect passengers to follow the time given, but you follow the info given which is completely different. It’s so upsetting"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Nice staff horrible experience,"I stopped flying American Airlines years ago because for whatever reason there is always a delay flying into Philly.  However my mom bought these tickets, breaking my number one rule never fly American Airlines.  But, alas I decided to give them another shot.  We arrived at the airport on time.  For whatever reason they had cancelled my step sons ticket.  We had to wait to get this fixed to go through security.  Security was extra nice went above and beyond to try and get us through.  They even called up to the gate to let them know we were coming and were traveling with a baby.   We got to the gate 15 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off.  When we arrived they said the doors were closed and we would have to placed on standby, with 4 kids, one being a baby.  The next flight was at noon and the last flight out.  We booked another flight for 5pm with Spirit so hopefully that will work out.  Paying double for a trip we shouldn't have missed.  Overall the staff is friendly but the company is awful.  What do I recommend as the take away?  Don't fly with American Airlines and do your best to never fly with children, especially babies."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Never had issues with Southwest,"Me along with my daughter and grandson flew to Kentucky for my mothers funeral this month. As we went to check out on the 12th we dropped our rental car off and went upstairs at 4:42p to check in for our flight that leaves at 5:22 pm the attendant at the counter says we are two munutes past the checkin time and that there was nothing she could do. i asked her how is it two minutes when we have to be checked in 30 minutes prior t o leaving. during all of this the attendant hasnt pulled up anything on her computer. A few minutes pass and now its 4:54 and the attendant tells us that she can rebook our flight for the next day or we can try the kiosk and see if it will check us in due to no more flights going out. As i regain my composure i ask the attendant it is due to her not wanting to look in the system to check us in or is it due to new covid rules, she say it is new covid rules. At 5:01 she now asks for an ID to pull up information and get us rebooked. When we get back to the house my daughter calls AA because our tickets dont have a gate nor a seat number. The agent on the other end states we are put on standby for the flight leaving in the morning for a full flight but we can confirm our seats for that flight for an addition additional fee. After my daughter said a few ""nice"" words on the phone she booked us for the 3pm flight and still got an additional charge. The next day we go to check-in none of our information is in the system so the attendant had to get help in getting us checked in. We sat there for 36 minutes. then for her to tell us we had too many bags in which she was counting my bible case as well. So we eventually get checked in and make it to the gate and get a message on the speaker that our flight is delayed. We were supposed to leave at 3:18 wand didnt leave til 4pm after they made people rebook flights. And when we were rebooked they had us spread on the plane. How is a 4 year old going to be on a row three rows away from his mom and seven rows away from me.  most horrible experience ever. never again."

Date of travel: January 2021,10,Terrible experience-sticking to Southwest,"I almost always fly Southwest, and this is why I will continue to do so. I had a flight from Miami to Providenciales that was delayed an hour. Stuck sitting in the plane while they checked out a maintenance issue. After an hour, they took us off the plane and we had to wait for another plane to arrive. All in all, over two-hour delay. On the return trip, the pilot got us back to Miami 30 minutes early, but they could not find a gate for us. So again. Stuck on the tarmac for over an hour! During the flight, there was about a five-minute window in which the seatbelt sign was off, so not enough time to use the restroom. When passengers are wearing a mask, not allowed to use the bathroom for an extended period of time, given no water or snacks, do your best to get them to their destination on time and get them off the plane when they land. It’s ridiculous. Never again will I fly this airline, unless I have no other choice. It’s stressful enough flying during a pandemic. If you want your airline to survive, do better!"

Totally worth the annual fee if you use them enough!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Airline is just overall terrible,American Airlines just doesnt care about customer satisfaction. I need to go home and my flight is delayed a whole day. It was only supposed to be delayed a couple hours when i called due to “maintenance” but the real reason is that they didnt have enough people on the flight. If you dont have enough people on the flight why lie and create a flight that you are just going to cancel on us completely. Now i am wasting money on hotels i did not want due to carelessness.

Date of travel: January 2021,20,You don't get what you pay for,"Alright. So I shell out $880 for first class tickets MONTHS ahead of time, right? I choose seats where I can sit by myself since we're in the midst of a pandemic, right? I obviously can't bring a portable battery on the plane with me, right? So get this...SEVEN DAYS before my flight, AA calls me and tells me my schedule has been completely flipped around. Instead of landing at 4:30pm, my flight now lands me in Oregon at 10:50pm. So basically they took an entire day off my ""vacation"". Not just that, but this new schedule makes me wait at the Phoenix airport for SEVEN HOURS.TWICE.None of this was even slightly close to my original schedule. But I figure hey, things can't be helped, it's a pandemic, whatever. Well, I hop on my first flight, and immediately realize that I am not only not in first class anymore, they also moved my seat so I was seated next to someone else, when I could look a foot to my left and see the EMPTY SEAT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MINE. How the heck did they let that happen?!The next flight was better, I was actually seated by myself, and although the flight was still pretty cramped, it was perfectly serviceable. So I get comfortable for my six hour flight, grab my phone and charger, and... Oh, there's no outlets of any kind... Granted, this one is prolly on me for not triple checking that this was the case, but like... I paid $880 to be on a flight where I had to conserve my phone battery for six hours because I couldn't charge it, and all the ports at the airport were taken.I just... Look, I know you'll think I'm a spoiled entitled first class brat complaining about inane things, but this was the first time in my life I wanted to treat myself to something special, and I feel like I got crapped on for it. I won't be flying first class again, at least certainly not with American Airlines. Not. Worth. It."

Date of travel: January 2021,10,American Airlines doesn’t care,"The flight from Key West to DFW was late. They blamed it on air traffic control. They didn’t make up time in the air. We ran from D31 to B29 to find American had closed the flight and cancelled the next flight so we were stuck an extra 4+ hours. The agent was still in the jetway, but the sign said “flight closed.” 2 other passengers came running up. American doesn’t care! No apology, no explanation, no compensation for lost time, no extra points, no flight voucher, not even a food voucher. Just, “here, you’re rebooked 4.5 hours later.”Something ALWAYS goes wrong when we fly American; that doesn’t usually happen with other airlines and when it does, they are nice about it and try to make it up to us. Wish I could sell all my AA miles."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,I will not fly AA again.,Customer service SUCKS.  When we approached customer service area at Miami Airport we were directed to a different desk 3 times. Finally one kind employee started to actually assist us. His female coworker rudely interrupted to tell us to firmly cover all of our noses with mask. Clearly a power play.They all insisted they had NO ability to help us. KUDOS to Victor who defied the complacency and actually went above and beyond to assist us!
Date of travel: November 2020,20,No Covid Social Distancing,"I have always been a huge fan of American Airlines until recently.  I flew in November and was very disappointed in the lack of policies regarding social distancing on the American Airlines planes.  Every seat was taken, including the middle seats.  Customers continued to bounce up and hover in the aisles to get off the planes.  Everything the CDC recommended was ignored.  Since then I have flown Delta Airlines with the staff  very proactive in social distancing the the middle seats are not utilized.  So sad, American was part of my life for 60 + years"
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Bottom line over everything else,"From ill informed policies on N95 masks to fully booked flights, it's clear that the staff only cares about their safety, and the airline only cares about the bottom line.  In the end, it's on the passengers to limit travel during this pandemic, but if you find yourself in a situation where air travel is necessary, look into all other options first before American Airlines."
Date of travel: January 2021,50,💯,"My family and I have always appreciated your airline! The safety protocols that your company has implemented are very good!! Thank you so much! I’m extremely confident that your company will continue to set a very good example. My family all tested negative for the COVID-19  virus after our return from holiday. The last negative result came in today. It’s my opinion that airlines,restaurants,everything really can be operated responsibly. To paraphraseThe Beatles “we COULD work it out” we should all try! Thank you again American! We had an excellent holiday due in part to everyone at American Airlines!I would be remiss if I didn’t mention food service folks. They have been protecting us from illness for a very long time! Food safety isn’t new for them. They will continue to learn and innovate and enhance all of our lives...if we let them do their thing."
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Only Frontier is worse; American drops below even Spirit,"We've traveled a lot in the last six months on American because we had miles from our credit card.  After our last trip, we canceled the card and hopefully won't be flying American again.Why do they have to be nasty about their requirements?  While Delta asks, ""For the comfort of those around you, please wear a facemask,"" American says something like, ""You WILL be denied boarding in the future if you won't comply,"" and ""We WILL be checking throughout the flight to see if you're wearing your mask.""  WTH happened to customer service?  And why wake someone up because the mask is only over their mouth?  Especially since you're crammed in like sardines anyway.  That piece of underwear isn't going to do much.  Feels like they should be wearing Brown Shirts.  I can't imagine that many of them are happy to be policing rather than serving.For ""food service"" on the longer flights, you get a single Biscotti cookie (gross) and a half-bottle of water.  For our shorter ones, there was NO service at all.  Why do you need three flight attendants when you're not doing anything for passengers except patrolling for ""non-compliance""?My opinions: Some of the check-in people in DCA are 4-letter words.  At-ti-TUDE.  The SEA ground crew is either incompetent or suffering from a residual high.  The flight attendants are misnamed because they certainly don't provide any service attending to passengers.  The two points are for the crew and desk out of Charlotte, NC (that wonderful Southern hospitality) and the pilots, who have been consistently wonderful, experienced, and communicative."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,They don't know the meaning of 1st class.,They don't Know the meaning of first class.  This was a lazy crew.   This is a 4.5 hour flight. The 2 attendants were to busy looking at their phones.  They never  asked if we needed anything.  They started the trip by handing out drinks.  They acted like they were sorry we bothered them.  And when they served a snack they said that they ran out of food before they could get to everybody.  They didn't pick up the trash until landing.  We sat there with empty cups and wrappers and no where to put them for the 4.5 hour flight.  They sat in their jump seats for the rest of the flight.   Our return flight was with a good crew and was the fine service we expected and paid for.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Horrible Covid19 proceedures,The flight didn't notify us that it was fully booking and we were forced to be seated with people like it was a cattle car!The guy next to us was coughing and sneezing and zero preventative measures were made to ensure he wasnt sick!!The airline was supposed to notify passengers if the flight gets booked so we could change our flight and that did not happen!When we kindly asked the stewardess if we could change seats because some of the forward seats were empty she ignored us.When other passengers started to comme t she left the cabin area and ignored all of us!!Absolutely will never fly this horrible airline again!If I get Covid because of your negligence you will be hearing from an attorney!
n/a,10,Horrible service,"I booked a flight for my wife and I to meet our cruise ship in late January 2021.  I bought the tickets on may 21st 2020. I found out our cruise was canceled due to covid 19 on November 18th 2020 and immediately canceled our flight.  I rescheduled a new cruise the same week in January 2022. Contacted american airlines to reschedule the flight figuring there would not be a problem due to the cancellation being out of our control. Come to find out american airlines is only honoring rebookings until December 31st 2021. Customer service was rude and pretty much told me to bad. Other airlines are honoring rebookings up to 2023. I would not recommend this airline during these times, they take covid money from the government and then rob its customers of thier money for covid related circumstances."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,if i could give them negative 5 i would.,"Due to their machine and stuff errors I missed my flight and had to overpay 500$, which the company does not care about and does not try to fix their mistakes, just a rip-off, thank you, will never travel with this company ever again"
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Sick of old HP/US A321 with no power,Every time I get on an Airbus CLT or PHL PHX it is this tatty A321 with no power. As there is no AV you need power for your devices. These nasty Turkey sandwiches with a cookie are nothing short of disgusting for dinner. Getting the cookie is better than getting nothing at all as we did in July. Why should I continue to purchase F/J when the service and equipment are better on WN in Y?
Date of travel: December 2020,20,International Flight - Mediocre at Best,"I hadn't travelled on AA for a while and was hoping for a better experience.  Sadly to say, things haven't changed much. Planes were packed, even with Covid 19 still going strong. My bag didn't make the connection and I received it over a day later. I saw at least 25 others on the same flight who also didn't get their bags. Given the reduced flights now you would think that bag handling would have improved, but it hasn't. My wife had a different flight to Bogota about a week before me and she also didn't get her bag and she had to wait over a day to receive it. If I had other options to South America I would use them. Spirit is the other option to these cities and I don't need to say anything more about that carrier."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,COVID-19 they don't care nightmare,"Was scheduled for a Cruise the end of January. Cruise was canceled. Was told I had till December 31, 2021 or lose you money. Even with their trip insurance you get nothing. All I was asking for is for them to extend it for Dec. 2021 to January 2022. A whole 30 days but they won't do it.   We're unable to take a trip in the fall. So we are out the price of our tickets. At least the cruise company is working with us. Now I see why they say don't fly American Airlines!"

Date of travel: December 2020,10,COVID negative nightmare,"On February 3, 2020, I booked a trip through Expedia to Oahu, Hawaii for Christmas vacation. In March, COVID happens and everything shuts down.  I don’t cancel the trip because it was my understanding travel would be allowed contingent on being able to produce medically certified negative COVID test. My husband and I responsibly cautious and use N95 masks and face shields for traveling. Along with hand sanitizer and wipes.  A few weeks prior to departure, I decided to surprise my husband and called American Airline and upgraded our seats to first-class for the trip.  At no time prior or at this point, were we informed of Hawaii’s strict COVID testing regulations. Not informing us of this critical information effectively undermine the entire trip and we were unable to vacation. The strict conditions Hawaii requires for testing should have been communicated to us, your customers, as soon as these requirements took effect.  It is reasonable to expect this would have been communicated by Expedia or  airline, as the omission of it effects the whole travel experience, if just for the sake of good customer service. Our experience was so utterly disappointing, and could have been avoided. I felt compelled to write this letter and describe, our experience and request you provide a way to rectify the situation and make us whole. My husband, Michael and myself left Baltimore-Washington International Airport on AA that left Friday morning at 6 am on December 18, 2020.  The AA attendant at the First-Class desk verified our negative COVID test results and we boarded the plane.  We connected through Chicago’s O’Hare on.  We landed in Honolulu, HI shortly after 3pm Hawaii time and we were herded through the airport to a screening location where we were asked for our COVID test results.  I handed it to the attendant who immediately stated “That is not from a Trusted Partner” and returned the documents to us.  He never looked at the negative results or that the company was a nationwide, reputable company.  He then told us that we had to quarantine at our hotel for the length of 10 days.  I stated that our vacation was only 9 days and that our test results were negative and the company is reputable.  His response was, “Well you could go home!”  This caused me to burst into tears and made my husband very angry.  We asked if we could test in Hawaii the answer was NO.  The attendant called the hotel and informed them that we were under quarantine and if we leave our rooms we are to be reported.  He asked for our cell numbers and then called them to verify we didn’t lie.  My husband asked how are we supposed to get to the hotel since you refuse to let us obtain a car rental.  He responded, taxi or Uber.  That is safe how? My husband and I decided to return home, we never left the airport.  We called American Airlines, explained what happened and requested a flight out for that day.  Our flight didn’t leave until 10:50pm and everything at the airport was closed.  We had nothing to eat or drink from the time we landed.  When we boarded for our flight, I discovered we would not be served a meal because they expected that we would go straight to sleep.  I cried myself to sleep from frustration, hunger and exhaustion.   I called several weeks prior to the trip to upgrade us to First class going and returning.  Sadly, we did not have the accommodation I had paid.  The connecting flight from Los Angeles to Miami was Business Economy (AA 369) and from Miami to Baltimore (AA 696) was Economy.  We even had to pay an extra $314.80 to leave on December 18, 2020.  We spent more than 40 hours either in the air or in an airport and we never got to have our vacation.  We arrived home Sunday morning almost 2 am. My husband and I saved up for this trip and we are now out $4,300 in airfare.  We can’t afford to schedule another trip because that money is gone.  I don’t understand why we did not receive an email from American Airlines explaining the strict regulations Hawaii has in place.  You must know them your pilots and flight attendants travel there daily.  I also called AA directly to upgrade to First-class and again nothing was mentioned.  I signed up for your American Aviator card thinking I would receive special benefits.  So far, speaking to your customer service staff everybody is very sorry but nobody wants to do anything to help us recoup this $4300 loss. Our Christmas was ruined!  All my Christmas surprises for my husband are shattered.  Expedia states this is an American Airline issue and American Airline states that since we went through a third party the max we can get is $250 in vouchers"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Terrible,"Horrible horrible customer service. Flight was directed to Des Moines instead of CID due to fog . After landing in Des Moines, we are given two option 1) Stay in the same flight and go back to Dallas 2) Get off the plane and find own way to reach to CID.I talked with two air hostess to find out if I go back to Dalls, is there any availbality in next flight from DFW to CID. No one answered anything. No one even bothered to find out.Aftyer 15-20 min, one crew member came in and shouted that if you want to get off the plane, get off now otherwise the door is closing. I asked them again that I am willing to go back to DFW if you give me information on next available flight to come back to CID. One airhostess told me to go to front desk (where boarding starts usually) and talk to AA agent. I went there and talked to her, she said you already got off the plane, so only option is to find your own transportation to CID. She had no mercy in her words and spoke with attitude. No sorry no apologies from her side.I had to get rented car in order to reach CID. Car cost me about 200$ as it was same day booking and lack of other options."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,No Compassion for Covid-19,"First, let me start this off by saying, in the past, I typically did choose American Airlines whenever possible, now, moving on, I will NOT be choosing AA.  I ordered tickets for a wedding that was to occur on January 2nd, and my flight was supposed to be December 26th.  On December 21st, I woke up with chills and couldn't taste my food all that well.  I decided to get a rapid covid-19 test and it came back positive.  That being said, I've heard of people still travelling and getting sued, and the CDC, as well as the Department of Transportation tells us NOT to travel with Covid-19.  The very same day I received my results, I cancelled my flight, giving AA 5 days to rebook the flight if necessary.  I then requested a refund through the website, and provided proof of my positive result.  Although it was the cheaper ticket, which is apparently non-refundable, refunds are available (supposedly) due to medical reasons.  I received notice that the refund was not going to be unavailable.  I called, to which I ended up talking to someone in reservations.  They advised me they could not help me and told me to contact customer service through the website or through 'snail mail', as she referred to it as, I let her know I wanted to actually TALK to someone, not go back and forth through e-mails, or wait on the post.  She told me that simply wasn't possible.  I asked for a copy of the recording, which she told me, I was unable to receive... even though I'm a part of that conversation and was not told I was being recorded, I just assumed it. So anyways, I got Covid-19, suffered through my symptoms which got much worse, missed my cousin's once-in-a-lifetime, small and intimate wedding (if she ever got divorced, there would be no other), missed new years with my family up North, didn't get to see my Grandmother for her birthday and now, even though I'm financially damaged from Covid-19, American Airlines chooses to add to the insult and the damages to me, by withholding money from me, close to 400$, that they technically haven't earned and technically haven't provided a service for me.  They are causing me more undue stress and lost sleep because of the worry of what to do now, and just feels so unfair.  This is very greedy of a company to do, considering I gave notice ASAP, and their guidelines wouldn't have allowed me to fly with them Covid-positive anyways.  Take this as you will, but be wary -- and make sure to give into the greed of spending extra money on 'refundable' ticket should you choose to fly American Airlines, because their greed knows no sympathy, and no exception and should something far out of your control occur... you'll just be S-O-L."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,No customer service,2 months after making our flight reservations American Airlines unilaterally changed both our flight to Maui as well as our flight home. They changed our departure so that we had to leave 5 hours earlier. I am a surgeon so I had to reschedule numerous surgeries because of the departure change. That was bad enough but they also changed my return flight so that my family of 6 have to leave the day earlier than planned. Therefore we paid for our condo for a night we will not use as well as our rental car. Then we have to spend an 8 hour layover at LAX after a red eye flight from Maui. Their customer disservice department solution to all this is to  patronizes us with a $50 voucher to use with their airline by the end of the year. Really? As if I would ever fly with them again and risk them doing the same thing again. WORST FLYING EXPERIENCE in my 40 years of flying.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Horrible,"We were scheduled to fly from Dallas to Kansas City at 2:55 pm on January the 10th. Our flight was cancelled at 9:21 am while we were on another flight due to ‘weather’. It was raining, so we were rescheduled for the 11th at 4:45am. No offer of a hotel or anything. We decided to wait at the airport because there was a chance to get on a flight at 8:40pm. While waiting, our takeoff time came and planes were taking off left and right. It was raining a little, but obviously planes could still take off. In my opinion it was terrible to not offer a hotel, food, something to compensate for the flight. And for other flights to be taking off when ours was supposed to was not okay. Needless to say it was a very stressful, frustrating day. We will not be flying American Airlines again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Regional Roundrip with quick service!,"I flew roundtrip from Boston to Syracuse and both the timing and the ease of each flight was great! I'm able to breeze through Logan in the evening, then through Syracuse in the morning, going door to door in only a couple of hours! Though the legroom is lacking, it was no problem for the quick flights."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Worst major American airline,Always disappointing. Was forced to fly and to my borrow the flight was completely full. Borderline negligent behavior by the airline.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Frequent cancellations and delays,"American Airlines has been a disappointment from the get-go. They frequently cancel or delay my flights. I keep flying with them because I made the mistake of signing up for their credit card. Well, even that has been a debacle. They gave me a second AAdvantage number that’s not actually linked to my account. So whenever I check in to my flight, it tries charging me for bags so I have to bag check at the counter. And it’s not applying any of my miles to my account so I really just have a rewardless credit card. They are cheaper to fly, but you’d better account for a few extra days on both ends of your trip because you probably won’t get there or leave when you plan to (due to cancellations or delays). The staff is overall unpleasant too. Most attendants have been obnoxious, rude, or simply apathetic. I’ve experienced few attendants who have been pleasant.The last cancellation came the morning of through text. An agent didn’t even call me to schedule a different flight. I had to do it myself. I’ve attached a screenshot of the most recent text notifications. One of my incoming flights was delayed which caused my bags to be directed elsewhere as they did not make it on the connecting flight. Then the morning of, they canceled my return flight. This is a normal occurrence so I’m going to cancel my credit card and fly with delta from now on."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Don't fly with American,Me and my son were supposed to fly from Detroit Michigan to Tulsa Oklahoma on January 2nd. Our first plane was delayed because they over fueled the aircraft which made us arrive in Chicago after our layover had already left. After spending 4 hours in the airport working with American Airlines they were unable to get us on another flight within the next two days. The individual at the ticket counter told us that since this was the fault of American Airlines that if we were to rent a car and drive they would reimburse us for the rental car and hotel and our ticket cost. So to clarify after buying my tickets and spending that money I had to come out of pocket all these additional expenses and now drive because that was the only option they had for us. So we did exactly as American Airlines said and rented the car and drove. After I filed for a reimbursement totaling $742.76 for all the expenses they agreed to refund they now backed out and are unwilling to refund us anything  but offered us a $125 flight voucher and apologized for our inconvenience. They directly lied to us and tricked us. Don't fall for it.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Damaged stroller,"They took/check in my baby stroller when not supposed, I got it back damaged and the AA did nothing about. I contacted about my problem and they found millones of reasons not to help me."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Mr,No social distancing on the plane. The plan was loaded from front to back which took very long. Will only fly delta from now on.
Date of travel: January 2021,30,It was nice,Enjoyed my flight to New Orleans slept like a baby!! Would recommend to anyone. If you scared of heights don’t sit by the window.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Paid for First Class for No Service.,"Airline is terrible. Ground staff is rude, they don't care about your experience as long as that payment goes through. Flew first class paid for a fairly expensive vacation package only for many of their advertised features and expectations to not be true.  Both legs of my flight was delayed due to mechanical issues and once due to a ground crew getting locked onto our fight in error.  They don't value being on time and can care less for your comfort.   Prepaid for a rental car that was oversold and not available upon arrival.  Over promised on my hotel amenities via their own website; over promised on my first class amenities also via their website. Customer Relations is very prepared for your complaints and won't hear you out.  They will do only refunds required legally and we felt cheated out of thousands of dollars.  Don't fly them ever.  Maybe they need to cease operations because they apparently don't care to make their customers happy."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Worst customer service in the business,"I never write bad reviews and I give every business the benefit of the doubt or opportunity to correct any circumstance. However, I have given American Airlines multiple chances with no resolution. I am so disappointed in their lack of customer service and overall empathy especially right now. They have refused to allow flight credit to be used even after multiple agents clarifying it would able to be used and how easy the process would be to use it. However when it came down to purchasing the tickets($1500+) to go see our grandfather who was literally on his death bed, they refused. We were unable to travel for a trip in April when covid had spiked and everyone was being told to remain home. I have dates and times of when I spoke to agents who assured me that I would be able to use this credit on any future flights, no restrictions, so easy, etc. They have refused to allow me to use it and now I am out significantly more money. & I am so frustrated. Their best response was essentially “too bad” and did not care about anything that I was communicating to them in regards to who and what was said to me. Awful customer service. Never again."
Date of travel: December 2020,30,Went Ok for me,"I only fly once or twice a year.  Despite all the negative reviews on here, my flight went well and was pretty ordinary. Less laid back about the Covid19 but that was fine with me as Delta started to sound like Big Brother after a while on my flight back home and that was annoying."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Poor customer service,Flight from Las Vegas into DFW was straight forward.  However catching my connecting flight was horrible...I landed at 1200 and quickly made my way to my next gate only to be told I was late because they close onboarding 15 min prior to take off.  This was my first time on American Airlines and it will be my last
Date of travel: December 2020,10,"The Worst, Most Disgusting & Dirtiest Airlines Ever!!!","Is there a minus 1? I've tried giving American Air chances at least once a year. Each time is worst than the last. Too many sickening incidents to write out. I once had condensation dripping down onto my seat from the air vents, they stuffed it with tissue them moved me to another seat after a lot of pleading and that seat had mold and smelly situation going on. Another time a guy sitting across aisle from me discovered vomit on the floor in front of his seat before take off..they didn't clean it until after take off. Another time, everyone in my section overheard a stewardess making some racial comments about a Chinese passenger to crew members and it was a passenger that had to correct her, the crew did nothing. Another time I was given a salad that looked like it sat in heat and wilted and it smelled, then they gave me crackers that were super hard and stale !! Stale!  Do you know how long it takes for crackers to go stale??!! The very last time... another smelly moldy seat that smelled like it sat in the rain and dried, it smelled toxic. The flight attendants seemed mad at everyone. I kept yo myself didn't ask for anything. I dont know how American airlines is still in business with all of the complaints. I often hear so many people with the same complaints about american air... it is a truly disgusting airlines"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Terrible Company,Terrible company. Did not take any sympathy for my family's health situation. They were rude and sickening in every way possible. Do NOT fly American Airlines.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Unsanitary conditions during pandemic,"After being told that the flights are thoroughly sanitize between flights, I was very disappointed to find that the surfaces and seats were extremely dirty after I wiped them down with a sanitizing wipe (see picture). I felt very uncomfortable with this flight due to this and the fact that the entire plane was packed to full capacity during a pandemic."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Unfriendly flight attendants,Just stepped on the plane.  The flight attendant was on her phone texting and wouldn’t even speak.  I said “Hello” and she just ignored me.   Their customer service need a major upgrade.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Layover nightmare,"Terrible layover. I spent 8 hours at Charlotte airport alone and then with no notice, our flight was delayed another hour right before boarding. I could have driven the distance I needed to go much faster than flying. Next time, I won’t waste the money."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Worst experience in my life,"I am thoroughly disappointed with my travels with American Airlines this time, and I will likely not take AA anymore in the future, even with credit still left on my account. I booked a round-trip direct flight from DCA to LAX 3 months in advance. However, without explanation, both flights were changed to layover flights with a stop in Dallas. Then, they changed my seats without explanation. Even worse, my flight from LAX to DFW was delayed, causing me to miss my connection from DFW to DCA. In addition to the delay, the connection time of merely 40 minutes was unacceptable. Furthermore, AA changed the gates last minute for my flight into DFW and my flight out of DFW, causing me to run through 2 terminals only to be blocked at the gate even though there were still about 15 minutes left. I now have to stay at a hotel overnight, miss a whole day of work, and pay for meals and travel fees out of my own pocket. The worst part, their compensation to me was a 12-dollar meal voucher..."
n/a,50,Felt very safe,Nice experience as always in 1st class even with the pandemic going on. Safety practices were in full force. Very clean and felt comfortable at all times. Flight attendants treated us very well. Drinks were plentiful but food was very limited but good.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Horrible customer service,"I booked a flight together, me and partner, in same account. Some how when checking in they split me and my partner seats on the flight at opposite ends of plane. Hers was a paid seat which they gave her for free but wouldn't allow me to move next unless I paid upgrade price. Then allowed stand by customers to be placed in those seats for free."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Never flying with them again,"So flight gets delayed because of covid in the tower which I admit wasn’t there fault. So instead of waiting on plane to wait until it gets straightened out they take us off the plane. So it’s 5 pm and and they keep pushing back all the way until 1220 am. So the two flight attendants finally show up around midnight so we’re thinking we might get out of here. Nope the pilot doesn’t show up which is there fault. So they put us on standby for 1055 that morning. It was two o’clock in the morning before they offered us vouchers for hotel. I decided against the hotel for three hours of sleep because it was a half hour away. If they would have just canceled us when we got off or the next time we got pushed back I could lived with that. Plenty of time to figure stuff out. So we get around to the next morning, mind you I have three kids and my wife with me. We are waiting for all the people to board and finally customer service gives us the boarding pass yay! We get halfway to the plane and she calls us back said she made a mistake. I’m livid now and two of my kids are crying cause they want to be home for New Years. So as stressful as that was luckily some other people didn’t show and we got to board otherwise they said January 2nd we could get seats. We held our breath until the plane took off. They said it wasn’t there fault and as a result I will never fly with them again!!!!!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,THE WORST AIRLINE-DO NOT USE THEM,"My husband and I were flying with our ESA's (He suffers from severe anxiety/depression and I suffer from anxiety, depression, panic attack disorder, PTSD, and BPD) from San Diego, CA  to Charleston, WV this Christmas Eve, 12-24-20. It was the most stressful and upsetting trip we have ever had. The flight from San Diego, CA to Charlotte, NC was fine. Once we arrived in Charlotte, the disaster began. The flight was cancelled due to weather about 40 min prior to boarding. After waiting in line for 45 min to speak to a representative at the airport, they informed us the next flight would be the following day. I had just had three tumors removed from my spine and had stitches in my back. Being unable to sleep in the airport overnight I informed the representative I wanted to refund my connection ticket. Fred (the representative) said he couldn't help me and gave me a number to call. I called and spoke to a woman who told me it would take 2-3 weeks to process the refund and that they needed to figure out how much that ticket was worth. She also informed me that the airport should be able to provide a car voucher. I asked Fred about this and he stated that was not true. Our return flight was scheduled for 01/03/21 from WV to CA. I attempted to check in the night before and it would not let me. I called American and was on hold for 45 min. Once a representative answered he informed me that they cancelled mine and my husbands return flights because we ""missed"" our connection flight from NC to WV. I informed him that was not true, as the airline cancelled the flight and I spoke to a representative that day to request the partial refund and informed that we would be driving due to my stitches and inability to sleep upright in a chair. The man said the flight was full and he couldn't do anything. After begging he placed me on hold again. After 15 minutes he stated the flight was back on and everything was good. At the airport the next morning everything was NOT GOOD. They only reactivated my ticket, not my husband's as well.  The gentleman at the check in desk was very nice (the only nice person throughout this entire ordeal). He placed my husband and I back on the flight, sat us close to each other, and stated that the ESA forms were still okay. At the gate the lady was EXTREMELY rude to us. The first thing she stated was that I had too many bags (I had a backpack, a purse, and my ESA in his carrier) I informed her that ESA's do not count as carry ons, per AMERICAN AIRLINES. She said, ""Your pet counts. You have three bags."" I again stated, ""He is an ESA."" She continued to disregard me. The gentleman from the front desk informed her that our forms are good. She then turn towards me and said, What's your last name. I told her and then she said ""Thank you."" I just stood there because she did not say if we could board or anything. She looked at me again and went, ""I said Thank You, move along."" So disrespectful. Once boarding the plane everything seemed fine until we were about to take off. The on board flight attendant came over to me and said, ""I don't see your ESA forms, I'm going to take your dog to the back and you can have him after take off"" She tried to grab him from me. I told her no and stated I can show her the forms and the confirmation number/email on my phone. She said ""We don't have time for that I need to sit down so we can take off."" and she tried to take him from my hands again. At this point my anxiety has hit a high and I begin to have a panic attack. Finally she sits down and let me keep him. I WILL NEVER use this company again."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Great Customer Service,"I’ve not flown on American frequently however, after this trip I am a fan. Service was great. Staff were friendly and helpful. Our luggage was courtesy checked at the gate. Baggage was not damaged. Flights were on time and smooth. Space was limited but is on most economy flights. I look forward to my next flight with American."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN,"Had the WORST weekend of travel on AmericanAir this weekend. Jammed in small planes like packed sardines, passengers not wearing masks properly, one passenger kept his mask down the entire flight to bite his fingernails. We were delayed deplaning because of a grown man in the aisle putting his shoes back on. AA pilots walking through the Charlotte airport with no mask on, not eating/drinking. Leftover sanitizer wipes in the seat back in front when we boarded, so not much sanitizing going on between flights as they advertise. I flew in October on JetBlue and had a wonderful experience and felt SAFE the entire time. Passengers were spaced out on the flights and repeated mask checks were done on the flight. I recommend nobody to fly AmericanAir if you want to feel safe."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"Flight was cancelled, seat was offered at 3x original cost, no refund","American Airlines is truly disconnected from the needs of the average consumer. For example, I purchased a round trip flight but because of Covid and other holiday complications, was left with only needing my return flight. American Airlines cancelled my flight home leaving me stranded in another state during the holidays. Now I am sure in the fine print this is allowed but to add insult to injury the representative on the phone gave me only one option, and this was to re-purchase my seat for 3x the original cost on top of my original purchase. Additionally, the representative on the phone was callus and nasty and on top of that, many layovers were added to my original flight. I will never use this airline again."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Worst Airline I've ever used.  Planes are extremely old.  There's no TV's even in first class.,"Would never fly with them again. Even if it's free.  This is the second time I've used AA in the past couple of years.  Both times had a connecting flight and our first flight was delayed.  Both times had to run full sprint over half a mile through the Airport so we wouldn't miss our connection.  Ridiculous.  This time I thought things would be better since we chose first class.  The entire experience was horrible. From the moment we checked our bag, we stood in the first class line.  There were about 5 reps standing around the first class line with no other customers in that line. The economy/coach check in area had a long line with only 2 reps helping customers.    I walked up to one of the reps in the first class area, and she seemed very annoyed.  The first thing she said was, ""This line is for first class only""  I told her I understood and had first class.  She was extremely rude and had a poor attitude.  Upon boarding the plane we were handed a sanitizing wipe.  We needed it because everything was dirty.  Pretty gross considering the pandemic.  They clearly hadn't cleaned the plane prior to us boarding.  The second plane was even dirtier and we didn't get a wipe with that one.After our bags were checked in, our flight was delayed and we got a notification through the app that we would have to rebook our connection flight and we were going to miss it. It gave us no options to connect the same day.  So we ignored the notification and kept our fingers crossed that a miracle would happen.  Lo and behold we finally took off after about a 45 minute delay.  We had to sprint almost a mile through the airport at full speed to get on the connection flight.The second plane was even worse than the first one.  It didn't have wifi and of course no TV.  Also they said due to covid they were not serving beverages.  Weird because the flight I was on 20 minutes before that did serve beverages.  So not sure why they lied about it.  You would think they would offer something, what's the point of first class then?There were many people taking off their mask., A woman in front of me was doing the mask policing. Every time someone didn't have theirs on she would alert the flight attendants.  They got annoyed by her and avoided the front of the plane after several incidents.This was our first time flying first class so we were excited.  We didn't feel like we got a first class experience, other than the extra leg room.  Between the rudeness of the crew, delays,  lack of safety concern and ancient planes I don't see why anyone would fly with this airline.  I had a similar experience in 2019 while flying to Europe.  We had an overhead light that wouldn't turn off, it was an older place and extremely bright.  I tried touching the light to turn it off and it burned my finger. It was missing the cover!  The flight attendant had to tape a paper cup over the light so I could get some sleep. It didn't really help, the light was still really bright.  Also  no TV's on an international flight, I was floored!  We had to use our phones for entertainment.  Also had to run full speed that time as well so we didn't miss our connection.  I still have about 8k sky miles that I will never use.  I plan to cancel my AA credit card.  I have no use for it since I would never fly with them again."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Bad week,We got to DC.with plenty of time to get to our connecting Flight.we went to the women at the desk and were told to walk to gate 40.instead of using the shuttle that we didn't know was there.we missed our flight and had to hang out at the airport all day.then late in the day are told that we could have been placed on a different flight but the women at the desk didn't know what she was doing.so we had to stay in DC for the night.we missed our flight to the island because all of this.the people at the custom service desk were of no help at all and in our opinion didn't care at all.It was a terrible experience.And on the way home they lost our bags.We will never fly on American again.they are the worst.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Horrible service,"Flight was delayed over an hour, causing us to miss connecting flight by a few minutes.  The connecting flight was not held for our group of 11, although it could easily have been done so.  No more flights were available that day.  We were put up in a local hotel with some voucher money for food.  Came back to the airport and was told they could not get us home for 3 days, offering standby tickets only.  Ended up renting a car and driving 12 hours to get home with no help or compensation."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Worst airline I have ever flown with,First off the put me on a flight with 3 layovers on my way home witch I would have been fine with if they weren’t 5 hours 5hours and then 15 hours of waiting on that note I could have hitch hiked faster to and from my destination faster then this sh*t hole plane could have flown me come to find out there was flights with no layovers both ways but instead of me getting put on those flights that had open seats they put me with 6 layovers oh and on my last flight it got delayed for 3 hours on top of the 14 because the pilot couldn’t show up on time terrible terrible terrible
Date of travel: January 2021,10,AWFUL,"went from OKC to dallas with over an hour and a half long delay, same thing from dallas to cancun. our flight from cancun to charlotte north carolina we were over 40 minutes late along with 2 other american airlines planes. all of those people had to go through a flooded customs, get your luggage and recheck it in, then go through tsa again. basically EVERYONE missed their flights and they claimed it was customs fault so they have no responsibility helping people find hotels etc. now we’ve been waiting for over and hour and a half just to get our luggage(: don’t do it. also made us fill out covid forms all while filling each and every seat and even splitting up groups to sit by total strangers during a pandemic! never again"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Horrible Experience,I went to board my flight and everything was fine and then they told my boyfriend who had our bags that we had to check them at no additional cost because there was no more room on the flight which is normal because every time I fly American they say this even though when I get on there’s plenty of room. As we started the process another employee states if we don’t pay we can’t get on the flight even though you are given a carry on and a personal item and if there was room there wouldn’t be a problem. After this other employee stated what he stated the original employee instantly got an attitude with us stating that we had to pay while letting others get on with luggage. She then started yelling asking for our seat numbers this is when I told her I want to talk to a supervisor and I wasn’t saying anything else. She continued to yell in my face for about 2 minutes and she went to call the supervisor. Once the supervisor got there he completely ignored us and they walked behind gate and closed the door without even acknowledging us. My boyfriend went over and he tried to talk with them and the supervisor yelled at him saying he would talk with us when they finish. At this point I just wanted a refund and find a flight through another airlines and file a complaint later. I attempted to get workers names but only the supervisor gave his name. The second employee put his hand in my face and told me to leave and get away from him just kept being rude and putting his hands in my face when I pulled out my phone and asked him again he acted as if he was busy on the phone. This is my third interaction with American where the employees are completely rude even the security at the airport said this is common with American and we should file a complaint with customer service. Another passenger experience the same he even recorded the agents being rude. I’m hoping to run into him on next flight so he can send me the video. I just don’t understand how employees can be so rude.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Poor customer service,"My son and I flew American airlines December 2020 to visit family is Wisconsin. My 2 year old son had a broken foot and couldn’t walk.  I requested an assist for all my stops and layovers. Other than leaving Portland and landing in Portland American Airlines didn’t provide me with the assistance I needed and requested. I waited over 25 mins in Dallas for my assistance which never came. I had no choice but to ask a stranger for help just so I wouldn’t miss my connecting flight. Also not to mention the the lady at the ticket counter in Wisconsin Milwaukee was extremely unprofessional and very rude which left me in tears, her name was PAM. This airline has very rude employees, not helpful, and unknowledgeable. I emailed American Airlines and all I got was a sorry. I’ll never recommend or fly with American again!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,"Poor customer service,lost flight info",I called AA at 11:04 am to book a round trip flight from Cleveland to Miami Jan 9-12. Talked to a agent by the name Mohammed.  The flight left Cleveland 6am. Flight round trip was $92 or $97. Mohammed worked out the details on me using my miles. After talking with him for 15 mins he stated that if I would like to call back within 24 hours to book said flight that I could. He has it reserved for me. I call backed 30 mins later and another agent said no record of the call and reservation. Also the price was not the same anymore. If I had known the price would not have stayed the same I would have booked it right there and then. I then called and talked to customer service about this and they stated there was no record of me calling AA at all. I said this was was 3 rd call. She then said I was mistaken and must have called another airlines. During my 2nd phone call with AA I booked the same flight for Sunday that I was to fly Saturday. I then told the lady on the 3rd phone call that she was wrong I had called 3 times today amd gave her my booking number. She got quiet because your computers were wrong. I have hotel and car booked for Saturday that I will need to change if I fly out Sunday. 3rd call I talked to a supervisor that said I was wrong and that those fairs were never for Saturday when 3 people here and Mohammed saw them. Hope you can makes this right. Todd Rager
Date of travel: January 2021,10,If You Book With American Airlines (a children’s book and warning for adults),"If You Book With AmericanAirlines (Have you read this book before?)If you book with American Airlines, and want to use your credits from a 2020 canceled flight, you will need to talk to an agent on the phone. If you get an agent on the phone, you will tell the agent you want to go to Salt Lake City. The agent will ask about your visit, and if you are planning to go to Park City. She will tell you that Park City is her favorite place! Then, the agent will book your flight to Seattle. Once your flight is booked, American Airlines will then see that you have two members of your family with the same name, and that MUST BE A MISTAKE, so they cancel your oldest son’s ticket to Seattle (which was supposed to be to Salt Lake City). When your son’s ticket is canceled, you won’t be notified.When you call American Airlines because you can’t find a confirmation email, or flight details on your account, you soon discover that they only charged you 3 times on your credit card instead of 4. So you really get worried, and give them a call. When you call American Airlines, they have to call you back because their call volume is too high.When an American Airlines agent calls you back, it’s a struggle to fix your flights to Salt Lake because they really want you to go to Seattle. You explain to the American Airlines supervisor that you’re sure Seattle is lovely, but you booked your trip for 4 to Salt Lake, and have returning flights for 4 already booked from Salt Lake. When supervisor hears this news she puts you on hold some more. When supervisor  returns, instead of bending over backwards for American Airlines COMPLETE INCOMPETENCE she asks you to pay today’s rate to Salt Lake City because she thinks you are a dummy. WTH?!!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Horrible flight continued,"In a follow up to my previous review on this airline after American Airlines took our money delayed our flight and could not get us a flight to our destination we had to return home. And I believe i ended that review with them loosing our luggage. The staff at the lost baggage claim In Miami tried their best to track it down. For 6 hours we waited as they called and had people looking for it. But no luck. We were put in a jet to fly back to Des Moines. We then sat for 30 plus minutes waiting again....... for what this time oh the pilot! Finally after being cramped in farthest back seats, you know the ones that don’t recline we were finally on our way. Not to the warm beaches of Roatan but back to our home state where it was 18°! But that’s not where this review ends. They had the heat so high in the jet we were sweating and my poor wife spent the entire trip in the planes bathroom vomiting! Heat and motion sickness got her. She said the bathroom was cooler. So we spent 23hours traveling either on American Airlines or in the airport just to come back home all because they couldn’t wait for for 5 minutes. Thanks for that American Airlines.On a positive note, the Lost baggage people at both Miami and Des Moines were very nice. The flight attendant on the Des Moines flight home was also a saint, she was guarding the bathroom and helping customers to get to the first class bathroom. So to her thank you so much."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Don't fly with these guys.,"First I had a a flight get delayed for over an hour and they kept moving us back and forth to different gates, then when we got on the flight their social distancing procedures were a joke. They were severely overbooked and we were all crammed into that tiny plane like sardines but hey at least we were all wearing masks right? I won't be surprised at all if I come down with COVID-19 after that debacle."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,WORST SERVICE IVE EVER HAD AT AN AIRPORT,we arrived in time to check in for our flight however they had only two people working there and obviously someone who was brand new which in turn made us miss our check in time and we were bumped to stand by! Waited in line for 40 minutes. I’ve never had this type of service at any airport I am beyond upset. Never flying with this airline again. I’m trying to make it home to my son.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Absolutely horrible!,I’m not one to get on here and say what a horrible flying I had flying American Airlines but here I am. We were scheduled to fly from Des Moines to Roatan Honduras. Our flight was delayed because they couldn’t get the sky bridge to retract in Des Moines. When we got to Miami was had only 5 minuets or so to make our connection. American would not hold the only flight they have to Roatan for a couple minutes for us to make it to them. I ran up to the gate as they were pulling the bridge away. Normally this isn’t an issue but due to COVID you have to have a negative test within 72 hours of your flight to Honduras. They offered to send me to Huston for a flight tomorrow but by then our Covid test would have to be renewed. It would be impossible to get a test and the results back in an overnight window. Now we are trying to return home and they have lost our luggage.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Doesn't care about the safety of children,"I was traveling with my 3 kids (12, 8, 5), and my 12yo was 3 rows away. I asked at the gate to have him moved closer. It didn't have to be the same row, just a row ahead or behind so I could have eyes on him. They told me they had nothing available and didn't know if they would be able to accommodate us. I asked if they could guarantee he would not be sat beside a possible pedophile or any other inappropriate person. The one clerk acted insulted and laughed that this would be a legit concern concern by a parent. When I said as such she got belligerent and rude with me and continued to act as if I was unreasonable that I wanted to keep my child safe. That AA doesn't take the safety of young children seriously or the concerns of parents seriously is dangerous and disturbing. And that their employees laugh at these concerns makes me question if their employees are properly background checked."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Don't fly with them,I had my 5 year old son with me. We were getting in out seats and settling in. His mask kept coming down and the lady was very rude about it. She continued the whole flight making trips just to walk by us and say something. He started to eat a snack and she said something again about his mask. I looked at her and said good lord lady he is eating a snack. Pick on someone your own age. She left us alone for a bit. Would not fly with them if you don't have to.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Avoid traveling American Airlines. It’s the worst!!!,This is an AWFUL airline. I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste their time traveling via American Airlines. Please pick another airline if you can. My experience with this airline has been terrible every time. I strongly advise you to avoid this airline at all costs. The service is absolutely terrible and the baggage fees are ridiculously and unnecessarily high.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Failure to prepare,"First, I don’t know why I even booked with American Airlines in the first place because 2/3 times I do, they overbook flights or have some kind of delay. With some icy weather overnight, they failed to be prepared by not keeping the engines warm. They let them freeze and also let the defrosting machine freeze. Southwest and United are coming and going with no problems. American, however, has cause me to lose a day in Cancun and rebook flights 3 times on an almost 6 hour delay. I will avoid booking with them at all costs going forward and do not/will not recommend. I’d compare it to flying Spirit Airlines."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Unprofessional,"The flight from Cancun to Dallas was a delayed flight. Our flight was delayed two hours due to brakes, which is understandable that planes will need maintenance now and again. The problem started when we landed in Dallas. The flight attendants on board told us that we would be able to reschedule our connecting flight in the airport and receive hotel rooms for the night. We arrived in Dallas around 8:35 p.m. and we did not get to the hotel room until 2 a.m. the next morning.  American Airlines only had 3 people working this particular desk and they were in no hurry whatsoever. The did call in 2 other people due the the amount of people waiting in line. The amount of time it took each worker was outrageous. The workers were not motivated to do their jobs and were quite rude to several of the travelers. One gentleman in particular was very rude to customers waiting in line. I am unclear as to what his position with American Airlines was due to his lack of duty the entire time we waited in line, which was several hours. He did not help anyone, he would come up and yell at people waiting in line. He was unprofessional and inconsiderate. He even make ""small talk"" with another man and was rude to him as well. His name tag was conveniently covered. Overall the whole situation was handled poorly. This is a ridiculous amount of time to make people wait for hotel rooms. There are a lot of issues that American Airlines needs to take into consideration with handling flights that have been delayed. This was not professional and serious changes need to be made in situations with delayed customers."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Will never fly with them again,I've been flying American for years but after what they did to those families because children didn't wear mask is appalling. I will never fly with them again.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Very poor customer service. ,"They provided very rude customer service. Most of flight attendants unprofessional. They threatened me to leave at the airport out of nothing claiming I didn’t wear a mask properly. They don’t value their customers. For some reason, our seat were reassigned and it was a havoc for the family of 7. Not coming back."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,CANCELLED MY FLIGHT,"American Airlines is the worst, cancelled my flight on New Years...... barely got another flight to see my family for New Years. Please, dont waste money they also don’t offer any type of refund."
Date of travel: October 2020,40,Not the best trip the way there but an amazing flight the way back,"I booked this flight for a trip for a wedding in October. I was shocked and a bit disappointed to get an email the day before our flight advising that our flight was full and they were asking passengers to be booked on later flights (nothing for the same day). With covid this made me super nervous but I figured there would be social distancing enforced while on our flight. Boy was I wrong. The flight on the way there was literally full. No social distancing no one seat in between someone you didn't know. We were packed into that flight like sardines, which I normally wouldn't mind but hello covid is a thing so It was very very uncomfortable. Aside from that the flight wasnt so bad and our connecting flight for the last leg of the journey there wasnt as full however they didnt enforce mask wearing on this flight as the woman behind us had hers off the majority of the hour flight. The return flights is where American Air really shined. We were once again stuck next to someone we didnt know but since there were open seats they allowed us to move so we could practice social distancing. The staff was friendly and although we had some weather issues and had to run to our connecting flight home overall it was a great flight. I would recommend American Air for travel even with the packed flight, however as they dont social distance i would recommend you taking extra precautions yourself if you are at risk."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Disgusting and Inconvenient,"I have been wanting to write a review for a long time, but I have held off, and now I just have to write one. Not only are my trips always delayed or cancelled, but this airline does not even automatically put you on the next flight or give other flight suggestions. After going to wait to rebook your flight, they are no help whatsoever. Along with this, we are in a spike of the coronavirus, and I am flying first class, so I expect to not have a single random person sit next to me for health reasons. Even if I was not sitting in first class, which I do not sit in first class often, I would expect to not sit by a random person. On my previous flights during the virus, I did not sit by a random person. To add on to these reasons, this airline is not the nicest I have been on...there is barely any leg room, and sometimes they did not clean up fully from the flight before mine. Overall, this airline is disappointing, and it has been for a number of years."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Waste of Time not worth the money saved,"We were trying to fly from SLC to Philly on 12/30 they had 2 tires go flat that they needed to fix and only had one here to fix it! Are you kidding me how do you not have plane tires? Also why not borrow off another airline or better yet keep them in stock! Then before they even fixed that problem... the crew had been awake for too long and thus could no longer fly due to regulations... hey while we were waiting to get that tire for 5 plus hours how about you take a nap or go sleep at a hotel room paid for by the airline! Finally, they decided to reschedule for the next morning so hopefully we could get to Philly in time for a wedding we needed to get to and now they are delaying it. I will never use them again. Delta is what I usually fly figured I would save some money but it just isn’t worth it."
Date of travel: November 2020,40,My Experience with american airlines,my experience with American airlines was great. before buying the ticket i was planning to fly with United airlines or any other airlines but my travel agent suggest me to book American airlines as i got very cheaper deal. my flight was nice and flight stewardess was also very helping. Over all great service.Thanks to my travel agent as well. I would definitely recommend Cheapusaflight.com if you are planning to fly within USA or International.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,No social distancing at all.,"Disgusted about how AA is managing the covid situation. The airplane was an american Eagle with no social distancing at all. The airplane we oversold, we all looked like sardines almost one on top of the other ones. The person next to me was the whole flight talking ver the phone, I guess through the wifi of the airplane with no mask. I told the flight attendant twice and she didn't do anything about it. This company don't care about the customers."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER,"The worst company ever. I will never be using this company any more. All my flight were delayed so that made me miss my connecting flights, had to sleep in the airport. i will given a bad review every day until this matter is taken care of. the customer service is crap, you call and sit on hold for 3 hours then they hang up on you."
n/a,10,Most incompetent airline ever,Incompetence at its finest. Both flights delayed. The second flight. They can't even get a flight crew to man the flight. Delay after delay.  It's worse than a monkey screwing  a football !!!!!!  Fly any other airline if possible.  This is inexcusable.
Date of travel: December 2020,50,HVAC technician,"A flight stewardess named Beth was very attentive to all passenger needs. We were on Flight 52, Dec 29, 2020 from LAX to JAX.

American Airlines on Christmas Day, ""You booked a flight 23 hours before scheduled departure, in order to be eligible for a refund it had to be 24 hours.""

Flight 5150 to SC: service crew is rude, faulty cabin lights have us waiting almost 2 hours on the aircraft already with no real updates, and most of us are missing our connecting flights...AA seems to be vying for 2020 official mascot status and has a stunning lead.

Not to mention the horrific Covid-19 health restrictions. No social distancing, or cleaning, only regulation is a mask that many people do not even fully wear. If you really want to be safe and your bags to be safe during travel I would consider another airline, I for sure am not using AA anymore."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Anticipatory breach with NO refund!,"In contracts,its called an anticipatory breach when one party, without consent, fails to live up to their terms of an agreement.  Typically, the other parties can collect damages at least to make one ""whole"".My wife and I received a cancellation notice from American but NO REFUND. The only option that was offered was a ""credit"" for any future flight that we might take in 2021.. They alone determined  that this solution was sufficient.Unfortunately, we don't want to take an American flight in 2021. Our cruise connection was made for 2020. Besides,if we reserved the same flight in 2021, the price has increased and we would have to actually pay more.We were unsuccessful approaching a solution through the BBB.  We are left to seek a solution through small claims and I say GAME ON!"

Ticketing, baggage and boarding the plane was an easy process and ran smoothly.  I am very disappointed in the condition of our first class seats. Our seating area was filthy with dirt from not being cleaned and also what appeared to be cracker crumbs on my seat and all over the carpet. I have pictures of the dirty surface areas and the seat/carpet area that are attached. I have flown first class/business class before and this is by far the worst experience I have had. I am not happy that I paid for first class and felt uncomfortable the entire trip looking at the dirt."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Clowns,"American may be ok for the occasional vacation traveler but if you travel for business you can never count on them to be on time. TIME DELAYS cause all types of issues from rescheduling,, re booking.it cost alot of moneyConstantly over books flights, no amenities, no social distancing. They are the first to apologize but never offer refunds or any good will. It's some hassle literally every other flight with themOnly as a last resort and emergency should a business traveler use American."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Still on the tarmac,Still sitting with a packed house for our 20 minute flight. Maybe I can just get some people to spit in my mouth to make it safer on this garbage plane.
Date of travel: December 2020,50,AA All the Way,"I fly AA almost exclusively.  All airlines have issues at times.  However, AA has been my airline of choice for about 5 years now.  Their attention to detail for frequent fliers is great.  I appreciate their customer service."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,The worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. This is 2020. How are they still in business?,It’s been 20 years so I forgot why I dislike American Airlines so much. One trip to the counter to see a line of 20 people with one attendant helping them and then the employees attitude when I got to the counter reminds me that cheaper is NEVER better. I will never recommend or fly American again. Rude. Unyieldind. Intentionally slow. And the customer isn’t first.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Sitting on the tarmac again,"American Airlines is horrible! Their planes are old worn out and uncomfortable. Their customer service is terrible, and once again on a 20 minute connecting flight from Greensboro to Charlotte I’ve been sitting on the plane for 40 minutes. Great way to handle Covid, wear you masks on a packed plane when they know it’s not taking off for 30+ minutes. I gave American one more chance and regret that, I’ll fly delta and have 10 stops before I’ll ever get on American again!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Worst airline ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Our flight was leaving Vail at 2:35pm. They delayed our flight 30min. We called to confirm and they stated our flight would leave at 3:10pm. We get to the airport and they said it was delayed for the next day at 3:10pm, instead. Mind you we got text messages from AA that our flight was being delayed only 30min. The customer service was terrible."
Date of travel: December 2020,30,Ok trip,We chose American because their flights fit our travel schedule. The attendants aren't friendly but not rude just blah. I'll be glad when covid is over and Southwest have more flights. They are the best.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Never Again,"I have had problems with American Airlines in the past. I don’t know why I decided to give them another chance, that was a bad decision. In the past it was oversold flights and terribly rude and uncaring flight attendants. I thought maybe these were isolated incidents. It seems I was wrong as I have continued to run into rude, arrogant, and inconsistent gate employees and flight attendants over the years, including today. The last straw? The flight I was just on that landed in Charlotte NC, was the scariest most unprofessional landing I have ever experienced. There was no weather or mechanical problems. The pilots are either incapable of doing their jobs or they just think of their passengers as cargo they can toss around. Never again."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Horrible Experience!,"In my recent trip, I was flying as the Assistant worker to an Adult autistic customer. On 12/19/20 when we arrived at the airport as scheduled departure 2:31pm, 3h48min flight turned into a nightmare. First they announced at the check in that the flight has changed without advanced notification (I could have arranged necessary accommodations for my customer).  So we spent 4 hours at the airport, waiting for a flight going to Dallas TX, where we should spend the night because  thanks to them our home flight was only the next day ( not what was originally booked - things happen but again there was no notification from the airline.  They agreed to pay for the hotel due to such inconvenience. But when we arrived in Dallas, the personnel directed us to the manager who categorically denied that they promised to pay for the hotel. She was abusive due to our vulnerability, we definitely didn't have any choice left."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Bad customer experience - Racist Ticketing Agent,"This is a formal complaint against a ticketing agent name, OKI at the Syracuse NY airport.  Very rude and impolite.  He made fun of my accent as none American and mimicked the way a speak.  I wasn’t even talking to him I was frustrated that they couldn’t let go of a half pound over my luggage. Really it was just half a pound extra. I understand rules are rules but I’ve flown thousands of times and never had someone being so strict.  I was talking to the agent who was helping me and he jumped in the middle of the conversation and sarcastically said, “maybe you need to learn how to pack better next time.” I told him you are so rude I’m not even talking to you. He said everyone follow rules, I told him you are liar because not everyone follow rules then he start mimicking my accent and making fun of it in front of my 6 year old daughter .. I start asking him to stop talking to me and he kept talking back at me even though I kept asking him to stop talking to me. Then I stoped talking and he kept going sarcastically saying things and lowering his voice just enough for me to hear him and I told him NOW YOU NEED TO REALLY SHUT YOUR MOUTH. I stopped talking but he kept being nasty and rude to me.  I’m taking this to every social media I have. I’m planning on going back to the airport later this week and speak to a direct supervisor.  He needs to learn better etiquette how to deal with customers. If American Airline keep such a person like this as their customer service face, then American Airline will lose lots of customers.  I’ve never in all my years traveling with all kind of airlines encountered such a humiliating situation. And his voice was loud where everyone in the airport was looking. Bad image for your counter when people pass and see your agent yelling at customers.  This is not the last you going to hear about this I feel so humiliated and if it wasn’t my daughter with me it would’ve went bad.  I k ow this is my last time flying AA out of Syracuse."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Makes no sense,"Traveled for family death. Paid more than $1,800 round trip in Bussiness Class.  AA left one of my luggage that I was able to recover only 4 days later. In the way back to Miami they were 24h late. Staff in Miami not only incompetent but rude and show no repect to passengers.In Hav they are understaff. Flights unnecessary delaied due to lack of personnel to do the boarding. A true nigthmare. Congress need to prevent further airline fusion. Monopoly is directly proportional to poor service and high prices. A true disgrace"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,LOST LUGGAGE AND DID NOT REFUND,The worst airline ever. Charged extra $100 for overweight baggage and then lost my baggage in Philadelphia and only refunded me $30 of the $130 I paid to check my bag. It also took 3 days to arrive to my house. I want the full amount back not just $30 of it such a waste of money horrible flight and horrible airline.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,They just don’t care,Absolutely awful service. The original leg of the flight was delayed by 30 minutes (much of which was due to their terrible boarding policy). Got to connecting airport and sprinted to other side of Charlotte airport to make flight. Made it 8 minutes before departure and told I was too late and had to wait for next flight even though they had just closed doors (crew hadn’t even come back from tunnel to airport yet). Took them almost 15 minutes to find someone rebook because “the crew for that flight is busy”. Have had one similar experience with delta where they rushed me and others waiting on to flight and managed to reopen the door to let us on while still maintaining schedule. Just takes someone caring.
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Airlines canceled my flight,"Checked in three large bags for a flight from El Paso to Phoenix, Phoenix to Los Angeles, then finally Los Angeles to Maui Hawaii.  Active duty military on short leave going home to see my family in Hawaii for a few days.  Sitting in the terminal waiting to board my flight from El Paso to Phoenix, when a notification on my phone tells me that my flight from Phoenix to LA and LA to Hawaii has been canceled. I guess there was a big delay in the flight from El Paso to Phoenix which resulted in the airlines automatically canceling the subsequent legs. Big ordeal trying to rebook the flights using the phone service, who then directed me to the ticket counter, who then directed me to the website. Trying to get my check bags back from American Airlines baggage office was quite an experience. baggage office lady and ticketing counter lady were extremely rude, unprofessional, sassy, and made the whole experience unpleasant. Phone service said ticketing counter may be able to offer voucher, ticket counter lady said she was unable to offer a voucher at ticketing counter (“this is only fine online”) and even if she could she would “not  because this was not an overbooked flight!” but rather a matter of the flight being extremely delayed thus resulting in the cancellation of subsequent legs. she was so rude I told her “I’ll never fly American again.” Her response: looked me straight in the eyes, shrugged her shoulders and said in a sassy voice “OK!”The entire time, not one pleasantry not one common courtesy not one “sir”not one smile. Because of the compressed timeline, Covid testing window required for Hawaii, unable to rebook flight… Refund not given, only voucher to use within the next calendar year. After the voucher is reclaimed, will never fly American Airlines again."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Covid,"I have to say I am not scared of Covid, I am a nurse and it’s just part of our lives at this point but I am very disappointed in American Airlines. We are trapped in a bubble essentially, going to spread probably, whether we like it or not, but really, you’re going to separate family and people of the same household over a few extra dollars, this is already irritating but on top of it you’re saying your couple of extra dollars is more important then the spread of Covid. All of the other airlines I have traveled on have even gone as far as to skip seats, not this company. My husband and I booked our flights together, checked in together, paid together, yet he was in the back and I was in the middle. It is so ridiculous that I watch two families have to switch around their children. Two families split up within each other. Come on. It’s ridiculous to split anyway but right now it’s just less safe. I should have to give even more money, on top of a normal priced not discounted ticket, to be more safe. Also, y’all were pushing so hard for your customers to pick up other flights, without any gain mind you, and half of this flight were your employees. My husband had an empty seat and a flight attendant next to him. Makes so much sense to put your employee next to him and to separate us. Yep. So disappointed."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Waiting in the plane for 30 minutes,We are all in the plane right now at 10am. Why do you make us wait for 40 minutes in an enclosed face and during COVID if you know about this delay. Everyone is checked in and just waiting
Date of travel: December 2020,10,The worst,"Worst airline ever, my teenage soncame out the gate in Dallas and He got the alert from American of the gate for my connection, I even got the email also. He went to the gate assigned to him by the Airlines, before that he ask a flight attendant ob the plane that told him to follow what was texted to me. He waited 20 mn, no update, gate with few people, I felt something was wrong. I told him to go ask, the aa personal he found 2 gates down at customer service, told him that he didn't know after waiting on a line that had over 30 people in front of me. I called the airline while he was rushing to leave there, she told me on the phone  the gate was wrong, he had to go accros to the other side of the airport, she said they didn't boarded yet. He ran to the other side, the agent there told him the flight was gone. I called a AA representative telling me that the flight is still on time and not boarding yet. I told the agent on the phone that she's wrong because I am at the right gate and the agent there is saying something different. She just said oh, maybe they didn't update their system.  seriously. Conclusion my teenager had to sleep their alone until the morning and they give him a next flight a 10 am tomorrow (12hrs alone there). THE WORST! Never again!"
Date of travel: December 2020,30,First class where?!,"I paid for first class tickets only to receive not even coach service! They didn’t serve any food or drinks,  the plane ride was rough, The outlets were not working nor the Wi-Fi, it just sucked!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Go with Delta if you can,"Mask enforcement on the flight from Japan to US was very poor, and some flight attendants were not even wearing the masks properly. The Premium Economy experience on American is nowhere close to the equivalent on Delta. Unless you can afford First Class, don't even bother. Also, we missed our connection because the gate agent opted to close the flight as we were walking toward the gate (and she knew we were coming!)."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Took off with Faulty Landing Equipment and Gave no Refund,2 hours into my flight from Miami to Chicago it was announced that we took off with faulty landing gear and there was a failure off the deicing equipment. We had to fly North and stop in Charlotte for 2 extra hours in order to switch planes. I tried getting my bags off the plane which I was told would not be possible. Then upon requesting some refund for my flight I was given a 50 dollar evoucher good for future American Airlines flights. This was a slap in the face as they only open up the situation to make more money from me. I had to call and cancel on my plans that evening and pay extra to inform my family I would not be making it home in time. In these cases a refund on the original credit card is the correct form of action and an apology. I was offered neither of these and am appalled with the service. I will never be flying American again and urge you to do the same. This was my pre Christmas flight December 2020. Thanks American.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,"Beyond annoyed, never again","I travel frequently and I have never been so pissed while traveling. My sister and I were on a 5:00 flight from ABE to CLT. We get on the plane and we sit there for a bit, the pilot announces there are difficulties on the plane. A little bothered, I understand though.They tell us to wait out at the gate, eventually we see our flight get delayed to 6, 7, 8, 9, and finally 10:30. We wait 5 hours to board onto the plane. The only thing I liked was the crew on the plane was very friendly and really did feel bad about what was going on so I appreciated them. We get on the plane again and ride along thinking we’re going to take off. We sit there stopped for a moment and the pilot again announces that they can’t fly the aircraft because they weren’t approved. We return back to the gate, they tell us we will immediately get on another plane and then when we get off the new news is we actually have to wait until 6am to fly. Really? I was supposed to be in Charleston at 9. Ridiculous. We come back in the morning thinking this day was going to be better.Wrong. 6 am flight delayed to maintenance, we board at 8 am and get to Charlotte at 9:50. The next flight is at 12:55. We board hoping everything can be smooth. As we’re riding along, the plane stops in its tracks. The pilot says we will be returning to the gate because they got some news. It seemed as if the crew didn’t know what was going on either. We get off and get transferred to another gate. We wait until 2:00. We board and as we’re all seated the pilot says that the reason for the delay was because someone apparently had corona and got off the plane? There was so much uncertainty. And that someone had corona and was on the other plane. That was super disturbing. They should take covid more seriously. We take off and finally land in Charleston.I was super pissed because I missed a day of spending time with mom to a bunch of delays."
Date of travel: August 2020,20,COVID vs MONEY,"Please do not blame COVID for the lack of service. Our flights were sold out with all seats filled. You do not provide any service to regular class, only a mini bag with mini bottle of water and a cookie. First class only one option: a small tray with cheese, crackers and grapes!! I asked for another option and nothing else was available. What about people that can not eat dairy products and paid you first class? Screw them!  The beer was warm in the two flights (4 legs 07/31/20 - 08/12/20) MIA-DFW-SLC, so after the first one I did not request anything else. Is that first service? Do you really care?  Everything points into you are trying to save money on COVID. Also your flight attendants leave much to be desired in their dress. You can be thin, heavy, tall or short, but you shall dress according to your job.Of the four flights we took, only one flight attendant was dressed according to her job and she seemed proud of it. It happened to be the senior one of them.Positive: all flights were on time.Hope you have learned, and provide a better service with or without COVID. That's what your customers expect from AA."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Beware : American Airlines misleading flexibility ticket statements in this uncertain times,"I had booked from LHR-DFW Business Class tickets and with the latest lockdown in London decided to avoid Heathrow for safety reasons.  When I went to reuse that ticket American denied me from changing/rerouting it from Zurich - Dallas.  Excerpt on your website says the following : We’re extending our offer to waive change fees on any existing tickets* for travel March 1, 2020 – March 31, 2021. This offer includes Basic Economy fares and AAdvantage® award tickets.Keep in mind:You may owe any difference in ticket price when you rebook your trip.You’re allowed to change your origin and destination cities as part of this offer.You may have until December 31, 2021, for future travel.Plus, if you have a ticket that is expiring between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the value of your unused ticket can be used for travel through December 31, 2021.***Tickets bought on or before September 30, 2020**Change fees apply if your original ticketed travel was before March 1, 2020, Basic Economy tickets with travel before March 1, 2020 are non-changeable.Well in their language you can change cities but only within the same country !!  which is no where reflected on their website.  This is not consumer friendly and rather incomplete if not misleading statement in uncertain times."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Worse Flight Ever,"American Airlines allowed for full seat flights during COVID in September, unlike other airlines which were keeping middle seats open to allow decent distancing between passengers. Additionally, the airline attendants did not check to ensure that all passengers were wearing their masks correctly. The gentleman next to me would either take off his mask or wear it around his mouth but not his nose. Not only that, he was coughing repeatedly the entire time on the plane. When doing their final walk through before take-off, the flight attendant even looked directly at the gentleman next to me and didn't say a word. Additionally, three planes on a four-leg flight trip were delayed due to maintenance. The delays ranged from as little as 30 minutes to nearly two-hours. Instead of having all passengers depart the plane, they had all passengers remain on the fully packed plane while they tried to resolve said maintenance issue. Furthermore, the flight attendants appear to not keep in good communication with those at the airports. Due to the maintenance delays two of the connecting flights were nearly missed. On the last leg, we missed our connecting flight by mere seconds because the in-air flight attendants did not communicate with the airport staff to hold the plane for those that are supposed to be on the connecting flight. Because we missed the connecting flight, we had to get on the next flight out. That being said, we had paid for extra leg room on our original flight, but because we were getting on another flight we were placed on the very last row of the flight. I was told by the attendant that American Airlines will reimburse us for the seats we paid for. To date (December almost January 2021), I have not received a notice from American Airlines about said reimbursement. Needless to say, that was the worse experience on any flight I've ever had and if I can help it will never voluntarily choose to purchase flights from American Airlines again. I would give American Airlines zero stars if possible."
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Flight Changed on Us Right Before Wedding and We Were Charged $170 Extra,My family and I booked a flight from Montana to Arizona for a wedding about a month in advance in October 2020. I received an email one week before our flight on December 21st saying our flight was changed and we would need to fly to Dallas for a layover before then heading to Phoenix. This would make us late for the wedding so I called and sat on hold two separate times for about 50 minutes each time to change our flights to an earlier time/date. I was charged $170 to change two flights to make it on time which I feel is unfair because it was no fault of my own there was a last minute change. We live in Bozeman but booked a flight two hours away in Billings because it was the only direct flight available that day. Now we will be getting to Arizona a day before the wedding instead of the day of which will also cost me another night in the hotel for $389 and an extra $120 for our rental car. Not happy with that obviously. On a positive note the customer service lady and man were very kind and I understand it isn't their decision.
Date of travel: April 2020,40,From Boston to Miami,"Standard flight, with some COVID precautions to be in place - it was still earlier in the process, so the airline didn't have as many standard procedures as today"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Standard flight from Boston to Chicago,"Nothing too crazy, but will get you from point A to B. A couple of standard snacks during the flight with enough legroom (although I""m very short). Checking in online beforehand is key to a faster process!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Fight or Flight,"I had a 30 minute flight from Raleigh to Charlotte, which was fine. As I headed to my flight, and patiently waited to board, without any alerts, or a heads up from the people at the podium, our flight changed from 8:15 pm to 11 pm; getting us in after midnight. As I scrambled to get a pick from the airport, I finally got an alert. They then announced that the captain was not able to fly the plane, and that there was another pilot landing at 10:30 pm, who would run over to us and get us to our destination.  At this time, once the countdown to board came and went, they started boarding people at this time. Once they got up to Group 4, there was a disabled person that needed attention, getting him loaded on the plane. They made an announcement that once he is seated and secure, they will continue to board. Twenty minutes lapsed as we stood there to board. Calls were coming back and forth, then without any heads up, the time changed to 7 am. Twenty minutes later, they told people to head to the information area to get hotel vouchers.   I missed half a day of work, because by this time it is midnight, and we still had to wait for a shuttle, ride to the hotel, and get checked in. We were alerted to return back to the airport at 5:30 am. and started work at 8 am; I am requesting that to be  reimbursed to me, $88.60 {4 hours at $22.15 per hour.} I am requesting my ticket to be refunded as well, due to this not being an act of God, this was not on the patients flying.    I also want to inform the TSA personnel are rude and unprofessional. During the 1st and 2nd layover, a small group went to find the smoking section. We asked the TSA worker who was sitting at the security area for directions and she acted as if we were asking her for free food. She gave unwarranted attitude, stating that we can either go up stairs or down stairs, and went back to her phone. We ended up asking four more personnel who all gave the wrong directions!    Lastly, if the option of an overall filled flight was to re-schedule people for another flight was sent via email, why wasn't that followed through? Vending machines did not work, stealing peoples money, and all restaurants shut down at 8 pm. This morning when we returned, I explained that I just had back surgery and wearing a brace for mobility support. TSA, stated I still had to remove it. I almost fell, and no one assisted me. Ridiculous"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Lost Item - Horrific Customer Service,"My husband was flying to Virginia for our wedding, and his ring box was in his carry on bag.  It fell out during his flight, which he realized immediately after leaving the airport.  He attempted to contact American Airlines, and was essentially told he could only leave a 'lost items' report.  If someone were to located it, they could check the 'lost items' system and respond.  NOBODY, and I mean NOBODY, was willing to contact the flight crew to conduct a real-time search.  Not a single person even attempted to assist him.  After a month, they closed out his request despite multiple phone calls/attempts to contact."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Be wary when booking with AA,"I've always avoided AA in the past due to flight delays/cancellations but I decided to give them another shot after several years. The price was seemed great but I soon learned how their business model works. We bought our tickets 3 weeks ahead, checked in to our flight 24 hours prior and arrived at the gate over an hour prior. We waited to board and then were told that our seats weren't available and we would have to go to the re-booking desk. The agent there wasn't exactly helpful but got us on a plane to Cancun hours later with no compensation. I don't even want to get into the losses and extra expenses it cost us. I learned through candid disclosure from that agent that they commonly re-sell tickets to same day or stand-by customers at inflated fees or just flat our overbook and bump people like me, who bought at a cheaper rate. When I made a formal complaint I was referred to the fine print legalese which in fact states that it is in fact their right to do that and there is no recourse for the customer. All my interactions with their customer services were met with a figurative ""Go F yourself""."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Racist Horrible customer service,I rode flight 5287 and Danielle was the rudest most unprofessional racist flight attendant I’ve ever met. She had a nasty attitude with me and my daughter like she hates her job. When you ask her a question she ignores you or gives a rude remark after she sucks on her lip stick smeared teeth. Not to mention this plane was hot and tiny in the middle of a pandemic. Awful experience and will never fly with them again.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,The WORST Of Any Flying Experiences,"I have flown many times all my life (close to around 75 flights including several international) and I have NEVER seen issues like I have when I flew with American. I got to the airport 2 hours before boarding. I had already checked in but needed to drop my checked bag. I get over the that part of the airport and I kid you not, there was at LEAST 350 people in line just for American and only 5 people working to get bags dropped between the regular cabin and priority lines. I was priority and there were only 4 groups in front of me and it still somehow took 2 hours of waiting. This was the first flight I ever missed, and upon rebooking the gate worker said 30 people also missed the flight. I had to rebook for the next day and everything was fine until we boarded, sat there for an hour, and had to deplane due to a computer not functioning properly.. I missed the connecting flight and didn’t get the premium seats that were paid for. Do yourself a favor and stay away from American. It keeps getting worse and worse"
Date of travel: December 2020,20,What's the point of having rules if you don't implement them.  Covid people.,So were suppose to be 6ft apart yet everyone was packed in there like sardines.  Customers didn't wear mask and attendants seemed to care less.  Just a terrible experience when we're all suppose to be trying to keep each other safe.
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Going the extra mile,"I just want to thank Joe, Pamela and the ticketing agent Brian, for getting me off to my destination, and making my flight so comfortable. This is a team of excellence."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,DO NOT FLY,"Let me tell you a story.. I booked a round trip flight to travel to New Hampshire, flying into Boston on the 18th departing at 3:15, for a meeting on the 19th at 9am. I have family there so I was spending the holidays since I was there already. Return flight was for the 28th.It’s December 18th (day of the flight), I go get some coffee at a local coffee shop in Dallas and leave my wallet at the outside table. Noticed it when I got back to my apartment. Made some calls, went back their to look, looked in the parking lot (mine and the coffee shops) no where to be found. Looked for three or four hours finally coming to the conclusion I won’t be able to board this plane with out my ID. So knowing this I call American Airlines 800 number and let them know I wouldn’t be able to make the flight at 3:15 and to put me on a later flight so I can have time to figure out how to get on the plane. With some google research I found you can get through TSA if you have your SSN card and a form to verify your identity(also later remembered DFW has CLEAR in terminal E so I would’ve been fine no matter what). The nice man on the phone helped me out and booked a flight later in the evening for 7pm which would arrive at 12am which works(maybe a little sleepy the next day but I’d make it besides it was my dumb mistake leaving my wallet behind). The catch was my round trip now had to be converted into a one way to make up for the difference in fare cost, oh and the seats I paid to upgrade for two of the flights would have to be refunded but they can’t issue a voucher because the site wasn’t working. But I would be getting a $100 or so e voucher back for what was left return flight I used to pay for this more expensive one way flight. He even said he placed me in an isle seat upon request because I am 6’4” and definitely need the room. (Usually this means your checked in when you’ve selected a seat)I get to DFW around 6pm (many would be worried about missing their flight but Becauae of COVID there’s barely anyone at security and getting through takes at tops 5 minutes right now). I get to the check in desk around 6:20 because I need to check a bag, and the (not so) very lovely lady told me I cannot check in and cannot check my bag because I am too late, which is sometimes the case showing up 40-45 minutes before departure(a gamble I don’t recommend taking if you like your shampoo and such) but I had no liquids I just had a backpack and a small suitcase and didn’t want to lug the suitcase everywhere so I wanted to check it. But I was too late, so I then see I myself am not checked in, so I go to check in at the desk. The lady now tells me I cannot check in, and am now on standby for tomorrow for a flight departing at 12:45pm.  Obviously frustrated, and upset after a long, stressful, and unfortunate day, I walked away and went back to my apartment. After I got back I called up American again and explained what happened and after thinking about it, not understanding why I wasn’t able to check in even though I had plenty of time to make the flight, and now not only being placed on a flight the next afternoon, but being placed on standby for a flight the next afternoon.I was greeted by a younger woman who understandably had some trouble reading through the reservation as it went from round trip to one way to being ‘missed’ to now on standby. She finally read through it all and told me the only thing I could do was pay an extra $200 something dollars to get a seat on the plane at 12:45pm the next day. Because that’s the difference in fares. I kindly explained what happened and wanted to understand why I wasn’t able to check in, and why I have no been placed on standby when I need to be in the plane and get to NH ASAP to now kiss some butt for being(a day) late. I also explained why I felt it was unreasonable for me to have to pay an extra $200 to make sure I get this seat when I have already had to exchange my round trip flight to a one way flight and for some unknown reason want allowed to be checked in.She told be that changing the ticket from the first flight at 3:15 to the second flight at 7:00 was a courtesy (even though in essence paid an extra $190) and was considered a ‘no show’ even though I called a few hours before boarding began. And then being bumped to standby the next day was a courtesy as well because I never checked in for the flight at 7:00 and was also considered a ‘no show’. After being told that i simply asked okay, so there is nothing you can do for me unless I pay another $200 and you don’t have a reason for why I wasn’t able to check in. And she responded with theres no other option. So that’s my story, hope you enjoyed. Remember, American lets you spend your money as a courtesy for you."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Outstanding service and hygiene the service was great very clean.,The service was awesome and super clean and sanitized environment. The fight attendant was great from Dallas to Yima.  Also space between passengers great.  Thank you AA.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Horrible,"have an N95 mask on. A mask that is the most protected for myself and people around me and the airline said I have to put on a different mask (the doctors mask) because the N95 doesn't protect anyone.......so I can either change it or cover the mask I had on, which made it impossible to breath. I can't begin to explain the anger over this idiocy!!! I hesitated and I began to argue but I wasn't about to be the one kicked off of the plane. American Airlines you are never getting my business again!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"First Class service is a rip-off. Basically, coach w a wider seat.","Flew BDL to LAX, round trip, in First Class. Not an upgrade, a purchase. The gate staff refused to allow me to bring a carry-out bag containing a CPAP and my insulin, taking it into the hold, saying it was too wide, as travelers w huge backpacks, duffle bags and larger luggage were allowed to bring them on board. This left me without insulin for a 5 hour flight, as they failed to allow me to retrieve it as some luggage ape grabbed it. Entered the plane, greeted w a plastic Ziploc bag containing a tiny water bottle and a cleaning wipe from the outstretched arm of a flight attendant, no greeting from her, however. After takeoff, was advised that ""lunch"" choices were a fruit and cracker ""plate"" or a turkey sandwich. Seriously. We were each delivered a clear, closed plastic container of grapes, cheese and crackers, a paper napkin, plastic forks and our drinks, tea and coffee, in small, paper cups. Breakfast on the return trip was even more embarassing. (See pics)Instead of retrieving our lovely food containers when finished, a flight attendant walked the cabin w a plastic trash bag for us to discard the containers into. Other passengers in our orbit suffered to same lack of service, and basically had to beg for drinks (served in little plastic bottles) or coffee refills. Attendants were not rude, but they were definitely not friendly, and seemed to not enjoy their jobs much. We have flown many different airlines in First Class, and always avoided American due to their reputation. We decided to give it a shot, and have determined we will never fly this airline again. It should be regarded as a discount airline w no discernible customer service. If you must fly American, don't waste your cash on First Class, you're better off flying in a dumpster. I've included a breakfast pic from Hawaiian Airlines as a comparison in the third shot.  Hawaiian First Class does it right, great service, flight attendants second to none.  The comparison should be embarassing to American Airlines. Shame on you for stealing customers cash in return for undelivered service."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,American's policy is to only serve themselves and not their loyal customers,"I was booked on the last flight getting me from Orlando to Charlotte. My meetings ended much early so I called the Platinum desk to see what earlier flights there might be, and they told me to go to the airport, which was where they should be able to make the change (any earlier flight was ""wide open"" for space). I have 2.5 million miles and lifetime Platinum status with the airline. Once at the airport upon check in the gate agent could not help even after checking with a supervisor because of their policy to not change flights, even though the earlier flight was ""wide open"" in terms of space, as it was company ""Policy"". She did suggest I try at the ""special services"" desk near my anticipated gate for the earlier flight. Their the gentlemen with a cold stare told me I would have to wait for the later flight, because he was unable to make the change because of ""policy"", unless I paid the $390 (more than my entire trip) change fee to get on a plane that was ""wide open"". He also informed me I would need to call the agent that booked it for me. I called the agent who asked me why American had not put me on stand by with my Platinum status. I had already asked the same question. The agent made the change for $250, and then when I went to the gate to get my new ticket, they informed me he had not processed the payment which I know had happened, and would not listen to the booking travel agent on the speaker phone, as they constantly interrupted him. So with minutes to spare he issued me a one-way ticket and then he sorted it out with American Airlines the next day. They of course were in error. So tomorrow I am flying back to Orlando, and once again my day will be ending earlier than anticipated. But today American Airlines has my original flight for tomorrow oversold, and wants to know if I would move to another flight. AMAZING HOW THEY CAN NOW MAKE THE CHANGE IN POLICY WHEN IT WORKS FOR THEM. I am disgusted with not just the policy, but with how a number of desk agents at the Orlando airport treated me. Even the supervisor would not hear me out at ""Special Services""... this department should be call ""Stick to Policy"" unless of course it might help out American Airlines. Forget about helping a customer who has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on flights. I do have to commend the flight crew who were very friendly. I had stopped using American for a while because of bad service, and since moving to Orlando I thought I would give them another chance. Well needless to say, I guess I will avoid the flights again with American. If this is how they treat someone who has flown a lot with them, I cannot imagine how they treat casual travelers.I have tried to submit compliments and complaints to American Airlines in the past, and have never heard back from them. I doubt I will hear from them this time either."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,The worst airlines in the world!,"When I fly American it always ruins my day because the service is terrible and the flights are terrible. When we boarded the plane they had us waiting in the plane for an additional HOUR before we took off. To make matters worse, they flew us in a stupid ass circle around DFW for 2 hours to then land back in DFW because the pilots forgot to check the gas before we took off. Then we waited for another hour and 12 min at the terminal until we were allowed to take off again. And the cherry on top was when they lost my bag. This is only one of many horrible experiences I’ve had with this airline. Just fly Southwest."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Extremely poor customer service!!,"I would never again recommend  American Airlines to anyone. I had the worst customer experience, they do not take care of their customers. There was a mistake in booking made by their own employee and they told me they were unable to reissue credit for this flight. BLOWS MY MIND!!! Extremely unpleased and horrible horrible experience. No one fly this airline unless you want to be robbed of your money."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,A miserable trip to Key West & Back,"They should of de-iced the plane a couple hours before loading, 3 hours on the tarmac sucks. Covid Virus I get it, but no drink or snack for the peons though 1st class gets a meal and drinks. Is it about safety or money? Social distance, wait to exit and seats will be released to maintain social distance but it’s ok to sit 2 feet from the two people in front, back, and side of you for a two hour flight. I asked to be seated with my wife to be safe from being around others. Out of 4 flights they put us together on one flight. If you really want to help keep people safe from this virus keep them together when they book. Covid Virus needs to be taken serious but come on let’s NOT have double standards."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,I hate flying with American Airline,"Extremely rude.Everytime my son flies out the ticket agent is always so rude. I get that they have to deal with a lot of people but if you hate your job find a new, don’t ruin someone’s day because you are having a bad day. I believe every single bad review. I’ll be making different travel arrangements going forward. They will not be getting another penny of my hard earned money."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,ASAP scam - American Air rescue,3rd party ASAP-Original Bk Oct 2020 was slightly changed by Korean Air cancel from ICN to MNL. ASAP discount tickets did nothing to reschedule and only issue tk with $200 per per fee 16 hours prior to departure.  At check in AA discovered 26 hr overnight was not legal.  AA rebooked me a few day later with easy transfers.   NEVER use ASAP.  We will book with AA even if slightly more cost.  Only airlines can help when things go wrong.Beware of ASAP (don't trust them)
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Are You Serious?,"I called to let them know I was bringing a puppy on the flight and they informed me I had to wait to book the puppy on the flight until I had a vet health certificate and vaccination records. I was able get into a vet last minute by some odds and I got the required docs. Then I called America Airlines back to add the puppy carry on fee and they said I couldn't and there was no room on the flight. She said I didn't actually need the documents and the person I spoke to the day before should have booked it that day. Because of this error, they made me cancel my current flight and book an entirely new flight the day before traveling. They offered no apologies, no help. AND I had to pay for an entirely new flight. Once at the airport, our flight was delayed 2 hours because they forgot to schedule a crew for the flight. THEY FORGOT TO SCHEDULE AN ENTIRE CREW FOR A FLIGHT!!  How does that happen?All in all, I will NEVER fly with American Airlines again and I would not recommend anyone to fly with them."
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Disappointing experience with baggage,"Very disappointed with American Airlines. When we arrived AA refused to check my bag. We arrived 35 minutes prior to departure and were told they stopped checking bags 10 min ago. The airport was completely empty, it was 5 am. We flew out of a small airport with a very quick security process. I then asked if I could go through security with my bag which was just slightly larger than a carry on and then check at the gate. They refused to let me do that. They said there was no other choice than to switch our flight. So my family and I sat around the airport for 4 hours until our next flight. There was no reason they couldn’t check my bag or take it at the gate. Disappointing experience."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Very bad service,"I have 3 days trying ti solve a problem with a trip to hawaii and they dont call me, there is no way to contact costumer relations, only by email. I just got a phone call from them and they even give me a extension number and they transfer me and hang up. Very dissapointes about this."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,BOYCOTT,"I dont do reviews but I had to for them. I've never met a company that cares so poorly for its customers. I usually use delta, jetblue or Hawaiian but my new boss bought the ticket. Ive never had a more horrible or stressful experience on a flight ever. And the list of bad press they have a astronomical. Why anyone would still use this airline astounds me. Apparently they lead in flight delays/just being late and bags being lost. A plus work. Very disappointed. Will never use AA and I will telling my boss to boycott them as well. Also, all my other business connections I will letting them know as well. The more ppl that dint use this airline maybe they will do something. On the flight I even read an article that said ""AA cares just not enough to fix anything"" something like that."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,WORST AIRLINE EVER,I thought United airlines sucked until i flew with American again. Never will i make that mistake again.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Terrible customer service,"The 2 women  checking us in at the Phoenix airport were very rude. I have never had an issue with my carry-on luggage being too large. (In was about a half an inch too tall. They gave the man ahead of me a diffucult time as well. I am not impressed with their customer service. I feel like in these times, am airline would want to be on their best behavior and treat their customers with great care."

Date of travel: November 2020,50,Short flight.  Good service ,Is a value paid a little more.  More space. Good service. Included licor and snacks.  Is only 2.30 minutes. . But enjoy
Date of travel: December 2020,10,So Upset,I specifically booked a later flight home so that we could enjoy part of our last day of our already short vacation. Now here I am the night before we leave rushing around packing because our flight got moved up almost 4 hours! I would be okay if they had moved us to a later flight but darn it some people have plans! I was not even notified that it happened until I went to check in for a our flight this afternoon. I’m so bummed.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Flight Change and seat down grade AGAIN!,We booked our flights in First Class months ago. The morning we were supposed to leave we got an email that our flight was changed. I called customer service becuase the last time we flew American our flight was changed and were downgraded to economy on one leg of our trip. It happened again! If I wanted to sit next to amstranger during COVID I would have booked my own economy seat (plus he took up my space as well as his own). American refunded us $111.00 each but it should have been more. Their customer service is far from service 😡
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Terrible service,"Our flight was canceled And the staff and manager refused to accommodate me in any way. I’m crying to the manager telling her I can’t afford a hotel for the night, and she called the sheriff on me. Will never ever ever book with American ever again. To say I am extremely displeased would be an understatement."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Worst Airline Ever!!,If I could give this airline negative stars I would. I am writing this review as I am sitting on the plane. Flight was supposed to leave at 7:05. We sat on the plane from about 6:30 to 8. They said there was something wrong so they had to get everyone off the plane. They then had to re book everyone's flight. Alot of people were not able to get a flight until the next day. This girl was supposed to go to Hawaii and the airline couldn't get her on another flight until 3 days later because she had to take another COVID test for some reason. Do then they fixed the plane and put those that were able to get to their destination back in the plane. So they got us on the plane at about 8am. We are still sitting on the runway 2 hrs and 15 minutes later. So so far we have been waiting on the plane for 3.5 hrs later. Took them so long to de ice the plane. Now I am probably going to miss my connecting flight. Absolutely horrible. Never again!! Stay away from this airline. I understand things happen  but this is absolutely ridiculous. I am for sure going to make a complaint to the actual airline. Most stressful flight ever. Again stay away from this airline!!!
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Disgusting service,"To start, they don’t even deserve one star. I am a physician and I was trying to get back to work (trying to help all those in need during this ruthless pandemic and then some) with my service dog. She is certified and has all her paperwork. Needless to say I was stopped at the gate before getting into the plane and told to step aside so that the staff could review my dogs paperwork.. I showed them her papers and they told me that they did not have any information about my dog and for that reason I could not get on the plane.. let’s start here1. My dog is 11 years old and has been traveling with me since she was born. So I am well aware of the rules and for the first 3 years of her life I paid for all her flights since at that time I did not need her as a service dog.2. In this situation I was told that I did not Pre-register my dog prior to my flight.. two points for this. — on the American Airlines website itself it reports that emotional support dogs need a 48 hour notice before their flights and that service dogs themselves do not need Pre-registration ( fine and dandy) — despite not needing to register my service dog I still called American one week prior to my flight and let SEC know I would be flying with her and I was told everything was in order. Well let’s keep going.. while standing in front of my gate the staff was extremely rude to me and told me they were going to close the gate on me since my dog was not in the system (again, not necessary since she is a service dog and not an emotional support dog). I attempted to call customer service and I was blatantly told they did not want to take the call. Can you believe that?They closed the gate on me and didn’t even offer to try to reschedule my flight for a later time or try to accommodate anything for something that was very clearly not my fault. I ended up having to drive 4 hours in a rental car in order to make it to the urgent care where I work. I worked my 8 hour shift, saw my 50 patients and wrote an email to customer service explaining my situation and how disrespectfully I was treated during the entire situation. The following day I received a phone call from an agent. She apologized and proceeded to tell me that it was basically my fault since my dog does not qualify as a service dog and that I did not call in advance ( when I did and my call log proves it). Also, my dog 100% qualifies as a service dog and it can be proved with paperwork ( however, it is my right to confidentiality and specifics are not required). I expressed to them what service my dog provides me and that is all they are allowed to ask of me legally. Yet despite this information she continued to tell me my dog did not qualify as a service god and that someone would contact me to ask further questions. Well that was 11 days ago and I have yet to hear from anyone since then. I wrote another email to customer service and again have yet to hear from them. Bottom line: I was disgusted by the way I was treated that day despite me doing everything correctly and speaking to all of them with the respect any human being deserves (regardless of how they treated me). Not only is American Airlines not keeping their word on social distancing ( no skipped seats and still filling the plane front to back) but they are also terrible at customer service, rude to their loyal clients (I’ve been using them for many years), and ruthless when it comes to extending a helping hand particularly in these times of need."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Worst airline ever,American Airlines is the worst airline you could possibly book though paid for insurance in case I canceled my flight had family issues pop up so I had to cancel it only for them to tell me it’s non refundable and that I needed to call the insurance company. Customer Service was the worst I’ve ever encountered they were rude and not helpful at all. No wondered they had to lay off majority of there staff. If you book a flight don’t book with American
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Don't fly with them,"Horrible. Plane was jam packed like Covid never happened. The funniest part is while you're sitting there with a mask on crammed in like sardines next to people you don't know they announce over the intercom ""please social distance 6ft apart while using the restroom"". lol (what's the point? you only get Covid while walking to the restroom?). Apparently the people sitting practically on your lap next to you, not 6ft apart don't have Covid."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Terrible Company!!!,"My wife and I were looking for flights up to Rhode Island to go see my dying grandfather for most likely our last Christmas together. When on American Airlines website I signed up for their promotional credit card, I signed up for the one that states they give a $250 credit. We signed up for this since we love to travel and want to travel even more. After the flights were booked and we received the receipt in the email and such.  I took screenshots of everything as I was signing up for my own records. I called in to see why the credit was not applied. The representative stated on a recorded line that it’ll be applied during the first billing cycle. Needless to say, I got my first bill, and it wasn’t there, I called into their customer care line and after getting transferred over 8 times to include being transferred to Best Buy and being on the phone for almost an hour and a half they said that the card issued to me was not the one where I get the credit and that there is nothing they can do. They are totally incompetent and refused to do anything to make this right. I am ready to cancel the flights and close the card and never fly with them again!!!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Ms.,"Ok. I am on this plane right now!!!! My God horrible, no SOCIAL distancing in sight!!!! They have us packed in like Sardines in an explodeable can!!!

Date of travel: December 2020,10,The worst service,I had a layover at O’Hara on the way back. I came across with a lady name Shannon. Shannon had bad attitude. She needs a lesson on Custer service.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Worst airline ever.,If you are buying flight tickets for a friend you need to be sure that he will go because if for any reason they are not able to go this airline does not give you a voucher but leaves you the flight in stan by so that you can activate it in the future for the same person. You can't use it for you who're the one to buy it. DO NOT BUY ON THIS COMPANY
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Covid changed fares offered till 2021,"Careful folks.  If you had to cancel your vacation or airline canceled you tickets for you you will get scammed by American Airlines.  When you re book your fare they will not find a similar fare to the price you have already had booked and paid for.  This way they will charge you a $50-$100 per ticket.  They will call it a changed fare with C.  This way its not because of Covid   Its because of you!  The customer fault!  Covid is our fault!  People they have to make their money back somehow.  Last time I use American, they don’t care about customers and their service is mediocre."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Terrible costumer service,"They changed the flight by 3 hours, not enough to get a refund but enough to make the flight time not work for me due to work. Called customer service where I was recited the policy of a 4 hour change requirement to get a refund and issued a travel voucher to use in a year with no options through their company that work with this trip. Terrible company that only cares about money. Cancelling my miles reward card and avoiding flying with them at all costs, I would recommend you do yourself a favor and do the same."

Date of travel: November 2020,30,Questionable Customer Service,"The seats were comfortable. However, they ran out of food selections so the fourth row got stuck with what no one else wanted. We were told that they routinely provide 16 meals -- 8 sandwiches and 8 pretty crappy cereal selections -- and no one ever wants the cereal. So, why does American continue this practice??? On top of that, we later saw one of the air stewards eating a sandwich -- doesn't seem right to save the good selection for himself. Everyone from economy used the front bathroom even though the flight was only half full in economy and there were several bathrooms in the back. Frustrating because you could not get in. Disappointing."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Anniversary trip - worst airline!!!,"Flight#1327We boarded and immediately there were 3 flight attendants that we so unbelievably rude to us. We went on vacation finally, for our anniversaries, and we were harassed, threatened and just treated with the upmost disrespect by the flight attendants. They came up to us constantly harassing us and threatening us that we would go to jail, for absolutely no reason. All we did was talk, that’s why they threatened us. They probably know we are Jewish and decided to hate us from the beginning. I have never in my life encountered the rudeness from flight attendants before such as this flight. Once We told them we want to sleep and to leave us alone , another attendant came up to us asking for our names. When we didn’t want to give it because we weren’t appreciating the harassment , he followed our passports on file and continued to stand there. The flight attendant with the biggest attitude , sandy and Laurent  , screamed across the plane while our friends and I were having a conversation and explained that we were disturbing everyone and in exact words, telling us rudely to take it down a notch. Instead of being professionals and coming up to us nicely and saying, do you mind lowering your voice a little because people are probably trying to sleep. We were watching them the entire time while talking, and no one complained they just made that up. She just didn’t like us at all. This is has been the worst start to what was supposed to be a relaxing , nice vacation for our anniversaries and they have ruined the entire flight. We couldn’t even speak the entire rest of the flight because they kept threatening us. They kept coming up to us when we said it’s over and we will be quiet , to tell us we are violating a law and we will go to jail. They also mentioned in the beginning of the flight that no one is allowed to take pictures of the flight attendants , or they will be sent to jail! I have never heard that on a flight in my life , EVER! It’s like they knew they were going to be disgusting before the flight even took off! What’s funny is that the disrespectful laurant came up to us video taping us while he was harassing us, and he was looking at us and making fun of us and telling every flight attendant something about us the entire flight! I can’t make this stuff up! I have never felt so uncomfortable in my entire years of flying. While doing all of this , at one point , we decided that there was nothing else to do but to go to sleep and there were 3 attendants continuing to speak about us and pointing at us, and one flight attendant told us word for word that we are not going to win this . Win what exactly ? We don’t come onto a flight to fight for our own pleasure. But for the flight attendants to continue speaking about their so called customers in front of their faces, is extremely unprofessional and disrespectful! It’s like their tactic was to try and push our buttons so we would fight back and get in trouble . At first we fought back because trying to explain to them that they were being so rude from the beginning , and the minute they threatened us and said we aren’t going to win this because we will go to jail if we continue speaking, Then we shut our mouths because we knew what they were trying to do. They continued to huddle in the corner last row and kept looking back at us and discussing a matter that in our eyes , was over . They also handed us a threatening warning letter. My husband want to sit in a row of 4 that was empty so he can sleep and because others were doing the same , and they made him go back to his seat. A guy behind us in the last row , went to sit in that same row 10 min later and they told him he can sit on the other side. It’s like they wanted us kicked off from the beginning. Honestly, between the 4 of us on the flight, we have flown for years on business and pleasure, and none of us have ever encountered such a horrifying experience. I will be going on Instagram and Facebook to let everyone I know that if this is the staff you choose, then it says a lot about your company . You simply don’t care about your customers whatsoever. That entire day was ruined because of that staff and if they won’t be fired, then the least you can do is train them and teach them manners. I have no words as to how a staff can treat their customers so disgustingly, it’s appalling."
Date of travel: November 2020,40,Flying during COVID,"We flew last year business class with AA and it was the best business class so far we experienced.This time we flew only Economy, because the flight duration was not that long to Jamaica. All 4 flights to Jamaica and back were good and I appreciate the crews making sure about mask wearing. The flight back from Charlotte to LA was really good, was an amazing board crew.Only thing is, that both times on the way to Jamaica and back our TSA was messed up, so that we were not even recognized on the way back when we wanted to enter in through Global Entry. We got help and all went well, good thing, but that was very weird and could have resulted in us missing our connecting flight home."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"When we arrived at the check-in counter, the airline representative stated that a balance of over $2000 was owed for our tickets and we would be required to pay the balance before being given boarding passes or allowed to board the flight. I explained to the customer services representative that these tickets were originally purchased and paid in full in February 2020 and due to COVID19, the original flight had to be canceled and rebooked. Since the rebooking, AA had also made flight changes on their end, the most recent change being in early November. The end result of said changes was two round trip flights paid in full plus two $130 refund vouchers for the difference in price of our original flight, which can be confirmed by review of our AA accounts.I did not volunteer to pay the balance as I had already received seat assignments and confirmation numbers as well as refund vouchers which further proved we had paid in full. Despite our pleas with the customer service agent and her Supervisor – David, we were told there was nothing they could do for us. It took over 1 ½ hours for these customer service agents to sort out the error in the AA system that was denying us boarding passes. When finally someone on the phone was able to walk David and the agent through voiding the error and permitting us access, it was too late.Prior to missing our flight, when David and the service agent realized the error was entirely on AA ticketing system,  we were told that if we hurried through security, David would notify the gate that we were on our way and he would check the oversized bag at the gate. We were instructed to take our checked bag through security (without boarding passes in hand) and that he would meet us on the other side to inform security of our situation and the reason for needing to take our oversized bag through. We rushed up to security and were forced to explain our situation again as David was nowhere to be seen. I declared to TSA that I had scuba diving gear, including a diving knife in the oversized bag. At that point, we were held up by TSA to investigate why we were bringing a knife through security. At that time, David finally did show up and explained to TSA that he had instructed us to bring our bag through. TSA forced me to forfeit my scuba knife before allowing us to leave security and proceed to run to our gate. TSA allowed us to ONLY forfeit the knife but explained to us that under any other circumstance and by protocol we would have been detained with SD Harbor Police. As you can imagine, this was extremely uncomfortable.When we arrived at our gate, it had already been closed and was preparing for take-off. We sat in the airport, defeated, demoralized, shaking, and crying about what we were just subjected to. To top off the ordeal, David walked away from us and blamed missing our flight on us bringing a knife through security. We had never intended to bring the oversized bag with scuba gear through security, it was supposed to be checked. This was no fault of our own, we were only doing what we were told to do after American Airlines had failed us.We were not given a statement describing our rights and explaining what to do if the carrier bumps you from a flight at no fault of your own. We were told by the customer service agent and by David that our only option was to write a letter to AA.com. Per DOT and 14 C.F.R. 250.9, the airline did not provide me with this information and should have.Additionally, according to 14 C.F.R. 250.5, as this was an international flight and ultimately arrived more than four hours after my original arrival time (Actually 24 hours hours later), I am therefore entitled to an amount equal to 400% of my one-way fare to my final destination.In addition to the flight costs, I was unnecessarily forced to forfeit my $100 diving knife, we lost out on one full day of a prepaid all inclusive vacation equal to $989 per dayPl, as well as an unnecessary expense of a $300 water taxi to get us to our destination after missing our scheduled embarkation.Please note, the only person who helped us while we were stranded without options in the airport was an AA manager named Dominique. He assisted us in getting on the flight the following day and was extremely apologetic for the mistakes on behalf of AA. He also told us that he would make notes on our account. Please see those notes for additional information and description of the events that took place."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"Terrible trip, terrible agents and policies","Booked with friend from San Diego, flight was San Diego to Phoenix to Maui,  Chose seats which were changed with no notice, no options.  Return trip Maui to Dallas, San Diego - booked San Diego to Phoenix with 50 min. between flights, was assured by agent that the trips would be connected even with different locator number and baggage would go straight through so didn't have to worry.  Check in night before only to Dallas, phone call to agent could connect San Diego but not Phoenix, had to do at airport.  Airport agent couldn't do, I would have to pick up and recheck baggage and go through TSA again - physical impossibility and she wouldn't cancel Phoenix portion.  Had to call AA to cancel and book and pay for different flight.  Took over 2 hrs. and AA still won't refund unused flight even though they booked and assured me it was ok.  Will NEVER use AA again, awful treatment!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,"Liars and not honorable, thieves",American Airlines should be ashamed of themselves their representative told me I would be getting a refund for my ticket difference and now there trying to tell me I am getting a voucher. To top it all off there's no contact number to get a refund and they keep responding to my emails with nonsensical replies. I would have never flown with them or changed my flight had I know they would not honor the words of their employees. Its just not right somebody needs to hold them accountable
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Great Flight. On-Time.,"It's hard NOT to have a good experience when traveling Business Class. The boarding was the only drawback. The gate assistant was difficult to understand. Due to COVID, everyone (whether traveling together or not) had to scan a QR code for the country of your destination. There, you had to fill out a online COVID questionnaire. Then, as you boarded, remove your face mask so they could scan your face and present your passport. The PRO was going through Mexican Customs was a breeze!The flight itself was wonderful. Departed on time and even arrived early. Smooth ride. No issues. Business Class you were served a meal and drinks. Economy class were only handed a baggie with small bottle of water, cookie, and sanitizer wipe.The flight was full - there was no social distancing between seats. Everyone was required to wear masks."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Irresponsible and inconsiderate,"During the pandemic, you would assume that this airline would not place more value on money than on human life, but I guess not.  We've flown Delta and they have a strict social distance policy where they skip the middle seat or have only one person to a set of seats. Not American! They had the entire plane full with every seat taken... no spaces, no seats left empty... nothing! I wish I had done my research prior to booking this flight but hopefully you'll read this prior to and make a better decision than I did. DO NOT FLY AMERICAN! Especially during this pandemic and if you're concerned about spreading the virus!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,"Customer Service is BAAAAAAAAD, employees are liars and thieves","Left something on the plane, asked AA employee to go back and check - after over 10 min she comes back with ""I couldn't enter the plane and check - the doors have been locked already"". This was absolutely a lie and I am 95% sure that she took the item...."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Money over customers,"Flight AA2731 is completely full with no spacing at all.  The plane was boarded from the front to the back.  Everyone is shoulder to shoulder like pre Covid and now we are all going to take our masks off to have a beverage.  Gov Cuomo would be screaming super spreader.  I can't have 10 people in my home or ask another family over for dinner, restaurants have to do outside seating and 25% capacity inside. Children can't sit on Santa's lap and can only see him 10 feet away behind glass like an animal in a cage and we can not see the tree in Rockefeller light up but American Airlines can pack you in like sardines.   The politicians wonder why people questions the guidlines."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Great customer service for wheelchair,"My husband stepped into sea urchins (both feet) and he could not walk, 2 days before we had to leave St. Thomas.  We had to fly from St. Thomas to Miami and then to Dulles.  The service provided by the AA crew in all airports was exceptional.  They were caring, empathic, and very accommodating!   Thank you AA for putting us at ease and making this a smooth flight home."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,The worst experience with an airline I have ever had!,"Not only was every single American Airlines employee beyond rude, extremely inappropriate, and disrespectful to the customers—- but my flight was delayed (keeping us on the plane) for 3 hours due to “mechanical issues.” We then deplaned and waited another 2 hours for a new plane (or so they told us). We got on the “new” plane and it was the same plane we had just gotten off of. (A chip I had dropped on the floor was still in the exact same place). After we got on the “new” plane the pilot refused to take off due to “mechanical issues” again— or because the plane had barley any passengers on it. So, after waiting on that plane for another 2 hours we were told to get off the plane again and run around the airport and figure it out on our own. Luckily, AA gave me a hotel voucher for the night. I was able to arrive at the hotel by 1:30am and was forced to leave by 5 am. This hotel (the Holiday Inn) reeked of cigarettes and dirt. 0/100 recommend flying on American Airlines. The has been absolute worst traveling experience I have ever had. I am disgusted with the lack of professionalism and inappropriate behavior of the employees. I have never been treated as poorly as the employees working for AA treated me and the rest of the customers."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Steal your money!!!!,"Had interjet flights cancelled, had to purchase my own tickets with aeromexico to get to Mexico city,  and refused after the flight to refund me saying I accepted the changes.  Told me good luck getting to Mexico city,  and I'm out 200 dollars.   Will NEVER recommend them,  can't believe they don't care at all about their customers.   They WILL leave you stranded,  don't fly American airlines!!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Awful,"Worst airline in the whole world. Employees are mean, nasty and rude. Blamed me For missing my flight When they had an line I waited in for 2 hours. Can’t believe how they spoke to customers and I will never ever be using this airline ever again."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,THE WORST AIRLINE THERE IS,"A tragedy of a company at SFO. After not accepting the way our initial negative COVID-19 PCR test results were shown on paper (despite our final destination's approval, and re-approval), they took so long to review our results that they literally closed the flight while we were standing there. Keep in mind, we had already been there for over 2hrs trying to explain that the test was valid, had already contacted our doctors emergency line and had them update it ONCE to the AA manager's original requirements, only to show the updates to them and for them to say that they needed something else... All this took so long that the flight closed, even though they originally said they would make an exception for us to board. Both managers at AA SFO are completely incompetent and impossible to work with.We called the local authorities at our destination today and had them confirm verbally, via their authorization portal, as well as via email that our original tests, as well as the ones we paid $500 each for were acceptable to enter the country.It's almost insulting as well that the managers at American Airlines joked about the validity of the local authority's authorization process - in order for us to enter the country, we have to submit a negative COVID-PCR test. Which we have done. The manager said that the process was not valid and the country just ""auto-approved"" every request they got. I raised this with the local authorities on a call today and they said that was totally wrong... I mean why have this whole process to just auto-approve everyone who submits?We have now paid over $1300 to get rapid COVID PCR tests and more, only to have no way to confirm with the airline if these will fly, even though we have written confirmations and confirmation from the CDC that these tests are valid COVID-19 PCR tests.On top of that, American has offered no compensation or other options, we are out as I mentioned over $1300, had to have our flights downgraded, 24 hours delayed, not to mention the rude staff and stress of it all. Save yourself the hassle and fly United or Jet Blue. Or literally anything else like Southwest or Delta. DO NOT BOOK ON AMERICAN AIRLINES if you can help yourself. The attitude of the staff is the LAST thing we all need in this extremely challenging year already.People like the managers at SFO American Airlines have something else coming for them. Fair warning to all future travelers."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Our 25th wedding anniversary-first time flying in 30 years,"It was our 25th wedding anniversary in June 2020 and our first time flying in 30 years. We had a great experience EXCEPT for our flight with American Airlines.  Multiple things went wrong. We booked our reservations to fly out of State College, PA.  We had it all worked out that are family was going to drop us off and pick us up at the airport.  Shortly before we left,  my husband just happened to check our tickets and that is when we discovered that our flight was changed  We never would have even known about this change had he not checked at the last minute.     AA changed our flight to leave out of Pittsburgh, PA which was 2 1/2 hours away.  We had to make the long drive and pay to have our car stored there.  The staff was not friendly  on the planeThe worst part about this trip was -the following   But first let me explain that we had purchased one ticket to go from PA to Las Vegas (staying for 5 days there)then out to LA to visit my brother--- then to return back home to PA.  We were suppose to have a non stop flight from Vegas to LA But they changed our flight AGAIN to have one stop ( layover between Vegas and LA)   What would have been a short flight was now going to take us 6 HOURS.  We discovered we could get to my brothers house in California with a rental car in 4 hours   much quicker than it would be to fly.  (When it is quicker to drive than fly that's pretty bad )  We chose to drive. The night before we were to fly out of LA to return to PA my husband called AA to confirm our trip home.   When he called we were told the tickets that we purchased were no longer valid and that we would have to purchase additional tickets costing and extra $1420.00 for my husband and I to get home.  AA said they cancelled the rest of our flight because we skipped a part of it.(to drive from Vegas to California)  We NEVER were warned that something like this could happen. We thought this must be some big misunderstanding and that if we spoke with a supervisor at AA that they would for sure fix this and that they would gladly put us on another flight home for NO additional charges.  WRONG American Airlines said they would get us another flight home but it would cost us an extra $1420.00 which is more than we paid for the original tickets.   Are they SERIOUS?  AA couldn't get us  flight home at either a low or no cost flight??  We already had been so inconvenienced by them   They just wouldn't work with us at all----  I just wanted to cry.  Pay American Airlines an additional $1,420.00??? just to get home when we already bought tickets to go home that they would NOT honor   We weren't going to give American Airlines another dime !!!!      The good news is we  ended up flying home with Spirit Airlines--  for HALF the cost and it was a NON stop flight  AND the staff was so nice on the flight and the pilot actually spoke to us over the intercom with updates on our flight.  A great experience with Spirit .  The bottom line is---That  its not so much that multiple things went wrong with our flight   What I'm really complaining about is that they refused to make right on their wrongs.  If American Airlines would  have offered us even a partial refund to help cover the extra unforeseen expenses that they caused us to incur or even offered us another flight out for another time we would have been SATISFIED and we would have continued to fly with them.  Now they lost our business and  I plan to warn as many friends and family as I can ."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,NOT taking care of their patrons!!,We flew to Jamaica on Delta and our return trip was American Airlines - all during COVID.  American airlines has not taken any steps to make sure that people are safe other than wearing masks.  The plane was dirty the stewardesses RUDE and the plane so so freakin packed it was just nuts!!
Date of travel: December 2020,10,I choose Delta over American airlines,On this trip we had a chance to fly using both airlines.  American airlines was not as friendly and welcoming as Delta. The professionalism was very low quality because it seemed like the flight attendants were bugged when someone asked for assistance. Two out of the five screens that we had were working. Even the early check-in process was much more of a hassle than with Delta. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TOPPED IT OFF WAS THE WAY OUR LUGGAGE WAS TREATED BY THE BAGGAGE CLAIMS AT THE PHOENIX AIRPORT. THEY SLAMMED IT DOWN SUPER HARD AND DENTED OUR NEW LUGGAGE. So all in all we will not be using American airlines and for sure not reccomend American airlines to anyone. CHOOSE DELTA AIRLINES WAY BETTER AND CLEANER!(I could say way more about AA)
Date of travel: December 2020,10,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE JUST B.A.D,"American Airlines sucks. I have been an AAdvantage member for 3 years and, not sure what happened, but the customer service is just inconsistent. If you have an issue and call their customer service line, you wait 20 minutes. Then go back and forth between agents who want to help and those who could care less. Finally get help, get on flight(after missing flights unwillingly), purchase wifi, and the restrictions to wifi are very unclear(along with basically everything else about their policy). Just bad. Go to Delta if you have the option, I BEG YOU. Flight attendants have no patience, pilot is not warm or welcoming. Not sure what happened but employment sucks here and be prepared for a dismal and overall unhappy flight. DELTA DELTA DELTA IS THE ANSWER. I have never even flown Delta before! But on a flight with my friend, they give free earbuds, are friendly, and spacious! Go to Delta, American Airlines is crap. Don't waste your money no matter how good the price is."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Not following their own COVID rules.,Beware COVID 19 recommended precautions are only followed up to the point of beneting the airline. The flight attendant has her loops on the bottom of her mask cut and it is just flapping around. Terrible double standard and they are packing flights.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Customer Service,"Their customer service is so disappointing I do not know where to even begin. I'll sum it up as quickly as possible. We needed to refund our tickets. They made us cancel our flight in order to request a refund. Then, THEY DENIED IT?  So,  we asked them if we could please just have our original tickets back. To which they replied, you'll have to pay the difference?!?!So they have you cancel your flight without telling you, there is no chance you will get your money back!!NEVER FLYING WITH THEM AGAIN."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Never fly AA,"My flight in Delta was cancelled last week  so they booked me in AA instead 11/27/20 Thanksgiving to attend a wedding in La Romana. During this covid times, the plane was so packed ,you're on top of each other,and they were boarding from first class to back, So it means there's no covid matters anymore, all infected people get to pass by you.  I can't wait to shower once i got into the hotel, just horrible experience . I am so used to Delta with middle seats blocked even Jetblue"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,They Cancelled and No Refund,"I bought a $1,200 plane ticket with insurance. Half the flight was cancelled due to COVID 19 and they are only issuing $800 back of the $1,200 I paid. Customer service is extremely rude and give zero help."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,American Airlines - an embarrassment to the United States,"With service this unapologetically rude and uncivilized, I imagine the disgruntled staff at American Airlines have only one outlet for their fury with the company: unwarranted aggression against the customers.Do the airline staff want their company to go out of business?  Presumably. Dear American Airlines, Please stop making us look like a backwards joke to the rest of the world, and retire your unkempt wings.  You're truly an embarrassment to our nation."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,American Airlines worst air line,Worst carrier at worst airport Was waiting for luggage 1.5 hours and no one to talk to When checked in they couldn’t properly check me in they had some issue with system and almost missed flight
Date of travel: November 2020,10,kicked out of flight,"I had attended flight AA#1309 Nov 17 2020 TIME: 4:30 FROM FLL TO PHL .My service dog had attended the flight with me, once we got on the airplane on the first seat was a little brown poodle barking at my dog , my dog had sniffed him the flight had shouted at me “ CONTROL YOUR DOG “ I didn’t not answer and I had continued to my seat . Once I had sat down the flight attendant named Mrs. Damino or Damindo from LAX past by I told her is my dog controlled now? She had replied “ you are looking to make a fuss if you want to fight we can talk outside – ( as a threat) and that I will be getting off this flight” She had called security to come take me off the airplane   I had explained to them that I need my luggage they said they cant bring it to me that it will be going to philly  I had to tell them that I need my medication with me only then did the agree to bring me my luggage and on top  of that they sent one of them to phily. Before I left the airplane I asked her what her name was she did not answer me the other flight attendant that seemed to be securing her as if I would have done something to her to me that they will not give it to me . I left this airplane crying my heart out because I was humiliated  if front of everyone on the plain I was threatened  and most of all saying the my dog id out of control ? ! not true I have a video of him lying down and sleeping the minute we sat down. All of the employees on ground at aa in fort lauderdale where amazing the manager Gayle came and spoke to me I had her look at my dog she had said that he is so calm and such a good dog that she does not know what she was talking about  that she is very sorry for what I went through and she will report exactly what she saw ( which was completely different from mrs DAMINO  from LAX. )All I can say is that was the worst flight I have ever attended in my life. I have not heard  a word BACK from AMERICAN AIRLINES"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,?,"Worst ever airline, terrible service, damaged my luggage and took no responsibility for it.  Terrible company!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Mask spies in the skies,"Americans beware spies in the skies !  and our freedom taken away , in such minuscule ways... that a Herd type mentality of the average human is not paying attention.so ugly and terrifying in the mannerism of his actions, I’m with mask on and as my head falling back to sleep my mask slipped just below my nostrilsThe steward was walking down the aisle as my mask slipped and he scolded me in the most rude facial expression as a look of terror, as if  I intentionally allowed my mask to slip.Upon my return home flight trying to check in my boarding pass would not load on my phone? This was oddMy ticket was taken off the system.The Customer service attendant had to make a callAnd it then become obvious they had reported the mask incident ,tried not to allow me back on the plane.I had to answers questions and state I would wear my mask the entire time .... then a bell went off ... we are being spied on.It’s funny ... the stewardess going through the safety rules mask slipped off her nose also as she was making her way through the oxygen mask.. she was t thrown off the plane ?I will never fly American Again Horrible attitude unnecessary behavior and terrible customer service."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Zero stars for customer service,"If you’re looking for AWFUL customer service at a premium price then American Airlines is for you. I traveled first class and the overhead compartment was too small to carry my small duffle. No big deal, you could tell the plane was a quite vintage for most airlines. They checked my bag at valet and when I got it back after one flight, my bag was broken and I could barely even carry it. I went to the “customer service” office just to be told that it wasn’t their problem and literally told to leave. After leaving the airport I tried calling American’s customer service office (thinking they would be more helpful) just to be treated with the same terrible service. The only thing they kept saying was “there’s a policy.” Apparently their policy is not caring at all when they are the ones at fault. I’m absolutely appalled that a company can have such an apathetic attitude to their customers personal belongs or how their customer was treated. Thankfully Delta Airlines doesn’t treat their customers that way and I will remember that the next time I’m booking a flight."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,The worst,Missed second flight because when we landed there was another plane in our terminal. American refused to get us a hotel because they blamed the weather even though it was their fault. Forced my toddler and pregnant wife to spend the night in the airport
n/a,50,Time is the issue,Not alot of options for short flights.  Most are over 12 hours and the shortest one that isn't direct has a really short layover that you may have to run to get to your next flight and they are really early.  Lose a whole day traveling there and back.  They are getting to keep all safe but people don't listen.  But they are trying
Date of travel: November 2020,10,My flight was cancelled and AA will not give me a refund.,I booked a flight with AA and they cancelled my flight and booked me on a different flight that was leaving over 3 1/2 hours later and I could not do that because it would make me miss my other plans.  I called and they told me that I would get a refund because the change was over 90 minutes but I got an email telling me that I would only get a credit.  I called and they said that the time difference now has to be more than 4 hours.  I checked with other airlines and they are saying 90 minutes.  Don't book with AA because they are saying they can change your whole trip and there is nothing you can do about it.  After I use this credit I will never book with them again. I am checking that my flight was in November but it was to be in December 2020.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Thanksgiving,I got kicked off a flight and delayed over 4 hours AFTER I complimented the flight attendant. She got mad i made a snap chat of taking off and returned the plane to de board me. I will NEVER fly American again. I’ve never flown them and I will happily pay extra to avoid them next time. Idk where customer service was thrown out the window just because it’s a federal entity. You’re A business and expected to provide services just like the rest of us. I had 3 white authoritative workers escort me (which i am of Latin decent) escort me off the plane. I feel incredibly targeted as a women of color and I will NEVER fly or recommend American Air to anyone I know ! When you are polite and follow the rules you should not be victimized. Don’t fly them. It’s a dice role if you’re allowed to fly or not depending on the crew. RACISM!!!!!!
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst fly ever,"I took a plane to Havana on November 21st. I was supposed to depart at 9:45 am. I boarded the plane at 9. At 9:45 the captain said that the fly was overweighted, so they asked for two volunteers to get down with a compensation voucher. Well for those two people the rest of the plane had to wait till 12:00 pm because the crew didn’t find the baggage of those people. Moreover, they only gave a cup of water and two cookies meanwhile. It was a disaster,"
Date of travel: November 2020,30,Unprofessional but you get to your destination,"Very unimpressed with the Philly based crews. To and from PHL attendants were on their phones constantly, not paying attentions to customers much at all. I asked if there was a closer seat to my husband and the attendant did not give me the time of day. With other airlines I’ve noticed they give above and beyond service if able. (Or they find an alternative option). On the way to PHL the Steward had his air pods in the entire time!!! So unprofessional. And he was not approachable because he just seemed to hate his job. I’m not sure if these two flights are a good representation for all of AA or just PHL but I don’t think I will choose to fly with them again. I would call this “gas station service”. You get your gas but you would only go there if you had too."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst airline service  in America,Always a delayed flight then miss the second flight that they know is coming in late. This happened flying both to where I was going and back home as well.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Flight 4696,"If I could give 0 stars I would. The man across the aisle from us didn’t wear his mask nearly the entire flight. When he first took it off he did so under the guise of eating a snack. You know fine, 5 to 10 minutes maskless for a snack, not ideal but fine whatever. But this gentleman just kept his mask off. We are mid pandemic and in an enclosed space. I hate wearing a mask as much as the next person. My face itches and my skin breaks out from them, but I wear them because I respect my fellow travelers. The flight attendant passed him many times and didn’t say a thing until we were able to get her attention after like the third time passing and asked her near landing. I expected more from you American Airlines."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Item stolen out of bag; AA denied claim; Never Trust!,"My 18 yr old daughter flew home 11/24/20 for the holiday and had her brand new lacrosse stick/shaft stolen out of her bag; Call today from Takeyon saying claimed was denied b/c the bag itself was rec'd undamaged and we would have to go through our personal insurance (or the colleges); Not only did it take over an hr. at 11 at night to find someone to file a claim (I was told she couldn't leave the airport until she did so) but I (mother) called baggage day prior and spoke to Eric who assured me that we could put in checked back; I also instructed my daughter to check bag at counter vs kiosk to again make sure it was ok b/c again this item was extremely important to her; This is a custom stick that her college just released  10-2020 and therefore not easily replaceable; It is roughly 35"" long with Camels all over it so also not something that just falls out without being noticed.  Bag was fully zipped when she retrieved in Syracuse and no TSA card so clearly was REMOVED by someone in AA. We have never had a claim with any airline and are (were) rewards members.  Shame on you American Airlines for taking advantage of our family and not living up to your standards; This is truly unbelievable!!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Pure Laziness,"WOW  What can I say.  Left Fort Wayne with two attendants.  One sat in the back and played on his phone and yelled at people who used the restrooms' to make sure the door was closed when you were done.  I only saw him twice walk the cabin.  The second did all the work.  No water the 2 1/2 hour trip.  The second flight the attendants at least gave out some water when you entered the plane.  However the plane was so hot, I couldn't wait for it to land.  They turned the air-conditioner on when we started to land in LAX.  I flew Delta a few months ago.  They were so much better.  I guess I go back to Delta."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Never fly American Airlines ,"My God! This was my first flight since 1996 and I must say it was the worse ever! We took three different flights over this past week. The first flight leaving out was the only clean flight. You could smell the cleaner while boarding the plane. The bad thing is, the seatbelts didn’t work and this was no concern at all to anyone employee! Not acceptable at all! Coming back from our trip, neither plane was cleaned before boarding new passengers, crumbs were in the seats, seatbelts didn’t work again and someone had left their identification in the seat next to us that had just got off the plane! To top this off, when we finally received our luggage in Charlotte, after checking it due to a connector flight, someone from that Charlotte terminal took the time to take my husbands address sheet off of our luggage! They took the time to take the plastic off and remove that part and that part only! Very questionable! When we asked about this and if this was normal the guy said not unless TSA went in your luggage. He checked out locks and they had not been tampered with and he too said that was strange. We will NEVER fly with American Airlines again and if you care about your safety you will not either! If I could give them zero stars I would!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Corona Virus transporter!!,"This was THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!I will never fly with this airline again during this pandemic. Their concern for revenue supersedes their concern for the health of mankind. It’s disheartening to see that there are businesses taking negatively taking advantage of this unprecedented crisis that were facing. In addition, it’s disappointing that the airport and the CDC haven’t done anything pertaining to their complete DISREGARD FOR PEOPLE SAFETY!!This airline doesn’t enforce the CDC Guidelines to limit/reduce the spread of the deadly disease COVID-19. I wish I would’ve know this prior to boarding the plane, I would’ve canceled my flight. They cram people on their plane as if there is no need for social distancing. I don’t remember seeing any empty seats on my flight, it was jammed tight as if we were sardines in a can. I couldn’t move without touching the passenger next to me. No open seat in the middle like the previous reviewer stated. They fill up their 3 row seating. There’s so much more to be said pertaining to this airline handling of this pandemic but as the previous reviewer stated AMERICAN AIRLINES seems to simply don’t give a CRAP/CARE. If you care about your health, pleaseeeeeeeeee seek another airline. AMERICAN AIRLINES ARE TRANSPORTERS OF COVID-19! RUN AWAY AND SAVE YOURSELF."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Covid 19 UNSAFE!,"There was a lot of talk about trying to be covid 19 safe and social distancing by American Airlines staff.  However, It is clear that American Airlines puts profit above passenger safety as evidenced by how packed the plane was on that flight.  As far as the passengers being packed on the plane there was NO covid 19 safe procedures in place!  There might have been three empty seats on the entire plane. So much for social distancing. I flew Delta airlines the first leg. It is evident that they are actually trying to keep their passengers safe. I will avoid American Airlines like the plague from here on out.  You do not care about your passenger’s safety.  If this is the case with covid, it's probably mirrored in your maintenance."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Frustration through the roof,I was very frustrated when I went to meet my connection flight and a pilot rushed off the plane while I was walking on the plane with others. The pilot looked at me and said we are not taking that plane. I saw the frustration and stress in his voice and eyes. They then said their was plane issues so they delayed us(witch is fine because it happens). They then lied about the new time that we would be boarding the new plane 3 times. They kept saying soon we will be boarding but never did. I have seen many reviews that people have experienced the same thing.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,NEVER AGAIN — Customer Service is non existent — level of incompetence is impressively high... 🤯,"Literal sh*t show.  Not a single flight booked was one we traveled on, not a single bag checked went on the same journey as we did.  Gate agents at 3 separate airports were rude beyond belief, supervisors just as bad, flights late with no explanation, refusal to notify connecting gate that we were off the plane and on our way (literally was being yelled at that we had 20 seconds when the gate agent could SEE US barreling down the terminal).  I mean not a single part of this experience was redeeming.  Called and was hung up on every time with no understanding of the inconvenience. Customer Service desk at airport is not manned.  Had to have a gate agent from 7 gates down call and have someone come to assist me after waiting 25 minutes (mind you, terminal is FULL of passengers).  They simply do NOT care.  Return flight was changed without notifying us to a flight leaving at 8:00am (original was 11:34am), again NO notification.  I noticed it when I went to check into the flight the previous day.  Now have a 3.5 hour layover in DFW.  Never would have booked that... asked to be put on Stand By for earlier flight and was told that I MUST TRAVEL WITH MY BAG... ummm, since when?  Didn’t travel with my bag on the way here, you all made sure of that.  Got it 13 hours after landing.  Don’t really think it’s a MUST.  I just can’t even.  I think we are in shock from this being acceptable... and consistent.  How?"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Terrible Policies,"American refuses to budge on their flight credit policy despite the circumstances. I paid for a trip four my wife and 3 friends for their Equestrian team Finals. After the trip was cancelled due to COVID-19, I was partially reimbursed the money to be used within a year. But the catch is that I cant actually purchase any flights for myself as I wasnt on the original flight ticket. So im stuck here with 1500 dollars in flight credit that I cant use for myself, only a portion can be used for my wife, and the other members of the team won't pay me back or use the tickets. American has been very robotic about their policy and seam to not care about the customer at all. Its simply not unreasonable to have the peron who paid for the tickets take ownership of the credit. Ive been trying my best to like them and even offered to pay for name changes, but they declined. Unless someone from American comes to their senses, I will never fly American again and always associate them with the worst airlines I've ever dealt with."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,American Airlines has lost a customer,"I was traveling from Las Vegas on American Airlines to Philadelphia on Nov 23, 2020.  Myself and my friend were scanned in and walking towards the plane when they told me the needed to check my baggage. I replied that it was fine but needed to grab my jewelry out before hand which I did.  We got the carryon tagged for them to put under the plane and were then told that she needed to check her bag too because there was no more room on the flight for her carryon. So went through the process again. They had two more people get scanned onto the plane which were on standby.  At this point, they told my friend to get off the door and closed it and said we missed the flight but already had us scanned in.  They gave away our flight tickets with us technically scanned onto the flight at the gate! They then proceeded to try to take all the luggage tags from the bags and would not return the tickets that they had scanned and taken at the gate.  I have never been so upset in my life.  I have never been so disrespected and demeaned by customer service representatives from American Airlines before. Amy, the representative working the counter came up yelling at me about how we were refusing to check our bags which was a bold face lie because we had bag tags on the bag already.  When she realized that her lie didn’t add up she ripped the tag off the bag and I asked if I could have it back for proof that we were not refusing to check our bags.  She flat out said no.I was told to contact customer relations if I had a problem.  They customer relations do not have a number, just an email and they just sent an email stating that they apologize for any inconvenience but there is nothing they can do!  They don’t seem to have investigated anything or make certain that the people involved were written up for their poor behavior.  I am so appalled by how this was handled and I hate to bring race into it but this never happens when I’m with my white friends.  I’d had friends who had to do similar things upon checking a bag and they were given help to push the process along.  Apparently we were worth the same customer service. The least American could do would have been to refund that flight."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,BAIT AND SWITCH!!!,"We were returning from my daughters wedding. We chose our flight because it got us home in 4.5 hours. Not only did they change out selected flights TWICE, but it ended up taking us nearly NINE hours to get home! I will never fly w them again!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Unorganized,Overbooked and made me miss my entire plans. There was no advice and no help on the matter. Felt like my fault when it cleary wasnt
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Never flying American airlines again,"Worst airline ever, we got a email in the morning saying that flight is delayed and then it actually wasn't delayed and we got later flights then we were supposed to have"
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Best experience EVER!,Check in was a breeze on both ends... both going and coming...flights left on time..and arrived early in both cases. Totally pleasant experience... KUDOS~~~
Date of travel: November 2020,20,Covid Quality,"I am not one to leave a review, good or bad, its just not something I generally do however this time I felt obligated to share. Let me also say that I know these are weird times- everyone is doing their best to make adjustments to CoVID and I do completely understand and try my best to follow the rules. These flights were booked well in advanced, like months a head of time. We left on a Thursday (flew Delta - incredible flying experience) and came back that Sunday (flew AA- not so incredible). 3 days before our trip, I receive a notice that our itinerary has been changed. Times, connections, the whole 9. 1. Sh**box of a plane - I do not know how else to explain it. Dirty and extremely unorganized. Second plane way nicer2. flight schedule, time and layover all changed. Now leaving first thing in the morning from MSY now have a ridiculous 2 hours layover in PA only to get on another plane to reach our destination at PBI. (this was an all day event)3. Had to check my bag in line to board which I dont see how that is possible if everyone can only have a personal and 1 carry on?!?!We paid full price for less than sub par service. Did I get from point A to B - sure but with everything going on in the world today and travelers recommended to stay home, you would think the airlines would aim to take better care of the travelers who are CHOOSING to fly with them."
Date of travel: November 2020,40,Pleasant Flight,"American Airlines Flight 2820ORD-PDX8:25-10:56 am Boeing 737-800My wife and I recently took a flight on American from Chicago to Portland, Oregon, after connecting in Chicago from Philadelphia. Similar to our earlier flight that morning, the flight was very much a standard experience for a flight on American during the pandemic. The flight was totally fine and pretty unremarkable. The flight boarded right on time, and flight attendants handed out hand sanitizer wipes as we boarded, along with a bag that included a package of Biscoff cookies and a mini water bottle.  We were also happy to find that even though American is not blocking middle seats like some of its competitors, the flight wasn’t full, and we had our own row to ourselves. Since this flight was over 4 hours long, we had purchased Main Cabin Extra seats with extra legroom toward the front of the economy cabin, which I’m glad we did. Although I was not particularly impressed by the amount of “extra” legroom that these seats had for the price (I think some other airlines, such as JetBlue, may have an equivalent amount of space as their standard legroom), it was definitely more comfortable than if we had been sitting in standard economy seats. Despite the Boeing 737-800 not having the most generous legroom, I did appreciate that the seats had both full outlets and USB plugs for easy charging during the flight, and the phone/iPad stand at the top of the seat came in handy as well.  We left the gate a few minutes early, quickly took off, and made it to Portland about 10 minutes early. The pilot initially said that we would probably be late arriving in Portland due to bad weather along the way, but said they would do their best to go faster, and I appreciated that this actually happened. Wifi was available on the flight, with several entertainment options offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight using the free portion of the wifi.Other than the cookie/water bags given during boarding, there was no service on this flight. I understand trying to limit contact and service during the pandemic, and I was glad we were given something, but I think it would have been appropriate to at least come around one other time to offer more water bottles or cookies based on the length of the flight. The flight attendants were coming around constantly to pick up trash, so it’s not as if they wouldn’t have been able to give out more water as well.The flight attendants did make several of the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and they were pretty forceful about it, which I appreciated. Most passengers around us were relatively compliant, although some people were definitely stretching the allowance to take off their masks when “eating or drinking.” When we landed, the flight attendants instructed everyone to stay in their seats after the seatbelt sign was turned off so that passengers could de-plane row-by-row and not clog the aisles. Everyone did listen, so I was glad we had a very civilized process of disembarking the aircraft.Overall, this flight from Chicago to Portland was good, with standard service from American. The plane was clean and the flight was early, with enough space for us to spread out. Other than feeling like seats were a bit tight, even in Main Cabin Extra, we were comfortable enough and had a pleasant flight."
Date of travel: November 2020,40,Standard American Airlines Flight,"American Airlines Flight 1253PHL-ORD6:00-7:30 am Boeing 737-800My wife and I recently took this early morning flight from Philadelphia to Chicago O’Hare before connecting on to another AA flight. Everything about the flight was very much average in terms of service and experience we’ve had while flying on American during the pandemic. The flight was totally fine and pretty unremarkable. We arrived at PHL about an hour before the scheduled 6:00 am departure and had no wait or difficulty when checking our bags using the self-tagging kiosks in the Terminal B/C check-in area. The Terminal B security checkpoint was very deserted at that time of day as well, so we were through the line quickly and off to the gate for boarding. Especially in the early morning, we’ve been finding that PHL is very dead now as compared to pre-pandemic flying.The flight boarded right on time, and flight attendants handed out hand sanitizer wipes as we boarded, which are nice to have while traveling.  We were happy to find that even though American is not blocking middle seats like some of its competitors, the flight wasn’t full, and the two of us had a full row to ourselves. Since the flight had several extra empty rows, flight attendants were also helping spread out and re-seat passengers to promote physical distancing. We left the gate almost 10 minutes early, quickly took off, and made it to Chicago about 20 minutes early, all of which was great. However, I did find the aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, to be one of the less comfortable AA aircraft I’ve been on. While the seats themselves are of a standard comfort level, legroom in standard economy definitely felt more cramped than on some of American’s Airbus aircraft that we’ve more commonly flown on in the past. However, I did appreciate that the seats had both full outlets and USB plugs for easy charging during the flight, and the phone/iPad stand at the top of the seat came in handy as well. Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and prepare for our connection in Chicago. There was no service on this flight, which was announced at the beginning. I don’t understand why they didn’t offer the little bags with a snack and water bottle in them that are handed out while boarding other AA flights, since it takes no time at all to hand them out, and there would normally have been drink and snack service on a 2.5-hour flight before the pandemic. The flight attendants did make several of the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and I didn’t see any non-compliance from passengers, so I felt safe on this flight. I would have liked if they had made an announcement asking passengers to disembark row-by-row when we got to the gate in Chicago, but they didn’t, so people jumped up as usual to clog the aisle as soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off.Overall, this flight from PHL-ORD was perfectly fine, with standard service from American. The plane was clean with enough space for us to spread out, and we made it to Chicago early, giving plenty of time to make our connecting flight."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Customer Service horrible,The airline stopped service to my initial destination and updated my itinerary to 3 hours away from original destination.The airline was unwilling to give any compensation even though this would add transportation costs which i had none with original destination and added 6 hours of travel time for a 3 day trip.Due to the fact i am visiting someone it involved coordinating time off from both our jobs so cancelling for a refund was not an option as we already had specific plans as this is a reunion with someone I have not seen in over 20 years..This was poorly handled and no compensation or future credit was offered for the inconvenience and extra costs..Would not recommend unless your ok with airline changing destinations on you
Date of travel: October 2020,10,"No flight, no help",We arrived to the airport and because of various schedule changes and cancellations somehow ended up without a flight. I still don't understand what happened after 3 phone calls and several emails plus whatever explanation the check-in agent tried to give. Part of the problem is that we bought the ticket through a travel agency and they didn't inform us of flight changes. They gave a refund to the travel agency but the agency is only giving us a partial refund. AA can't tell us how much they refunded the agency and have been no help in this process.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Unhappy person who couldn’t make his business trip,"I booked a flight with Christopher and he told me no passport needed to fly to Mexico. When I got to the terminal my flight was canceled due to no passport. Then the lady told me to call this number for a refund. When I called it the guy said I had to do the process online and that the lady only gave me the number so I would leave and they could help other people. This was an important business trip that I got canceled because of lies. I will never book a flight here again, I will rent a car and drive"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Horrible experience,Worst airline I’ve ever traveled with. Everyone is rude and do not know anything. They are very unprofessional and unorganized. Would not ever travel with them again.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Don’t fly with these con artists,"I booked a flight from London to Montego Bay Jamaica via Miami, 3 weeks before my flight. I was called by a AA representative 4 days before my flight to be told about authorisation form I had to fill in ASAP. We ran through my details of what passport I held and said all was fine. 24 hours before my flight I was called by another AA representative and asked questions. She then said I might be able to fly, I told her I had spoken to someone and all was fine. Then told I’ll get a call back to confirm from a supervisor. I got no call my phone reception was perfect. When checking in my passport was taken and I was asked the purpose of travel, I told them it’s work related and confirmed in Jamaica. To be told I can’t get on the plane and will only get a airline credit to use this year.  I asked if they knew when I could fly they said they don’t know. So they have no obligation to help me or give me my refund. I felt let down recently by airlines wanting peoples money knowing they won’t be going anywhere regardless of approval from your destination. I have lost a lot of money due to this and will be set back until they allow non US citizens to use their services. Anyone reading this please understand your travel plans will be messed up and you will get nothing back for your lost time and money."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,DON’T fly American Airlines,American Airlines does not respect social distancing guidelines like their competitors do. They pack a plane for and you end up sitting next to somebody coughs all the way there. Delta and Southwest still utilize Covid guidelines. American Airlines shows no respect for their passengers and customers – do they want to kill them all?
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Don't use!,"Do not use. I have used AA for two round trips. I got stranded for 9+ hours in airports longer than I was suppose to be for three of the flights because of delays or maintenance issues. They won't refund my very last ticket from my round-trip even though I ended up not using it because one of their employees told me the wrong gate number and cost me to miss my flight back home. They expected me to sit in the airport for 12 more hours until the next flight they had. I went to claim my luggage at the airport when I finally got home and realized my luggage case was broken when I got home. I called to complain and they basically told me I should have reported ut at the airport, but I didn't even notice at the airport 'cause I wanted out as quick as I could 'cause I was done with that place. Never flying AA again. I really don't think anyone should."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst Flights to fly on,"American airlines are the worst flights when it comes to flying experiences. This is the second time I am flying in these flights and my flight is 6 hours long. They did not provided any snacks the whole time. There is no TV on the front seat to watch movies or to entertain ourselves for 6-7 hours. I flied kn DELTA airlines recently, their service is good and flights are also good. They care about their customers.I booked my flight tickets through priceline, they have put these trash company flights to me. Next I will remove American airlines from my filters so that I don't have to travel on these trash company planes"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Cleaning crews steal lost items after deplaning.,"Walked off the airplane and before I made it to next gate for short connection realized I left beats earbuds in the seat. Ran back to aircraft was already cleaned and cleaning crew did not turn them in. Two gate agents looked. Cleaning crew definitely took them and did not turn them in. So now, I am out $300 earbuds.   The charger back system never works.  American Airlines does not care about your lost items. Like a shoulder shrug. Oh well! Sorry.   That is the wrong answer!!   The cleaning crews and the airlines should have a better check and balance system.  Cleaning crew now has a new Christmas present to give to their kid at the cost of AA losing yet another customer. And myself losing $300 earbuds."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst experience,I will never fly American Airlines again . The customer service I had with the gentleman working at my gate was horrible . He refused to answer my question about a text I had received regarding my flight. I paid to have my luggage come with me through my trip until my destination and now it’s delayed and stayed somewhere else. I will never fly with American Airlines. The whole flight was a terrible experience they don’t care to check for safety they never once checked to see if people had seatbelts or were wearing mask . No Covid precautions . Also none of the charging outlets worked . Just a horrible experience never again !
Date of travel: November 2020,10,The most horrible experience with American Airlines,"The most terrible experience today - they were not able to accommodate us with disability. They put us in the end of the plane to walk on crutches, even though we’re were willing to pay for the seats in the front of the plane. The checkin desk person told us no need to buy tickets then, and that people at the gate will be able to accommodate us. No true! Everybody was extremely rude at the gate, don’t even try to assign us seats that are appropriate with injuries, more over they told us to board last, standing (on crutches) and waiting for all people to move thought the plane. On a top of that there was no room for our luggage, because we checked in last. Will never flight American again and don’t recommend anybody with special needs ever fly American!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Virus what virus,Apparently American airlines only cares about social distance in the terminal. Their claustropgobic seating combined with them seating every single seat even if the people next to you aren't in your party is simply outrageous. Combined with back breaking seats and  ot enough legroom to move your legs anywhere choose another airline. I recommend Alaska airlines for a much more humane flight where they might actually care about their passengers
Date of travel: November 2020,10,My 17 year old daughter was stranded,My 17 year old daughter was left in the air circling Charleston airport unable to land. She missed her next flight to PA ! She’s there now stranded!  Our first time flying with American Airlines. Stay away! If anything happens to her god forbid I’ll sue!!
n/a,40,Exactly as planned,"I have no complaints about my experience with American Airlines except I wish that they still had a meal service. I got a pretty sad little sandwich and a cookie. My flights were all on time, my luggage was handled properly, all staff interactions were pleasant and professional. Our flight attendant, Courtney, on the Charlotte to Seattle leg of the trip, was absolutely wonderful. Very attentive and courteous. I wouldn't say that it was the ""Best Flight of All Time"", but it was nice and uneventful, which is pretty good in these days. I'd fly with them again."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Got Covid on flight,I was on flight 2460 to Cleveland Sunday. It was a full flight and the passengers spent 3.5 hours in delays without us being let off the plane. I contracted Covid as a result. Perhaps Americans Airlines should reconsider there Covid policies in these situations.
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Cross Country Flight,"We have been flying American Airlines a lot this year because of really good deals. The great prices have made for fuller flights, but the planes are super clean and they make sure everyone is wearing a mask. The first leg of our flight was Las Vegas to Charlotte. The agents in Las Vegas were super helpful and professional. They moved some seats around because our travel party was not all on the same reservation, but they made it that we sat together at no extra charge. They did not have seat back screens on board, but I was able to connect to their library of movies from my tablet for free, Drink service is only water, but I was still able to ask for a Coke. The connection in Charlotte was easy. Despite it being busy, I was still able to grab dinner before the short flight up to Philadelphia. That flight was also very pleasant. I enjoyed my experience with American and am excited to travel with them again."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Refunds,I canceled the trip on November 1 and I also paid for an insurance in case of cancellation so I would get my money back . And has been more than 15 days and I still waiting! So dissatisfied with this
Date of travel: November 2020,20,Purchase ticket through attendant to be identical to another and ripped me off for baggage costs.,had to get a ticket through attendant ($40) to get identical flight and never booked seats costing me when it was time to check. Then after 40 years and having citibank American credit card had to pay for luggage (first time ever). Time to switch.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Do not fly American Airlines!!! Particularly if you are disabled!!!,"Flying with American Airlines is one of the worst decisionsyou can make in planningyour trip. It's a mistake We do not plan to make again. From the very start the customerservice was practicallynon existent. Our flights were changed multiple times without much time to do anything or get to the new flight. 4 of us paid extra to choose our own seats 4 separate times and didn't keep a single seat because American Airlines would change them last minute. My wife had a seat and an extra seat and at one point she had a seat on one flight with her extra seat on a totally separate flight. They can't seem to figure it out. We want to be refunded for all the seats we paid for and never sat in. Our connecting flights were even changed while we were flying to that airport and we weren't told until we arrived at the airport. Along with that, my wife needed to use the disabled cart services. The guys running the carts were standing around talking to each other instead of getting her to our gate and then they tried to close the doors on us. The lady at the gate told us we should have been faster if we wanted on the flight! My wife has a disabilitythat makes it hard to walk. SHE KEPT TELLING HER TO WALK FASTER TO THE PLANE WHEN SHE PHYSICALLY COULDNT!!! She was so disrespectful and rude. They tried not to honor her extra seat on the last flight out to Sacramento from Dallas Fort Worth. So many of our flights have been cancelled and rescheduled with little to no notice to get us onto the flights in time. The staff has been so rude and unhelpful during this entire time of flying to our destination and flying home. When we arrived to Sacramento, my wife  requested a wheelchair because of her physical disabilities and she was told NO by American Airlines flight attendants because she didn't use one in Dallas. She was on the disability cart in Dallas to get to our terminal faster (which the people in our group who walked beat us there because the guys driving the carts were standing around talking as we waited for them to stop socializing so we could get to our gates). So she was denied her wheelchair use while having a physical disability by American Airlines. American Airlines is a JOKE. Do not waste your money on these people. Fly with Delta, Southwest or United who seem to have better customer service skills and who will actually help you and fix their mistakes rather than blaming the customer for the error because American will not own up to their mistakes that they made! They are TRASH. When we first made our reservations we had to call them out on Twitter to get them to own up to their error because they wouldn't combine the extra seat with my wife's original seat and said they could cancel our flights AS THEY PLEASE AT ANY MOMENT because of duplicate tickets in our name rather than just fixing their error for it to say it was an extra seat. Well guess what, we are calling you out again for being THE WORST AIRLINE COMPANY AROUND!!! YOU SUCK AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"horrible flight, service, staff, personnel, overall quality","It looks like this review is not necessary and travelers will get the message that AA is not the  to use for any kind of travel by seeing all the hundreds if not thousands of poor reviews. Traveling first class on AA is nothing more than a slightly larger seat. NO TVs on the plane like on every other large aircraft. AA is the only airlines that does not have a monitor on the seat back. Food is limited to cheese and crackers and even that was limited, i was in the third row out of 6 rows and when they got to me, NO chees and crackers, no courtesy , no apology, the staff are very nasty, i think bc they know their airlines is horrible and in last place for ratings. couldnt even get a blanket for the wife who was cold, ""we dont do that anymore""We travel a lot and on the RARE occasion that my wife books with AA it is only bc its the only airline that goes to the destination we need. Otherwise, would never, ever intentionally use AA. would strongly suggest and warn others, DO NOT USE AMERICAN AIRLINES !!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Do not use this company,"I flew out of Vail, Colorado on Nov. 17th on an American Airlines aircraft. It was a connecting flight. I was supposed to arrive to Dallas, Texas at 6:30 PM, board on another American Airlines aircraft at 8:00 PM, and arrive at my final destination, West Palm Beach FL at 11:36 PM.I boarded the aircraft in Vail, Colorado. We spent forever aimlessly riding around. The captain said that this was due to other aircrafts being late to depart and we had to wait our turn to take off. We finally took off 30 minutes later. When we arrived at the Dallas airport, again we were aimlessly riding around. The captain said because of COVID there were minimal gates open and we had to wait for another plane to leave our gate. We were supposed to arrive at 6:30 PM, arrived at 7:25 PM but didn’t even arrive at the gate until 7:45 PM. We arrived at Gate E and my connecting flight to West Palm Beach, FL was at Gate A. (If you’ve ever been to DFW it is huge. Gate A was on the opposite side, so I had to take a train to arrive) When I finally get out of the plane, it is 7:50 PM and I am frantically running to catch my plane to get home. By the grace of God, I somehow arrived to my gate by 7:54 PM. I approached the lady to board the plane, and she said the plane already departed. I looked at the aa.com website and saw that my connecting flight to West Palm Beach, FL took off at 7:51 PM 10 minutes earlier than it was supposed to! The really frustrating part is that if it left when it was supposed to, I would have made my flight!!! I was extremely discouraged and frustrated. I spent all day traveling and could not spend the night at my home with my family- and the reason behind it was completely out of my hands. The next plane that I could catch to get home was the next day, at 11:00 PM!! Here I am with no family, at a place that I have never been to, basically stranded until the next day. To make matters worse, the American Airlines customer service was unapologetic, unsympathetic, and flat out did not care about their customer’s personal lives or reasoning behind why they had to get to their destination. They told all of us that it was an Aircraft Traffic Control issue and not an American Airlines issue- because of this, they were not able to provide us a place to sleep but instead just gave us a “discount” for a hotel. (The “discount” was nothing more than what we could find on Expedia for the same exact price). When customers of AA were rightfully complaining, one of the associates had the audacity to tell us that we could just sleep at the airport. One customer said she had back problems but the associates basically said you’re s.o.l. Also, I had no luggage because I had a checked-in bag!!! If it was our fault and our responsibility of missing a connecting flight, that is one thing. Not only was American Airlines completely in the wrong and tried to ignore their fault by blaming another department, they did not try to help their customers in any way. I am very disappointed in the way AA handled this situation. Especially in the middle of a pandemic, there is no excuse. I am very disappointed in the lack of sympathy and accommodation. I will not be supporting this company again."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,DENIED HELP TO DISABLED PERSON,"Flying with American Airlines has been an absolute nightmare. I will never again in my life fly with American. The customer service is horrid from the start. Our flights were changed multiple times. I have paid multiple times to pick seats and have never sat in the seats I paid for because American Airlines keeps changing my seats. I had a seat and an extra seat and at one point today I had a seat on one flight with my extra seat on a totally separate flight. They can't seem to figure it out. I want refunded for all those seats I paid for and never sat in!!! Our connecting flights were even changed while we were flying to that airport and we weren't told until we arrived at the airport. Along with that, I needed to use the disabled cart services. The guys running the carts were standing around talking to each other instead of getting me to my gate and they tried to close the doors on me. The lady at the gate told me I should have been faster if I wanted on the flight! WHILE HAVING A DISABILITY THAT MAKES IT HARD TO WALK. SHE KEPT TELLING ME TO WALK FASTER TO THE PLANE WHEN I PHYSICALLY COULDNT!!! She was so disrespectful and rude. They tried not to honor my extra seat on the last flight out to Sacramento from Dallas Fort Worth. So many of our flights have been cancelled and rescheduled with little to no notice to get us onto the flights in time. The staff has been so rude and unhelpful during this entire time of flying to my destination and flying home. When I arrived to Sacramento, I requested a wheelchair because of my physical disabilities and I was told NO by American Airlines flight attendants because I didn't use one in Dallas. Uh no, I was on the disability cart in Dallas to get to my terminal faster (which the people in my group who walked beat us there because the guys driving the carts were standing around talking as we waited for them to stop socializing so we could get to our gates). So I was denied wheelchair use while having a physical disability by American Airlines. American Airlines is a JOKE. Do not waste your money on these people. Fly with Delta, Southwest or United who seem to have better customer service skills and who will actually help you and fix their mistakes rather than blaming the customer for the error because American will not own up to their mistakes that they made! They are TRASH. When we first made our reservations I had to call them out on Twitter to get them to own up to their error because they wouldn't combine my extra seat with my original seat and said they could cancel our flights AS THEY PLEASE AT ANY MOMENT because of duplicate tickets in my name rather than just fixing their error for it to say it was an extra seat. Well guess what, I am calling you out again for being THE WORST AIRLINE COMPANY AROUND!!! YOU SUCK AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Super Slow Refunds on Under 24 Hr Cancellation,"I booked 3 family tickets to Puerto Rico November 11th.  It took American 60 seconds to charge my Amex card.  After reading about recently imposed COVID-19 restrictions at my destination, I decided to cancel my trip the next day.  I was within the 24 hour policy for a full refund.  I visited the American Air website to cancel.  It would not recognize my login although I provided the record locator and ticket number and my name.  All fields were completed.  I was concerned and this caused me to believe American Airlines was attempting to create a hurdle that may cause me to miss the cancellation deadline.  So I called direct to the cancellation desk and was told I would be on hold for at least one hour.  There was no option to request a call back so I held.  Finally I was connected with a live person.  They stated they found my reservation and had cancelled my 3 flights.  I requested proof of cancellation via email or text.  I was informed they did not provide confirmation but they had documented the request in their system.  Since I was now within 3 hours of my 24 hour cancellation deadline, I was very uncomfortable with this process but I had no choice to accept and ended the call.  An hour later I became uneasy not having confirmation in writing for my $926 refund, so I called back to confirm there truly was a record of my cancellation in their system.  Once again I was reassured there was record of my request but could not be provided anything in writing.  It only took American Airlines 60 seconds to electronically charge my card, but with today’s business systems and banking technology they seem to conveniently be unable to electronically communicate my request in writing and after 7 days have not credited my AMEX Card for the $926.  I am a field employee with my company and typically travel on other airlines and never experience this aggravation.  I don’t know if or when I will be receiving my refund, but rest assured I will avoid booking any future flights with American Airlines due to their customer-unfriendly cash flow process.  It’s quite obvious what they are doing here.  I’ll bet they don’t monitor reviews of their travelers and wool not respond to this post.  I will come back to this site weekly to post updates to my refund status.  IT”S NOT A GOOD TIME TO FLY AMERICAN!!!"
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Great Compared to Economy,"Prefer Delta but could not afford them on this flight, so flew frontier out, hated it so bad I cancelled it and found affordable American flight. Was comfortable and timely and have no complaints."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Avoid at all cost.,"My last employer had already booked a flight for me this summer, but I decided to leave the company and they had to send someone else in my place to that project. Since the flight could not be canceled, I took the credit and used it for another flight, and reimbursed my employer for the value of that flight. I then booked a return flight to Canada using my credit and additional money. American Airlines canceled my new flights twice, and when I called to reschedule the flight a third time, they told me they had issued a refund for the flight. I told them I didn’t need a refund, just a credit and to apply it towards rescheduling, but I was told it was too late to do so. I then asked them to what credit card they submitted the refund, and to my surprise, they told me the money did not come back to me entirely, only the portion paid with my card would be reimbursed to me and I could reach out myself and ask my last employer if they would kindly reimburse me for the portion I had already refunded them for. Of course, I wasn’t going to reach out to my last employer asking them to fix American Airlines’ mistake. So that money seemed lost. I therefore waited to receive the portion of the money paid with my own credit card, and monitored the refund. Once it was processed, I checked my account and realized the entire refund was issued to my last employer!!! AMERICAN AIRLINES TOOK MY MONEY ANS GAVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE. I alerted them of this issue, and I had to wait 10 days for someone to call me back and order me to call my last employer and ask them to fix AA’s mistake. AGAIN. I gave  this money to AA and I expect AA to give it back to me. No one else. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Only reachable by email, EXTREMELY SLOW. LITERALLY STOLE MY MONEY."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"Do your self a favor, and book something else..","Do your self a favor, Avoid this company at all costs... I usually always travel with JetBlue because I love what they do. However this time i decided to go with American Airlines because it was cheaper... Boy i should not have done that... First of All there is no such thing as social distancing. The flight was FULL. Every single seat was taken. To top it all off, instead of getting people on from back of the plane they board the front first making and making you more susceptible for covid.. Now when it comes to wifi, you have to pay for it. JETBLUE HAS IT FREE!!!!. The leg room is horrible, i paid extra money for extra Leg room and guess what, JetBlue has that standard!. There were plenty of passengers that did not cover their noses with masks and flight attendants did nothing about it. Heck i only saw the flight attendant during boarding and to collect garbage... Did i mention they had no screen entertainment? they had journals instead which had printing on them stating that they were disinfected.. WRONG!!! My journal was Greasy with Fingerprints all over it. People from previous flights had stuff written on it. There were Coffee or Soda marks on the seat as well which tells me they definately do not wipe or clean the seats after a flight. Pure Chaos... Never Again will i travel with this company.."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,DO NOT FLY AA,"Just flat out terrible customer service. Right from the start the guy at the counter gave us the worst attitude. Then after realizing we got a good deal on our ticket, we were forced to pay $250 at the gate on top of what we already paid just to get on the flight. Absolutely horrible."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"Horrible in service, horrible in everything","Even don't try to use this airline in near future. Waist of time, level of their service horrible, delays is 100% normal for this airline. Oh, yes, if you have to cover 800 miles drive it will be the same time but more comfortable because you will be not treated only like source of money for them. Your baggage will stay under rain for hours (2-3 hours delay is normal) and you can guess what will be with all your belongings."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst air travel experience ever!,"We had negative covid test from Doctor at  Humber River Hospital in Toronto. AA would not accept it at check in Toronto. AA insisited we re book excluding Honduras connection. Our cost approx $1,200. Meanwhile tests accepted in Miami and Honduras. Flights changed to CST and MIA. Ended up at same destination on same day but billed twice.  No social distancing in line ups. Flights virtually full (so much for leaving seats open). Total confusion at different times wrt AA check in requirements to fly to Honduras. American and Canadian airports comparison to RTB are laughable. Greeted by by Honduran representatives in hasmat suits, temperature checked, hands cleansed, officers enforcing social distancing.Will never purchase AA ticket again."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,What idiots!!!,"They are still seating the FRONT of the plane first, increasing the chances of SPREADING COVID!!!! Southwest Airlines (which I WILL be using from now on!) is SOCIAL DISTANCING by seating the rear of the plane FIRST! We are NOT six feet apart! Looks like money is more important to American Airlines than safety! Also, leaving us seated like sardines elbow to elbow with a 50 minute delay on the tarmac is STUPID!!! I can’t emphasize enough DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES! Also, they announced “no beverage service”, but FIRST CLASS gets beverage service!!!! Wow!!!!! What a way to show your average customer your PRIORITIES! NEVER AGAIN!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,A poorly run airline with a bad attitude,"Am Air and most US airlines continue to decay.   AA is has a lot of employees that have an attitude problem.   Not an attitude of customer service and courtesy but rather rude, disinterested in helping, or just angry.   First class today was ""here is a sani-wipe"".  Yes, really.   And, ""if you don't wear a mask on your nose and mouth you may be disallowed from ever flying with us again"".   Yada, you get the idea.  But there's more....my initial flight was delayed at least three times at what point, I moved to another flight.   As the online app asked me if I wanted to move to another flight, I decided to check with the desk agent to make sure I wasn't making a mistake.  They could not even tell me that I would get on the other flight ""I guess if your app tells you, you might get on but from my side your are stand by.""    This is AA."
Date of travel: November 2020,20,Shame on American Airlines,Flight to Orlando was completely booked. No social distancing. Care more about finances than customer safety.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"Plane was FULL, every seat filled, no social distancing.","I flew to Denver on 11/05/2020 and the plane was FULL. Every seat taken even the middle seats were full. There was no type of social distancing what so ever, they just only require a face mask. With COVID 19 going on they put the passengers health and safety in danger. The plane was just as crowded on the way back. This was my first and last time I will every fly American ""greedy & selfish"" Airlines."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,You pay for your ticket then you have to pay for a seat when you check in.,"Twice now we have flown AA in the last month.  When We bought our tickets, we picked our seats together at the time of purchase.  We’re married so we prefer to sit together when we fly.  It’s been that way for 36 years. However when we checked in we didn’t have the seats we  choose when we purchased our tickets and  if we wanted to sit together we had to pay a fee for our seats. Once is a mistake.  Twice is just bad business.  This will be my last flight with American Airlines."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Excellent,"I flew Miami to London with AA. Flight no: 38. Excellent service from beginning to end. Big thank you to crew members Rhonda, Greg, Teri, Karen. All so kind, caring and attentive. My first time using American and will definitely return if all the crew are like these members I mentioned. As a frequent traveler I get bored or airports and airlines but with this crew they made me enjoy every min of flying. Please AA thank them on my behalf, they are great Ambassadors for your company."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Kiss it,Trash at keeping schedule.  Who flies these planes?  Always late.  Hour delay today and 2 hour delay yesterday.Changed time and gate today with no notice.  Ridicolous.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND COMMUNICATION,"Wasnt able to board flight from Pensacola to Miami due to not have a negative covid result in hand. Took the test required in the allotted time required but test results were not released before check in time. Was never made aware we couldnt board the flight without that paperwork by the airline beforehand. When we there there trying to check in, Katherine was super rude and unhelpful. From the minute we said where we were going, she got defensive and unwilling to listen to anything we said, let alone help us. We had the required QR code and number sequence code for the Belize government to track us and anticipate our arrival, yet she kept saying we didnt. She also said we didnt do a covid test, which we did, just hadn't received a result either way. She told us to contact customer service but they would tell us the same thing so we would be wasting our time. Katherine also made it apparent that there was absolutely no supervisor for us to talk to and seemed happy to push it along out of her line. Do not recommend this airline to anyone. Their customer service and overall attitude and willingness to help the paying customer is unbelievably underwhelming."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service,"The employees in Customer Service are rude and truly act like they hate the customers that fly.  They are not helpful and very snippy.  Especially in Pensacola.  Normally fly Delta which is hands down better.  American isn't cheaper, Delta just wasn't flying that route so you are basically subject to as much rudeness as they can pass out.  No wonder they are rated as one of the worst airlines to fly."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Last time I ever fly with them,"Never have I had a good experience with AA. Never disclose why you are delayed or anything. They also just expect to have customers. Every time I fly Southwest it is a great experience. Had to fly AA this time due to my team paying for the flight, but I will never pay for another AA flight myself again. This confirmed that. ^^ made me fill all of those fields, NEVER have I had a good experience with AA in the last decade of traveling. Stop funding their mediocre service."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"During COVID-19, they cancelled my flight with no refund","I booked a flight, they cancelled it, and then did not offer me a refund as the pandemic worsens. This is not ok."
Date of travel: November 2020,20,The most of the stuff is not friendly,The flight stuff should be trained better on customer service skills. Poor service in this regard. They act like they're your parents or higher ups.
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Awesome service,"I was going to write a bad review when my plane was three hours late taking off, but with the amazing service I simply cannot. We were supposed to go from Santa Barbara to Phoenix then to Milwaukee, but since we missed our connecting flight we had to go from Santa Barbara, Phoenix to Dallas then Milwaukee. I can’t believe how helpful American Airlines was. The general manager at the Santa Barbara Airport made sure our luggage was sent to Dallas. Tracy that worked at the gate did everything in her power to keep our first class seats. I have a bad knee and can’t sit in economy. When we got to Phoenix another lady at the gate assisted us into the plane all first class. They really went above and beyond to make sure all three flights were first class, like we paid for. The flight attendant Louis from Phoenix to Dallas was very attentive and super friendly. They made a bad situation turn into a pleasant one. Thank you!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,"Will not refund a military ticket, but Southwest does","I have not seen my son for 3 years since he is in the military.  This would be the first Christmas in 3 years that I would be able to see my son.  He was denied leave after the Army told him he had the leave and Southwest was very nice since he is military and refunded my reservations.  However, American Airlines refused to refund my money.  I am a single mom and do not have money to just loose.  Last 2 Christmas's my son has not had a Christmas and myself and his brother's were so excited to have him home this year...that was until the military denied his leave.  All I asked for was a refund and it's not the money as much as yet again we not be able to have Christmas with my other son."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,What Pandemic???,"Not only was the flight full, it was overbooked.   Comment about PHL airport.   In line for TSA I saw numerous people without masks.  I asked the agent why they aren't enforcing the mandate.  He said show me someone without a mask.   I pointed and said there, there, there....   He just shrugged.   I said aren't you supposed to be the first line of defense?  No answer.   I mentioned it to a second agent and his attitude wasn't much better.   On the plane to Miami I had to ask the woman next to me to put her mask back up.   Way back to Philly same thing.  Also guy in front of me had his mask off when deplaning...nothing said.  The crew did absolutely nothing to ensure compliance.   They sat in their jump seats and chatted or read.   Shouldn't they be walking around occasionally to check on mask wearing.  The rule is wear it the ENTIRE flight.  Drink or eat and put it back over your NOSE AND MOUTH.   They threaten to ban you from future flights if not compliant but do nothing to be sure throughout the entire flight that people are doing what they are supposed to be, which is a Pennsylvania mandate and an American Airlines mandate.    American Airlines:   IF WE ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO FLY RIGHT NOW  AIRLINES, DO YOU JOB AND KEEP US SAFE."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,PLEASE FIND ANOTHER AIRLINE,"Chairs were disgusting, plain were duty,  that right there is telling me wasn't properly disinfected as it is supposed to DUE TO covid 19"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Please Choose ANY OTHER AIRLINE,"To start off this was my very first flight with American. The majority of the attendants were very cold and rude siring thee flight. When it comes to the efficiency of the airline is it a complete ZERO. I missed my connecting flight dude to the gate changing not being properly communicated or should I say not being communicated AT ALL. I received no notification via online app, email etc. Has this been my mistake then ok... but I was not the only customer who has missed my flight due to the lack of communication. The service reps were extremely hostile and unprofessionally aggressive! They did not apologize once nor take even the slightest accountability for their mistake. The manager and I quote said “I don’t believe you” to another passenger who was explaining how the change of gate was not communicated. They put myself and another customer on stand by for a morning flight but then took back the ticket to confirm the flight only when they were being proved wrong by their handling of the situation. They offered no hotel accommodations to us when asked repeatedly but yet offered one to a man behind us who had also missed his connecting flight. I will never fly with American airlines again after this. Please choose any other airline!!!! PLEASE!!!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,If you have a choice don’t fly American,"I flew American. The cabin appeared clean. The crew was friendly. The cabin was packed like sardines like COVID wasn’t an issue. When I inquired if there was a beverage service I was told no, due to Covid there would be no inflight service. As I said we were elbow to elbow front to back, but Covid was an issue. I should have forked a few extra bucks and flown Alaska air."
Date of travel: November 2020,20,End of a nightmare,"This was the second leg of a terrible journey that started from WPB earlier in the day. Upon landing I asked the gate staff for assistance when one became available. I explained my previous situation and asked if he could reprint my boarding pass to SFO. He looked up my flight and then told me to go to the gate at my departing terminal. I said thank you and repeated my question. He abruptly said they would. Not being a first time traveler, I know this is something they can do. Rather than argue I head to the gate he instructed. Guess what ... it was th4e wrong gate and the wrong terminal. If you know DFW, you know you have to take a rail car. Well to keep this short, I just barely made it.During the flight, I noticed several empty seats, so I asked one of the flight crew if I could relocate. My thought was why crowd when we could spread out. There was three of them chatting. One began to tell me yes when he was interrupted by another telling me that people have to pay extra for those seats. I commented that I had seen others move and thought it only polite to ask before just moving as they did. She began to repeat herself when the third person cut in and said thank you for asking. It was the only pleasant thing to happen on this portion of my trip.Upon landing at SFO, there was a problem with the baggage carousel that caused a delay. When my backpack, that I was force to check bag against my will in WPB, finally arrived, it was filthy and had been roughly handled. It had not gone through very well, as I had feared back in WPB."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Rudly herded like cattle during COVID,"I arrived with plenty of time to spare and found myself a seat near the gate. Having recently flown on a couple of other AA flights with pleasant experiences, I thought this would be the same. It could not be furthest from the truth.1) As they began the boarding process by calling up the groups, you could hear the staff talking about the flight crew being short staffed due to a late call out. Given that I was more than twenty feet away, I or any other passenger, should not have been privy to that conversation. They should have stepped away and lowered their voices.2) They kept the first three boarding groups spaced apart, but after that they began calling them up quicker and had people bunching up. There was no caution or social distancing. Passengers had masks hanging around their necks were not being told to pull them up; they were not eating or drinking, nor were they wearing a face shield.3) They had 9 boarding groups. About mid-way through them they began asking to carry-on bags to be courtesy checked. They cited lack of space in the overhead bins. I thought this to be odd but wrote it off until I was able to board.4) Since I wasn't allowed to pre-board, and social distancing was non-exisitant, I found that I had to wait until the end; I was part of group six. I approached near the end of group nine. I was told I HAD to check-in my backpack ... a backpack ... because there was no space. I told them it was my only luggage and would not survive going through the check bags process. They saw I was group six and told me I should have boarded sooner then. When I related my concerns, they said I should have pre-boarded. I told them I was declined, and they said oh well and that I had no choice, I had to check in my bag. I was furious but complied. 5) Unhappily I enter the ramp only to find it filled with people waiting to board. Everyone is crammed in and not spaced apart. The last few remaining passengers behind me are also being rushed to join us. It felt like being on a cattle car.6) When I boarded the plane and making my way to my seat, I saw that several of the overhead bins were vacant. There was plenty of space. It had all been a ruse to rush everyone on the plane. I had plenty of time to observe this since I had to wait to slowly make my way through the plane because the crew rushed us onboard.7) The cherry on top of it all was when I approached my seat. Not only was someone sitting in it, but it was one of the non-mask wearing people and he had the nerve to ask if I didn't mind. I wanted to scream at him that he was insane, but sanity prevailed and I said no, I had selected that seat. I'm an experienced traveler having been to 20 countries and 32 states, some more than once. This flight is on my worst experience list and makes me want to avoid AA if at all possible."
Date of travel: October 2020,40,Second leg of a red-eye,"Having just come off a coast-to-coast red-eye for my first leg, I was concerned about making the gate coming from a distant terminal. There turned out to be no cause. I arrived in plenty of time and the gate staff was great at welcoming everyone while keeping us all apart. Once on the plane, I noticed it was a newer model. The seats were very comfortable and allowed me to relax. Having a bad back makes flying a chore, this flight was not. I actually was not fatigued when I disembarked. That is not something I can say often."
Date of travel: October 2020,40,The red-eye to fly,"I was concerned about flying because of COVID, but this was a needed trip. When the gate crew took the podium, they cite the normal airline speech and then social distancing practices for the gate. You could see a few eyeballs rolling, but when it came time, the crew kept reminding people to stay spaced out and not crowd or bunch up. Even though it was a full flight, they said there was plenty of space and no need to rush. They were very professional and reassuring."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst Airline Ever! Avoid These Scammers!,"I strongly recommend that any military families or friends that I know.. (any civilian families or friends too) choose any airline but American Airlines! Sorry for the long post!My family recently made a PCS (permanent change of station for my non-military friends) from Hawaii to Texas. After spending 10 days in a hotel with 2 restless kids, we arrived at the airport with our 14 bags in tow more than ready to get going. Unfortunately, the experience we had was far from exceptional. Besides some overweight luggage misunderstandings, the big issue was our tickets had been purchased a couple of days before through the Army. We found out too late to ask the Army for a change that my husband’s vehicle had arrived in Dallas early so we asked about changing our flights at the check in counter. We wanted our (HNL->DFW->ELP) to become just a flight to Dallas and we were willing to pay any cost differences and fees. We wanted to avoid having to fly back to Dallas and then drive 10 hours with 2 kids all the way back to El Paso. The tickets (over $1300) were already paid for and it seemed simple enough to just change the info to reflect the new itinerary for the bags. This wasn’t our experience, though. To make a long story short, American Airlines IS NOT MILITARY FRIENDLY. Please do not fly with them for official or leisure travel if you can help it at all. They will never get mine or my family’s business ever again. This airline charged us over $1100 for new seats ON THE SAME PLANE. The explanation that we received was that they couldn’t stop our bags or make any changes to the itinerary because the Army booked our tickets. The customer service was severely lacking and made an already hellish PCS that much worse. It feels as if we were robbed. American Airlines came out on top because they were paid twice. Over $2400 total. This isn’t an airline. They are scam artists! And nothing about them is Military friendly either!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst Customer Service ,"Thankfully, I don’t get a chance to fly AA often. In my recent trip from DC to Aruba, I’ve experienced the worst customer service through the entire flying experience. From the representatives at the call center, to dealing  with their employees at check in as well as on the flight. I’m unsure to why they all have major attitudes when interacting with their customers. It must be a normal culture within AA since every employee I encountered has zero customer service skills. I will not be flying with AA again."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,The worst customer service and flight crew,"Let me tel you what I pay 750$ each way to get some good service, well what I thought I usually fly jet blue and have never flew American and let me two u I never will again. The flight crew has the worst ATTITUDE very mean. My face mask fell down off my face and they were screaming at me as if I wasn’t being compliant mean while I was sleeping then two ladies yelling at me like I’m a child I’ll just have to stick to jet blue worst airline ever."

Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst experience,A worst airline to take ever!! Worst cabin crews with worst attitudes!! Never will recommend this kind of Low standard airlines!!!
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Horrific treatment of disabled woman,"Flew from Akron/Canton to Atlanta with a layover in Charlotte S.C. Called the airline in advance to ask about wheel chairs and assistance on and off the plane. Yes they said, no problem. Akron/Canton was excellent. I give 5 stars. Charlotte 3.5 stars. The ladies on the plane from Charlotte to Atlanta -0. I was told they couldn't help me put my bag in or out of the overhead. No one offered assistance to help me carry my bag off the plane until they had no other choice. They had started to clean the plane around me. I was almost in tears. I walk with a cane. Can barely breath and use a wheel chair. It's not rocket science that I could use a little help. Shameful to watch disabled people struggle and have that kind of apathy. Never again will I  fly American. From now on I'm sticking with delta."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Choose another airline,"Never fly with American Airlines! We were diverted due to a faulty fan on our plane coming out of Orlando. The flight team including the pilot handled the entire situation extremely well and it was a smooth and quick landing in Charleston. However, once on the ground American handled the situation terribly. There was lack of communication from the entire American Airlines airport team. All they offered while we waited for hours for another plane was snacks and water. Every single shop and restaurant was also closed in Charleston so it wasn’t like there was any other option. We finally left Charleston, once again with a great flight team, and arrived in Charlotte at around 10:30pm (original arrival before being diverted was 7:19pm). Needless to say everyone on the plane missed their connections. All car rental options were closed leaving the people who wanted to drive to their final destination stuck and just like Charleston all the restaurants and shops were closed with no option for food. Everyone made their way down to baggage claim to get their bags prior to going to the hotel. We stood at baggage claim waiting for our bags for just short of 3 1/2 hours! American “had to find” our bags. There was NO COMMUNICATION and baggage customer service suddenly just closed, shut the lights off and WENT HOME at midnight even though we still didn’t have our bags. We all just stood there not knowing if anyone was even there anymore to get the bags. They refused to give the supervisors name regardless of repeated requests and repeatedly refused to even get the supervisor when requesting. Around 2am our bags finally showed up. Upon arrival at the “complementary hotel” American Airlines had never even notified the hotel and the entire hotel smelled like marijuana. I have not slept at this point and we are back at the airport to get on our flight. None of the meal vouchers are good because apparently they have to be used at actual restaurants which means after keeping me at the airport with an 8 year old kid I couldn’t feed dinner last night until 2am we were supposed to come back early enough to go to a restaurant before our flight boarded at 11am? So as we ran though the airport last minute this morning I had to pay for snacks and what have you. Apparently no one was supposed to eat last night either because none of the said “meal vouchers” were good until today only at the airport which was completely closed when we got in. Long story short I will never fly with American Airlines again. The last week of my life and the reason we are even traveling was for a family emergency. So the week was rough enough without the extra stress from American Airlines and their excessively poor service."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,$$$$,"American Airlines changed our flight(roundtrip) blamed me for not calling them earlier.   Called once heard one story, called again heard another story.   Wanted ridiculous amounts of money to move my flight back to the original.  Then of course seats were down graded and me and my husband had to sit by strangers.  I asked about changing seats when checking in and was taken to sometime that should have helped but passed me on until I was told no.   All we are yo American Airlines is money.  They don't care about customer satisfaction at all.  Very disappointed with these flights.  Also not sure how their completely filling up planes is helping with the COVID mess.   There are so many in the planes that we share EVERYTHING."
Date of travel: November 2020,30,Peggie,I was very disturbed with the fact they are filling middle seats right now with Covid going on and there's NO leg room I'm 6'2
n/a,10,Worst flight ever,Horrible experience with American airlines stranded us in Dallas tx and expected us to be good with it. I was threatened multiple time by thier staff that they would not allow me on the connection flight. Because I demanded the provide accommodation for us. Horrible airline do not use them.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Why can they not provide up-to-date information?,"I appreciate we are in the midst of a pandemic and it is absolutely necessary for airlines to consolidate flights, based on demand. Nevertheless my initial gripe is that they never sent me an email informing me I’d a change in my departure time. It was fortuitous that I checked on the app a few days in advance, only to discover the changes. No communication whatsoever from AA!I then had to manually go through the crazy seat assignments they’d given to my travel companion and me, to get us back together for our flights. Then, to add further confusion, the Admirals Club information on the AA app for ORD is not up to date. Guys, I know it’s a difficult time at the moment, but this is when you need to work extra hard to look after your loyal customers!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Business over Covid Safety,Traveler beware! I traveled round-trip from Miami to LA Oct 29th and Nov 2nd. They did not keep my party together or space people out. They did not space out boarding or off boarding. I realized how different things were mostly because I had traveled round-trip with Spirit the week before from Miami to Denver. Have been traveling with American Airlines since before I could purchase my own tickets and am surprised they weren't at least keeping groups together. They claimed it was because of ticket level but when checking in there were plenty of open seats. This was after trying to stay together when my parents ended up in the middle of two separate strangers with the same ticket level.Only redeeming thing was an amazingly kind gentleman that was able to help out my group of 3 sit together and made us feel safer by enforcing social distancing in a friendly way.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,NEVER FLY AMERICAN- Won't socially distance even if it's available.,"I flew delta last week and they were socially distancing. American airline is not (EVEN IF ITS AVAILABLE) I asked to switch seats so I could reduce my covid exposure. These seats are empty and less leg room than my seats. However, they would rather them remain empty than properly social distance. IF THEY CAN SOCIALLY DISTANCE US WHY AREN’T THEY!!!!! Thanks for protecting us AA."
Date of travel: October 2020,30,Let down,"Not at all what I expected.New and clean airplane, but seat barely reclines.!!Service is a little box of bagged items........!!Service is down due to Covid, prices are NOT!!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Discriminated by their Mexican staff.,"I am Mexican-American  by DNA and i look more Mexican than i do American. When i got in the line on the computers at the Mexico City airport i asked an attendant  for help (I'm not too savvy checking in the self-check computers). She told me ""You're Mexican speak Spanish!!"" and she refused to help me. Another customer who saw how she was treating me offered to help me. Its American airlines  an American company if you choose to speak English what is their problem? she spoke English she was helping Caucasian customers in English. English is my primary language and i bought a ticket from an American airline for a reason. USA is home and i figure i can speak English in an AMERICAN owned company. I know Mexico well, my WW2 vet father owned businesses in Mexico and one of the idiosyncrasies of the country is hatred of their own. Nobody in the world treats Mexicans as bad as Mexicans themselves. Its a historical fact. It even has a name ""Malinchismo"". But you would NOT expect an AMERICAN airline to allow their Mexican staff to engage in it. It's very clear in both the American  and Mexican constitution (which i have read too) that ""all men are created equal.."" Mexico is a very racist, classist, ageist country which allows discrimination of the poor, the darker skin and older (which by their standard is anyone over 40). But its actually a democracy like the US. Again i did not expect an AMERICAN airline to allow that. I did speak to a manager at the airport about it and she refused to let me know the attendant's name or let me video how she was treating me. Another violation of my civil rights.  I used to have to travel every 3 weeks for years, American airlines was always by first choice. I will never use them again to travel international. Because they don't apply USA service in other countries."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,DISCRIMINATION,"Hispanos, cuidado cuando decidan viajar con American Airlines, pues los empresarios ejecutivos de American Airlines son tolerantes hacia la actitud discriminatoria de algunos de sus empleados.  Yo fui una víctima de discriminación.On 24 October 2020 I was a passenger on American Airlines flight 2194, seat #32C from Charlotte North Carolina to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  I was discriminated and harassed for incorrectly asking the flight attendant for a glass of water.  I asked the flight attendant “can I get a glass of water?” he very condescendingly told me “is may I have a glass of water” he was very arrogant, he lacked social skills and empathy, but evidently that’s acceptable by the leadership of American Airlines, besides having no concern for social distancing and packing the aircraft."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst airline experience ever,"Worst airline experience to date. Staff was incompetent and rude. Check in was disorganized. During check in, was moved to three differnt lines before talking to an agent. Online check in was full of glitches. The only reason I would ever use AA again is if they offered the only direct flight to a destination that I could not drive to in less than 12 hours. Also my bag looked like they loaded it onto the plane with a wood chipper."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,COVID RISK: DELAYED USE OF AC AND AIR FILTERS!!,"A few days ago I flew from Knoxville, Tennessee to Charlotte, North Carolina.  The plane was full, and after everyone boarded, the pilot announced a 30 minute mandated takeoff delay due to Charlotte congestion.  I reached up to turn on the air, and nothing came out.  A fellow passenger and I complained to the stewardess who spoke to the pilot.  A few minutes later, air came on, but warm.  The engines were off.  We complained again, as the fully booked plane was heating up, and we doubted if the high efficiency filters were working.  Nothing changed, and five minutes before we left the gate, the pilot turned on the engines, the air conditioner started working, and, I assume, the air was finally being filtered by the HEPA filters.  Thus, for nearly 30 minutes, a fully loaded plane was sitting in the sun without passengers' breath being filtered!  I FELT THIS WAS A HUGE COVID RISK AND UNACCEPTABLE!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Horrible Experience x2,"Do not Fly with this Airlines. I have certified ESA animals that they wouldn't allow me to board my flight twice to St. Maarten for school from DFW. The agents are incompetent, insensitive, racist and uncaring for those of us who have Documented Disabilities, certificates of approval from The Inspection Department of Agriculture and Ministry of Tourism to bring both of my ESA cats with me plus their veterinarian, USDA certificate, and yet they still denied me transportation not once but twice. I've experienced emotional distress, panic attacks and it has costs me over $2600 to prepare my ESA animals to fly. They lied on me say my Covid test was invalid, it was not , I need a physical exam, oh my debit card doesn't work to oh you were here last week , so he took over an hour to even put my luggage in the system. Never fly with this company, never if you want a piece of mind and treated with dignity and respect. Not lied on and to by the managers at DFW terminal C-21.  Just don't choose another airline."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst customer service,"Honestly the reason I gave American Airlines a terrible review is because of their customer service.   My flights going too a wedding and back home were both changed.I understand that COVId has caused lots of things like cancelations and changes, that is not the problem.   But they changed my flight to a time I could not make, so I called expecting them to figure out what they could do.   ( I was not mad or yelling because again I get that COVId has caused lots of people not to fly and airlines need to make money).   The problem happened when I could not find a flight that worked during the times I needed because I have class,  I asked to change the destination and see if that would work.   They found a flight that worked (with a huge lay over ).  The AA representative proceeded to tell me that I needed to pay for the price difference because I changed my destination.   ( I get that policy when I call to change my flight because I want to change something,  not forced too by the air lines who change my flight).  She would not budge so asked to speak to her manager,  they didn’t budge and asked to speak to their manager,  at which they didn’t budge,  and I did the same thing.  After three levels of management I got some one who critically thought,  and told me that I could have the flight with out paying any extra money (again I was I this situation because they changed my flight first to a time I could not do and had no other option for me at that same destination ).  So not that you care American Air lines but your air lines will be the last company I choose to fly with and if it came down to you being the cheapest,   I would probably pay more just so I don’t have to deal with this again.   Good job you lost my business after this wedding.."
n/a,10,Reschedule - loose $$,"Don't fly American air if you value ur money! They do not honor their vouchers or credits. Our original flight, booked 11/7/19 for March 2020 to see a sick friend was cancelled due to Covid-19. We were promised they would honor our money to rebook. They said they could not refund the money. We tried to rescheduled again for 7/10/20 and had to cancel, as I am immune compromised since birth. We were promised that they would honor our original tickets. Our friend is dieing and we tried to reschedule for 3/2021. Even with all previous cancellations and complete paperwork (after having to find it all since I had voucher numbers, reservations said I could not use both of the vouchers at the same time. I'm going with my husband! So, I have lost $881.20 in flight credits! I always thought AA was better than this! Spent over 1.5 hours on the phone 3 times trying to  reschedule  just to be hung up on by Kemon & Jack.  Finally, Kemon said ""Dont call back!"""
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Very professional,"Very professional service, they took all the cautions for the COVID 19 . Friendly workers, safe and they are pending of everything. About food or drinks now you need to pay for everything."
Date of travel: October 2020,30,Attention to detail and covid,"So a couple of positives, they let me board early to get my support animal settled in before the cabin filled. On my flight out from myr -atl - pdx I was not boarded early but had window seat and no one next to me. Only 1 person per row for social distancing.this worked well and was happy to see that my first leg from pdx to ord was the same. After that however, there was no social distancing, 95% of seats were filled. I was assigned  a middle seat on the next 2 flights. Not cool when you need to settle an animal. You can't say you're striving for health and safety and not social distance. shame on you"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Fully booked flight during COVID,"Even with their cleanliness commitment, the seat and tray I wiped down were dirty. The flight was completely full. Three days after my flight I’m feeling run down and will have to get tested. I am so completely disappointed in American Airlines. I did not book a return flight but will not be choosing AA. No middle seats empty. In fact they changed my seat to a middle seat."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Mrs,"In the mist of COVID-19 increasing in numbers, AA is packing flights to capacity.  Changed our flight time from morning to afternoon to completely fill the flight. Very disappointed in American Airlines.  Will not be flying with them again!"
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Most unpleasant,"I flew American Airlines from Burbank to Dallas last week on flight 2599.  I was really upset to find the plane was full.  Not full with no middle seats occupied, but full without an empty seat.  I found this to be a bit disconcerting during an international pandemic.  I really don't care that they stopped food and beverage service, but please don't tell me you did it for my own good as you fill the plane to capacity.  The return flight was nearly full.  I think it's time to look for a new airline for my next business trip.  Also, I got to the airport early, as I'm supposed to.  I checked my bag in at my own expense.  When I got to the gate, the announcement came through that the plane was full.  There wasn't going to be enough space on the plane for all the carry-on bags.  Anyone with more than two carry-ons was asked to check bags.  At this point, American staff starts checking bags for free.  Why not reward people for showing up early and checking bags instead of rewarding people who bring too many bags onto your planes?  Just a thought to help keep customers happy."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Safety is not their top priority!,"Flying back to Orlando from Reno we had to connect in Phoenix, AZ.  That terminal was so jammed packed we had to wait to exit the walkway because of the crowds waiting to board other flights.  There was NO social distancing at all nor did they even care about that.  The fights were packed the terminals were packed, never again would I fly them.  No one on there staff seem to care.  It's obvious with AA is all about the money and NOT the passenger's safety.  With the pandemic continuing they should not be allowed to do this."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Nola N,"For my whole trip, this airline has been trash. Everything was fine until my connecting flight in Dallas. My girlfriend and I had to run to 3 different gates because they kept changing it. We went to the first gate and they told us to go to another. So we went to the other and they told us that we were at the wrong gate. We had 10 minutes to board our flight that was on the other side of the airport. Thankfully, we got there on time and we were already annoyed. When we went up to scan our boarding passes, one of the workers- Betty Harris (yes that’s actually her name) had a horrible attitude with my girlfriend. Betty asked her to scan her BP. While my girl was trying to do that it wasn’t scanning for some reason...then Betty asked for her passport. So of course my girl left the BP on the scanner and tried to grab her passport for Betty. Next thing you know Betty rudely said “NO, SCAN FIRST THEN PASSPORT.” So at this point, we’re both getting more irritated. When my girl went back to scan her BP, Betty grabbed it from her and was breaking the keyboard typing in the BP. When she handed the BP back, my girl gave her the same attitude that she was giving back and grabbed it from her and walked off. Betty had the nerve to ask “Do you want to get on this flight?” Betty- you get what you give. You had no right to act the way that you did and you cannot get offended if they give you the same treatment back. Now coming back home from Dallas. We didn’t fly out until an hour later because they forgot to check something with the motor. When we landed in Nashville, we got a text message saying that our bags were delayed. We looked at the time it was loaded and it was only 20 minutes before we landed. At this point, we’ve had such a horrible experience with this airline our whole trip- it didn’t surprise us that something like this happened.Never again am I flying with this airline. If you’re making your way out to Dallas DEFINITELY pick another airline."
Date of travel: October 2020,30,Trip back from Utah to Tampa,"American Airlines ,did safety protocols,Everyone wearing masks,Flight was full and Crew was good. There is not really any food except a small bag with a water bottle and a cookie. I am not complaining especially with all these Covid cases increasing. Overall was ok Flight"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Terrible airline,"American airlines is the worst airline I have ever taken in my life. You’re better off flying with an airline that is cheaper and will compensate you for their screw ups. My flight going on vacation was switched after everyone was boarded and prepared for takeoff due to “maintenance issues” you would think they knew about these before we even boarded this plane and everyone was ready to takeoff. Had to take another plane which took forever to board,  and then caused me to miss my connecting flight. Majority of the customers had connecting flights and most of them were also missed! My plane going home was also delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight once again! I had to wait in the airport for over 4 hours for the next flight home. No compensation , no remorse , nothing but disappointments guaranteed !  An oh of course “im sorry” which is an insult at this point 😡😡😡. Never again will i fly with this airline I will spend my money else where . This is the customer service line of unhappy guests all complaining and disappointed with American. Save your money dont give it to this crappy airline"
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Does anyone at American Airlines care?,"So you don’t even get a TV? Old outdated planes and service ideas. Either upset or overworked flight attendants & gate agents who rarely seem to care but some do! Nobody smiles or wants to make sure you having a good day or try to make your day! That’s where customer service is failing these days, what happened to you are doing this lone of work because you care about people and experiences?? Please start some really hard thinking of copying Delta airlines!! Or at the least sell to them and make a better company even bigger for the rest of us flying!! Thanks!"
Date of travel: November 2020,20,Horrible Flight,"Our flight 0005 from DFW to HNL was Horrible.  There was engine problems due to debris on runway, which was not AA fault.  But we had to deplane and spent 6hours waiting on replacement plane and another hour plus after finally boarding waiting on replacement crew. AA offered apologies but nothing else.  Part of delay was waiting on Sky Chef, only to be served crackers and a kind bar.  Very Very disappointing with many of your patrons traveling first time to their vacation destination."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,No safety covid protocol,"AA is not a safe airline to use during this pandemic. They could seat families 3 to a seat but because of their desire to make as much money as possible they are not social distancing. They could at least seat families together, but unless you pay extra to choose your seat you sit next to strangers. Children do not have to wear masks so you sit next to them while they cough and sneeze. Since they are cramming as many people as they can on their flights they should at least make an attempt to put families together to lessen the chance of spreading germs to others. I will not be choosing American anytime in the near future if ever again."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,American Airline Gate close on Handicap passengers!!!!!,"There is 4 people in my party and we flew from Cancun to DFW. Our connection flight from DFW to SDF was scheduled, for some reason, with only 1 hour between flights. This is impossible as security only has two lines and customs is in no hurry. American Airlines gate attendent closed the gate even though I told the hateful girl that I was not bording without my friends and they were Handicap. SHE DID NOT CARE... NEVER fly with this horrible airline. They clearly do not care about you or your problems."
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Left A Bitter Taste,"I got a one way ticket to see my grandma with Alaskan because of unforeseen circumstances and was saddened to learn I couldn't get a ticket back with them. Instead I chose American Airlines because it was the most affordable. I visited their website to see how much it would be to check a bag and couldn't find a clear answer. Then checking in my ESA was a nightmare. When I finally got to the airport, the woman at the counter was mumbling and clearly did not want to be there. In fact... none of AA employees I encountered seemed to want to be there. This was the complete opposite experience I had with Alaskan where the captain was animated, the crew smiled, and everyone treated me in kind. Alaskan made me very comfortable flying for the first time with an ESA... making sure we had everything we needed. AA employees side eyed my dog like he was going to do something crazy.  I get that coronavirus is scary but AA didn't even offer water (they tossed sanitary wipes in my bag when boarding) while Alaskan have me a water for both Sam and I, a soda, and snacks. When we landed for my connecting flight I checked the status of my terminal to see if it changed because we arrived late and I only had 15 minutes to board. I asked for assistance to get to the other side of the airport faster as to not miss my connection and the fight attendant told me she knew nothing. Turns out, after stopping to ask for directions, my terminal did change after all.  Glad I asked someone other than American Airlines. No one was helpful the entire trip home."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Thanksgiving hell,"NEVER, EVER fly American!  Aside from the fact that they have been packing planes too full during Covid, endangering everyone.  Aside from the fact that they are well known for some of the worst customer service in the industry.  They changed my existing flight to one an entire DAY later nd never notified me!  When I complained, they blamed the FAA, Covid and me for not checking my flight sooner.  They told me they could cancel the new flight but my refund would have to be REVIEWED by their team.  No explanations for the change, no apologies for the lack of notice and no attempt to make it right.  I'm an AA  frequent flyer and an American credit card holder.  Never again and no more."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Poor service,I flew hungry and thirsty. They never asked if you needed anything. And I flew first class. Don’t waste ypur money for first class
Date of travel: October 2020,10,American Airlines Has Dangerous Covid 19 Practices,"I just had the worst flight experience on American Airlines. First, the gate area has no social distancing and 25 percent of the people at the gate are not wearing masks or wearing them improperly. Then, so that American can charge more for seat upgrades, the flights are no longer boarded rear to front. It is a hodgepodge of people stepping all over each other by profit making ""groups"", again with no social distancing. Once seated, the same 25 percent of people are still not wearing masks or are they are still wearing them improperly. And American flight attendants refuse to do ANYTHING about enforcing the safety guidelines. Some of the attendants don't even wear masks until you catch them in the back row reading magazines.  Lastly, the deplaning process is more chaos as there is no unboarding by row groupings like on other civil airlines and again there is ZERO social distancing. Flight 335 from Miami to Chicago on October 31, 2020. Avoid that flight AND ALL AMERICAN flights for your own personal safety."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,American Airlines = Theft,"Prior to COVID-19 hitting the shores of the U.S., I purchased round-trip tickets from United Airlines and American Airlines for a visit to NYC for the start of baseball season. I'm a Mets fan.The trip was to occur in late March and early April 2020. But COVID-19 was raging in Washington State and NYC, and both states implemented severe travel restrictions. I had to cancel the tickets in late March 2020. I requested refunds from United and American due to state manadated lockdown.United eventually refunded their ticket. American Airlines has, however, refused to refund and denied my subsequent two appeals.An American's customer relations agent claim that I voluntarily canceled the trip and, therefore, was denying my refund request. This agent, instead, offered a travel extension in lieu of the refund that will expire at the end of December 2021. Since I have no plans to travel anytime soon, the economy is collapsing all around us and no one knows when the pandemic will end, so the extension is not a solution for me and unwanted.My last attempt at a refund was to reach out to American Airlines corporate headquarters in October 2020 to inform them they are losing a decades long customer in order to pocket $238.20. The people at corporate sent my letter back to the above mentioned customer relations agent who gleefully left a voicemail informing me they are CHOOSING not to refund the $238.20 and they are SORRY I'm angry about it.I will end this cautionary tale of theft by and utter disgust with American Airlines with the last part of the letter I sent to the CEO:""At this point, I have no recourse other than to accept the fact that American Airlines has decided to criminally pocket my $238.20. If the $238.20 means more to you than keeping me as a lifelong customer, then so be it. Enjoy the $238.20 since you need it, apparently, much more than I do."""
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Broken and unhealthy,"American Airlines has never been my first choice, but when I have orders cut using this airline I have little choice. This flight was supposed to get me home to a sick spouse. It was broken at airport, then at landing it was broken again. I don’t believe the airlines claims to be focused on our safety as they packed the passengers in to pre-pandemic levels showing they really care about their funds. This flight left late and arrived at the gate even later causing me to miss all my connections preventing me from getting home to my sick wife. American was unable to get my luggage for over six hours forcing me to go to lodging with no change of clothes or toiletries. Next flight out they would put me on next morning wouldn’t leave until almost noon. They also refused to change my seat after giving me in of the worst seats on the plane despite arriving more than two hours early. No one in this airline cared about my situation and would only do bare minimum required to get me out of their way and move onto something else. I have better opinion of every other airline over American."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,DO NOT FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES DURING COVID 19 PANDEMIC,"I am Nurse and was appalled how they have no consideration for social distancing. They pack the planes to full capacity. after hearing from a few that AA fills up their flight full; I called customer service to confirm as I was unaware, ams was assured of the safety mechanisms put in place . Was told by customer service that plexy glass was installed in the main cabin;  and that they try to re-seat passengers to allow socially distancing, to later find no plexiglass on the cabin. .  AA will change your flight times based on moving bodies around to ensure all seats are sold out. Everyone is packed in the cabin like a can of sardines! To then, add other flights with various times, and additional stops, showing  a  significant difference from your scheduled flight times ,  ams send you email notifications, asking if you would be willing to change your flight stating  original flight is full capacity! If you agree; there are no accommodations; with the exceptions of no fee to change flights To top it: when we departed back home  from Miami, there were technical issues with the intercom system and sat on the plane for 1 hour, then suddenly the captain gets on the intercom and introduces himself stating he just flew in from Honduras on another flight and was filling in behind the Captain of flight because he tested positive for COVID! Every single passenger packed on that flight heard it! I was appalled; and this was a violation of staff/patient confidential in regards  to protected medical information Customer service provides inaccurate information; amd I formation thar os inconsistent. They have absolutely no consideration l, or compassion for customers other than templates responses, in making some attempts to ensure passenger safety in regards to COVID, other than the obvious global standard of wearing  face mask! During this Pandemic; I would not recommend flying AA whatsoever! I tried to cancel my flight ahead of time to go with another airline; but if you purchase a basic economy, there are no cash refunds, and only a credit toward a future flight to be used within 1 year"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst Customer Service and Company EVER!,"After getting off the plane from SJD, we had two hours before our connector flight departed for Atlanta. It took 1 hour and 30 mins for our bags to arrive before we could go through customs, recheck bags, and then security. So to say the least, we missed our connector flight. Customer service agents at gate was insensitive and then told us we would be placed on standby for something that was NOT OUR FAULT! We were not offered a meal voucher, not even an apology. Then told if we couldn't get on that flight we didn't have another option until the next day and we wouldn't be offered any compensation to get a hotel either. This was a total disgrace! We called into customer service over the phone and got 3 people who did absolutely nothing. Meanwhile we watched several other customers cursing out gate agents because of their bad attitudes and lack of solutions to these problems. We will never fly American Airlines again! We will also be reporting this to other review platforms to warn customers about this. This was a sad way to end such a great vacation!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Packed flight - no consideration for COVID,"It is the middle of a pandemic.

Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst airline EVER,These people are total scanners. They will do anything in their power to make sure they take your money.  My flight was canceled by them due to covid-19 they told me I had a credit. I ended up having to pay double the price for the ticket that I had already purchased. I could not get a refund. They charged me double to use my credit. I will never fly with these people again. Make sure you don't either !
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Total scam!!!!!,This company is a scam. They cancelled my flight and told me that now I have to take another flight 3 hours later than the time of original one. I could not do that because of business meeting. They  just canceled my flight and never got me refund. I have to go thru two weeks of refund process and I doubt that it will be approve. TThis is fraud.I just paid for product that I did not receive!!!
Date of travel: October 2020,10,I just got a notice that my airlines miles will expire in January. Really??,"I just got a notice that my American Airlines miles will expire in January. Really?? The other airlines have extended them until end of 2021. AA wants me to fly (when I have no place to go) or buy more miles! Customer service says yep, that's the deal. I say I WILL NEVER FLY AA AGAIN! Clueless company!!!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Unsafe for covid travel,"Flight and airport gates absolutely jam packed. Many passengers with masks not covering noses- although rules were announced, no enforcement of rules. The man Employed scanning tickets at boarding gate even had his mask not covering his nose through the entire boarding of the plane. Planes are 100% filled to capacity & in my row was a >400 lb man sitting on his seat and half mine. No way to stay distanced. They should offer bariatric seats for these passengers to make it safer and better for other passengers. I flew into New Orleans through southwest & it felt relatively safe- open middle seats, gates not overcrowded, everyone respecting mask rules (staff and passengers). This was a completely different experience and I will not be flying American Airlines again unless they make some major changes."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Their baggage delivery is HORRIBLE!!!!!!,I freaking hate these American Airlines!!!!I go first class so I can get my bags first so I can make it directly to my meetings. My driver has had to circle 4 times and I'm passed. It has been 35 minutes and still no bags nor any help from AA. I talked to the AA attendant and he didn't even call in or anything. Just said it's coming
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Great people,Pilot was great and informed. Colleen was very professional and best personality. Lynn was fill of info and very helpful and concerned for all passengers. Love this airline!
Date of travel: October 2020,10,American Airlines lost me as a customer,"American Airlines just lost a lifetime customer with me today. They lost my baggage that had essential medical equipment in and have completely absolved themselves of helping me locate it. I was directed to Wheresmysuitcase.com to track its location, but the delivery never came when it was supposed to and no one has updated me since. I called back to American Airlines to let them know about the situation and they couldn’t have cared less. They also refused to give me the contact information for the company tasked with shipping the baggage to my home.This isn’t the first time they’ve lost my baggage and I’ve had a difficult time getting it back either. Each time is the same story, no one else wants to take responsibility in helping me."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Non- Stop Booked,I booked my flight non-stop from LAX to Eugene to visit my daughter and grandchildren. My flight was changed without me knowing until I went to check-in to a connecting flight leaving earlier arriving later and then returning super earlier. I called the customer service number and the lady said they changed the flight to non connecting because they didn't sell enough tickets so the flight has to go to a hub. She was able to help me change my return flight to a later time but I am still upset because I lose precious time with my family. They offered nothing in return. I have to book a hotel room in LA now because I live 3 hours from the airport and my new connecting flight leaves 2 1/2 hours earlier then the original and gets in an hour after. The return flight leaves 2 1/2 hours earlier then original schedule as well.  No compensation... I will never use American Airlines again!!!!!! I would give them no stars if I could.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst Experience Ever - ZERO social distancing,"Zero social distancing, a joke of an in-flight service, everyone crammed in. Many not wearing masks or wearing masks hanging off their faces, no one in charge or who could give a rats a**. It has been over a decade since my last appalling flight with AA. Never again."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,What a joke!!!! Let down - Dirty - and Cheated!,"So bad!!! This was my first time flying during the Covid-19 pandemic and I was shocked! The plane was dirty, there was absolutely NO SOCIAL DISTANCING and they are using COVID-19 to be lazy! There was no food service, even for the flight that was 6 hours long! Just drinks! Why can you had out drinks but not pre-packaged food!!!?Additionally, I had to change my return flight to another airline and was assured that I would receive a credit. Well I called today and sure I get a credit - but it's only good for the same route!!! So if I ever find myself in Hawaii with no return flight home - I can use the credit. What a joke!! Everything I read and was told by the agent on the phone was that I would receive a credit! No one mentioned that it had to be for the same route. Well needless to say, I flew home on Delta to help my daughter with her kids and what a difference!!! The plane was not only extremely clean, they also handed us wipes as we got on if we wanted to wipe down our area even more! They also used social distancing on the plane! There were empty seat between travelers. They also had these baggies with an individual hand sanitizer, a Kind bar, a bag of Cheezits, and a water. And on the the 6 hour flight, they gave us this twice. American Airlines is the worst and they have definitely lost a costumer! I feel let down and cheated!! Never again!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Horrible Airline Experience  - Total Sh*t Show,"Flight 1613 from SJU to MIA was delayed by 4 hours resulting in a missed connecting flight from MIA to LAS. Was told by counter agent and customer service assistant (via phone) that since we would be spending the night in Miami (due to missed connection) we would be able to receive our checked in bags. Upon entering baggage claim, bags were not available. Went to the Baggage Assistance counter in Miami Airport and all 3 women working the counters were rude as hell, gossiped among themselves and were dismissive to myself and other customers in line. Told me it would take 2-8 hours to receive bags (with no guarantee). AA needs to educate their Baggage Assistance Counter staff in handling weary flyers. After dealing with a 4.5 hour delay due to mechanical plane issues, a missed connection flight (which was previously upgrade to first class - not have to submit for a refund), not having luggage (which contained medications) and then being forced to spend the night in a mediocre Miami airport hotel, the least they could do is provide some type of high level of customer service to tired flyers. As a result of this and previous past experiences, I can not ever recommend or have a positive outlook of American Airlines.  As an airline struggling to generate revenue from the impact of covid19 , I would imagine that you retain the best staff members - but in all honesty, 90% of staff I encountered were straight up rude. To top the icing on the cake, when we finally arrived back to Las Vegas, one luggage was missing and still back in Miami.Will definitely never fly AA again."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,A pandemic terror!!!  Do not flight AA,It was the worst flight of my life.  I'm not one of those who doesnt leave the house because of COVID but a complete full plane???? and from Florida???  I don't think AA is following the COVID protocol;  there was no social distancing at all in that plane.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,"Bitten by a bedbug, response from AA completely inadequate, they  simply they are not interested.","I flew west on SW, good social distancing, no issues.  Flew back on AA, abut 4 weeks later.  I received a single bedbug bite, classical, 4 bites in an arc, 3/8"" to 1/2"" slightly raised red bumps that appeared two days after the flight.Advised AA.  Response was really inappropriate.  A single bedbug can lay 50 eggs in two weeks.  Two weeks later there can be 2500.  AA has experience with bedbugs as well as other airlines.What miffs me is the response indicates not a single effective effort will be made.  ""Routine"" pest control does NOT stop bedbugs.""Prior to the flight I stayed at one place for 3 weeks with one rental car.  I'm expert at Bedbug detection--there were none in my room.  The bites are classical.  The timing is classical. AA seems to have more bedbug issues than other airlines based upon an internet search.  Now, I see why.  Ignore them at passengers peril.I am very lucky that I recognized the bites, and took remedial efforts to make sure that any eggs/nymphs or bugs that may have come back with me did not infest my house.  That, dear reader, is the real nightmare."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst company ever!,"Soo I just have to say I will never fly American Airlines again in my life. A almost 500 plane ticket on a round trip was utter disaster! I traveled out of Orlando to Iowa flight was fine! My return flight a week and three days later was delayed at 11am for a leave time originally for 3:15pm. As time got closer my flight was delayed again and it left me 34 minutes to make my connecting flight so I called American Airlines to double check if I would make my connecting flight due to delay and if I didn’t what would happen. I was told by the representative that it normally takes 30 minutes from one gate to another at Dallas and I should make it if I didn’t due to it being a issue on their end I would receive a hotel voucher and they would get me on next available flight. I said okay thanks and hoped for the best. My flight than was delayed again shortly after only leaving my 9 minutes from land time to connecting flight departed time. Sooo.. I said let’s be safe rather than sorry so I called airline again. I was told again I might not make connecting flight but they may hold the connecting flight but if I didn’t I would get a voucher. Again short time later flight was delayed again and my arrival was 15 minutes after connecting flight departure time, not ten minutes later while on hold my flight was delayed again and American Airlines send my a app notification they rebooked my connecting flight as I would miss it and I had to confirm the change. So when a representative got on the phone I asked what was going on how do I confirm and what happens when I get to Dallas with no connecting flight til 8:50 the next morning. She said your confirmed on that new flight and we will give you a voucher at the gate when you land. I get to check in at Iowa airport lady tells me same thing on how next flight was moved and go to gate for voucher when I arrive. I take flight.. now mind you flight was suppose to get there at 5:56pm. I arrived at 8:20pm. I go to gate and the lady tells me there is no voucher due to it being weather issues. I said no this isn’t right I spoke to numerous people from your company prior to taking this flight here so I knew what would be the turn out. She said well I can’t help you. So I asked for a supervisor. Needless to say I waited a total of 55 minutes for a supervisor to come to the gate to speak to me and while I was waiting I got back on phone with American and the person I spoke to told me we are going to give u a voucher tell the supervisor on our end it shows flight delayed due to crew. So when I spoke to supervisor and he said it was due to weather and I wasn’t getting a voucher I said what I was told to say and the supervisor says yes due to crew due to weather so I’m sorry we have no options for you. So I asked if there were any earlier flights due to the fact I didn’t select the flight. He stated no and told me have a good night. So I went and got my bag from baggage claim found a hotel close for 80$ and ordered a Lyft for 22$. As I’m checking on my next flight which was on my app to check the terminal for next flight I realize my flight is now gone. I again on way to hotel I now am paying for in the Lyft I am paying for call American again. They tell me the last person internally at the airport I spoke to cancelled my flight. So this supervisor didn’t like me arguing with him so he just decided to cancel my flight on me to be spiteful? What if I didn’t check?? I would of been stuck?? Please people do not fly American! They lie and they treat you like absolute garbage!  Update on response from them: I put in a customer relations complaint as I was told and I just got off the phone with a lady who stated that they will not do anything for me. As it was all due to weather issues this was my personal problem and personal choice to get on that flight. I said your agents, not one not two but 5 reassured me I would be fine and get a voucher and I was ok to get on the flight! I said your company lied to me and gave me false information 5 times! I said your also telling me a supervisor cancelling my rebooked flight is ok? She said we can’t see who cancelled it for all we know it was you. I said if I did it why would I call and ask what happened why isn’t my flight showing up? And get put on same flight? They claim they can’t see any calls nor are none recorded and they claim they can’t see what representative cancels or adds flights! Needless to say they will not do anything at all barely apologized!!! American Airlines is the worst company ever and I will make sure it is known! They also don’t practice social distancing, every flight is at full capacity not a empty seat! #DontflyAmericanAirlines"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,I'd rather drive across the country than ever fly with American Airlines again.,"I am shocked that they are not practicing social distancing and they don't even tell you until you are about to board the plane.  I had to sit in a middle seat between two strangers  for 6 hours during a global pandemic, the plane was so full I had to check my bag because there was no more space in overhead compartments. There's a sign saying that they spray the seats with an antiviral coating twice a week but no other signs that the seats are cleaned between flights, there was trash in the seat back compartment of my seat.   They could at least tell you what you're signing up for when you buy the ticket, I wrongly assumed I could trust their judgement on health and safety measures. Customer service is also the worst.  I left my phone at the gate and realized it just as I sat down, people were still boarding but they would not let me get off to quickly get my phone. I was cooperative since they said they could just mail it to me when I got home.  I've been home for a week now, I've located the exact location of my phone on the find my iPhone app which says it is sitting at the guest services station at the American Airlines, but every time I call they say that they don't have it and now I believe they are intentionally not answering my calls. Minimum effort public safety.  Minimum effort customer service.  I almost regret taking the trip, might have to pay big $$$ for a new phone and could easily have contracted COVID-19."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst airline ever!!,"I was flying out of Appleton, WI to Oklahoma City for my brother in laws funeral.  When I got to Appleton they delayed my flight when I was asking the front desk lady she had no information for me and kept saying no to everything I asked then another lady helped and found me a different flight but adding a stop and making me arrive 5 hours later than planned which was better than landing 7 hours later.  The woman accused me of getting defensive but then later came and apologized and said she moved me to first class because of all the inconvenience.  I got to Chicago to catch my flight and I did not receive first class which really is ok but they ended up delaying 25mins.  When I got to Dallas I had 20 mins to catch my connecting flight.  Which I made it and still no first class.  Also when contacting American Airlines regarding all this they were extremely rude and basically said well you made it and that’s our only obligation.  The delays and problems with my first flight were due to mechanical issues and runway issues.  My flight home on Tuesday got cancelled, I rebooked and that got cancelled they offered me a flight 10 hours later than my original one when contacting them I was told it was my only option.  It was due to weather they said except plenty of other flights were not cancelled with other airlines.  I ended up cancelling the flight and booking with a different airline.  I will never fly with American airline and would highly recommend no one else does."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,American Airlines in a time of COVID19,"I flew to Orlando from Philadelphia on Oct 15th and back on October 25th. For any one flying in a time of COVID... I highly encourage you to CHOOSE ANOTHER AIRLINE. American is NOT encouraging basic CDC guidelines and has done nothing to tailor the boarding process to encourage social distancing. Simple things like encouraging spacing while waiting to board seem like the least they could be doing now. They are also not blocking middle seats. Additionally, their planes are hot since it seems they have not found a way to keep them cool without blowing air around to much. They are not investing in protecting you as a customer... DO NOT PROTECT THEM from the financial crisis. My seat's tablet also did not work so it's clear they aren't doing upkeep on their planes... doubt they are cleaning well. I will encourage all friends and family to NOT fly with them... there are WAY better and safer options right now."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,The CDC would fall off their chairs,"I took 3 flights this past weekend, 2 were American and 1 was Spirit and surprisingly enough, spirit actually practiced social distancing while American had a FULL flight, strangers next to strangers, completely crowded and not practicing social distancing. Just behind me I had someone coughing up a storm the whole fight. I was in disbelief on how crowded it was and how much they didn’t care about sanitation ? Spirit was a totally different ball game, they sat every other seat, provided sanitation and you can tell the seats had just been cleaned. I’m never flying American again if they can’t take the health of their customers as first priority. Not to mention the customer service was atrocious and maybe it was because it was 6am but I’ve never had such a bad experience in an airline."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst Airline Ever - Customer Service is Disgusting,"I will never book a flight with American Airlines in the future.Their way of treating customers is disgusting.They cancelled my direct flight from Montreal to JFK, cause I have to get to another country with Delta the same day.  I was looking for information regarding my flight and learned they cancelled the flight. I called and talked to customer service, the lady offered to book me with Air Canada but it was Laguardia Airport, not JKF. I am flying with my autistic son, so I told her I need to think about because I have to get to JFK with 4 luggages and my autistic son.I called 3 days later, they refused to book me to another flight, they told me that the representative made a mistake, she can't just book me with another airline.I talk to two supervisors, they told me either they book me to a flight that will take 23hours to get to JFK (2 stops) with my autistic son or I can get my money back.This is my first time experiencing anything like this with any airline, American Airline is the worst airline I have ever dealt with and this is my last."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,The worst airline ever,"DO NOT FLY AMERICAN! We were trying to fly home from Cancun and had a layover at DFW. We spent two hours waiting at baggage claim to get our bags, go through customs and re check them. They repeatedly told us our bags were “being unloaded”...two hours later, they finally came out on the carousel and we missed our connecting flight. They rescheduled our flight for the next day and tried to put us up in a super sketchy hotel. We had to spend over $200 to get our own decent hotel. Worst service, no honesty about the situation and awful people to deal with."
n/a,10,Left without us,"My wife and I are delayed on our first flight from Houston. AA notified us at departure time that we were waiting on a piece of equipment. We arrived at our departure gate in Dallas 4 minutes after our departure time. Our plane was still at the gate for another ten minutes or more while we tried to find another flight home. We weren't the only ones and they clearly knew we were coming, but they left without us anyway."
n/a,10,They stole my paid for first class seats,"They say the carecEvery step of the way?My experience yesterday was1. A gate agent who refused to back me up on a later flight when I was going to miss my connection.2. Being told onboard a 20 minute connection between concourses in Dallas was sufficient.3. Being berated for attempting to quickly exit the aircraft and not standing patiently letting everyone without connections exit first.4. Having to run between gates to find my connecting flight boarding closed...however Kudos to the gate agent who managed to still get me on.5. Taking away my first class seat and sticking me in a middle seat in coach.6. The chat agent telling me if I wanted a refund of the difference in first class vs coach fare, I was not eligible for any compensation for all of the American Airlines screw-ups.Yep. Sounds like that is all taking care of you every step of the way."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst Airline Ever,American Airlines has to be the worst when it comes to customer service. If you want an airline that takes into account your needs this is not the airline to fly with. They are unaccommodating whether it be you missed your flight or even if one of their own flights made you miss a connecting flight. They will close gates even if you are 5 minutes late from your connecting flight and misinform you about the instructions to make sure you’re on the next flight if you missed one. I was on standby and the agent never told me I needed to check in which stopped me from getting on a flight. I would fly Southwest or Untied in a heart beat compared to American. Absolutely the worst airline I’ve ever flown.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,COVID?  What COVID?,"I have been flying on DELTA and have been impressed with their attempts at preventing the spread of COVID.  They leave empty seat, They board from the back to the front, the hand out Sanitizing Wipes as you board.  Their waiting areas are littered with reminders of distancing.  THEN, This weekend I had the unfortunate pleasure of Flying American.  CLEARLY they are as a company completely oblivious to Social Distancing and their responsibility to the general public to maintain a safe environment.  Had 4 flights in three days.  EVERY flight had every seat filled.  Their procedures are no different from prior to the virus.  They have ZERO hand sanitizing stations in their boarding area. They boarded the flights in groups.  Groups 1-5 had about 15% of the flight. Group 6 Had about 60% of the passengers all cramming to get on board like the plane was going to leave them.  One of the flight attendants was sniffling and wheezing, I cant say she was infected BUT... Sure looked it.  REALLY?  My Opinion.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS AIRLINE!!!!"
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Do not fly AA if you’re worried about COVID,They had full capacity on both our flights and packed us all in like sardines when boarding and on the plane. It was crazy and very uncomfortable in the current climate with COVID-19.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Non-masked Russian large group- no enforcement of mask rule,"There was a large group of Russians on our flight. I am not against Russians at all but against people who BLATANTLY disregard others, and others' health in a place that you cannot social distance. They kept their masks below their nose or chin. Would not put them up when I asked nicely. We spent a whole week taking extreme precautions and it just started bothering me that this group was going to jeopardize our trip in the last two hours. They were told they could not stand until the seat in front left. They got up and stood for 15 -20 minutes 2 inches away from me. I finally asked for help. AA just said put your masks on right.....Why weren't they asked to sit back down? AA went past dozens of times. Why they didn't say anything the whole 2 hours? There was an elderly couple trapped back there by the window. Just wear your da#n masks if it is the policy on the flight. You don't own the airline and until you do, follow policy. They have a right to make whatever rule they want and deny service because they own the plane you are on."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Avoid American Airlines,"Avoid American if possible. They’re not serving food on this flight and they give you what they call a snack bag - xsmall water and a cracker, no charging station, small compact area, and no movies. The service was so-so. This was a first class flight and just imagine the conditions of the other areas on the plane."
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Just No!,"I had hopes that this airline would be better than some of them like Frontier, because we were supposed to have a direct flight from Los Angeles to Orlando and back. But my family was treated worse than what I would have received from Frontier. My seat was small causing me to sit in my neighbors lap. Everyone else had a tv except for me and no one came by to tell me where to find it so I had to burn my battery down to the last few drops of power. Which caused me a delay of 15 minutes so I could charge it to get to the rent a car location through Uber. So not looking forward to flying with them again."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,This airline is a joke,"I will never fly American Airlines again in my life.  What an absolute disaster this whole experience has been.   On the way out to Flagstaff, I paid for an internet package for the duration of the flight and was never able to connect to the internet.  I then tried using their App to stream movies and lost service at least a dozen times.  Then, on the day I'm supposed to fly back home, I get a text message at 3:30AM that my flight home was delayed by 40 minutes and that it ""may"" cause me to miss my connecting flight in Phoenix -- it was cutting it close but after calling the airport in Phoenix to get advice, I decided to stick with the original flight.  Found out after I arrived at the Flagstaff airport that the reason the flight was delayed is because they didn't have a crew to fly the plane, and that they STILL had not found a crew to fly it less than an hour before we were supposed to depart.  WHY  WOULD THEY NOT JUST CANCEL THE FLIGHT?  Sure enough, now the flight was delayed by almost 2 hours, and there was no way I was going to make my connecting flight in Phoenix so I asked the flight attendant at the gate to change my flight to the morning.  I attempted to check in on the app for my flight in the morning AND upgrade my seat to an aisle... it processed a $61.82 payment twice (shown in my bank account) but kept loading an error message saying that ""seat selection is unavailable at this time.""  I called American Airlines to tell them I had been charged twice for a seat I still didn't have a reservation for, and could they please change my seat.  The woman on the phone said that something hadn't been transferred correctly at the Flagstaff airport so that it showed me as having left on the original flights.  She also said they didn't have a record of the two $61.82 payments and that because I had already checked in, they couldn't change my seat and I would have to wait until I go to the airport tomorrow to do it.  She ""thinks"" the charges will be refunded.  I will never, never, never fly with American Airlines again.  What an unprofessional pile of s*** this airlines is."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Problems after problems,"After speaking to customer service involving a change in flight schedule (2 total), both were change to the same flight (day and time). They were SUPPOSED to be different. Being a trusting person who apparently didn't see the mistake until last minute, we had to change the flight. No big deal, forgot to triple check. When comes time a couple hours before the flight, low and behold, the flight is delayed and we have to select a different connecting flight, making this whole process a complete headache. Will never fly with AA again!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Unsafe travel,"Flew American airlines and noticed that they aren't following the Covid-19 protocol, there's no social distancing at all, not even at their airport. During your travel there's ""No distancing"" with seating either, horrible landings from the planes - just horrible."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Horrible Check in Website and communications,"The check in procedure and communications from AA was non-existence and horrible. No pre-check in communications at all. No text, no email, no nothing. Then the website to check in makes checking in impossible. Poorly designed interface. Also no number to call to get help. When I locate the number, no humans on the phone to help. 40 minute wait for help. No chat, no email support."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Never fly American Airlines,"Flight from Atlanta to Charlotte was delayed. I understand weather cannot be controlled. However I landed in CLT and only had 15 minutes to get to the next gate. I literally ran and got to the gate only to be told the gate was closed. The flight wasn't scheduled to depart for 10 more minutes. I understand once the doors are closed they can't open again, but they should have waited a few minutes. They knew the flight was on the ground. Funny how they can be late an hour and a half but they couldn't wait 5 minutes for connecting passengers. Now I'm stuck for 5 hours until the next flight tonight and AA offers no concession for this. I could have driven and got there faster without all the aggravation. I knew I should have flown Delta. They at least have more flights."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Vacation ruined,"Had plans a nice trip to Fort Lauderdale. But flight cancelled due to rain delay then flight crew timed out. How can a flight crew time out before the plane can even fly. And now we barely get a flight and no one says sorry or even offers a rebate of some sort for the inconvenience. American needs to fix this ASAP. This is not good business practice to an airline during specially during covid year. I will not fly American during this time of year, Unhappy passenger 10/23/2020"
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Lost and found,"I didn’t even know my wallet was gone when my name was called at my gate, only 5 minutes before we boarded. Someone had turned it in at the lounge and they found out where I was going and had it brought to the gate. Fantastic service, I really appreciate not having to track this down."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Emergency landing,"Was handled terribly, staff were very unprepared and caused panic through the entire plane. Will never be flying with them again."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,If you purchase 1st class tickets you should be able to sit in 1st class seats,I purchased 2 first class tickets to transport my mother with sever osteoporosis from the east coast to the west coast. I was told that it was not guaranteed to have the seats even though I paid for them. I had to force an almost 80 year old person with 3 broken verabre in their back into a coach seat because they sold me the seats and said sorry it's not guaranteed. After reaching the west coast I found out she had an additional broken verabre due to this issue. I want a full refund due to the empty promise of first class seats and it never happened. I will NEVER use this airline again. I have filed a complaint with the BBB and I am going to all media outlets so others aren't taken advantage of.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,I should call this racist like liberals do!,Made me turn my shirt inside out cause im to american and they thought my shirt was too offensive. Was trying to make me leave the airport.
Date of travel: October 2020,20,"Technically American Eagle, I guess - I'll keep Delta, thanks.","I usually fly Delta. Here and then other airlines either have prices that are too good to say no, or you really have no other options due to schedule. Mine was the later. The flight from SJD to PHX was great. Great crew, and the pilots were amazingly friendly keeping us informed. The flight from PHX to SLC...with the PHX based crew was completely the opposite. As I was boarding I greeted the flight attendant lady...she looked into my eyes and turned her head to look at the person behind me. However, when my bag got stuck as I was turning from the plane to into the isle, she quickly wipped a ""you need to learn to drive that""...but not in a humorous tone, but an irritated one...she missed a great opportunity.Then as I got to my seat I started putting my bag under the front seat and the flight attendant in the read section quickly came to me and said ""you'll need to dispatch that bag"", but I knew it fitted because I had traveled with that bag many times in small regional jets. As I she was talking to me, between fitting the bag and putting my CPAP on the overhead bin, I ended up hitting my head twice in the overhead bin...no issue, didn't hurt, it was just loud...but on the second time I hit, as the flight attentant says, ""oh geez...and to think you should have learned you lesson by now..."" then she turns and walks away. This PHX crew had nothing but old cranky flight attendants. Flight deck didn't provide any update all during the whole flight. Terrible service...just terrible. I'm not saying I'll never fly with them again...but they will NEVER be my first choice."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,No Covid 19 precautions flight 2748,"American airlines is not safe, it is putting the lives of Americans at risk. There is no social distancing on the flight, as it is on Delta and Alaska. This is the last time me, any member of my family and my close friends will fly American airlines."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Bad service,Super bad service! The lady that we had was super racist and did not help at all!! I do not recommend this airline to anyone if you want good service and helpful people you gotta go to delta!!! This is the WORST!
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Packed in tight,My daughter and I flew on American appx 1week ago and the plane was packed! Every seat filled. The flight attendants were not very friendly and they barely went up and down the isles. Last month my husband and I flew on another airline to Cancun and they kept seats open in between strangers due to Covid. Also When I got to me seat after boarding there were crumbs in my seat. Obviously not cleaning well.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,No social distancing,They packed this plane like sardines & don’t even offer/pass out anything to drink or snack on like delta & southwest. Over packed then had the nerve to have animals that were too big to fit in a carryon cage. Just terrible will not fly again
Date of travel: October 2020,50,One of the most safest and caring airlines of all time,"As an advantage member traveling 4-6 times a month personal and business the service, ontime, comfort, and equipment I enjoying flying with this airlines specially in the Airbus 319-320 airplanes better than B737 only deficiencies will be airport at St Croix terminal, facilities and boarding process can be little confusing like still 50 years stuck in the past, advantage program still need some better improvement but its Ok ... keep up the good work AA team"
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Great experience,"Great experience on this flight. The airplane was the cleanest I have seen for US flight. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful, as were the gate staff.on entry to the plane, we were each handed a bag containing a bottle of water, a packet of cookies, and an alcohol wipe. I was very surprised to have free in-flight entertainment on a US flight, it was very good as well.I was very pleased overall."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Lack of face mask compliance by flight staff,"On the first flight, one stewardess was wearing a (literally) “see through” facemask, much like a knitting that revealed her nose and mouth. The second stewardess wore a mask that did not cover her nose. Neither of them seemed to be concerned with passengers who did not use their own masks.On the second flight, the captain and co-pilot both appeared in the passenger cabin at various times. Neither of them wore any masks.After corresponding with customer relations, AA admitted that their staff was out of compliance."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Do NOT even bother,"I booked a flight with American months ago for a trip to Las Vegas because it was a decent deal and the times for the flights were what I needed. They were following mask protocol but there is NO social distancing I mean this was an overbooked flight. Then on my return trip which I had booked over four months in advance they changed the time on me with less than twenty four hours notice! Absolutely no phone call, an email just 13 hours before my new departure time and then I was on hold for thirty minutes during my vacation to try and switch back and they said they had NO flights during the window of time I needed to get back. My flight was originally scheduled at 7:30 pm and they changed it (with less than a days notice, mind you) to 1 pm. Over a 6 hour difference and offered me nothing with a suitable window of time. Either I stay an extra night in a city I don’t live in, miss my doctors appointment the next morning and possibly work, or I get on a flight they’ve rescheduled for six hours earlier which isn’t possible since I’ve budgeted my time in Vegas to be away from the airport and back just two hours before my flight. So after being on hold for twenty minutes and receiving info on how to apply online for a refund since you can’t get one over the phone, I receive the refund weeks later, and only for the amount of the return trip. Which is nothing compared to the 300$ last minute flight I needed to book with another airline because AMERICAN has no sense of customer service. I cannot believe my tax dollars went to funding these jerk’s stock buybacks. Use them if you want but DO NOT expect that your flight is actually your flight, cause it might not be."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Unreliable service and even worse customer service,"After several poor experiences with both the airline itself and the ensuing lack of customer service, I wanted to warn others. Most recently they left me stranded in a connection city and I was forced to pay for accommodations. They also delivered my luggage (after losing it for 24 hours) soaking wet which ruined several items inside. After several attempts to contact customer service and ask for reimbursement for accommodations ($100), I finally received a reply saying sorry but we don’t cover that. After similar situations in the past, long story short is they are unreliable and have 0 customer service."
Date of travel: October 2020,30,That's all!,"Is this the sign of the times?  I am a working person who has to save, plan, save and plan.  We have been saving along with buying points to travel somewhere.  This Covid deal dealt us a bad hand so plans change.  I used our points we worked hard to buy, booking First Class Tickets to Arkansas.  All we received for three times the money was, bags checked free, a wider seat, and first boarding.  NO FOOD.  No headphones.  Yes, That's all.  This was suppose to be special ---- First Class.  Not worth it.  We had a long layover coming back so I Paid to use the Admirals Lounge.  That also was not worth the money."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,"SSHO, CHST",Horrible ratty airline forced me to stay in filthy North Windham Hotel. Disgusting very poor service . Long lines. Proprietress unprofessional
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Flight rescheduled. No refunds.,Booked my flight 3 months ahead of time. 1 month goes by and they rescheduled my flight for 3hours and 53mins earlier. I called to get a refund because I couldn’t make that flight time due to not being able to take off work earlier. They said they cannot issue a refund because they did not change the times by more than 4 hours... They then told us to talk to Priceline (who we booked it through). Priceline said the same thing and they would be able to change to a different flight but there were no later flights available. I am now out over $600 because of 7minutes...
Date of travel: October 2020,10,HORRIBLE,"Worst experience of my life. As we were sitting waiting for our plane to start boarding a male flight attendant called out a young man who was standing in a corner away from everyone with his mask lowered (he was on a phone call) loudly in a very disrespectful tone telling him to put up his mask. After a minute or so the flight attendant  from three rows away from the young man points his finger at him yelling you yes you, pull up your mask. Asked him if he is going to Seattle, young man answered that he is , the flight attendant said he will not get on a plane if he doesn’t have his mask on... ??? how the heck is that relevant. We were not even boarding yet. I have no problem with mandated masks. I do have a problem with individuals abusing their power and humiliating another human being in front of strangers. You can discreetly come up and ask for his mask to be pulled up. That was so not OK. i’ll add one thing. I was sitting next to my husband with my mask pulled down as well and that flight attendant had no problem with that. But this poor young black man got yelled at, and humiliated in front of many folks! NO Professionalism whatsoever. That young flight attendant needs to APOLOGIZE.  never in my life thought id see something so stupid...  that but I had my blood boiling... American Airlines, you already have enough issues on your hands please train your flight attendants a little  professionalism."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Never Guaranteed,"American has been my least favorite to fly. Their connections are constantly changing gates and every single one of my flights has been delayed. If you would like a stress free travel experience, I would recommend Delta or Southwest."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Delays As Usual,"This flight is already delayed over 4 hours and this is the norm with American Airlines, not the exception.  Both flights to our destination we’re delayed due to maintenance and now our return flight is delayed for the same reason. We have now missed our connecting flight (as often occurs with American Airlines delays). Over the last few years we have experienced more delays with American than not. What a joke. This is why they rank so poorly most recent years among available domestic US airlines. American Airlines will likely increase your loss in time and money as you are delayed and even stuck in other cities."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst airline ever!!!,I’m flying from Sacramento airport Joplin Missouri airport. I paid for first class on both planes and they cancel the second flight and put me and my husband on a smaller plane with no first class. They did put us in the exit row on the second plane but because I’m considered handicap I could not sit there and wanted my husband to sit there and they changed his seat to and was not able to let him sit in an exit row and he is a very tall person. They were very rude to me on the phone I will never recommend American Airlines to anybody. I’m even selling my stock with American Airlines. They won’t even give us a refund for the difference from first class to Coach.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Covid Precautions,"If you need to fly and you’re worried about being affected by COVID, do not fly with American Airlines. They have been packing their flights and their aircraft doesn’t seem nearly as clean as United. It’s almost as if the only precaution American Airlines has taken is making everyone wear a mask during take off and landing."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Dangerous airline to be avoided,"My husband and I bought first class tickets for our trip to Florida. Unfortunately we didn’t realize that American Airlines was disregarding health experts recommendations about social distancing. Each and every seat was sold and the American Airline gate B12 at the Charlotte Airport was very crowded. We tried our best to socially distance, however, it was quite impossible. I contacted American Airlines Customer Service and received a unhelpful and dismissive response. We will certainly avoid this airline in the future as it is obvious they put profit over the safety of their customers."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,A Dangerous Trip,"n 40 years of flying one of the worst flights. check-in the staff was on the rude side, condescending, and curt. After taking a Delta Flight to Bradley in this era of Covid-19, there was social distancing, middle seat empty, wipes given out, cleaning of the plane and baggies given for goodies along with mask enforcement. I flew American Back - what a mess. Went from Bradley to charlotte. 3 gate changes, no enforcement of masks (literally saw customers pulling masks down to talk!), boarding was part of the ""Herd Mentality"" groups of people literally touching. The Airlines does not leave the middle seat empty and I was literally touching the guy next to me. No wipes, no enforcement of masks (again seeing people wear them on their chin. the guy in back of me I think was sick. If I get sick, I will be holding American Airlines responsible. I will not fly them again at least during this pandemic as I am not part of the ""herd."" They also gave you no food on a flight over 5 Hours and we were late getting in. If you are a ""herd"" person, this is the airline for you!"
Date of travel: October 2020,40,"Not bad, not great","I can’t remember if I’ve ever flown with American Airlines before but this was not what I expected. It’s so uncomfortable. The seats are in this curved shape that forces your head to hang a bit. Hard to get comfortable in a +2 hour long flight. However, aside from that, the flight was pretty awesome. A carry on and personal item is allowed at no charge. Huge win! They give you a bottle of water and a cookie. Nice little touch. The flight was also very affordable. The check-in for the flight was seamless. I would probably fly with them again if the price was right."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,AA?  Never again!,"Do NOT trust that AA will honor a voucher if you choose to take a later flight.  I gave up my seat in June 2019 with a year-long voucher that I have not been able to use until now due to COVID.  I was told not to lose the voucher (which the voucher also states).  I used part of the voucher last fall and found it was a NIGHTMARE to use.  I had to either mail it in for a flight I wanted (in which case they could take up to 2 weeks to process and risk there being no more seats on the plane) OR make a reservation on hold and then go to the airport.  I had read reviews that AA claimed some of the mailed in vouchers ""never arrived."" So, I chose to go to the airport (40 mins away) and used part of the voucher.  The attendant gave me back a photocopy of the voucher to use for another flight.  I haven't been flying due to COVID, but I did write the airline for an extension, which they granted.  I reserved another flight yesterday and went to the airport today to use the rest of the voucher, along with the printed copy of the AA e-mail from them.  The counter attendants would not even look at the e-mail and would not take the photocopy, even though it was one of their attendants there who gave it to me (and I've been carefully guarding it ever since.)  There is apparently no way for them to check on ANYTHING and they kept insisting that I had to have the original voucher (which I had surrendered) .  They were the RUDEST airport personnel I have ever dealt with.  I would never have passed up my flight and taken the voucher in the first place if I had known their complicated procedure as I had only ever used a voucher with Delta.  Delta is SUPER easy - there is a number on the voucher that you enter when you book a flight, and just keep entering it until all the money on the voucher has been used.I have taken my last flight with AA and the company seems not to realize that poor customer service in this day of social media will hurt them a LOT more than honoring my last part of the voucher for a fairly inexpensive flight."
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Heartbroken by my experience,"I had an emergency with my mother so I had to fly to Chicago with five of my children. I asked AA if they had any emergency rates but they turned out to be more then the original flight. I payed for the tickets and fly out. After almost three long weeks of being at the hospital with my Mom in a coma, staying in hotels and with family, sadly, I lost my Mom! After telling family and friends, planning the funeral, burial, and repass it was time to fly back home with my children. Our travel experience with American Airlines only added to our weariness. Being drained physically, emotionally, and mentally, I was hoping to just get on my flight and go home! However two flight attendees where just brutal. After running through the entire Airport with 5 children, 7 bags and literally nothing left, we sat and waited for our chance to board. We were in the 6th call of boarding. As we desperately approached the counter I was told Id have to check all of my bags. The same bags I'd traveled with on AA to get to my Mom and 2 additionals. I was not told to check them on the way to Chicago I didn't understand the difference now. One attendant very rudely spoke from behind my children saying, ""pay for the bag or you're not getting on the plane."" With the last $40 I had in my pocket I proceeded to hand it over. I was smiled at by the female attendant and told ""you have to go back to the front of the building and pay, we don't take cash."" I asked. So I'll have to take all the bags and my children through the entire airport again to pay for the bag? She responded, yes and you'll need to book another flight. I was just undone... until a passenger behind me offered to pay the charge. I tried to give him the $40 but he wouldn't accept it. My children and I got on the plane and were finally on our way home. I would not wish to travel with AA again if I could avoid it. I don't like my children seeing anyone be treated that way. I hope this helps AA do better. 🙏"
Date of travel: October 2020,40,It's a hard job in 2020,"Hats off to American Airlines, have such a tough job these days.  Everyone working in the flight was friendly when enforcing all the policies.  Only downside I made it to St Thomas, my luggage arrived the following day."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Always in Your Pocket,"October 2020 we flew from Phoenix to Tampa via Dallas.  Additional prices for everything they could possible price; Luggage, Seats, Early Boarding, etc, etc.  Had to return few days early, the original round trip ticket $836.for two.  We were charged  an additional $1,140 for the change .  Before you book with any airline get ask about the cost for changing your flight.    I will NEVER use American Airlines again  After merger with US Airways the quality of their service began down and now is at an all time LOW.   Do Not Get Taken Advantage BY this Airline."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Customer service persistent and unhelpful,"We had an issue on our seat assignment for our return flight. Could not get through to customer service, could not resolve at check in, and could not resolve on the phone afterwards, but they told me to reach out to customer affairs. Customer affairs will not offer refund requested, but continues to contact me. It seems they just called me to argue. I'm so frustrated with their ""policies"" and how they ""resolve"" issues. My 2 family members were seated next to each other with me behind them despite an empty seat next to them. I had to pay $40 to switch to the empty seat next to them and then my seat was put up for $40. We were told we'd be seated next to each other if seats were available and yet we were intentionally split up so AA could make profits off seat changes. Normally I would have just stayed in the other seat, but we wanted to minimize covid transmission risk (one family member is high risk). Also why not be honest from the beginning that we would not be seated together even if there were seats available? And why call me to discuss further if not willing to do anything about it? Apparently they wanted to see if I wanted anything else documented, I said sure, document that I'd like a refund, and she reiterated I wouldn't get one. I said okay stop calling. Smh. I'm 30, have a good job, and love to travel. I'm sure I'll be spending 10s of thousands in future flights for myself and family members. So, their loss really. 🙃"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Why they should fail.,The lack of professionalism is astounding. We have been stuck at the gate waiting to depart for over an hour. No offer of water or a snack or really any explanation.    This is why they should fail. The next airlines that serve us should know that if you do terrible work you will not get help. After years and years of sqeezing the consumer for every dime they could wring out of every inch that they took from us in the name of profit. They have the nerve to ask for a federal bailout.  THEY DO NOT DESERVE IT. THEY HAVE NOT EARNED OUR GOODWILL.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Still dont have my luggage,"Its been 2 days and my luggage is still in NY, they keep saying they are going to send my luggage, Im sitting in Quarantine without my medicine, because everything is in my luggage that they wont send, but keep saying everyday they will send it on the next flight. Thats after they told me I would arrive at my destination on the 15th but forgot to tell me they dont offer that flight anymore and I arrived on the 16th, without my luggage. No flight offered beverages or snacks, due to covid they say."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,VERY RUDE,Took a flight to Florida from Seattle and the flight attendant was very rude. Asked for a cheese tray and she skipped me for some reason then when I asked for it again she said they were out. I asked for a Coke and again she waited quite some time before giving it to me. As always American has no concern about the behavior of their attendants.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Disgusted,"They care more about filling seats than people safety I'm disgusted. I'm pissed my employer chose this airline, AA act like corona doesn't exist. If I didn't have to fly for my job I would've stayed home definitely requesting a safer flight home like Frontier or Spirit that should tell you something. So many babies and young children not able to wear a mask while being packed in a plane like sardines. Bad enough I had items stolen out of my checked luggage and had a two hour delay. AA suck! Never again and I would never recommend anyone fly with this airlines."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,"BAD SERVICE, PLUS LOST BAGGAGE","Personally this is the worst experience I've had while flying an airline. I understand delays and things happen, but the poor customer service with being told so many different things from different customer agents and then my lost baggage and told they had found my bag several times by customer service which was not the case. They refused to refund my ticket and told me to speak with British Airways, when they had taken over my ticket from British Airways and deleted all of my previous segments so I couldn't get a refund now from British Airways which is infuriating. On top of that given the delay on American Flight from PDX, I couldn't make any connecting flights and was told I could get on an American Flight from Dallas to Amsterdam then on to Nairobi. I had a valid Covid Negative test and showed all my paper to management at customer service in Dallas on 10.8.20.... I was scheduled the following day on American from Dallas then with KLM to Kenya. I also check several times with checkin agents and customer service that my bag was on the flight and I was assured it was. When I went to board my flight on the 9th of October I was told that I couldn't take the International flight given my covid test had expired on the 9th. I was to arrive in Kenya on the 9th with all of my paperwork which would have been good to go. I proceed back to customer service and the American customer agent tells me it's a British Airways problem and she won't help me. I tell her this is not the case and she argues with me and gets her manager. I finally call British airways while American is on the line with Tariff proving to me it's not there ticket which in fact it is now since they took it over. I put British Airways on speaker phone and the agent explains to American with the correct ticket number which I had by the way and had shown to the agent and now she's backpedaling. Then she says to me so what do you want to do. and I say I want a refund and I""m told they don't do that and I have to do every thing online.... I end up flying home to PDX and my bag doesn't show up with me. I'm told by the agent at PDX that it's in Dallas and I will get it the next day. NOT TRUE! They now can't find it the next day and I'm told it never went to Dallas in the first place it went to Boston. WTF... then I'm told by another agent the following day it's in Boston and being flown back to PDX. NOT TRUE AGAIN... I call the following day and they have to record of it after BOSTON... I understand we are living in an interesting challenging time, but come on, the Airline AMERICAN should compensate me and other people for this kind of mess up and the way I was treated. it's complete BS... I spent 3 hours at customer service on the 8th and then on the 9th just to get home. I personally won't fly American again..."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,over booked,They do not care about the wellbeing of their staff or passengers all they care about is stuffing as many people as they can on planes. every seat full and rows so crammed together you legs are in the back of the seat in front of you
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Not following any guidelines During COVID,We were on two different planes and experienced the same thing. -No temperature check-All seats where occupied-No spacing out of passengers-Not checking for appropriate mask wearingFeels very unsafe and in clean.It’s very clear that AA only cares about the money.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Flight left early and rude workers,Flight left before departure so we ended up missing our flight. Then we had a 3 hour layover. The plane was dirty they did not take the time to clean between people getting off and on. Rude people checking us in.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Unethical flight attendant,I will NEVER fly American again.  The flight attendant in the first class cabin unethically used her ability to place a security hold on my return flight in retaliation for my respectful criticism of her poor service.  This is a serious breach of ethics.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Not worth your money,"They originally had my friend and books for a lay over flight that started to board before we even we suppose to land, lucky we were able to get on the  plane taking off before the one we supposed to be on. They told us it was allowed because it was “40 mins.” Before our connecting flight was suppose to take off... it take 40 minutes just get across Atlanta airport. Not only did this happen which was stressful for two people who have barely flown before, but they changed my sisters flight in November after we booked it 2 months in advance because my family hasn’t seen her in 8 months. Why book in advance if they can just go in and change your flight times... everything about this company is just messy and unorganized, I recommend using Delta instead overall a better experience."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Horrible customer service,"I don’t even know where to begin with explaining the horrible service I have gotten my entire trip. First, American Airlines continued their flight knowing they were landing right in the zone for hurricane Delta. To my knowledge delta had already passed. By the time I reached Charlotte North Carolina I had no idea the hurricane had not hit yet. Cancun had already been evacuated BEFORE we even landed, or took off. Leaving me stranded in the Mexican airport, then having the airport close on my new husband and I leaving us stranded with no flight out and no safety. This was poor on American Airlines end. The flight should have been delayed or canceled! When I called the customer services numerous times, I was told it was my fault. That I should have looked on their website and that most people check the weather. Horrible customer service!! I didn’t want a refund! All I wanted was to extend my flight for 2 days because I had to be evacuated and bunkered down in a shelter for 2 days and didn’t want to miss out on my honeymoon. I talked to a woman named Susan who was a supervisor for AA. She was horribly rude!! Very unprofessional. Not to mention she made me PAY for my extension even though the hurricane wasn’t my fault. She flat out told me it was my fault and I chose to fly. Well sorry Susan when it’s 8am and I just had a 6 hour flight I didn’t check the status AGAIN because the last time I did the hurricane was to have already passed!! I didn’t even want a refund! Just a simple fix of extending my flight TWO days. Appalling at how rude and unhelpful this company is. Not to mention on the flight extension I had to PAY $120 for, they didn’t even sit my husband and I together! So I paid another $79 and they only sat us together for HALF the flight! This is freaking ridiculous! They are thieving and a unreliable company."

Not a Good Experience AT ALL*"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,worst airline ever,"Worst airline ever. I only flew with them because I had a free trip because of the inhumane way they treated my mom last year. I booked my flight to Vegas in July for October. When I called the airline in September to make sure everything was good they told me my reservation had been canceled. They couldn't tell me who canceled it or why. They wanted to charge me more for a new flight. That was the 1st thing. We got on the plane in Jacksonville to Philadelphia our flight landed 5 minutes after my connecting flight to Vegas took off without us. When we talked to American Airlines customer service they said that it was not their fault and FAA was to blame. They were not accommodating or apologetic. We were stuck in the Philadelphia Airport for 11 hours with no compensation or concern from American Airlines. When we finally got to Vegas the rental car place- hertz- was closed. The next morning they had canceled my car, charged me a missed rental fee and wanted $760 for another car. Needless to say I am now on vacation without a rental car because of what American Airlines did. American Airlines has the worst service ever."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Confiscated my ammunition out of my TSA certified gun safe.,"This is an agenda of aa to harass and cause harm to legal gun owners who are forced to use aa to fly to places like Lynchburg where no other carriers are available. My ammo was safely and securely stored away in my gun safe and locked to my luggage. They allowed me to travel from my home airport without incident (intentional) but on the return flight, I didn't have the option to return to my car and retain my property. They are ""Left"" oriented and the corporate offices refuses to give me an explanation.  If it weren't for my good customers in Lynchburg, there would be no more flights on aa."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Not a single employee cares about you or your stuff when you fly American Airlines,"Bulletpoint version because otherwise, this would be a novel with multiple spin offs. When checking in, bags are okay to go on as carry onsAt gate, ""NO ROOM GOTTA CHECK YOUR BAGS"" Fly to Philly, wait 1.5 hours for next flight. In bathroom, door to plane closes almost 30 minutes early. No Final call made so imagine the look on our faces when this nasty attendant told us ""sorry doors closed.""Nobody willing to help. Ended up getting another flight to Orlando but had no guarantee from these people that we could get on even though there were at least 20 seats available. Bags that were checked at the gate never made it to Tampa. Apparently we were supposed to get them when we got to Philly which nobody once communicated with us. Would have grabbed them no problem during the layover if we knew that. Now a full 24 hours later and the bags that were in Philly, that were supposed to go to Tampa, actually went to Orlando. Then, on a trip to Tampa, but the bag wasn't taken off in Tampa to get delivered and went back to Orlando. Its 11:20pm the following day and we are on the phone trying to get someone to find out where and when our bag will get to us. In all of this, we have talked to about 20 different employees from 3 different airports, all who have been so unhelpful, that it makes me wonder how this airline is still in business in 2020 when online reviews are a thing."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,No social distancing,"Flying this airline was bearable before Covid. Now it is utterly, awful. There is no social distancing but they pretend the measures you take are enough. I had to check a carryon bag at the gate though it was of the correct size. Had I known that you were not social distancing your flights and/or given we a warning that I would have had to check my bags, I would have booked my return flights with Delta as I booked the flight out with them. They have better prices and way better Covid procedures and client service. You are charging way too much for less of a service. You have basically used Covid as an excuse to give less and charge more. I will happily fly Delta from now on."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Reservation Confirmation,"Made reservation.  Never received confirmation email.  Called American five times over a week, each time being told something different.  Got confirmation codes from AA and GOL, the Brazilian airline.  On my six call, waiting for 40 minutes, I am told that I ""put the reservation on hold"" therefore it has been cancelled.  Worst customer service ever."
n/a,10,AVOID LAYOVERS AND MIA,"We are frequent fliers on AA flights to the Riviera Maya of MX; Punta Cana, DR; and Orlando or Tampa/St. Pete. We began our adventure before AA took our US Airways away. We fly at least 5-6 times per year, for recreation only, and always fly Non-Stop Business Class.   We decided to brave flying to Punta Cana. Ooops, there are not any direct flights. We were stuck with a layover ⁰in Miami. Oops, I cannot book business because,  business seats, while available were not available for those who chose to use their miles. Pre-Covid, this was not an issue. We have flown business with miles for many years. Ok, so why do I have all these miles? Yes, I will opt for Premium Economy.  Yes, I can pay for that without miles.  And, by the way should the jacka....s in front of you who already has the first seat with tons of legroom decides he wants to recline, those extra inches are wiped clean and you are SOL for the extra cash you paid. Insert major sigh here!!!Now let's talk the first leg of our journey It is to MIA. I haven't had a layover In MIA since 2006. No matter how desperate you are to get out of Dodge and bask in the sunlight of paradise, do not do it. The plane had little air conditioning and we were squeezed like sardines.  There was no social distancing lining up for the plane. American just wanted your behinds on the plane ASAP.  They had a schedule to keep. There was noone ensuring proper mask wearing. The biggest insult was the bag that contained a hand sanitizer, an guesstimate of an 8 oz bottle of water and that darn Biscot cookie. Can I purchase a snack pack? Heck no, but Business can be served a multi-course meal. It was so loud on the plane, I kept my headset on just to drown out the noise. Last but not least, the gentleman in the bathroom I was waiting to use, blew it up, did not flush or even put the seat down. That was the kind of people flying to MIA.  I made a ""It Wasn't Me"" sign so, I didn't catch the blame. lolThe flight to PUJ was exactly the same. To add additional insult to injury, while we landed in Terminal B, we still disembarked via the dreaded ladder. The flight home with a layover in Charlotte. I expected much better from a previous layover I remembered from 2006. It was exactly the same from PUJ to CHLT.The last leg of our journey was back home to Philly.  Ahhhhhh, even our middle seat was empty.  But, lo and behold, no bag with water. Don't dare put a Kleenex in the front pocket either. Put it in the plastic bag we do not have because we didn't get the bag with water.Bottomline, if you can, and I know it is pretty difficult to find right now, book a NON-STOP from whatever airlines you can find. Last but not least, don't use my tax dollars to bail out this industry! The prices are high and you are a meaningless sardine on AA. We will use our miles up for domestic travel and begin shopping for another airline. Make your flight attendants not only ensure mask wearing,  but also PROPER mask wearing. A mask beneath the nose is a Kleenex."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,No social distancing here!!,"They insisted that we wear face masks at all times however, they boarded us in large groups (from front to back) so we had to pass everyone to get to our seats. Once on the plane my husband and I got situated in our seats then a lady comes up and sits beside us. Keep in mind they are supposed to be practicing social distancing. Then we had a connecting flight (AA5565) on American Airlines from Charlotte to Augusta, GA. There were only two seats in every row on this plane. They sat me in 9F and my husband in the row behind me in 10F. So we both had strangers sitting beside us!! The lady that was assigned to sit beside me graciously offered up her seat and took my husbands seat so we could sit together. There was not a lot of  communication from the pilots or the employees. This was one of my worst experiences flying and I don't want to fly American Airlines again. Angela Sanders"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Never again,"2 days to get from Indiana to Tennessee. Plane rerouted to Charlotte landed at 2 a.m. suppose to leave at 7:45 right now it's 8:35 a.m. I have been awake longer than 24 hrs.and still have an hour drive once I get to Knoxville. No hotel, no discount... a pack of cookies! Nothing open in the airport, couldn't even get a water! Customer service was also bad... this airline is the worst!"
Date of travel: September 2020,20,Avoid at all costs,"I’ve flown with AA several times because of the cheap prices to get to different cities with the US. After my most recent flight with them, I will make it a priority to fly with anybody other than AA. I had one layover in CLT. We sat on the plane after boarding for THREE HOURS and did not go anywhere because they had to fix maintenance issues that the plane had! Then we had to wait another hour for new pilots because the original pilots were over their hours for the day!!! They didn’t even bother to give us any refreshments while waiting! Then they had the nerve to tell us that we had the option to deplane, but could not come back on the plane. Passengers, including myself, were hungry and a lot of us that came from the same previous connecting flight had to rush to the gate because we landed late!! From CLT to SEA was almost a 6 hour flight. We only got 1 pack of Biscoff cookies and a small cup of juice/water/soda! Meanwhile, I’ve been on an international 6-hour flight that fed us dinner and breakfast, with tea and coffee in between. What’s going with AA? I wanted to cut them some slack because of COVID and I know they are understaffed and stressed, but SHEESH! I know these big corporations can do better than that..."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,✈️,I had flight today I missed my flight because are very slow and Very bad customer service ever seen in my i life
Date of travel: October 2020,10,COVID-19 Stupidity,"I got today home around 9:30 am, so I could unpack, take another shower (I’ll get to that later), and have some time to reflect on what a disaster American Airlines has become. The last time I checked they were not a budget airline. I flew Delta to Key West, FL back in September and their is ZERO comparison between the two with regards to how they are handling COVID-19. Going to Indianapolis and coming back to Charlotte both flights were filled to 100% capacity, no hand sanitizer getting on board or during the flight, no drinks or snacks (not even a jelly bean this time), and frankly the crew coming back were not welcoming and looked like they hated their jobs. Delta was the complete opposite in every single way possible. I don’t want their excuses, and I hope I get a corporate email asking about my flight. I have to say they were consistent on both flights and I felt the need to take a shower as I just felt dirty getting off that aircraft. If I’m going to ever catch COVID-19 today is that day. I use common sense with regards to COVID-19 like wash your hands and wear a mask, and I have been that person if I get it, then I’ll deal with it. However, I’m not asking for it, but this airline is a complete and utter mess and being careless with their guests safety. Charlotte is the hub for this company, and I would like to fly AA because it’s non-stop wherever I decide to travel. However, Atlanta is the hub for Delta, but I would prefer to have a layover in the ATL and know that I’m going to be valued for my business, not taken for granted, and know they actually care about their guests & employees safety. American Airlines has to do better in every aspect moving forward or they will be in serious trouble."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Golf club stolen from travel case.,Flew from Los Angeles to Charlotte North Carolina. I took my golf clubs with me and put them in a travel case. The driver was too long so I unscrewed the head and wrapped  it up in a towel and put it inside the travel case. When I arrived in Charlotte the head and was gone and the towel was laid out flat across the top of my bag. Tried  to file a claim with the American Airlines. They told me I was SOL. American Airlines doesn’t cover stolen items from checked  bags. I find their  lack of accountability and “that’s too bad” attitude very disturbing.  Don’t put anything in your bag that you want to have when you arrive at your destination. Maybe I should try to get a job there before Christmas. Perhaps I could find some interesting things to get my family. Hope this doesn’t happen to you
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Charged '$160 for airport booking fee?',"Was charged for $160 for at airport booking fee when their website didn't work and they wouldn't answer the phone in Mexico.  No COVID protections as stated.  Called to request a refund and after escalation, they continued to deny.  Wow, the worst customer service I have ever received.  We will never fly American again, they are the worst airline I have ever had to deal with.  Dirty packed airplane not a vacation-worthy flight.  Spent $2,500 on the flight."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Luggage,Omg over 1 hour wait for luggage. Unacceptable and incompetant. Cannot recommend to anyone else ever
Date of travel: October 2020,10,BAD,Delayed flight 2x which was a ripple affect to missing my next flight. No other solution but to stay the night in city I was in. Note: over half of the people on my flight had this same problem but also given the same solution. Do not use this airline use Delta.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,"Horrible Experiences, as always.","The customer service at American Airlines is far from enjoyable. They are rude, not patient, nor are they kind. I have had many poor experiences with American within the last couple years and am to the point I no longer wish to travel with them. Every flight attendant and front desk associate while at the gate treat their customers awful. I have never had such awful service with any other airline, especially as many times as ice travels with them. Losing a loyal member of the American an airline family."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Horrible !!!!,Not family oriented do not waste your time or your money horrible customer service.... They do not care about anything but themselves... Everybody on this flight do not waste your time or money will most likely be kicked off as David act up in one way or another
Date of travel: October 2020,10,I guess COVID doesn’t exist,"I am DISGUSTED that American Airlines doesn’t care one bit about COVID. They fill their planes to the brim, putting every single persons life at risk. This is now my second time flying with them during COVID where this has happened. All this airline cares about is money and greed more than human safety. Disgusting. I will never fly AA again and I will be sure to tell those I know to take another airline. Shame on you."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Intentionally separates family,"I didn't pay extra to sit next to my wife, and they assigned us different seats. When we requested to sit together at the gate, we were denied. There are empty seats on this flight, and my wife and I were both seated next to single passengers. They intentionally separate families, then charge them for the privilege of sitting next to each other."
Date of travel: October 2020,50,2 amazing staff members + 1 rude ignorant staff member,"I needed to pay for my baggage via debit card and desperately needed WiFi and couldn’t assess it . A fantastic AA staff member named JULIO BRYON helped me to secure WiFi and I managed to get the issue resolved. I would like to say a huge THANKS to Julio for being such a big help and also a huge THANKS to JOSE GRASPAR who checked me in he was very friendly with a polite manner and genuine nice man , he and Julio both have excellent customer communication skills and both are destined for greatness in life . And now unfortunately I am writing to let all the AAirline customers and company board members know about a AAirline staff member who was standing near the check in desk looking up and down at the people within her vicinity and then smirking and sniggering to other staff members who all of them were doing nothing and stood talking amongst each other and this was whilst AAirline customers such as myself were in need of a little help and assistance and as I’ve mentioned it was only Julio and Jose that were absolutely wonderful in serving customers such as myself. The most rudest and ignorant / arrogant / disgusting / disrespectful was the female who I would describe as being a large fat size / big brownish dark hair tied in a bun , ugly looking obnoxious pig mannered lady who is a disgrace to the company she is “ working “ for as she was the only staff member NOT doing any work NOT attending to HER customers needs , NOT bothered at the slightest wether HER customers were given a professional service and NOT bothered at all about what was going on around her . How do disrespectful pigs such as this fat vile lazy and disrespectful , arrogant animal actually gain employment ?? She really is taking the urine out of her superiors because she really DONT GIVE A SHI* about anything or anyone just HERSELF !! It’s time for her employers to give her a DISAPLINERY !!!!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Worst Flight Company,"I bought a ticket to visit a relative in Arizona. I was called to active duty orders for the Army National Guard and even though I provided a copy of my orders, they won’t refund me. That is very disrespectful and terrible thing to do when I had no choice in the matter. I don’t ever want to book with them again if that’s how they treat people. In a time when money is tight for everyone, even a massive airline company can’t feel sympathy for a person with a valid reason."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service,Y’all I would never image an airline would make you miss your flight and want you to repay for a flight they make you miss and never gave me an refund. I lost over $600 with this airline. I even called customer service and the supervisor itself gave me a hard time and hung the phone up on me.
Date of travel: September 2020,50,The great service from the man that smelled SO GOOD,My family took mini trip and we received AMAZING SERVICE!!!  I want to thank the flight attendant that smelled really good for the great service and made our flight comfortable and fun. Travel dates 9/17/2020-9/20/2020. We had a lay over there and back... stop was in SC. I think his name is TIM BUT CANT REMEMBER. Great Job Good Smelling Man... LOL
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Never fly with American Airlines,"Regardless of how inexpensive their tickets are, I would advise you to fly any other airline.  The small amount of money you save is not worth the headaches that come with this company.  Last night, we booked a last minute flight to see my critically ill father.  My flight from Birmingham to Dallas was delayed for over an hour and then sat on the runway for 20 minutes once they landed.  I literally ran across the airport to my flight to Baltimore and got there just as they were closing the gates (15 minutes before the plane was leaving) - there was even a worker walking down to the plane.  The worker at the gate, whose name is ""Tola"" would not let me on the plane despite the fact that I explained my previous flight was delayed and I was trying to get to my critically ill father.  The worker was extremely belligerent and rude and told me he could take a flight to Dulles which was leaving in 15 minutes or spend the night in Dallas.  He would rather waste a ton of resources than let me on the plane.  It was clear that he was just being uncooperative and nasty.   I will NEVER use this airline again.  I ran into multiple passengers with a similar experience and while I was using my food voucher at the nearby Denny's, the waiter told me that he sees tons of people who had issues with American Airlines.  ""If you want to spend an unwanted night in Dallas, just fly American""."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst 1st lass experience EVER,Worst first class ever.  Ran out of choices after two passengers.  Five hour flight delayed for an hour because maintenance forgot to turn on valve in bathroom. Tiny water bottle handed over for flight.   Charged $150 for third bag.   Stewardess waste of $$$.   Read whole flight.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Tarmac delays,"American Airlines had no problem taking our money, they had no problem packing a 737 to capacity in the middle of a pandemic. They didn’t even have a problem taking a crammed airplane out to the runway. But they did have a problem taking off. They kept a completely packed 737 in the middle of a runway with the excuse they were over weight! I would definitely like to see the FAA investigate the social distancing protocol of this airline and then to keep us packed in a tuna can causing everybody to miss their connecting flights. Stuck in Dallas on my way to Tampa in a terrible motel. I will never use American Airlines ever again. I recommend using any other airlines available over this airlines. No wonder they are capsizing!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Ruined trip,"We flew from Tampa headed to Cancun.  Hurricane hit Cancun.  Flight canceled.  We went to baggage claim and were told we had to wait 4 HOURS to receive our bags.  Back trough TSA again.  Waited for bags.  Booked a later flight back to Tampa.  We were told by a baggage SUPERVISOR our bags would be in Tampa when we arrived at midnight.  Back through TSA.  Third time in one day.  Our bags were not in Tampa they never left Dallas.  We were told, again lied to, our bags would be delivered first thing the next day.  After multiple calls and being hung up on and put on hold we discovered our bags arrived in Tampa at 12:40 PM.  After several more calls we were told the delivery service American Airlines uses does not pick up luggage until10:30 PM.  We are 30 minutes from the airport but we do not have a car.  The EDT of our bags to the hotel is 4:30 AM!!!!!!! The flight attendants were rude.  Mask rules were not enforced.  The plane was empty but no social distancing.  No empty seats."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Rude captains and flight attendants,"I never flew with American Airlines but I work for a company where we are contracted  with American Airlines to pick them up and take them to the airport in our company van and a lot of their crew members do not tip me and the other van drivers. Sometimes when they do tip, they give us only $1 when there are 4 of them and they have a lot of bags. This is just being rude, obnoxious, and insulting. We have to load and unload in and out of our van almost everyday. It's ashamed that we have to deal with this almost everyday. I will be flying my flights with Delta and Allegiant Airlines because they treat us better are nicer and have nice flight experiences. I will never ever fly with American Airlines ever."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,WORST COVID PROTECTION!!!,"I travel often and fly with several different airlines and this flight with American Airlines was absolutely the poorest COVID flight I have experienced. Zero protection whatsoever! Normal boarding with zero social distancing. Absolutely PACKED flight with no seats left open between passengers. Delta boards back to front by row, they leave seats open between passengers. Delta will have my business from now on...regardless of price!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Price gouging ,My husband works out of the Cancun area often. We live in Orlando Fl. He tried to book a flight or come home before the Cat 3 hurricane hits The Cancun area tomorrow and was shocked with the price. It’s usually about a $300 round trip flight. He tried to get home today before it hits and was shocked at the price. $895 one way. This is totally unexceptionable!  How are they allowed to price gouge like that?  Something needs to be done about it. They should be ashamed taking advantage of people like that.   I hope my husband is safe. I wish he could have come home.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Kevin bellanger,"Unbelievably poor service, gate a to gate f is over 1/2 mile so I fast walked to my gate. Had no confidence in a shuttle because so many on the arrival flight where also late and probably using the shuttle but I thought I had time. Wrong! Told I missed the doors closing by 3 minutes and the next flight was 16 hours away. I was furious. They told me it was my fault and it happens. No refund so I rented a car rather then stay at the airport or some hotel. Worst experience. Never again"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Very disrespectful staff and zero service (business class),"I've noticed AA get worse as time goes by, used to fly it quite a lot and during COVID, had to fly for work and decided to try it again, thinking business class will be betterEven though there were 3 people flying business class, and two flying first class, the flight attendants were not the least bit attentive, choosing instead to lounge around in first class themselves and enjoy all the dinner trays lolThey didn't make any rounds of the cabin, didn't ask any questions about comfort, and when I ventured out to ask for some water, I was told ""ma'am pls stay behind the curtain in business class"".... are you serious?The business class restroom was continually occupied by the staff, and they left it super dirty with paper towels strewn about and water everywhereIt was just a free flight for them, I guess they have gotten sued to the perks of empty flights due to covid and want to just enjoy instead of doing their job....sucks, I wouldn't fly AA again, such terrible and rude service. With all the options around, that too in these tough times!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst COVID flight ever,"I am a 2 ++ million miler on AS. We flew DFW to Cabo and the boarding process going and returning was violating ever COVID recommendation there is. People in line not distancing, loading the aisle on the plane with people bumping into each other. When we landed everyone jumped up into the aisle to get their bags. Same thing happened on the return flight. They should board by seat numbers and not groups and be spaced. I am fed up with AA and although we live in Dallas, i am done with them. Please share this with as many as possible."
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Terrible During COVID,"DO NOT fly American during COVID-19. The majority of passengers had their mask around their chin, not covering their mouth or nose before and after boarding the plane. The flight attendants did not say a word to them. In fact, most of the flight attendants had masks falling off their face. I was placed in a middle seat next to someone in the aisle and fortunately was able to move to the window seat as no one was sitting there. Passengers were not encouraged to social distance or wear masks. Flight attendants did not come around at any time during the long flight. I will only fly Delta or Southwest in the future, particularly during the pandemic. This was a terrible experience."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,UNAMERICAN AIRLINES,We have flown with American many times in the past and have never encountered issues. We booked our flight almost 7 months ago. A couple of weeks before our trip we were notified of a flight change of 3 hours. We discovered through conversations with other passengers that this flight was already scheduled. It appears that they cancelled flights and stuffed more people on fewer flights loading them to maximum capacity. Not only did they move our flight but were kind enough to seat my girlfriend and I 11 rows apart. So much for social distancing and keeping people in the same group together. Then the icing on the cake was the unprofessional counter employees at Gate A3. What a joy.  The first was a shorter Latin lady who said we could sit together if we paid $45 since the seat next to my girlfriend was not yet assigned.  We then called customer service and the very nice lady said that they could change our tickets at the counter. We again tried with a man who was at the counter and he wanted $110 to seat us together. Both counter employees had a terrible attitude and were unhelpful. American Airlines perhaps should relearn customer service before the government bailout money comes. Sorely disappointed. We will give our money to other airlines moving forward.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES,I have flown with American Airlines to Jamaica for years and never have a problem but this time was the worst experience I've ever had. Not only did I have to wait over an hour to check in for my flight  ( and yes I did I have all my necessary authorization to travel to Jamaica) but they lost my luggage! It's supposedly been in st.Vincent and I've been promised to get it the next day and I never received it. The entire trip I had nothing and no one from American Airlines or st.Vincent has done anything to make sure I get my luggage back to me. Every time I call a representative I get the run around and no one knows anything. This is the absolute worst experience and I highly doubt I will fly with American Airlines. This is the worst experience and this whole ordeal has ruined my vacation. What's worst is I don't even know if I'll be getting my luggage back.  I would never recommend this airline to anyone and I will never fly with them again.  We've been here 3 days and still no luggage and no update about the whereabouts of our luggage.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Stand by took our seats!,"We arrived at the airport1/2 hour before the flight was scheduled to leave. We stood on line to check our baggage for over 10 minutes( there was one person in front of us monopolizing the line). When the agent was finally free to check our bags, she told us we had missed the cut off to check our bags. She offered us stand by on the next flight 3 hours later. We had originally purchased first class seats based on the length of the trip. The very rude agent told us we would not be flying first class. In fact, we would have to take what we get, if we could even get a seat on the next plane. No refund, no nothing. We continued on. Made it through security. Directly behind the passenger who had been in front of us at the ticket counter. We made our way to the gate only to find that there man who had been changing his flight to an earlier time was boarding the plane with his luggage(which would be picked up by baggage handlers on the plane). He wasn’t standby. He changed the time of his flight. We also learned that the woman in front of him had done the same, immediately prior to him. I failed to mention she was also being helped by an agent who disappeared when finishing her, leaving us standing in line. We were denied access to our seats because they couldn’t check our suitcases. Yet, both of these individuals were allowed access after changing their flights and were able to bring their luggage to the gate to check. As we sat watching them board games he plane, we couldn’t help but notice the flight wasn’t leaving as scheduled. In fact, the plane sat at home he gate for an additional hour. When customer service was contacted, they basically said, too bad. Be thankful you MIGHT get seats on the next flight. Being denied access to a delayed flight, in turn, caused us to miss our connecting flight. When we were finally able to board the next plane, we were given two seats apart from each other in coach. While walking to the back of the plane, after boarding last as standby, it was clear that all first class seats were not filled. We requested to be able to sit there. Of course, we were told no. The connecting flight in Charlotte boarded 25 minutes after we landed in Charlotte. We had to run across the terminal..15 minutes to wait and see if we would get a seat. Again, at the gate was a passenger with their luggage being able to board the plane and check their bag at the gate. We were number 11 and 12 on the list. Luckily, we made the plane. We were again forced to sit apart for the 4 hour flight. What took the cake was as we were walking to our seats in the very back of the plane, the passenger who was allowed to check his bags at the gate was comfortably seated in first class.We spent the entire day waiting for seats and missed an entire day of vacation based on a policy that only applies to certain passengers. I will never fly on this airline again. The rude customer service and agents have no business dealing with the public. We spent $400.00 extra dollars for nothing. Now, I understand you hat if you are late, you risk missing the plane. However, I don’t understand denying us access when others were allowed to board afterwards with their luggage. Bad business!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,AVOID AMERICAN AIRLINES,"This airline is horrendous! Always some BS...9/10 will be delayed, which means your probably going to miss your connection...which makes your day MUCH longer. Avoid if you want to actually get somewhere on time. Avoid if you want to get what you paid for. Spend the extra money and fly with an organized airline. Save yourself the frustration!"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Terrible,Worst experience ever. DO NOT fly with american airlines. Moved us last minute claiming it was for social distancing ON A FULL FLIGHT. Failed to mention they were moving us to an exit row where the flight attendant would be sitting inches in front of me.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Delay airline,Always delay. Hasn’t had an on time flight yet. No explanation for the delay. This airline has one of the most delay service I have experience
Date of travel: October 2020,10,MD,"After being greeted by angry staff at the baggage drop, the website that wouldn't let me check my luggage online, the overbooked flight, no spacing for COVID at all, followed by the filthy sear with trash all over, obviously no attention to cleanliness. I travel weekly, generally delta- ended up with American due to flight times, will plan for an extra day before I ever fly american again. Absolute worst flying experience ever. Delta can charge more for their tickets, they are definitely superior to this."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,No Customer Service,I think AA must have grounded a bunch of planes. AA cancelled my Monday flight out of Mexico 2 days before my return and the best they could offer was a flight on Thursday.  I was forced to buy 5 tickets on United for 4x as much. AA refused to cover any of the additional expense.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Rude people AA,"I had to fly back from Philadelphia to Phoenix, I had my bag overnight by 5 pounds and they wanted to charge me 100 dlls ( if I were to add a second luggage it was 40 dlls) they made me take out my dirty laundry and carry in on me the whole flight. Complete horrible experience, why in the world would I ever want to fly this way again. I understand overweight chargers, but 100 dlls is straight up stealing. At the end the guy told me I should check into a mental hospital. Very bad experience."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Unacceptable policies,We booked our flight back in May to Curaçao for October 16 2020. They were happy to take our money. They are not even able to fly into Curaçao until December so they should not have accepted the booking. Now they will not issue credits even though they are unable to make the trip. They offer you the ability to use the tickets at a later date but for those who can’t you are out your money. The airlines knew they could not fly but still took the reservations and money. Buyer be ware before you consider using American Airlines.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Worst Airline every known,"I did hear horror stories about this airline, but decided to give them a chance after trying to switch them out for our Cancun vacation. Came to airport to check in, just to find out that they cannot check me in, and their bogus reason was that my wife's green card was expiring in 3 months, and need to be valid for at least 6 months...OK. I came home very upset that our vacation is out the window now, and looked up at Mexican embassy site, and their site as well, and nowhere it mentions that about green card. I called them to get refund, and they would not give me refund.. only credit to use them again... NEVER ever will that happen! Ever.... The woman at Seattle airport, African nationality... she messed up our vacation. Now Costco only refunded 1/3rd of amount we paid, and have to fight to get rest of the money for hotel and flights....What a joke company and employees...They should pay for my transportation to/from airport, and all the planning cost."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Not great at all,"First off I try to avoid this airline like the plague. I couldn't avoid it unfortunately this visit but they do a lot of shady practices like getting you to pay extra to ""reserve"" your seat even after you pay for a ticket for a certain date/time.  I actually paid extra to ensure everyone had a reserved seat and they still knocked off one of my group from their seat assignment. They're ridiculous, hence why people hate the airline industry especially American Airlines, they have zero sense of ""consumer protection or satisfaction."""
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Customer Service is the WORST,"I booked travel that was canceled by Covid, tried to rebook and AA messed up the rebooking now I can’t use my full credits that I am trying to use now. I’m just trying to use my money I’ve already spent with this company. I’ve been given bad advise numerous of times from their employees about my credits. If you can use a different airline!!!! I know I won’t financially hurt this company but I will not use them again not matter how much I have to spend with another airline."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,They don't care,"My flight was to depart at 6:45 AM.  The flight attendent apparently felt sick and they delayed my flight.  Not only did they delay the flight until 11:30 AM, but there was no sympothy or consideration that my connection flight, car reservation and travel plans were completly messed up.  The worst part is when we were boarding at 11:30 AM the same flight attendent return to the airport and boarded another flight while laughing and joking.   the airport did not have anything open but a Dunkin Donuts, so there we all sat angry and hungry."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Awful Customer “service”,"I was not able to book online using a Flight Credit issued by the airline. The website said to contact Customer Service. Because of heavy call volume, the recording said they would call me in 22-30 minutes. Time passed. No call. I called again;” 90 minutes later; same response, with no call back. Finally, I just booked the flight and used a credit card for a $598 flight. When I got to the airport, the in-person agent said that because I already paid for the flight, the voucher could not be used. So I went online, using the chat feature, with the same result. The voucher can still be used, but with a $200 change fee, since the cancelled flight was 3 days before their new policy waiving change fees was announced. Bottom line: American Airlines sucks! Fly Delta, Drive, walk, or pedal!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,"If I can't use another airline, I'll drive.","American Airlines charged me $557 for tickets from Ontario, California to Savannah, Georgia. A little more expensive than I expected, but it was two days before my trip.Then, I went to get my seats through the American Airline online check in procedure. The application told me there were no seats left for the price I paid -- but I could pay an additional $119 to get ""preferred"" seats.So, American Airlines sold me a seat I couldn't have, for a boosted price, then charges me more to get ""better"" seats. Not sure how they were ""preferred"", as they seemed to be just as cramped and crowded as every other seat.Apparently, American heavily overbooked the flights. There were stand-by lists of ten or more people on every one of my flights but one. Because they overbooked so heavily, they decided they could charge me an extra $119 to get into the seats I had already paid for.That, so that I could be forced to wear a mask for twelve hours, crammed into five fully loaded flights, with no food or drink service. (Sorry, American. A cookie and four ounces of water in a plastic bag is not ""food and drink service"".)American Airlines is not running an airline; they are running a casino, and their customers are betting they can get the seat they pay for. Lose the bet, pay extra. Or go on another (overbooked) flight. Or don't go at all.Do not ever fly American Airlines. I won't. If I can't get where I want on another airline, I'll drive."
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Excellent Service (again),"The flight attendants did a great job of keeping the flights running on time for our round trip during COVID. They were polite, yet firm, to individuals who didn't want to follow the COVID regulations. I appreciated their ability in keeping track of everything and getting us to our destination as quickly as possible."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Worst Experience Ever!,"AA Employee Daniel at Gate C19 on 9/19/20 was rude/disrespectful, discriminatory and taunting. His manager Nicole was an enabler of these actions. He was rude to me, continuously called me a ""sir"" after i corrected him that i was a woman just because i was a lesbian. His words were ""well you're wearing a hat and hoodie"" as if that somehow makes me a ""sir"" after I've already let you know I am a woman not a man. After our exchange he still tried to not let me on my flight even though his supervisor Nicole ok'd me to get on. Once she told him to let me on he taunted me by waiving at me as i boarded the plan. His Supervisor Nicole did nothing to deescalate the situation beside okay me to board and that was only because she did not step in when he continued to call me a sir after i nicely corrected him. Most embarrassing situation I've ever had to deal with. Other passengers were outraged with me."
Date of travel: September 2020,30,Decent,"I flew American last week from Phoenix to Cleveland with a connection in Dallas. The flights were full (so zero social distancing), and they also did not do a beverage service. They gave us a small bag with a cookie, small water, antibacterial wipe, and pretzels though. I like my mid-flight ginger ale though, so that was a let down. Our temperatures were never taken at the airport or prior to boarding the plane. Some people may find the lack of distancing (full flights) and no temperature checks unsafe or unsettling.Overall my flights were pretty smooth. I did almost miss my connection in Dallas though. I was supposed to have a one hour layover, but I got off the first airplane to find the connecting gate was switched to the other side of the airport and would be boarding in ten minutes. I had to make a mad dash for the train thing and get to a different terminal and Run to the gate. I didn’t miss my flight (almost did), but would have liked the time to run to the restroom and grab a soda (since they don’t serve them in flight). Overall the flights were smooth, attendants pleasant, and no issues with passengers following the mask rules."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Held hostage at the airport — Made us pay for ticket twice!!!,"My husband and I arrived at the airport to return home from a brief trip. When we tried to print our boarding passes we discovered that one of our tickets had been canceled. We had not requested to cancel this ticket, had received no notification that the ticket had been canceled, and there was no refund posted to the credit card. The agent we spoke to could not explain what had happened, only that the records showed that the ticket was canceled and he had no option for us other than to sell us a new ticket. He agreed that the mistake was not our fault, that it must have been a clerical error, but he had no way to rectify the error before our gate would close. He promised me that if we purchased a new ticket, he would make a note on our record and that if I called customer service the next day I would receive a refund. So we paid for our ticket a second time and flew home. I have now been calling customer service for 6 WEEKS. Every time I go through the whole story explaining it to a new person and they insist that a refund was posted. I offer to send them our credit card statements which show that no refund was posted. Then they say the refund department will call us back. THEY NEVER DO. There is no way to contact the refund department directly so I keep calling customer service and they do nothing!"
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Thoughts and prayers to all affected,"Good luck to all affected by the lay offs.  I know it will turn around, hopefully sooner than later. Flying to Germany next year.   hopefully they alloy us in"
Date of travel: October 2020,10,I Will Never Fly American Again!!!,"They deserve negative 5 stars!! We got to the airport an hour early for our 6AM flight. We waited in the priority check-in line and they said the priority line wasn’t running because someone was out sick. Then we were told to get into the check baggage line and when we got to the front, they told us it was too late and we would have to get on the next flight. We were scolded and talked down to. The customer service reps didn’t want to deal with either of us or help us get our flights figured out. Instead, they blamed everything on us, Covid and a new airport opening up.  We still had a half hour left before the flight left and the only reason we couldn’t check our bags was because customer service reps made us wait in a long line, and they were very rude and not willing to help. On the flight we got put on, we got pushed to coach after paying for first class and we had a 6 hour layover (our layover was only supposed to be an hour). On the second flight we still weren’t put in first class (even though we missed both flights because of how awful their customer service was). The flight attendants were rude and every person we voiced our concerns to did nothing. We didn’t even get an “I apologize for that.” You guys just lost a frequent flyer willing to pay for first class. Everyone stay away from American Airline!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Every seat sold and packed in,Got to live American Airlines as covid is hot and heavy and the planes are full and crowded. Next flight will be on Southwest
Date of travel: September 2020,10,AWFUL and their employees are unethical,"American Airlines is a joke of a company – They are late to the airport and make people late for their lay overs (yet there is an hour or more to in between). Then when the person has to wait for the next flight, they have employees who give you a ticket but don’t acknowledge that you paid for an upgraded seat. Oh, BUT WAIT – they don’t care that you paid for the upgraded seat on a flight you missed, if you want an upgraded seat on a different flight you would have to pay again. Okay that’s fine, but MAYBE your employees would actually say something to the customer along the lines of “hey, I see you upgraded on the pervious flight, now if you want that again you would have to pay again, or we don’t have any seats left like the upgraded one you paid for, please reach out to customer service for a refund”. NO, their employees just don’t care to say anything?! Not super ethical American Airlines. You guys are greedy people who rather just steal money from their customers.  DON’T TRUST THIS COMPANY THIS IS THE CRAPPIEST WAY I HAVE EVER BEEN TREATED BY AN AIRLINES BEFORE. DO NOT FLY WITH THEM!!!!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Bad experience,"I would recommend using another airline company. Poor customer service, although the planes are nice."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Discourteous,This Airline has 0... ZERO... sense of customer service. Being able to change seats I was told to cancel the flight and rebook. When I did the the prices per ticket were triple the original cost. I will never fly American Airlines again. I suggest that you use other airlines if you can.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Do not fly american airlines!!!!!!!!,Save yourself the frustration. This airline has no communication changed my flight within 5 min of boarding time and i missed my connecting flight.. They told me to eat it. Seriously fly with anyone i mean anyone else! Cs sucks just as much as the staff working there.i made restaurant reservations etc and had to cancel the entire trip because of time changes i was notified about 5 min til boarding
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Racism from Melanie at JAX airport flight AA 2451,I’ve sat on flight 2451 for the past 2 hours concerned for this young black male that I’ve seen being harassed by an AA employee at the JAX airport. This is just exhausting to watch people of color get mistreated all because of the color of their skin. Melanie was the employee and she completely abused her power and bared horrible costumer service out of hate. I’ve already wrote a report to the airline and hopefully they recognize that her actions were out of hand. I hope this guy is okay.
Date of travel: September 2020,20,The service has been not good,"They are not giving earphones anymore, and they don’t have to sell. The back flight they didn’t have TV and not even usb plug to charge the phone, in a flight of 6 hours. Unbelievable."
Date of travel: September 2020,40,Another Good Experience with AA,Everyone was so nice to me and my girls.  We were treated with respect.  From when we checked in to leaving the airport at our final destination everyone that was apart of the AA team was kind and courteous.  Thank you for the pleasant experience.
Date of travel: September 2020,40,Good Experience Flying AA,Everyone was so nice to me and my girls.  We were treated with respect.  From when we checked in to leaving the airport at our final destination everyone that was apart of the AA team was kind and courteous.  Thank you for the pleasant experience.
n/a,30,Clean but full,"Our flight times changed a couple times, but no big deal. Even though the flight was clean, I still sanitized everything again myself. No service during the flight,  bu we were given a small water and some crackers upon boarding, which was fine as we ate beforehand. Passengers were all good about masks. Plane completely full, which we were informed of ahead if time, but we had no other options.  It was all ok"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,COVID Nonsense,Over packing planes horrible service and though the Stewardess was improperly wearing your mask wrote up people for nose is being exposed taking them off the fly list no warning no nothing lookout for America
Date of travel: September 2020,20,why have status,I have the 10 am flight out of geg and thought I would get an early start my day and standby on the 8am flight they still had room on the plane. Big mistake even do I'm a platinum pro American wanted 200$ for the change and the difference in fee. So why does American put this has a benefit to standby on earlier flight when this is obviously not a free option.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Exorbitant baggage fees,"I think this is the worst flight experience I have had in terms of extorting money on the name of overweight baggage fees. I was charged $200 for a bag which exceeded in weight by about 4lbs, which equates to $50/lb, which is ridiculous. I wasn’t in the state to think rationally at that moment and I felt bullied by the check-in attendant at the counter, who would not co-operate. I felt helpless and paid the money off that moment, but I feel cheated. The flight ticket cost me $98 and the bag cost me $230 in total, which makes NO sense! I would not recommend anyone to travel by AA as these guys have no room to spare the travelers or help them out in anyway."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Horrible customer service,"I was booked on an AA flight through work. Arrived at airport for 7am flight only to deal with surly, rude agents at AA desk to check in my bag. Purchased a checked bag  online and the bag got applied to my business associates boarding pass, called Customer  service they said the agents at the counter would fix the issue. The agents at the counter were rude and said they could do nothing. Had to pay again to check the bag under my name. There’s no way they can’t get in the computer and apply what I had already paid to a checked bag under the correct boarding pass. No social distancing on plane and AA agents at the gate we’re just as rude. Horrible airline. I’d never dream of treating my customers like that."
Date of travel: September 2020,40,Flight to Dallas,"Flight was on time. Pushed off early. Gave us our Covid snacks,water, a cookie and disinfectant wipe. Arrived to DFW s few minutes early which was good for our connect."
Date of travel: September 2020,40,No problems here.,"Let’s be serious for a second. If you’re that worried about corona virus then maybe don’t plan your trip in the middle of a pandemic. Enough with the “they’re boxing people in like sardines” nonsense. You are safer NOW flying on a plane than you were before being “boxed in like sardines.” I fortunately didn’t have that problem because I only fly in first class while traveling so there is ample room among the other passengers. Flight one from Newark to Chicago was great. No real food service because of corona but whatever, the drinks were flowing so that’s good. Same with flight 2 from Chicago to Vegas. No issues. Flight 3 from Vegas to Charlotte on September 25th (2939) wasn’t as good as the prior 2. The flight attendants were NOT friendly at all. Didn’t make anyone feel welcoming. When it was time for our prepackaged “meal” she says “do you want a blank or blank.” I think the proper terminology especially in first class service would be- “would you like a...” And then that was it. No drinks offered and I never saw another flight attendant on that plane again the entire flight. And then the final flight from Charlotte to Newark (746) was adequate. The flight attendants were very catty, but that’s what happens when you have an all male flight crew with 4 male flight attendants. I only saw 2 and they  were continually getting more and more annoyed when people in first class were asking them for things. I’m sorry, it’s your job to serve us, that’s why we pay a lot of money. They seemed to want no part of it. If my second 2 flights were as great as my first 2 I would have given it a 5 star review. American get your first class flight attendants in line for your premium customers. Be thankful people are still giving you business, especially your first class guests."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,No social distancing!,My flight was 45 minutes delayed due to “fog” got to the gate just in time for my connection myself and people from other airlines that were also delayed and the flight took off without waiting for us. Therefore I had to then fly to Charlotte North Carolina wait for a 6 o’clock plane and then fly to Detroit my trip to 12 hours. Most importantly!! There was absolutely no social distancing all three planes were completely packed no middle seats available. No water or snacks given out. Absolutely no social distancing while boarding the plane it was like cattle hurting. Hand sanitizer was not given out. And I was forced to have a long layover in North Carolina. The airport was packed with people many of them not wearing masks all the restaurants were full although the tables were 6 feet apart. Could not believe how many people were on those planes and boarding those planes at the same time and filling up the North Carolina airport where American Airlines often plays over in. A flight attendant explain to me it’s a lot less expensive for them to land in Charlotte North Carolina which is why they do this all the time. I will never fly American again.  Here is a picture of passengers boarding
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Engineer,Literally the worst airline I’ve ever flown. I’d rather sit in a dog cage on a Delta flight. Their customer service is trash and they have the worst connections known to man. Be prepared to sit for anywhere from 1.5-5 hrs in an airport for a layover and be told the next flight is in 6-12 hours. Literally fly any other airline. You might die on Spirit but at least you won’t be stuck in literal purgatory with American.
Date of travel: September 2020,30,Irresponsible ,"I took my first flight on American Airlines for the first time last night and was completely shocked that every seat on the flight was full. American is almost always my go to when flying. Earlier in the week I thought it was odd when I received an email to switch my flight at no cost due to it being a full flight. I assumed there proper spacing guidelines in place, but every seat was full.  Then I got the email for the bidding offer to take another flight. When I arrived to the gate, I was stunned to see the amount of people. Have these practices been given the okay by the CDC? I am definitely going to reconsider until there is a vaccine."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,DONT EVER DO IT!,"I was suppose to fly AA. Bought my ticket a month prior. Had my hotel, transportations, reservations to different excursions and restaurants all ready. Waited in like for an hour and 45 mins. Each person that headed to the counter were having issues. My flight was at 11:00 am I arrived to the ticket counter 10:01 only to hear “ ma’am I’m sorry but we can no longer check in ur bags due to not arriving to the ticket counter 60 mins prior your flight”. Umm I’m sorry it is an hour... “ no ma’am ur a min late. ARE YOU EFFING KIDIDNG ME!!! I raised hell! No way this isn’t possible spoke to his supervisor who was the rudest human I have ever met. Said yup can’t help you. THEY DID NOTHING TO ACCOMIDATE THEIR MESS UP! After having a breakdown in front of all the tellers they got me a higher supervisor who then tells me ya so even if we let u thru u won’t be able to board we over booked the flight. HOW IS THAT MY FAULT OR PROBLEM! So ur telling me no safety precautions r present they filled all the middle seats oh and when I asked y they said they changed plans last min. I WILL NEVER EVER FLY THIS AILINE AGAIN AND NOONE SHOULD. After fighting with customer service for hours they finally gave me a voucher THAT I DONT WANT! I don’t and will never fly these ppl. I had to then purchase new tickets for 1000$ leaving the next day thru another carrier. They didn’t care, didn’t help, were rude and disgusting. Ruined everything."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,American airlines is trash!!!!!,showed up an 1hr before my flight . Stood there with the lady at the desk for 20 minutes trying to find my info and flight. By the time she found it she told me that i have to show up 45 minutes before to check my bag. She said I was too late and wouldn't let me on the plane. Even though I still had 40 minutes till it boards. Never will ever use them again .
Date of travel: September 2020,10,No social distancing on aircraft AT ALL!,"1. No social distancing enforcement, passengers were crammed in the cabin like sardines. 2. Albeit a short trip, but absolutely NO water (bottled wouldn’t break this company) offered, however, sitting directly behind first class, they rolled out a cart and lingered with selections of drinks and snacks. WTH?3. Flight Attendants should take Delta’s FA and repeat. Do not talk down to passengers as if we’re idiots. They were rude and cranky. Except for first class.I WILL NEVER FLY AMERICAN AGAIN. GO DELTA!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Terrible Company - diagnosed with cancer,"My wife’s doctor called and told her she has to have emergency surgery to cut out the cancer they found. We needed to change our flight from 2:30pm departure to 6:15am. They charged us $175 per person because of this. Meanwhile, they never refunded us for the 2:30pm flight. They kept the money. I’m a very successful business owner and I could not believe they did this to us. This is why there is no brand loyalty when it comes to airlines. The airline industry does not believe in customer service anymore. It’s all about the dollar. I write this review so hopefully they can change their business model and have a little compassion. I could have provided evidence from the hospital."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Lack of Social Distancing / No thermal checking,"Do not fly American Airlines even if they offer a better deal than other airlines. They do not take social distancing seriously and sadly I saw this on my flight 2 days ago as I had to fly due to a family emergency. They packed as many passengers in a small plane and there were no available seats. When I complained to customer service after I got back from my flight, they said we ask passengers to sign a consent before traveling. Do you all think anyone who is sick is going to be truthful on their consent. Honestly with the pandemic the lack of social distancing was terrible. Even while boarding and getting off the plane they did not do anything like other airlines have done. My daughter who was scheduled to return back from Phoenix to Houston was on United and she told me that they used a bigger plane and kept the middle seat open. Another person I know flew Southwest and they told me that they are also keeping the middle seat open. I felt strongly about this issue and when I complained to customer service they brushed me off and said that they have improved on the cleaning of the airplane. It does not matter how clean the plane is if they allow infected passengers to fly and expose everyone and do not have a way to check and confirm that passengers are not sick. It is up to you if you want to travel with AA but for now I have already told my husband that we are not traveling on American Airlines."
Date of travel: September 2020,50,American Airlines,I would like to give Brandon burrows from American Airlines for being helpful when I missed my flight and was a great help to me
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Horrible customer care,"If you plan on flying, DO NOT book with American Airlines! We booked a roundtrip flight from DFW to Pensacola. GREAT PRICE....UNTIL....Hurricane Sally hit Pensacola Beach! Our flight was to leave Pensacola Airport 09/18 at 11:00 am.  All flights up to ours was cancelled, so we called the airport to see if ours would still be scheduled to fly.  They told us no, the airport was closed and AA would not be flying out of there that day. So, we called American Airlines, who argued with us that the airport was not closed, and changed our flight our of Destin/Fort Walton Beach.  We were charged an additional $440/ticket for a ONE WAY flight to be able to get back home. Let me add we had no water and no electricity on Pensacola Beach, so waiting to see if the airport or American Airlines was lying was not an option.  Our original flight DID end up being cancelled!! We have reached out to AA several times to let them know our flight that they told us would not cancel, DID cancel, and everyone has been very rude.  The last lady I spoke to had the nerve to tell me ""it's not like it was a surprise hurricane."" UMMM...yes it was! It skipped 2 states!! We were suppose to be in a tropical storm...not a hurricane that was moving 2 MPH!!!! I understand being charged to change our flight, but $440 is absurd. (This same flight was showing at $370 online when we changed ours) WE WILL NEVER FLY AMERICAN again.  HORRIBLE customer service and lack of caring on their part."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Terrible,The worst airline ever no social distancing southwest was better because they leave the middle seat with no one i was shocked how american airlines got everyone right next to each other no room for nothing...
Date of travel: July 2020,10,The worst airline ALIVE today.,I will never fly AA again due to the way they treat paying passengers! They treat us like animals and like we are an inconvenience! It comes from the top down.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,"Never fly AA, they should have never been bailed out","I fly from Richmond, VA -> SNA (Santa Ana, Orange County) on labor day weekend 2020; the plane was jammed back, on both legs - way against covid CDC guidelines. They destroyed a checked in sporting item of mine, like bad - I spent hours at the airport filing a claim with an agent; showed the agent the damage - I was rest assured I'd get a replacement. This is when the horrors set it; I tried following up for weeks on this - I was lied to, hung up on, and ignored - each conversation was a a relentless forensics trying to fight and debunk my claim, all of which was invalid, after a month I finally accepted a $200 eVoucher (my item was $300) - I just couldn't stand to speak with these shady people any longer; such a dark unethical company that should have never been bailed out. They will fight you tooth and nail on valid baggage claims. They are 100% on par with Spirit Airlines (worst of the worst). If you want to be treated like a human - do not fly AA ever. These corporations will only do what us people/customers allow; don't give companies like AA a dime."
Date of travel: September 2020,20,Sociasl,Absolutely no concern for social distancing. I was onboard a almost full flight. How is this legal. This def does not follow federal social distancing guidelines. Clearly profit over safety is motto here.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Dont Fly American Airlines During Covid,I have flown three times since March 2020 and American was the worst. They are filling every plane to capacity. It was the only airline company that is not blocking off the middle seats. The flight attendants did not seem to care about anyone.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Worst Airlines Ever,It is no wonder this company is going under.  They treat their customers like crap.  I was hung up on by a supervisor when I tried to change my fight... Becuas of an emergency I needed to change my flight twice and they charged me $200 TWICE instead of be decent humans and charging me 1 time.  If you are greedy you get what is coming to you.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,No Service Recovery = A Bankrupt Company,"Hello,With all this trouble it will be very hard to fly again with American Airlines. I find it very hard to trust your company and the compensation for missing clothes and other belongings such as medication, toiletries, electronics, shoes and countless other things has cost me money that you are not willing to give me back unless I have receipts. To me that is the most corrupt and evil mindset and crime a company can commit again humanity or someone like me. I have not been able to change clothes, I wore the same items for weeks on end, dealt with pain and depression, and the items in my luggage are precious gifts that I thought I would never get back. Now I get them back but the time, effort and money I spent trying to move through life since will not be replace unless I have a receipt which is robbery to me and I’m sure everyone else’s eyes globally. I feel that the least you could do is offer complimentary hotel and food vouchers or something more because you know very well that your company has caused me extensive anguish and exhaustion chasing down my belongings. To be American Airline should be the best airline in the world and honestly you have failed the American people by calling yourself American Airline but delivering such and experience to me and I know countless others without adequate service recovery. Accidents happen but that is okay if you are able to be held accountable and make up for your mistakes. American Airlines has made it through this rough time for the global economy because of people like me and if there is no accountability then company’s with this behavior and attitude fall prey to bankruptcy, buyout and the employees like yourself are the only ones who end up hurting and jobless. Whilst the CEO’s and top people make out with all the money to move forward and the countless employees struggle as well.This is not a threat, this is a plea to make it right and use what power you have to justify the negative impact you have caused me.

Date of travel: September 2020,20,What Covid?,"During our recent trip to Mexico the most uncomfortable part of our trip was the air travel. This was thanks to American Airlines choosing to fly at full capacity. Yes they require everyone to wear a mask but what good does that do if you’re packed in line with people boarding, during the flight and un boarding. I wish we would have researched this before hand. Delta for instance is booking at 60% in the main cabin in an effort to space people out."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Today I purchase a one way flight OMA to FLL and another FLL to OMA. Paid as required $482.29 for four people.,"Today I purchase a one way flight OMA to FLL and another FLL to OMA. Paid as required $482.29 for four people.  I used Bookingbuddy.com, thenjetcost who connected to Click2Book.  Rad all of the instructions.  One hour later I get a man, Gary Williams, India accent who said I owe another $110 for one flight and $125 for the other.  I asked why and he said because of additional charges, didn't you read the contract, I said yes for what was provided.  He said pay or you don't get a e tickets and loose the $965.19 you paid.  I told him this sounds like a scam.  He said American Air charges $25 per carry on bag and they will forgive that =$200 if I pay the $235.00.  I called American and they said they don't charge for carry on.  I talked with him again and he said that if I am not happy he will refund $180.00 but loose everything else.  I am contacting the US Commerce Dept and FAA to file a complain for fraud."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Stay Away from this Airline,"we boarded and then sat on the plane 2 hours becuase the gas gage wasnt working properly. After about an hour a few people asked to be placed on different flights. we sat there another 25 mins and I along with another couple asked  for a different flight, we were told to go sit down by the flight attendant. That the issue was almost fixed and we would be leaving I tried to explain I have horrible anxiety issues which I need medication for, and I was told to sit back in my seat. The other couple that asked for another flight was told to sit as well. They never fixed the gage. They told use they had extra fuel in the wings because of prices in florida being high. when they started to back up to get ready for take off after almost two hours the plane smelled of strong gas. I as well as another passanger asked a flight attendant what was the cause of this and if it was safe to be flying with it smelling of gas. and we both were  completely ignored. She just walked by as if nothing happened. Worse experince ever stay away"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Don’t ever book with this airline,"WORST customer service I have ever experienced. Also not cleaning well for covid! Less then 3 minutes of unloading the plane they were reloading it, no way you can clean all those seats and wipe them down that quick! Annnd After a 5 hour delay!! No food or drinks offered. No compensation! Unable to do anything for us, unable to do anything on our last night or vacation due to this delay. Customer service was rude and not helpful. This happened to someone else I knew ruined 2 full days of their vacation because of the airline and once again didn’t care. All they care about is collecting the fees, not giving back when they’re at fault. I will never book with this airline again. Spirit airlines are more helpful then them!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Non-refundable Tickets,"7 days after booking my flights, American Airlines rescheduled both flights.  Due to their rescheduling, I was not able to catch either of my connecting flights.  I was told by an Agent that I would be refunded the ticket cost of $167.20 and proceeded to tell me how to go about doing that.  After another week or so I received a message from American telling me that they will not refund my trip.  I have had to re-book on another airline and rent a car to make this trip.  I understand the non-refundable clause, but when it is out of my control, I don't think it is fair for them not to reimburse me for a flight I cannot take."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Worst flight,Literally the worst airline I've ever flown. The employees were incredibly rude and extremely unhelpful. Asking a question seemed to be an inconvenience to them. When we checked in there were 4 employees chatting to each other about their weekend and didn't want to lift a finger to help us out. I would rate a zero star if I could. If you want a cheap flight no big deal but if you care about service pay a little more somewhere else.
Date of travel: September 2020,40,american airlines man-phl,I should have taken a flight to the usa on sep4th until sep14th. Obviously this was cancelled. I requested a refund which i promptly got on the 18th. Just wanted to thanks American airlines for a quick response in difficult times
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Cancel/Rebook Reservation,"Do to COVID-19 my husband and I canceled our flight to Las Vegas in May, I talked to Katie and she was so helpful and just a joy to talk to as she explained the waiving of fees to cancel and rebook.  This month I talked to Heidi to rebook the flight to Las Vegas and she was also very helpful and a pleasure to talk too; I my Mahalo to American Airlines for looking out for their customers in this terrible time of COVID-19 and my Mahalo to Katie and Heidi for taking the time to work with me.  Be safe all."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,"They say they waived their change fee, NOT ","American Airlines proudly joined United airlines with the removal of “Change Fees” for passengers who wish to change their flight arrangements.  This is very disingenuous. What they have in fact changed is the name, “A rose by any other name would smell as sweet” but in this case it’s smells a little foul.  On their website they announce change fee waived but what they are now doing is charging an exorbitant “Change in Fare” fee. We went to change our tickets from Norfolk to LAX and the change in fare was more than the original purchase price of the ticket!  Shame on you.  Believe me the public sees right around your scam!"
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Staff made the trip!,"Jen E and Luke H absolutely made our flight! Friendly, relatable, down to earth people. They made every accommodation to ensure we were having the best flight. They were also very friendly and made our flight fly by. It’s staff like them that made me want to continue flying American Airlines! Absolutely enjoyable, friendly, welcoming people! From the minute we stepped on the flight, Jen set the tone by giving us a goodie bag and politely welcoming us. Luke and Jen both came by multiple times to ensure we were doing well and to keep us company on the 3 hour flight. Extremely relatable and friendly; they literally made our entire trip and DFW wasn’t even our end destination! Thank you for hiring people like them who are life loving and friendly enjoyable people. Thank you for making them a part of our trip and a part of our lives! Love them!"
n/a,50,Flight attendants Luke Hamilton and Jen Esch made the flight,"I cannot say enough how impressed I am with the customer service of Jen Esch and Luke Hamilton on flight AA 2194. How friendly, outgoing, and extremely humble both of these two were is a reason we choose to be loyal customers and fly with AA. I am thankful for these two representing this company and hope they continue to for a very long time. Thank you. -Chad"
Date of travel: September 2020,20,Horrible service,"Despite COVID-19, this aircraft was slammed. They had us waiting an extremely long time to board the aircraft, and once we were finally onboard we were consistently rushed by all of the staff. Not one of these crew members welcomed us onboard. I was actually yelled at upon stepping into the craft. The very first flight attendant told me to step aside and let someone through (There was nowhere to move). As I was beginning to move she continued to repeatedly bark at me to step aside until I finally told her to stop yelling as I was already moving. Once we reached our seats, in a once again, very crowded aircraft (forget all guidelines) we began to load our carry-on and we’re yelled at by a flight attendant (Angel) to hurry and let others through. Mind you, two women flying alone and we have a gentleman behind us who is yelling at us instead of assisting us with some light equipment. Embarrassing on behalf of American Airlines. We have never experienced anything like this prior to this flight. The service was unacceptable. The staff was a complete and utter disappointment."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,American Airlines...AA.... Stands for American Awake ? Does American know there's a pandemic?,"I just flew from SAN-PHX on 9/11.  We were packed full with no social distancing on boarding.  The herd crowded into the jetways.  Then once on the plane it was completely full.  No social distancing with a middle seat open LIKE DELTA AND SOUTHWEST  are doing!  American has taken, are you ready, $5.8 BILLION dollars from the government but won't adhere to government CDC recommendations!  Disgusting.  They don't seem to care about their passengers health, only filling up a plane.  Inflight magazines were in every seat pocket...gee, that a nice touch point!.  Yes, they clean their planes but not leaving seats open is awful.  I will never fly them again during this pandemic and never once it is over because or their dangerous lack of social distancing.  I won't forget."
Date of travel: September 2020,20,Flight modification policies,"I just want to start off that I appreciate the customer service from AA, but this review is about capatalism. I understand that america is about the economy, and consumerism, there has to be a line drawn somewhere though. I booked a flight for a buisness trip within the states which I would consider flying american airlines would be patriotic by showing some financial support toward the company because america, you know.  My buisness trip was extended by quite some hours on the last day which was supposed to be the day I fly out. Now this is where the review has some constructive critiscism, I called customer service which I got a pretty fast response. The employee I was talking to explained there was going to be a price diffrence which I respected. I am going to let it out now I payed around $180 roundtrip for two weeks of a time frame. I was not able to modify to a flight within the same day but later becuse the price diffrence was cheaper the next day, I was okay with that due to my inconveiniencing toward the company.   I paid maybe $210 for the diffrence for a one day modification. On my behalf I then explained the cost to my employeer and I was advised to not ""financially stress"" myself for that price so I then called customer support again to re-modify my flight back to the original ( it seems like I am complaining, I know) but when I was informed by customer service there was a price difference again I almost had to recalculate because why was there a price diffrence to go back to a cheaper departure which happend to be my original. I blamed the economy in my head but the customer support told me AA used to automatically charge $200, so I thought to myself where is the same financial empathy I showed by originally booking this company becuse america. The answer is capitalism, I was then charged $8 cool becuse I get it then tax which makes since The gov has to get their portion of the end aswell. By the way there is no refunds okay I get it but why charge me when I revert back to my original departure. Where I am baffled is when there was a email sent to me explaining my original departure might be pretty packed so they offrered a free flight modification and yes I took it because I got to sleep a few extra hours, now this free flight also happend to be on the same day as my original but a few hours later. I get it everyone we are in a economic crisis along with a helath pandemimc, but come on ceo and friends of American Airlines why did you have to spit in my face like this through your means of capitalism. I thought this was america land of the free home og the brave. I THOUGHT THIS WAS AMERICA!!!!!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Getting worse,"I've been flying economy airlines since I was 10 years old, I would visit my family during the summer due to my parents divorce. Site I would have a few long layovers or minor delays but  generally it was a good experience that I look fondly back on. I now find myself in the same position with my three sons, flying from Florida to Washington multiple times a year and if I had a choice of airlines that crossed the country right now I would even choose Value Jet over the  EA games piece meal charging and every single flight being full with two being at capacity. My youngest twins are 12 and are being evaluated for MS in Seattle, i will have to fly multiple times a year and now I have to worry about Asymptomatic people sitting next to me for over 4 hours and then possibly infecting one of my high risk children and everyone they interact with including thier high risk mother who is works in the medical community and could infect her whole facility. I've accepted that at 6'4 it is always painful to sit for hours without legroom and that my own mental health problems make being around a lot of people for very long will badly affect me for days and that I can rarely leave my apartment. Those things I've accepted so that I can be there for my sons. But this disregard for risking the lives of me and my children is causing a real anxiety to add on top of the ones I have to battle to have some kind of life worth living. I hate that I have no safer and faster method to be with them and I have that ""American"" Airlines should really be named ""Capitalism and Shareholders"" Airlines. There comes a point where basic humanity should take priority over profit. I know the front line employees are not responsible for the decisions made by the people in charge and I sympathize with them which is why I show them proper respect while flying. Whenever possible I will pay a little more or have a longer layover just to avoid AA but I don't think that will be realistic in the near monopoly in Airlines at the moment."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,very bad for your ear drums.,Oh my god. How many time do the cabin pressure has to change. Its been 2 days  since I took that flight and my ear drum still did not set back in. I took  Flight AA2630. Most horrible experience I ever had. I do not need ruptured eardrums so I am never using this airline again.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Lost a day of our honeymoon,"American Is awful! Changed our 6 am flight on the 13th at 5:30 am the 13th with no notification to us until we arrived at the airport that morning. This change Left us missing our connecting flight in Dallas to Key West having us then having to spend 23 hours in Dallas. We just got married on Sept. 12, this was our honeymoon. American Airline’s change had us miss 24 hours of our honeymoon in Key West! And their excuse for this happening  and doing nothing about is covid. Will never fly American again!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Do not do it!,"This is the worst airline I have ever used.  First,  when I left on my trip to Miami, we loaded the plane and stayed parked for an hour before we even moved. I would have let go of that but, I am pregnant and went into a medical crisis right before leaving Miami yesterday. I was rushed away from the airport in an ambulance. I was told with such care that I would not need to worry about rescheduling. I was told that they would reschedule my flight for free. SIKE! When I called for help  and waited 45 minutes to speak to a human, they were very cold and. short. I was told I needed to pay $125 dollars more to return home. When I asked to speak to someone else the rep got an attitude. The next rep was worse! She would not help me with my flight information, cut me off several times, and even hung up on me after I asked for someone who could help me. I would rather book another flight with another airline than use my  credit to fly with them again. It's sad."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,THE WORST AIRLINE,"WILL NEVER FLY AMERICAN Again. You are better off booking the same price ticket thru a private airline! Not to mention the fact that they dont give a sh** about you. I have flown American dozens of times with the same AWFUL customer service.  We missed a connecting flight due to what they say was ""weather"" related, but was never told that from the flight was told for overcrowding at the connecting airport. Upon arriving watched our flight leaving having to wait 45 minutes because of a down aircraft.  This was just their way to not have to reimburse the hundreds of flights they screwed up. We would of been on a flight over 12 hours later to our destination. We opted to fly somewhere closer and rent a car to DRIVE 4 hours to make it back in time for our engagements. When reaching out to customer service trying to get something for the inconvenience customer service WAS RUDE!!!!! So much attitude cutting me off while trying to explain that there was nothing they could do and is RESPONSIBLE for none of it. COMPLETE RIP OFF. Disgusted with how airlines can get away with whatever they please."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Bunch of crooks,Bunch of crooks. Not allowed to use cancelled trip credit and vouchers towards flight purchase? Or towards seat upgrades? Beyond ridiculous.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Don’t use this airline,This airline is terrible I will never use it again . Being military I always get my bags waived well this time they refused for absolutely no reason I told them that’s not right and they should be ashamed of themselves. The whole time they did nothing but laugh in our faces and talk to each other about me and my wife . They have the worst customer service I’ve ever seen they didn’t try to help or do anything don’t use this airline if I could give a 0 I would
Date of travel: September 2020,10,NEVER EVER AGAIN 0 STARS,"I dont even know where to start. Was woken up out of a dead sleep to be told my mask wasnt on my nose, when i looked at the 2 passengers across from me wide awake with a mask on their face at all i was told not to worry about them. One the way back they forced me to check a Carry one after they over booked a flight. They changed my flight due to technical issues. When i asked the lady why my ticket said chicsgo not grand rapids for my baggage she told me i do this everyday very rudely, it will be at my final destination. Well.....it never made it there. 3 days later i got it. While on the plan i was behind a highly intoxicated lady using radical slurs and being very vulgar. Security told her to keep her mask on or she would be removed. As soon as the plane started moving she took it off and was coughing and sneezing all over...USING RACIAL SLURS...had a whole meal in her carry on bag spilling it all over, When i asked the flight attendant to do something he shrugged his shoulders. Multiple passengers complained. Nothing was done. I filed multiple complaints and was giving a pre written letter saying how saftey is number 1. Blah blah blah. I DONT CARE IF UNAMERICAN AIRLINES IS 500 CHEAPER I WILL NEVER FLY WITH THEM AGAIN"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Changing Ticket Name,American Airlines has terrible customer service. My girlfriend booked my ticket and accidentally put the wrong last name. When I found out I called them to change my last name. They said we could not change the Last name or be refunded for the tickets. They made us purchase new tickets altogether and the people were rude. DO NOT fly with them.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Flyer,Horrible customer service boarding started at 6:42 got there at 6:50 and they said they where done boarding and all the doors where closed . Now we are on standby and where told we might not have a seat yet i paid for this flight with my money . NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER Would Give 0 stars if i could .
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Watch your Credit Card chrges,"Two things stand-out about this flight:1) American Airlines charged me $30 twice for checked bag on out-going flight. Trying to get it corrected,but AA is too busy with other issues to help me.2) After boarding plane for last leg of flight, wife initially sat next to a young girl (twenty something) who insisted on wearing her mask around her neck, while at the same time coughing consistently. Talked to Flight Attendant who basically told me that she bought a ticket and there was NOTHING that the FA could do (except remind the girl to wear her mask). I was able to relocate my wife next to me and we're hoping we're okay. I am surprised that airlines don't check temp of passengers as they board."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,No distancing on the plane.,"What good is it to social distance before boarding if we end up shoulder to shoulder with other passengers. In my case, there was a mother with a child that kept bumping me on one leg. I kept my face toward the window for 2.5 hrs. Then on another leg, the person next to me was very large. His shoulder and arm was well into my space causing me to lean toward the window for almost three hours...They packed it in like usual. I guess I was mistaken, I thought they were spacing ppl on the plane, but nope I was wrong. I was terrified the whole way to my destination and back. I was already paranoid about traveling. Will think twice before flying AA next time. Only flew this time for a funeral in the family."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,NO info for delayed flight,I am currently standing in line nearly an hour after I was supposed to board my American Airlines flight. This is my first and very last time I will ever choose this airline. There has been zero communication regarding whether or not this flight is delayed or what is going on. I understand delays due to weather but there is no excuse for leaving passengers wondering what is going on for an hour. I was supposed to take off thirty minutes ago and now I have absolutely no idea when I will be reaching my destination.
Date of travel: September 2020,20,Severely dissapointed,"I have become severely dissapointed in what was once a great  airline that understood customer service and went beyond the mark to make loyal customers happy during situations that were out of the ordinary. For those that connect through DFW, you know that weather plays a big part in if you get off the ground, if your plane has made it in for your connection.  Sometimes, the airline just cancels a flight or ""delays"" a flight overnight and says it's weather. Our flight had a 11 hour ""delay"" which meant an unexpected overnight in Dallas.  Plane was in Dallas. I saw it.  No weather on either end. i was connecting in DFW.American swears it was weather. Ok.. fine.. 11 hour delay and you think it's ok to tell someone no meal voucher, sleep in the airport? we're not going to do anything for you you are on your own.  Not only that, when I ask a gate agent to tell  me what is going on, I'm rudely ushered away like they can't be bothered to take a breath. In today's economy, where airlines are hurting, wouldn't you think the more appropriate thing to do is recognize and speak to your loyal customers vs. throwing them to the wolves?  I've flown loyally on this airline for over 40 years, have gold status and am a member of their admirals club.  All going away when it expires because they have no concept of customer service. My recommendation - they are expensive over competitors, and no longer know how to treat their customers. Don't expect anything."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,They are terrible.,This place is terrible. They sent my luggage to wrong place. We had to wait over an hour to speak to a manager. We seen the people tell him we needed to speak with him. It really took him over an hour to come to us after I had to go and find him. This is exactly why they are known as the garbage of airlines. Do to that we couldn't board our flight to our home moon. This place is a joke. Most of the workers are rude. I think our flight attendant might be the smartest person there. I would suggest traveling to go to a different airport. I know I will never fly with this joke of an airline.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,The worst of the major airlines,They have now swapped to smaller planes which has you packed liked sardines in a can. Guess the threat from Covid is over??? Less than zero social distancing. Did they not get millions of tax payor dollars from the Government? They are earning the 10th place ranking out of 10 US airlines
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Never Again,Booked flight from San Antonio to Raleigh with a 40 min layover in Dallas. Arrived in Dallas with 9 mins to spare for next flight on the total opposite side of airport. Didn’t make it. When we went to get new flight tickets they were trying to send me back to San Antonio instead of Raleigh. 40 min layover turned into a 4 hr layover and finally got to my destination by 7pm. On the return flight I go to get tickets and check in bag. I’m supposed to go from Raleigh to San Antonio and instead they told me that my final stop was in Dallas. I was like “No my last stop is in San Antonio and showed them my itinerary and they said “Oh! Well that’s not what we see here”....got new tickets and had to wait 3 hrs in Raleigh when I was technically suppose to leave by 930am and ended up leaving by 1230pm. Got to Dallas just to be on standby for 3 “overbooked” flights and now staying the night......Worst part is they gave me crap about my having a CPAP. So they could shut up I put it in my check-in luggage and now that’s in San Antonio and I’m stuck in Dallas. They said that they allow medical equipment yet gave me a hard time bc I had it on my person. Just had it in its own little bag. Never again will I fly American Airlines.
n/a,10,"Rude, mean, condescending, horrible, unkind, the list goes on","We had a traumatic experience today with TSA and AMERICAN. My ticket was randomly selected for extra security...ok fine. Not fine though because TSA forced me to wait indefinitely with no explanation even though I explained to multiple people I was going to miss my connection. TSA  literally treated me like a child being punished because I was visibly upset about being ignored they chose to detain me even further until I could ""behave"" which of course only mage me more irate. When I finally emerged from their torture...which according to multiple TSA persons, it was AMERICAN who ordered the security screening. (Btw, I'm a global entry citizen). My husband went to the gate ahead of me and explained the situation. They did not care. They would not hold the plane for 5 minutes even though it was the last flight out. They threatened to call security on my husband when he got angry. By the time I got to the gate, they had already sent him to customer service/customer DISSERVICE. We were able to get boarding passes for the next morning but not before some other American attendant tried to prevent the guy we were working with from issuing them. For no reason...she just stuck her nose in and said it was TSA's fault. I told them TSA said American ordered the screening...she said no.. someone is obviously lying. The attendant working with us did provide the boarding passes. We had to pay for a room and sleep in our clothes. I WISH ALL AIRLINE WERE RUN LIKE SOUTHWEST."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Policy change with no warning,"AA informed me in June 2018 that anytime they delay a flight, that the customer can get a full refund. Well they changed this policy apparently recently and have made it EXTREMELY difficult to find on their website. You have to search for the 'conditions of carriage' link then click on the 'delays, cancellations, and diversions' link, then click on 'ticket types and refunds'.  It's not under refunds or flight changes. You have to actively search for it. I didn't actually find the policy until AA's customer relations dept sent it to me.  I booked a trip for a friend and myself for September 2020. They delayed the flight home by 3 hours and 5 minutes which didn't work for my friend. Based on the refund policy I was previously given, I canceled the flight, and my friend and I both rebooked (partially with American). I was declined my refund and the ticket price can only be used by person who it was originally ticketed to. I'm not traveling with my friend again before the ticket value expires. If the policy was easy to find or if AA sent any communications regarding the new policy, I would not be upset at all. I find their hiding of this policy to be deceptive and they have completely lacked consideration of my situation. I have platinum status with AA and always have flown them whenever they  were going to my destination even when they cost more. Very disappointed."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Will NEVER fly American Airlines again.,"I will start off with saying I do not usually write reviews but after this last trip, it needs to be done. We picked American because it had better flights for our Honeymoon dates.. First off, they canceled our flight out and put us on a flight that arrived AFTER our connecting flight. We fixed this and had to arrive the night before, no biggie we thought since we were on our honeymoon. On the way back, our flight was delayed which only gave us a hour to make it through customs. We tried to ask multiple American employees about this and NO ONE would give us any information, they all said ask the next person. So we land in Miami and immediately get a text message saying our flights had changed and here is a hotel and meal voucher.. yet our flight was still scheduled. After hustling through customs and getting our bags rechecked, we were told the bags would make the flight. We arrive in JAX, long and behold our bags are not there.. After talking to customer service and being told our bags would arrive today since they got sent to Charlotte (why in the world would they send them there?) they have still not arrived, they are hanging out in Charlotte.. no one has been helpful at all. We will never fly American again, thanks for making our honeymoon travel a nightmare."
Date of travel: September 2020,20,Canceled my flight,"I had a whole trip planned to Guam for the end of the month. A one way ticket because I'm getting married on the island and will be living there. Two days ago they called me and told me they canceled my flight from Tokyo to Guam, but my flight from Raleigh, El Paso, etc, was still fine. I called the lady and she said they aren't taking any flights through Tokyo. okay that's fine, but when I asked for my flight to be redirected to Hawaii the lady became very rude and seemed like she was not doing the most to help me. She had an attitude with every question I asked. I ended up having to cancel my flight and now I won't be able to leave till the beginning of November. Also I'm confused about why the tickets skyrocketed to Guam after they canceled my trip. They're now 6,000 and more. This is why I usually fly United."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Where do I start?,"We booked a vacation to Prague. We used American Airlines vacation package. The trip was cancelled due to Covid. American Airlines talked us into keeping the money with them instead of a refund. In doing so they would contribute something like 10% to our monies. We booked a trip to Alaska, which we could not do, as we would have to have negative Covid test within 72 hours of arriving. We couldn’t find anyone that could do that turn around on a test. We had to cancel that trip. We then booked a trip to Denver, staying in Estes Park. We arrive at our vacation destination (that American Airlines booked for us via a voucher) only to be told that this place does not honor vouchers from American Airlines! 😡We were left riding around at 9 p.m. looking for a place to stay. American Airlines is the bottom of the list, especially for customer service. They falsify everything they tell you. Please beware of this airline. Oh and please make sure you take something to drink with you, they didn’t even give us a bottle of water 💧 on our flight!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,American Airlines sucks,"This airline keeps expressing they are practicing social distancing, yet we are packed like sardines.  I would rather them say they are not practicing social distancing than keep say it.  Unfortunately, this was the only airline I could take.  Had I k ow I would have used a different t airline.  They really suck!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Missed flight and 350 bill,We were flying out from Phoenix AZ to Green Bay with a layover in Chicago to go to my cousins  wedding. We have never been to Ohare so we were following signs to go to our terminal. It led us out of the terminal so we asked a guard where we needed to go. He let us know we walked out and needed to go back through the check point. We went to go through and my boyfriends boarding pass wouldn't load. We still had a few minutes until boarding so we went to print it at the self check in. It showed an error so we went up to the desk. When we asked the receptionist to print the pass she said she couldn't so we asked for a supervisor. He said he couldn't do anything so we asked what we should do next and he shrugged and walked away. At this point I was extremely  frustrated because we were on a tight timeline to make it to the wedding. At this point the receptionist said she would look up the next flight which wasn't until after the wedding. We asked what else could be done and she told us to rent a car. They did not offer any discount or assistance. We went to the rental car place and the cheapest car available was $352 which was more expensive than our flight. When we contacted support they told us they would not reimburse us for the rental we had to take in order to make it to the entire reason we were flying out and only refunded us for the flight that was missed. When I asked to speak with management  they told us that they did not have a manager in customer relations  and there was nothing they could do for us. Because American Airlines website had an error we missed our flight and had to rent a car in order to make it to my cousins wedding we are our $352 dollars. We were lucky that we had the money to even rent the car. If we did not have $552 (there was a $200 holding fee due at the time of rent) we would not have been able to make it to my cousins  wedding. We would not use them again but they refunded us with a voucher that we can only use with them.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Not Worth 1 Start,"American Airlines has disappointed me 3 times this past month and I have absolutely just had it with them. With the pandemic, many airlines are allowing refunds/e-credits/etc. American has made it incredibly difficult by not providing e-credits every time a flight is canceled. You will receive a different answer every time you call customer service. This past flight I booked using a ticket number since American failed to send me an e-credit, but don’t worry they said, the cost of my flight was “safe.” A week before my flight, they sent me an email saying to contact them regarding my flight. When I called, the gentleman couldn’t help me and stated I had to contact Customer Relations. They removed me from my flight to be at my nieces baptism where I am the God mother. No idea if they’re going to do the right thing, but as of right now, no response. Customer Relations also doesn’t not have a number. So thank you American for once again making this time more stressful than it already is. Better Business Bureau complaint on the way."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,American Airlines don’t care about customers,American Airlines does not care about their customers with disabilities. They make it incredibly difficult to get the help you need. Worse experience with customer service ever. Each rep i spoke to only have me partial information to the point were i had to pay multiple additional fees to get there and back home. I was disrespected and embarrassed every step of the way
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Packed planes. Very unsafe,"All 4 of my planes were packed. Transfers in Charlotte, an American hub were crazy. Huge crowds shoulder to shoulder. It will be a miracle if everyone isn't sick within a week."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Want to be treated like cattle?,"The following is exactly what I posted as a review after the flight:Poor quality of character and customer service. I asked if preboarding includes people traveling with young children (I had 2). The response I received was ""We only preboard people with a disability - are YOU DISABLED!??"" I had flown to Florida with Delta and also transitted just a week before. On both flights there were empty seats beside every passenger. AA not only filled every single seat, they actually overbooked the plane and if it was not for a muslim family with 2 children giving up one of their seats and taking their child on their lap for the entire flight, they'd have a problem on theur hands from passengers. To add insult to injury, the flight attendant assured the family that they'd be reimbursed but they double checked with the agent to be sure. The reimbursement was denied by the agent who boarded the plane and felt satisfied that the problem was sufficiently resolved by itself. She turned her back on the family and said behind her back ""no we don't do reimbursements!"""
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Why wouldn't you??,"American Airlines is always my first choice when it comes to my airline travel options.  What attracts me is their locations in which they travel too.  Also, they partner with some amazing other airlines which comes in handy when i need to use my reward miles.  LOVE LOVE AA!!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Sardine Can,"What’s the point of making us socially distance if we are packed in like sardines? We are right on top of each other. It doesn’t matter if we are in first class or basic economy. Every single seat is full. I thought we we were still in a pandemic. I don’t even want to travel right now, but I’m being forced to because my father is dying. American Airlines doesn’t care about their passengers. They care about profiting. It’s not like they are paying the flight attendants or pilots a decent wage anyways."
Date of travel: September 2020,40,Average flight.,"Same as always now that we are in COVID. Board, sit, stand, deplane. We are asked to sit in seats until the row in front have left their seats, no one takes any notice of that. No drink service but if you ask for a coke/soda they will give you one in First. In economy if you ask for that you will be offered water."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Multiples issues with the Flight; First and Last time flying with AA.,"This was my first flight with American Airlines, and it was not a pleasant experience to say the least. First issue, we booked an overnight flight to New Orleans with a layover om the way to our destination, and a direct flight back to Los Angeles. Maybe a week before our scheduled flight, they moved our first flight time later into the night, which meant we would arrive much later to our destination. We were not happy, they did not give us the option to reschedule the flight. Also, for the direct flight back, they added a layover without the option of rescheduling or some kind of compensation for the inconvenience. Second issue was their disregard for the CDC guidelines. I would say 2 out of our 4 flights were FULLY BOOKED. There was absolutely no social distancing being practiced boarding the plane nor inside of the plane. I was perplexed. This company really does not care for the health and safety of their consumers during a pandemic. The flights were extremely uncomfortable. It's safe to say I will never fly with American Airlines again."
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Love American!,"I had a very nice flight yesterday.Uneventful both flight attendants were very courteousThe one in fact was kind enough to thank me for my continued loyalty with American and gave me a thank you note. That is going above and beyond! It is always nice to have someone say thank you for flying American but for someone to write a note, a personal note and give it to me that’s going the extra mile and I love that !Anyway American is my favorite airline and my only airline"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Zero care for CDC guidelines,"Completely unorganized and unprepared to handle cdc reconditions, they do not load the plane properly and they let everyone stand up and crowd the isles when it’s time to get off, also the worst thing is they fill the middle seat where you are just shoulder to shoulder with someone snacking on their cookies and water. I believe in the mask wearing but you allow people to remove them when eating on the plane isn’t that counterproductive???"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,DO NOT FLY WITH THEM,"I have never flown with America before and let me tell you i NEVER will Again. My trip started out smoothly. The first flight we were given sanitizing wipes, the associates were very courteous since my sisters travel agent messed up our tickets and put a two year old all by her self.  The flight after that,  no sanitizing wipes. Both flights were not exactly full so some social distancing care was put into place.  But let me tell you coming back?  I AM HORRIFIED.  The associate asked me several times what my ticket was. Then because she couldn't get them straight she said ""i can't do this i need to board"" with a HUGE attitude mind you.  Another attendant came over and tried to fix the seats and we ended up not in the same row but that's fine.  Here's where the horror comes in. THIS WAS AN ALMOST FULL FLIGHT. IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. I WAS TRAVELING WITH TWO CHILDREN AND MY ROW AND MY SISTERS WAS FILLED.  WE EVEN HAD A STRANGER SITTING NEXT TO US THE ENTIRE TIME. The awful thing about it was these idiots had the bright idea to cut our previous flights and switch us to this one which most likely resulted in it being a completely full flight. I cannot make this up.  In the middle of a pandemic, trapped in a metal box and american airlines thinks its a bright idea to have an almost FULL FLIGHT. DELTA WOULD NEVER. I took a bunch of photos but they are too big."
Date of travel: August 2020,40,AA got it right 😀,"The most stressful part of any trip is flying. Any time a flight is delayed, there is always a risk of missing the connection flight. Well they got it right and everything was on time as it should be for our trip. The AA advantage CC we got is also paying for itself with no check bag fees. We have already had one free flight with miles and are close to another. I would recommend you get some drinks before you leave the airport because the flight didn’t offer on either of our trips which was odd. The plane did practice social distancing with 2 to a row. Overall AA did everything they needed to and my trip was a success and made my event on time."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,My last American AIrlines Flight... Ever,"I rarely feel compelled to write a negative review about any company, but my experience today with American Airlines is an exception. I plan on posting my experience on several websites like this one. About a month ago I booked 2 tickets to Aspen, CO to fly American directly into Aspen. Earlier today I logged on to select my seats and the Aspen part of my itinerary was missing?!!!? Where did it go? Did I miss an email? What happened?!!It turns out American canceled that particular flight (which is the only one that day that goes into Aspen) for not reason at all and the flight the following day to Aspen only had 1 seat available but there are two travelers. Oh, and I was not notified either. Thankfully I found this out today, and not on the 17th when I am scheduled to leave.After talking to my travel agency, I suggested that they reroute me to Denver (now I am flying into a much cheaper destination and will also have a 3 hour car ride). I'm flying into Denver for the cost of flying direct to Aspen,CO. So not only did I overpay for a flight that isn't even happening (with no type of refund or seating upgrade or free checked bag), but now I also have to payto rent a car. American Airlines is joke, this is not the first time I've had issues but I promise this will be the last. And I plan on telling everyone I know about this experience. Hopefully there won't be anymore problems with my reservation between now and the 17th. There are plenty of other options to fly than American."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Ripped Off from Rebooking a flight cancelled because of COVID,"I have not even taken my flight yet and it has already been a disaster. After needing to cancel my trip from May 2020 and rescheduling it to September 2020, American claims they will waive the rebooking fee and only charge a difference in fare. HA. My mistake. When I went to rebook my new flight it was about $30 more. No problem. I knew I would likely need to pay a little more than my original ticket. Unfortunately, they charged me a $90 *additional fare collection* (whatever that is), probably to get around not charging people the change of ticket fee. It's as if they think their customers are stupid and do not know the price of a ticket before booking. There should have been no hidden fees, only the difference in fare. After reaching out to them to have this resolved, they told me there's nothing they could do about it and could not refund the unwarranted, hidden $90 charge. Lucky for me I have my original receipts and new receipts saved and screenshotted them to send over for proof I was overcharged. Even if they do end up resolving this, I will never fly American Airlines again. It was my mistake in the first place for wanting to get a good price on my original flight. I will only be flying Delta from now on. Even budget airlines have better customer service and the fact that they clearly think their customers are lying about their experience is maddening."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Don’t fly american.,I find it morally irresponsible for American Airlines to oversell fights at this time with the pandemic. My first flight from Detroit to Charlotte was overbooked.  It was an hour late due to storms and they rebooked us on another overbooked flight. I lost my premium seats and they separated my husband and I. Very very disappointed. First and last time with american.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,bounced and bungled,"After booking a flight for 9/8/20 over a month in advance, AA delayed the first leg of our trip by over an hour, which would have caused us to miss our other 2 connections. So we reluctantly agreed to fly out a day later. All those flights (3 of them) however had my wife and I sitting in different rows. We are elderly senior citizens. When I asked if they could pay the extra $71 from PHX-PHI and upgrade us so we may sit together, they refused. I know it's hard times for everyone right now, but this is exactly why corporations are failing these days. THEY inconvenienced US, we accommodated them by changing our plans, only to be inconvenienced again!. There is no compassion at AA. Goodbye AA, hello Delta!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,My items were stolen and American Airlines refused to do anything about it.,"I had to check 3 bags on my trip to the Virgin Islands with a layover in Miami. 2 of the 3 bags are brand new but to look at them after the trip looks like they were caught in a war zone. I’m not kidding or exaggerating. Not only were the bags in terrible condition, but lots of items were stollen from the bags that the airline “refuses to take responsibility for”. So now not only do I not get recompensed for the stolen items, I have to worry about new items that I purchased while on vacation for my loved ones being stolen on the trip back. I was told that unless the culprits come forward there is nothing that they will do to remedy this situation. Also I was told to ship the items through a reputable company so I guess the airline is not reputable since I obviously can’t use them as means for safely transporting my souvenirs. I’m sorry but I will NEVER fly American Airlines again. I have ZERO faith in their staff not to steal my items and since I was told that they will do nothing about this I am looking into getting a refund for my return ticket so that I can get a flight on Delta or JetBlue. If you have security grade luggage that can be locked and not tampered with I say ok fly with them and check the bag but if not, save yourself the trouble because it’s not worth it."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Poor performance from a COVID perspective,"In AA basic economy you are essentially penalized for being poor. Now, during COVID times, instead of boarding the plane starting from the back and moving towards the front, so that there is less interaction among its passengers, allowing for better social distancing measures, they still board it based on economic priority. Not only that, but also because we had an basic economy fare (which by the way it wasn’t even that affordable) we were taking our carry on suitcases before boarding because the “flight was full”. When we get to board, we see that there was plenty of space on the upper head compartments and that checking our bags at the gate was totally unnecessary. That made us have to wait for a long time at the baggage claim, along with many other passengers, exposing ourselves and others to a higher risk of exposure to the virus. Overall very poor COIVD related organization and sanitary rules applied. Will not recommend. They do care more about maximizing profits than about the security of its clients."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Theft by proxy!!,Will not fly them again a highly recommend the abolishment of this so called airline. A double booking due to a subpar internet connection caused a flight to be booked twice.  I immediately canceled the second flight and began the process of requesting a refund and submitting my paperwork. Arrived at the airport the following day and went directly to the ticket counter to address the issue with an agent. Boy was that a mistake. The young lady seemed really upset that I bothered her so early in the morning and such trivial discussions should not be had with her. Long story short. American Airlines customer service and airline flat out stink !!!! Fly DELTA.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Giving me a weekend when I paíd for a week,"Worst experience !!! MIA reps I quote said “ whatever the reps on the phone say doesn’t matter and we can’t do anything about it” Reps on the phone have us a date to take Covid test and that we didn’t need a notarized letter, when we arrive to the airport they say we NEED it. The African American woman said we were racist and she blocked our reservation without advising us. The give us the next available flight and only for the weekend when we paid for a whole week. They don’t wanna refund us the money or extend the ticket. They also I quote said “ idc nor do we have anything to do we have anything to do with the facilities giving the results 7-10 days later” but they want us to have the results 72hrs before ???. They want us to pay $200 somewhere for the test. Apparently the reps on the phone don’t have the same access to requirements for someone to fly as the people at the airport ?!! Just terrible."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,sardine can from champaign illinois to Chicago,"company that treats passengers so poorly doesn't deserve my business, Have taken Champaign to Chicago flight multiple times. knees rammed against seat in front to me. No storage for carry on luggage on 1/3 of plane unless you want to ram it under the front of your seat which is impossible unless you are a child. After sitting on the ground at O'Hare for over an hour on two occasions waiting to get off the plane after landing while breathing exhaust fumes, decided will never do again. Is only jet service from Champaign. If American removed 3-4 rows of seats from the plane so that there was enough leg room would make it tolerable."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,1 minute !!!,2 of us were 1 minute late.  They refused to let us on the plane. We both then watched the plane still in the same spot for over 30 minutes as we were put on stand by for a later flight that was booked full !!!!   1 minute??? Really??? Dont plan on traveling again.  The connecting flight was late and 1 minute ruined the rest of the day.  2 people... flights paid for. Compassion people...  No one will budge for 1 minute as we RAN through the airport.Delta here WE COME !!!
Date of travel: September 2020,10,The worst treatment by on flight staff ever threatened me and grandson,The lady threatened to throw me and grandson off our flight for me removing mask long enough to take a drink. Screamed so loud the whole plane heard her and made my grandson cry. He is four! The people are rude and threatening I will never fly American again! I’d rather pay extra to fly with someone else!
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Mrs.,I traveled by myself and was nervous because I needed handicapped assistance. The staff was super nice and I was met at terminal with a wheel chair. They took very good care of me. The flight was near perfect and staff very helpful. I was very impressed and will travel again with America. Mary Ross
Date of travel: September 2020,10,They cancelled our flight and won't give us a refund!,"American Airlines cancelled our flight stating they could not re-book it at this time and we would need to apply for a refund. We applied for the refund and it was denied stating it was a schedule change.  We have all the documentation showing their correspondence of a cancellation however, there is no way to contact customer support. Reservations representatives say we need to do it online and they are the only people you can actually speak with. Can someone help me locate a live customer service number?"
Date of travel: September 2020,50,BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!,"The incredible people at Myrtle Beach Airport helped my husband, my son and I when our flight got cancelled. They are so helpful and provided us a car seat, a hotel room, and a new flight. They fixed EVERYTHING, and it wasn't even their fault what happened. So I want to have a shout out to Scott, Denise, Jennifer, and Rana for having amazing customer service. These people need raises because they really went above and beyond to fix the problem. I will never forget American Airline and you definitely have a loyal customer for life!"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Avoid American unless you have no choice,"I booked American just to see what it's like. , I would normally fly British Airways in FC. At Check-in the staff were rude and just throwed my stuff on to the baggage belt, not even a smile when they gave my Boarding pass.The Boeing 777 was pretty clean and the legroom was okay, the food was pretty rubbish and felt like a Awful budget meal. Flight Attendants were attentive but rude. My IFE and didn't work and my Charger bearly did the Cabin crew wouldn't reset even asking multiple times. Although the Cabin itself was clean, the Toilet had a feces in it, GROSS!. I had to flush it down myself. Avoid this Airline, the ticket wasn't that cheap either."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,SAVE YOUR MONEY - RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!,"First of all, I hate how it makes you select a number to recommend this location, just don’t even go it’s not worth the frustration or time. After catching a flight in Austin with some rain and thunderstorms, a delay was obviously expected. My flight was supposed to board at 3:35 PM, we didn’t even take off of the ground until 4:35 PM. Still kept cool, Mother Nature happens ya know. Keep in mind though, I have a connecting flight later today that leaves at 8:10 PM.  Once landing in Charlotte, NC we were told by our stewardess to “grab your bag if you have a connecting flight and go” (The entire plane jumped up, everyone was a connecting flight, like who planned this?) followed by other agents saying the fastest way to catch our flight was run. So I did. I took off with my wedges, two bags and hauled ass like Ricky Bobby 5 minutes away from port D to E35A. After arriving I was completely ignored for 5 minutes! Instead, three “workers” were antagonizing a man who had been denied flight because of the airline’s incompetence and poor time management. Not only was I, but at least 20-50 other passengers stranded in Charlotte even though I made it at 8:01 to the boarding area, and the plane departed at 8:10. IT WAS STILL THERE!! Those people wouldn’t even look me in my eyes, I had beads of sweat pouring down my face and I run 5Ks every week, running is not hard for me but with this mask ordinance and full clothes with two bags, and then to be IGNORED by people who are paid to help you.... NOT worth my time or money. Not only did they ignore me, but after asking for resolution I had three completely incompetent people just point in the direction I needed to go and say customer service is that way. These people were standing around talking chatting just going on, they did not care. A lady that ended up sharing a hotel with me even said a lady slammed a door in her face, NO ONE RECEIVED RESPECT AT THIS LOCATION that was flying, even though it was American Airlines who royally f****d up and had NO intentions of taking responsibility for it.  No one wanted to help me, everyone was ready to clock out and leave for the day. From this day forward, I swear on my own life, I will make it a goal to convince any person that flies anywhere to spend a little more money or find an alternative like crawling on your hands and knees, just whatever you have to do besides trusting AMERICAN AIRLINES. THEY WILL SCREW YOU!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Flight was very crowded during a pandemic,"I was traveling home and had a layover in Charlotte. There was absolutely no distance between people and not a single seat was available on the plane. Everyone was next to each other. They make it seem like they are taking many precautions but I was so disappointed when I got on the plane and saw that every single seat was occupied. Overall, it was such a bad experience and I would not recommend anyone to take American Airlines in the middle of a pandemic"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Nurse,This 3 to a seat isn’t working to crowded and no social distances so need improvements it surpose to be 2 to a row not 3
Date of travel: June 2020,10,I was lied to by customer service representative,"I cancelled 7 tickets in June 4, 2020 I was told that I would get a travel voucher for 20% more.  I called last night to check the balance and was told that I have a credit for the tickets not a travel voucher.  I can't combine the tickets to use all together.  I was led to and basically Tim's there is nothing I can do. Do be NOT USE AMERICAN.  BAIT AND SWITCH"
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Travel day bring Covid.,"Traveled with Am A during the Covid issue.  I was very pleased with the cleanliness, the crew was polite and courteous, friendly and all in all a comforting flight.  No worries as everyone wore a mask the entire trip"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Mask Nazis,"Felt like a prisoner aboard the plane, they enjoy telling you to adjust your mask if it isn't over your nose correctly. I have a medical condition and was traveling for medical reasons because my neck was injured. But that doesn't matter because if you're not part of the corporate cult then you don't matter."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,45 MIN EARLY FOR CHECK-IN,Their website says 45min early they really need to emphasize on that because we were 42 min early and now we are getting to our destination about 8hrs later. Honestly I think the lady stood there and looked at me till we were past the 45min....
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Impossible Flights,As all are experiencing flights are changing. My flights I was offered from the airline left me stranded in north Carolina as my flight to Jamaica would have left before I arrived! After dealing with customer service for two hours now having to stay overnight somewhere costing me more money with no offers. Flying first class and find out they are sending me somewhere that the lounge is closed when there were options to go other places. Clearly they are trying to push people through with no consideration of what they are doing or the money you spent on getting somewhere. Never will fly this airline again. I fly all the time and clearly a reason why I don't fly them.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Rude,American Airlines customer service representatives are extremely rude. they don’t care about you and they say things under their breath. Will likely never to book with them again. They need to learn to have customer service if they’re going to run a business.
Date of travel: September 2020,30,Social distancing? Really?,"In the airport 6"" distance is enforced when buying a coffee, when waiting for boarding, when doing ANYTHING AT ALLI Very strict!  I boarded an American Airline plane with people sitting right next to me - like 20 inches from my face there is another face! So I thought ""well, I guess they need the money, lest give them a break"" (Southwest keeps the middle seat empty because of Corona Virus and to keep some semblence of social distancing!!!).After we rolled away from the gate I moved forward to one of about 8 empty exit row seats. I was told I couldn't sit there without an upgrade!!! The plane was already rolling! Who will now buy an upgrade? So they rather have several empty rows than having people sit further apart from each other (and now money has NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH IT, RIGHT?)Go figure!"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Worst customer service I’ve ever had on a flight.,"Since Covid has existed, they make you wear a face mask when flying. I have a face mask with a filter and they wouldn’t let me wear it on the plane since recently they banned these types of masks. I flew with the same mask when I arrived in Miami and don’t understand why there would be a ban for face mask with a filter and honestly doesn’t make any sense. At the end of the day it’s still a face mask right? I’m forced to wear a regular surgical mask that has no filter. By the way, the plane is COMPLETELY full. Secondly, they made me check my bag since you had to “force” it into the overhead compartment even though it still fit. If the plane was so full, why wouldn’t they just asked people to voluntarily to check their bag instead of singling out specific people?"
Date of travel: September 2020,10,How likely are you to recommend this airline?........thanks God their is rating for 0,"where do i even start...so much things were happening....lack of professionalism; Rude, Petty, (need i say more). computer never working apperantly whenever i fly. DELAYS!!! and more DELAYS!!! cant follow their own procedures. lack in leadership (managment). the list goes on and on. moral of review never fly with them again PERIOD! spend the extra few bucks for another airline it'll be worth it!!!!! thank God their is a rating for 0 for reccomendations. They'd be lucky to even get a 1 star rating"
Date of travel: December 2019,20,"Stepping back in time, and not in a good way.","I had high hopes for American Airlines, however I have to say I was disappointed right from trying to do the online check in once it opened. The app was awful and when in the airport the staff were not too helpful. The flight was a full flight, which meant not much room. The hostess was informed within the first hour that my TV was not working as it kept playing the same commercial add over and over, and we were informed by intercom that there was a bug with the system. The TV did not work for the entire duration. The food selection was limited as well as the drink selection. I could tell that it had really been stripped back, and this is simply something that has put me off with flying with American Airlines in the future. Compared to eastern airlines - the service was honestly terrible."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Get planes that actually work,I have now sat on the run way for 2hrs just to find out the plane don’t work we could already be in LA during this time sitting your company could of already got us on a new plane this is unacceptable and will be leaving 1000s or reviews to drive down your TripAdvisor
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Customer Service,"American Airlines has stated that they would no longer charge change fees...Well hallelujah. So now when I have to change my flight I only have to pay $300 for the new fair. How is it if I already purchased a ticket that they bill $300 more for the new one. Also, every seat on the plane seems to have an extra fair attached to it along with baggage fees you as the customer is being robbed. Then I paid the upgraded fair for my seats only to have the money taken away as there are no refunds to seat upgrades should you be required to change you flight. Overall, this airline is not here for anyone but themself."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Distrusting!!!,This was my first time flying American Airlines because I usually fly southwest but I decided to try American Airlines cause I found a good price on a ticket but I will never fly American Airlines again it was so dirty and especially in the middle of a pandemic I would think they would be clean! But they weren’t and everyone was so rude when you would ask a simple question! It was all very frustrating and I will never fly American again!
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Denied Boarding,"I was amazed and was refused check-in by the rude AA/BA staff, giving reasons that no British citizen are allowed to transit in the US.I have work for the industry for 36years and will never again travel on BA or AA ever again.I am ashamed of working for BA one time."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"I have now accumulated 475,000 miles.",Mostly just by their branded credit cards.  If we ever get to traveling again.  I can go many places in Business Class.  I am hoping for travel to resume safely ASAP.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,They took our US$1300++. STAY AWAY!!,"We bought a ECONOMY flight since June 2019, to go to Prague on Mar 2020, we also bought trip protection from Allianz. Because of Covid 19, we couldn't return home on the scheduled flight which was on Mar 23, because Prague was lock down, so we called AA and they changed our departure to London Heathrow on Mar 24. On Mar 15, we got news that all Europe will be shutdown in the next morning, that means we had to go home right now. We called AA about the situation, while being on hold for hours in a foreign country, we were told that we had to buy a new flight for Mar 17(the last flight available to go to US), instead of rescheduling it for free. We had no choice but to pay more than double price for that emergency BASIC ECONOMY ticket on Mar 17 to go home. In that such critical situation, they forced us to spend extra $$$$, otherwise we would be stuck in Europe and they didn't care! When we got home, we tried to call them. They said because when we bought that new flight, the original flight wasn't cancelled yet so they would only refund part of the original/cheaper flight (only $$$). On the 21 of March, the original flight was finally canceled, so they said they would refund our original flight instead of our emergency flight ($$$$). Ethically, if the flight was cancelled, they should reschedule it for free, but they didn't cancel it yet even though at that time, they knew it would be canceled so that they could charge us double price. This company is definitely not humane. We flew with AA a couple times and in this hard situation, how can they take advantage on us, while leaving us with no choice but to pay extra $$$$ to go home?? Plus, their affiliated insurance company Allianz is a complete scam, they refused to follow their policy and ran away with our money without giving us a single penny. Stay away from this scammer! Delta or ANA is wayyy much better!! I will pay extra money to avoid this thief that took our money $$$$ (yes, over US$1300++ plus luggage)."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,COVID-19,"I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with American Airlines! In the Midst of a Pandemic American Airlines had Us PACKED on the plane like Sardines. I’m Very Disappointed to see that American Airlines would focus MORE on Making a Buck, than the Personal Safety of its Passangers! The ONLY REASON I flew American Airlines was because I was told that they were leaving the Middle seat vacant in order to help Practice Social Distancing...Well Guess What?!? THEY•ARE•NOT!!😡😡 I Actually Upgraded my seat to further distance myself! It was a TOTAL WASTE Of My Money!! I Left SPIRIT AIRLINES for this Same Reason...I Guess I’ll Add American Airlines to my List of “NEVER FLY AGAIN, Flights”!!😡😡😡"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,The worst airline ever,"When I arrived at my destination, I found that my luggage is totally crushed by someone. The surface was beaten, one of the wheels disappeared, and zippers got broken.  I sent the photos of the luggage to AA, and they totally acknowledged what happened to my bag, but they declined to do reimbursement. They said I should show them a receipt of the purchase of my luggage. What??? Almost nobody stores every single receipt of their purchase. Though they knew my luggage was broken by their fault, they declined to reimburse it, which makes me very disappointed."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,No concern for Covid,"Honestly, it’s frustrating that there’s literally a lack of or no care for Safety with COVID-19. The flight from SFO to PHX is barely filled and was the first flight in the morning at 6am. There must have been around 30 people on this flight. The majority of people seating in the last 10 rows. There’s a ridiculous amount of empty rows and seats but they only let us move seats if it’s within the last 15ish rows. There was ample room for guests to feel safe and allow for adequate social distancing but because we didn’t pay the extra $40 for main cabin they put basic economy people at risk. I’m extremely disappointed with American and their lack of care."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Much better!,"FLL -> PHL leaving 8/27 and returning 8/28, I brought only problems and received only kindness and professionalism. Expedia put my maiden name on my booking by Mistake, then I missed checking as I was late, and my online upgrade had failed. Agents fixed all of it with patience and kindness. I wish I had written their names down. I was impressed. There seems to be a big improvement with the personnel. Thank you for all the help."
n/a,10,Still waiting on flight refund from MAY!!!,I am very disappointed.  I have been waiting on about $1200.00 in flight refunds. We cancelled in May .  American Airlines said they refunded BD Travel... i have not received my refund.  When i call the reps said that American Airline has not deposited the money in their account.  HR/BD Travel are blaming American Airlines and American Airlines said they gave them the $$.. i am left with no refund...
Date of travel: August 2020,20,flight cancellation fee,"We had booked a flight to Jakarta for a vacation in Indonesia in October 2020. It was advertised with the assurance to be fully refundable. However, when Indonesia closed its borders to tourism until the end of 2020, we had to cancel out plans. It then came as a surprise when AA wanted to charge us $250 in fees for each ticket. I do not consider this ""fully refundable""! This is an act of deception! I warn everybody to get informed what ""fully refundable"" means when dealing with American Airlines."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Horrible,Pilot informed us that something needed to be cleaned at 6am and that the crew was very close and it wouldn’t take long. Flight was supposed to fly out 6:15am and it changed to 7:15am. Not the first time this has happened. We had all been on the plane for waiting for an hour and a half without power/air. Horrible experience
Date of travel: August 2020,10,horrible check in service,"I will never fly American airlines again.  The check in counter attendant in Denver was horrible. Rude, not helpful and acted like I was an inconvenience to her job. Not only was the check in service awful, their online check in process/app was not only horrible but also pointless you still have to go through the kiosk process so online was a waste of time.  Just a poor airplane all around."
Date of travel: August 2020,30,"Great Flight, mostly a rude staff","the flight we took to Miami from New Orleans, round trip, was on time and was comfortable. The mandatory mask requirement is absolutely ridiculous. It's very hard to breathe and communicate, but we of course complied. The flight attendants only job was to insure safety of the passengers before, during and after flight. However, and I don't use this term loosely,  they were like flight Natzis patrolling the aisles only to insure that passengers were wearing face covering all the way over their mouth and nose.  When they weren't they were rude to tell the passengers. Thank goodness the air was cool and moving on the aircraft. There are no snacks and no beverage service. You have to special request and with those attitudes my wife and I didn't want to say anything to the flight attendants."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Canceled Flight,"Flight was canceled without notice. New flight was 12 hours later, this required sitting at the airport for 14 hours. Was not allowed to check bags and could not go through security. Could not get something to eat or drink because of this. Asked if it would be possible to change to an alternate airport. Told would have to buy new ticket, without refund on first ticket. You would think with travelers down AA would do better. Never again will AA get my business."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,American Airlines is working hard on creating loyal customers,"I decided to write a review on the airline because I have seen a great level of service and attention to the customers. I started traveling again for work about three months ago when planes were almost empty and some flights were not even available.I have had some great experiences since then, The first one was a manager coming into the plane to personally thank me for my business.The second one was when I traveled on first class and one of the flight attendants named Oak greeted the first class passengers by nameThe third one was last week when I had to make some changes to a reservation and I called asking for help, The service provided by the lady on the phone was impressive and I could tell she was really eager to help me and make sure that I was happy at the end of the call.I must say that experiences like these are the ones that create loyal customers and this is the time when companies should be working on it. Good job American Airlines."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,American airline is by far the worst service here in Chicago!,"I have asthma and I can not breath in hot air for long! My lungs start to tighten and I get short of breath! They said that no one is allowed on the flight if they do not cover their nose and mouth during the whole flight! Out of respect I cover my mouth, but I leave my nose out to get fresh air! I went up to let them know that I have a medical reason why I can’t wear the full face covering, so they didn’t call me out in front of everyone. They had to call their supervisor down to talk to me. While I was waiting for her I called my doctor and asked if they could email me proof because they said that’s what they needed. Finally the supervisor arrives and I ask, “ I believe asking for my medical records is a HIPPA violation,” and she agreed. I said I can walk into the plane face covered but when I’m seated if it’s ok if I just stick my nose out. She said no, and if I don’t do what they say they can kick me off the flight, leaving me stuck in Chicago. She also said that the new protocol also states if you have any breathing issue, they recommend you don’t fly! WHAT! I have family all over and now I’m not aloud to fly and see them because I have asthma and I should just “stay home!”"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Will never fly with them again,"Taxi made us miss our flight, sprinted to gate made it 5 minutes early and they did not allow us on the flight."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Best airline company,Thank you for your service and good customer service very profesional and clean I highly recommend American airline is been my favorite company so far .
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Ira in NC reservations office--Horrible customer service,"At about 7:09est on 8-27-2020 I initiated a call to a representative named Ira in the North Carolina reservation office. Ira answered the phone sounding as if she was still in bed and I had to make the representative aware that I could barely hear her. The representative would not allow me to speak without interrupting me. She as extremely rude and VERY condescending. I literally had to let her know that she had horrible customer service skills, that she kept over-talking me and that this is not how you address a customer. I asked for a supervisor and she became even more condescending. I would like for you know that I DO NOT write reviews, I am also not one to complain. If I have a bad experience somewhere, I just don't patronize that business again and go about my life. But in this case, I was compelled to let you know how HORRIBLE Ira was. My reason for calling: I was having a booking issue because I booked at ticket for myself and my daughter somewhere around 8-13-2020 and 8-14-2020. I woke up to check into our flight and saw that after providing my credit card and receiving a confirmation for my daughters flight that it had not been booked. This was extremely concerning because we would have made it to the airport and would have been completely blindsighted. This has not been a good experience at all. From the horrible customer service down to booking a flight over the phone only to be told that there was a glitch in your system that caused the ticket to fail, but no one called me to correct the issue and my flight leaves today."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Terrible Company,never even made my flight due to having to cancel over family friend catching pneumonia. cancelled my flight which i made sure i paid for a refundable ticket and was told it would take 7 business days for my refund request. refund request took a month and still no one had viewed it. called a customer service rep and while on hold they reviewed it and denied it even tho my tickets were refundable. i am right now in a dispute with my credit card company to not give these crooks a dime. even if i costs more i would recommend never flying american airlines. i would rather drive to any destination than have to deal with these crooks again.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Worst customer service experience of my life,"Worst flight I have ever taken in my life! I spent $500 dollars on my flight & it had 3 layovers ranging from 9 hours to 4 hours!!! I can deal with that but the customer service OMG HORRIBLE. Fist off I was flying home 7 days after having surgery out of state & arrived at the airport to find no one there with a wheelchair which I arranged during online booking I called the airline who said I had to make it all the way to the check in counter in MIA from the car rental area (after being on hold for 30 mins) thank goodness a security guard was there & borrowed a wheelchair from a rental car place & walked me all the way up to check in the walked the chair all the way back... bless her heart! Once arriving at check in I was literally relieved to had made it & thought I would finally get customer service... I WAS SOOO WRONG! Once arriving at the check out counter I was greater my glares & whispers, the ticket lady was HORRIBLE. I walked up with a note from my Doctor & said I had surgery & have a doctors note. She replied “SO WHAT... a ton of people like YOU come here for surgery, your not special... what do you want from me” I’m NOT KIDDING, SHE SAID THIS TO ME all while looking at me like I was garbage & talking about me to a nearby coworker as if I wasn’t standing there. I handed her the Dr note that only stated that I needed to be able to stand up & walk the isle WHEN IT IS SAFE to avoid deep vein thrombosis (blood clots that can KILL YOU) she read the note then said “I can’t check you in if you plan on standing.” NO ONE PLANNED ON STANDING! I never once said I wanted to stand nor did the note say I had to! I told her that I never planned on standing, that I only informed her because I needed a wheelchair threw TSA to the gate & that WHEN IT WAS SAFE & the seatbelt light was off that I needed to stand up every now & then & walk the isle. SHE THEN LITERALLY SAID that she is making a note in my reservation NOT to accommodate me because I had surgery BUT to watch for me because I could be a “PROBLEM PASSAGE & to watch me closely for standing because I planed on standing during flights” WHICH I NEVER EVER SAID OR PLANNED TO DO! I couldn’t believe it! So because of that note EVERYONE at the gate & all the flight attendants & pilot all thought I was a “Problem passenger” that planned on standing before I ever even got to the gates or meet them so they already had a bad view of me before I got to the gates. When I did get to the gates before EVERY flight all the flight attendants & pilots came up to me SINGLED ME OUT & has to talk with me about not standing & told me I would not be allowed to board if I planned on standing WHICH AGAIN... I NEVER EVERRR intended to stand. I explained to the pilot & attendants that I only needed to stand up & walk the isle a few times when the seatbelt light was off. They agreed then let me boards but they all treated me horribly watching me like a hawk like I was a toddler then was clearly talking bad about me & every laughing at me to each other like we were all in high school. They watched me during me whole flight even sitting in seats where they could keep an eye on me & most of the pilots hardly ever turned the seatbelt light off to spit me. One pilot only turned it off for 15 mins once during a 3 1/2 hour flight & the weather was clear so he only did it to force me to sit as long as possible as if my LIFE didn’t depending on it. It was the worst treated I have ever received ANYWHERE 7 days following a painful life threatening Massive surgery & all because I have them a Drs note so they would accommodate me & let me walk around when it was safe like everyone else gets to do. I feel like I shouldn’t have told them anything & world have received better service. My husband was disgusting by the service & he hardly ever gets that way. Don’t every fly American Airlines especially if you had surgery or need any accommodations at all."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,The absolute worst,"I will never fly AA again. The flight was completely full. We were suppose to receive an email saying when the flight was getting packed in case we wanted to change flights. We purposely bought the insurance for this reason and we never received an email. There is no sanitizing stations, no temp checks and absolutely no social distancing guidelines. It’s very clear this airline cares more about profit than safety."
Date of travel: August 2020,30,Rough trip home,"Flying in the era of COVID these days is challenging no matter what.  Biggest downside of AA for us is the inevitable connection in DFW - IMO the world's worst major airport.  Absolutely nothing good to say about DFW.  I'll spare the blow by blow on my last trip.  Other than that the return trip was the usual - spartan business class amenities hardly worth the upgrade, surly desk agents, 1 1/2 hour delay leading to a missed connection, more surly desk agents and finally arrival home."
Date of travel: August 2020,40,Easy check in!,"We flew from Fort Myers to Philadelphia round trip. The airline staff at the airport in Fort Myers were very nice. I didn’t screenshot my boarding pass and something wasn’t working. The lady where you board was super helpful when I went up and told her. The flight attendants were very friendly as well. Due to Covid 19 they weren’t selling or serving drinks or snacks on the flight. They did give each person their own individual bag with snacks and water when you were boarding the plane. The Captain on our return flight was very informative about the weather, turbulence and arrival time. They way the Captain spoke was awesome. He didn’t sound like a broken record or like it was an inconvenience. The flight prices were fair. My only complaint is that in Philadelphia....not one person cleaned anything between flights. We were very early for our return flight. So we were there while another flight was leaving before ours. Other than that..I was totally satisfied. Plenty of legroom on the plane and seats recline a bit."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Worst flight,"I boarded an American Airlines flight on Saturday August 22, 2020 (Flight 2341). The plane was full but that was not the problem. The problem is that many individuals were not wearing their masks and the American Airlines  employees did not force people to put on masks. I asked an employee why the people were not wearing their masks and her response was ""I don't know"" and she proceeded. Thier was no intention from the employee to de anything about the situation.  Most of the people took off their masks and that made me and my family very uncomfortable. It is enough that the plane was completely full but it's just ridiculous that a majority of people did not have thier masks on. I felt confident in flying American Airlines because I felt safe to travel with the strict guidelines being advertised. Now after this flight, I feel very uncomfortable traveling again anytime soon. My husband and I are at a higher risk age group and I felt like no one on that flight cared about the overall wellbeing of thier communities. I am very disappointed that an airline that I have always trusted has let me and others down."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Poor customer service,"Rude agents, horrible customer service, entitled employees! Horrible overall experience with this airline!!!"
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Don’t Choose this airline,"We missed our outbound flight & were re-routed for a fee. We were not told by AA Service Reps that this would utilize our return flight home. On the day of return home, we found out our flight no longer existed. We had to purchase one way tickets home for almost $350 more. I contacted customer relations with NO resolution or offer to refund. We will not fly AA again. Additionally, there were little to no safeguards for Covid. Don’t waste your time with this airline."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Kevin L,Horrible customer service. Trump was on the airport so our flight would not let us unload. Ran a mile across the airport just to be told we had to wait until 8 pm to fly home. More then half of the plane missed this flight. Flight # 1750. I will never fly American again. Careless employees. Delta all the way!
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Complete COVIDiots,"Complete failure to enact any kind of meaningful social distancing protocol:---No attempts to space out passengers on the plane (even though there were plenty of empty seats)---No attempts to enforce mask wearing by passengers, let alone correct mask wearing.---No hand sanitizer (good thing I brought my own).---No temperature checks.Do not fly this airline if you want to stay safe."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Not likely to recommend .,"We were flying from Cabo to Baltimore connecting via Dallas and the lady at the gate Brittany had to make sure we didn’t make home after a 7day vacation in Cabo .She was rude unprofessional she rudely said you are not going anywhere anyway which she made sure she did ,inconveniencing other passengers for 15minutes !Choosing American Airlines over other even better Airlines and spending your hard earned money only to be treated like trash with no respect by one unprofessional Brittany at Dallas airport is unacceptable.Not forgetting we had to spend more money to book a hotel for the night and not even allowed to leave the airplane with my bags even after clearly stating I need my medication ."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,No social distancing,This airplane is packed. No social distancing whatsoever. Yet there are about 5 rows that are completely vacant upfront. Unacceptable
Date of travel: August 2020,20,be very careful with connecting flights!!!!!!!,"Now I understand that this is not all on American Airlines BUT there is so much that they could have helped.We left Los Cabo to arrive in Dallas where we had a connecting flight to Atlanta. When we got to Dallas they off boarded everyone (instead of having those with connecting flights off first) so we had to wait in a huge line to get through immigrations, then to get our bags, then to go through security again to board the flight to Atlanta, all within an hour.  I am getting too old to do an OJ run through the airport, jumping over obstacles to catch a flight but I had to that time.  Lucky we were the first two seats, so we got on, sat down and buckled and then they closed the doors preparing for take off.<rant on> Now what makes me so mad that I am giving an unfavorable review? The airline attendant looked at me as i am gasping for breath, to tell me to get my mask over my nose............. I understand the COVID BS has everyone up in arms but REALLY??? I was good to keep it on my face so give me a freaking break!!The rest of the flight was uneventful thankfully but OMG this who COVID has people forgetting any manners. Oh and by they way I have had it already, you cannot get it from me, I just wear it for your peace of mind. <rant off>"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Save yourself and support a better business,One of the worst flight experiences I have ever had! No customer care or a word of customer service. For the price I would most definitely choose any other airline I would and will from now on choose to even pay more for simply a good experience. American Airlines is a joke. Claiming to care about customers health they over price for there OLD non cared for planes. Even though we are in a “pandemic “  they choose to be cheap and tight wads worried about control and there bottom line. In a plane where ever customer is stuffed shoulder to shoulder touching all in the back half of the plane while the front half of the plane only had a few scattered seats being used. If they actually cared about there customers and being a good quality airline ran by quality people they would have obviously have moved customers around the airplane creating some more comfort and doing their part to protect there customers as they claim they are doing. Also as I was getting my rental car the lady there assumed I had been flying with AA because of my poor experience and that she had heard the same exact customer care from other distraught people who felt the same. Shoving everyone in the back of the plane. Not a single thing was OFFERED THE ENTIRE FLIGHT! of over 2.5 hours not a single complementary food or beverage. Claiming for the covid. So all I understand from AA is they care about control and bottom line. Over priced tickets and one of the least updated planes being on 4 of there planes through this trip not a single plane was updated like Delta flights. I took a flight from Delta not long before this flight and updated kind very nice customer service was awesome and they offered in flight food and drink. If you care about your sanity and or just simply do not want to support bad business then please do yourself a solid and fly with a better company. Hope this review helps.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Beware of AA,"All road warriors eager to get back on the road, please be leery of flying #americanairlines.  The fares are low right now, but they are packing the planes and god forbid if your flight gets delayed or canceled.  They could careless about you, the amount paid, whether you get to your destination on time or even at all. Since COVID, most non-stops flights to non-hub cities have been cancelled. As such, they are now packing you on to multi-stop flights to get across the county.  Hoping to social distance, we bought full fare first class seats for our trip CMH to LAX connecting in DFW. The outbound flight was delayed making the connection impossible.  When we called to inquire, customer service informed us that they didn’t have seats on any other flights, let alone first class.  The rep attempted to route use through CLT, sitting in center economy seats on a fully sold out airplane.  When I asked about a refund for my full fare first class seats, I was told that was handled by another department and she had no idea what or if I would be entitled to a refund. I asked for a supervisor who came on the line and was equally unhelpful.  In short, AA is not doing its part to ease traveler concerns.  We ended up on #unitedairlines and found them to be great."
n/a,10,COV19 Incubator,"I always flight with DELTA,but I decided to get AA this time and now I am worried about my safety.The flight from Austin was an amazing experience. The crew was accommodating, proactive and caring. Every seat with the middle seat empty and plenty of space (new aircraft). But of course, you get to Florida and the crew give a f*ck about you, the aircraft is supper old and smells like pee. I am inthe middle seat since I am traveling with my emotional support animal and they sat an obese lady next to me. How am I suppose to keep safe if we are pack like sardines in a low budget aircraft? Just flight DELTA, don't put your health in a company where clearly have different standards per region."
Date of travel: August 2020,20,No precautions for COVID,Absolutely no one on the plane had masks on! Seats extremely uncomfortable and no middle seat distancing. The plane was jam packed.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Covid19 promotion!,"Today I took flight from Dallas to Sarasota Fl, and all passengers had a masks accept ONE lady with a dog sitting behind me, when I asked serving lady why that passenger didn't  carry a musk on her, she told me because she has problems with breeding, so it's o.k for her to be like that, isn't that called double  standards,  what if that sickness she has related to Corona, and every one of us on that plane was breading that reused air.  That called negligence on a part of American Airline. And I treat this as a promotion of Covid19 by the stuff of this airline. Be careful  folks."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Service August 22nd,We had truly amazing trip in Jackson Hole until we got to the airport and had contact with very rude person . She gave us very hard time with 2lb overweight. We didn’t have problems to repack but the rudeness shouldn’t happen. On top I opened credit card with AA that I already regret.
Date of travel: August 2020,20,anxiety,rude staff on return flight wow. Boarding went well. Flying gave me major anxiety with our pilot jesus it must of been a student flyer. N9 attempt to avoid turbulence.. and landing was even worse.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,American Airlines Continues their Loser Streak.,"Delayed flights, gate changes, clueless gate attendants and missing planes. AA stunk prior to the pandemic. First chance I give them five months later, same incompetent airline. They should ground what few planes they have that are operational or maybe switch to poultry and livestock transportation."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,"Flight to St. Thomas, USVI","Wow, I knew some airlines were not blocking seats for preventative Covid spread, but AA packed us in and didn't use any social distancing!  We even paid extra to move our seats up further with an open seat.  But by the time we came home, the airport gate and flight were full.  If we don't catch Covid on this flight, it will be a miracle.  And it was obvious nothing had been cleaned or sprayed.  It's so sad when an airline cares more about money than passengers' safety and health."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,Delay After Delay,This trip was back in July of 2019. There was a bad storm in Philadelphia which was where I was flying too. My flight was scheduled in the afternoon at some time. When we were driving to the airport we got a notification on our phones that our plane was delayed for three hours. Okay no problem we can kill time. After three hours it gets pushed another hour. Next it gets pushed 2 hours early. We now rush to the airport once again and it turns out it was a false notification. When my plane finally is about to leave (it is probably around 6:00) it gets pushed to 8:00 because they didn’t have any pilots to fly. I understand that the weather was bad but they don’t tell you anything until it’s too late. We sit there for another two hours and finally it gets cancelled. Now we book a hotel room at the airport and find out that all flights are fully booked until 3 more days. The whole experience was a disaster. The only reason I gave this airlines two stars is because some of the time I actually arrived on time. If they would tell you what is going on earlier maybe it wouldn’t be so chaotic. When flying be prepared for many delays.
Date of travel: August 2020,40,Seating,"I received an e-mail prior to our flight saying the seats have changed, I had 1A and 1B, my wife likes the window seat and I prefer the aisle seat. Arrived at the airport in Cancun and they switched my seating, putting my wife in the 2nd row window and myself in the 4th aisle, so we had to ask someone to switch seats and it took a while for the aisles to clear so I guess there was a big mix up on seating not just mine, it took a while for the aisles to clear. Overall American Airlines does a real good job, I haven't had any other problems."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Late,This airline sucks!!!! Always late always an excuse Will not fly anymore never again don’t fly go to another the charging port or tv on the chair isn’t worth the flight
Date of travel: August 2020,10,ripped off,"My flight was delayed to fill it up. So it was changed to go to Dallas instead of Phoenix. 2 hours plus added fly time with mask. Was bumped to economy in Dallas because of flight changes. Very rude and mean in Dallas. 2 hours extra to Cabo from Dallas. 4 hours and more extra flight time with mask and half in economy. I would not have ever booked a trip in economy. I would never had booked a trip that took 8 hours to get to Cabo. No apologies only rudeness. Now all they offer for refund for bump to economy is $43.00. How often can one get upgrade for $43.00. AA is horrible, the worst never fly them again. They stuck us in a bus packed like sardines shoulder to shoulder nose to nose from gate to plane in Cabo."
n/a,50,Rude gate .EMPLOYEES ,Me and my wife and 3 others missed our flight...not a big deal Untill the man and woman working the gate came out the whole atlanta do not give rats A.s ...showed there numb did not care what the crap do you want us to do..so what it was our fault .rolled eyes and the guy wanted us to pretty much the f up..even though we paid for our tickets to fly with American..we flew 3 other times in 4 days on American. Every one was great .but not tha atl..did not expect anything better.its Atlanta.
Date of travel: August 2020,20,No social distancing!,"I hopped onto a commenter flight to take a quick detour after my primary trip. I was appalled to discover this small plane was absolutely packed! There was a change ofPlanes in Charlotte and still both planes uncomfortably full! After having taken a Southwest flight to my original destination with empty seats in the middle to spread people out, I will definitely only fly Southwest next time!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Gave Me Wrong Boarding Pass,"....missed my flight. My D Partner got on the flight, but I had to go on the next one. The counter rep was a brash, loud, caustic shrew who, while quoting FAA, AA, and TSA rules, printed out and handed me a boarding pass for another person.Wrote letter, guy called.... apologized. Wow. If I had $1 for every apology in modern American (at large) customer Service, I could retire."
Date of travel: May 2020,20,ASAP Tickets scam,"We purchased tickets and travel insurance in November 2019 for travel in May. Since we are in our 80's, with the Corona virus, our physicians advised us to cancel. We provided letters from them and submitted a claim in February to the insurance company (owned by ASAP we found out). We made many attempts to find out the status of our claim and each time the agent said they would submit the claim. Today I received an email that said the claim would be denied! We're out almost $2,000, including the bogus insurance. Be very careful about purchasing airline tickets through ASAP Tickets!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Inconvenienced & Embarrassed,"American Airlines On 8/16 (my birthday) I had a flight from Phoenix, AZ to Cabo San Lucas, MX. Per usual I left about 2 hours early for my out of the country flight excited to catch a flight with my favorite airline. I even had a “it’s my birthday” shirt on. I have global entry which includes pre TSA (it was on my virtual boarding pass as well). I arrived to the airport (PHX sky harbor) and went directly to the Pre TSA line skipping the long line. Unfortunately, It was there I was told by TSA I would have to get into the regular line as I did not have pre TSA. I was so confused! It also was no longer on my virtual boarding pass either. Something literally changed from the time I got in the line, to the time I got to the agent. I was completely embarrassed. I had to leave the pre TSA line and go to the back of the regular line. A few moments later, my father (Jerry Coker) who was out of breath joined me in the line. Yes our names are very similar. He explained to me he had just been inconvenienced as well. When he & his wife arrived to the airport earlier he was told by TSA his ID and boarding pass didn’t match and he would need to go back downstairs. Please note my father has had 2 knee replacements so this was a major inconvenience and discomfort for him as the check in desk is downstairs at the PHX airport. He literally had to leave the line and go back downstairs to retrieve his correct boarding pass. He found out the agent had checked me in again (I had already checked in on the app) & given him my paper boarding pass when checking in, (this is when I realized how my pre TSA was removed). This was a huge embarrassment and inconvenience to the both us. While I do understand our names are noticeably similar I expect better attention to detail by an American airline employee. This is also a huge security concern. In addition, we could have missed our flight due to an error on American Airlines part. This caused major delay as we were unable to grab coffee and use the restroom prior to our flight due to this huge mistake, we were literally rushing to our gate to catch our flight. The story gets worse!!  while in Cabo attempting to check in online on 8/17 (24 hrs before our flight home). I received an error stating I had to see an agent at the airport to check in as my name did not match what was in the system. I quickly realized once again American Airlines could not decipher between my father and I. This really inconvenienced us. Due to not being able to check in online myself and my father were given separate seats from our spouses, and I was unable to get my window seat that I highly prefer. In traveling to over 22 countries (majority with American Airlines), I have never not had a window seat. My flight to LA was so uncomfortable. I would like this incident looked into and I would love to be contacted about what is being done about this huge inconvenience to my family and I. As you could imagine this was in no way the customer service we expected to receive when flying with American Airlines for our first joint trip out of the country for our birthdays. What was suppose to be a lovely birthday trip turned into an airport fiasco. We were embarrassed, inconvenienced & most importantly uncomfortable! Wait there’s more!! My connecting boarding pass from LA to PHX said Alaska Airlines. I was utterly confused. However, when we got the LAX we proceeded to Alaska Airlines believing something was changed. We walked from the Tom Bradley terminal to terminal 6 (please look up how far apart those terminals are). We walked OUTSIDE for this duration only to find out once there we were indeed with American Airlines and had been given the incorrect boarding passes. We literally almost missed our flight. No exaggeration, we were walking around LAX for 40 minutes LOST and had to go through TSA once again although we had connecting flights. This has got to be thee worst flight experience I’ve ever had. I am very displeased and would like to contacted immediately as to find out how this happened. I am interested in going to the media as this messed up my trip. How could this happen? I have my global entry number as well as my booking history to show I should’ve been pre TSA. I also have a paper boarding pass provided to me by AA that says Alaska. To top this horrific experience off, when I got on the plane they asked to check my bag as the plane was small, when I got off no one could find my bag. 10 minutes later we found out someone checked it and it was at baggage claim. I was told it would be waiting when we landed. It wasn’t!"
Date of travel: August 2020,20,No Social Distancing,"The flight was totally packed, no distancing during boarding and none on the flight. I was not comfortable during this flight."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,American Airlines flight attended harrased my family the whole time of the flight,"We are military family and my husband is currently deployed. I'm 5 months pregnant was flying with 2 small children- 9yo and 2yo. When we got on our plane it was max 20% full and when I asked if we need to be seated at our seats female flight attened advised us to take any seats since plane was pretty empty.We moved closer upfront in th economy and picked seats. In a minute male flight attended came and screamed to go back to our original seats. When I tried to explained that we were directed by another flight attended to pick any seats since flight was pretty empty he said that He will ask us to leave aircraft if we won't do what he wants. We got our luggage and went back to our original seats, he kept following us asking if we want to leave aircraft. After we got to our original seats and got everything in place I was seating in my assigned seat in shock holding passports and tickets in my hand. He flew to me, grabbed ticket out of my hand and screamed that he needs my tickets to report me for not following his directions. Passengers in front were in shock and advised later to talk to the captain. From all the stress I started feeling sharp pain and called flight attended for help. I had sharp lower abdominal pain and flight attended had to get a nurse to check on me. Worse experience of my life. This older man who operates on flights USA/ Germany, speaks German,blue eyes should not be working there, extremely rude and unprofessional. He made the whole flight miserable, and he knew we are military family."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"AN Airline that is rude, direspectful and racist","The CSR at the airprt informed us that by booking economy what did we expect other than poor service, she stated you get what you pay for. Our flight got changed and it caused us to miss our connecting flight so we were told we could change flights for no charge so we wouldn't miss our flight, at the airport they wanted us to pay 1800.00 because when we called the nght before the CSR didn't complete the change and somehow that was our fault. We were told that we needed to learn a lesson, arrive earlier than 2 hours before your flight, do not buy basic economy, don't be cheap, etc. We were on our way to see our first grandchld and the amount of disrespect that we were treated with with was uncalled for. In this time where there is a pandemic and people are losing their jobs and some do not have food, an airline decides to call you cheap since basic economy is what you can afford. The flght home the stewardess complained loudly of the ""black male"" requests of water with ice and that she was not their slave. She felt that she was a babysitter often on the flights and that they should have common sense. She focused on getting the phone number of the male passenger in first class and ignored requests from any females. We were told we could use a voucher to pay for our luggage and hen told that the 3 American Airlines reps that said that were wrong, we had to pay out of pocket for the luggage. We contacted american airlines numerous times to have these issues addressed and their anser each time was that they would forward the behavior and comments to the proper people as a tool to help in training. American AIrlines has proved that they condone rudeness  disrespect and racial remarks."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Zero Service,"I am AA's highest elite level, so I fly a lot on them.  I am extremely frustrated by the lack of service on my recent flights.I had been offered beverage service in First Class on recent flights.  This flight was over 2 hours and they did not provide any water or snack to anyone on the plane.I have had the bag with a tiny water bottle and pretzels offered on previous shorter flights.The flight attendants litterally stay seated for the flight and do one trash run before you land."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,customer service,Customer service was VERY rude. I explained I had never flown with am infant before and she made me feel quite stupid honestly. I am very appalled and will probably not use American airlines again.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Never flying with American again,"For starters, instead of checking the weather and covering the luggage,  they allowed an entire cart of luggage to sit out in the pouring rain, uncovered, while on our layover. We got to our destination with all of our clothes soaking wet. The flight attendants were the only polite employees we encountered but that is only because we rarely saw them. The pilot was silent most of the flight, gave very few updates on our location or turbulance we were about to encounter, which I suppose is more of a luxury than standard operating procedure. BUT the icing on the cake was flying out. Trying to get our bags checked. We could not check our bags without all of our party there, one of our party was turning in our rental car. The kiosk was not working and when we did get everyone together, even though we were still an hour early for our flight, we were told we missed the cut off to check our bags and the check bag attendant said ""i don't know why yall were just sitting over there not checking your bags in"". Almost everyone we encountered on our travels with American Airlines were the rudest and most careless people. We will hopefully be changing to a different airline on one of our two layovers."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Left by AA in Dallas,"Insult to injury is the best way to describe the experience.  AA was delayed departing ELP.  So anticipating issues with my connection in Dallas, I asked attendant for assistance.  She replied she couldn't help me, she did not have the ""app on her phone."" So customers were left to help each other.  Our flight arrived on time but were made to wait for a gate, and we missed our connection.There was no attendants at the gate to help reschedule passengers.  The attendants at the next gate were as helpful as the absent attendants.  The male offer to book us on another flight to DSM in 2 days or would fly me to another city. When I explained that was not helpful, he threw us arms up in the air.  He told me to call Customer Service if I was not satisfied.  I went to the ticketing area and was informed that secondary to the pandemic, workforce reductions prevented the airline from assisting passengers in a meaningful way.  No one was able to re-book us on another airline.  No one held our flight for us. No one really cared. I assumed responsibility for finding another flight to DSM the next day from the other Dallas area airport, arranged an Uber to Lovefield area and booked a hotel room for the overnight stay.I called Customer Service and learned that their had been an airport malfunction and I was entitled to some compensation.  I submitted my complaint on the website as directed and received a generic response.  I was informed that AA is not in the habit of compensating passengers for those fees.  They did not accept responsibility for the delay they created and essentially they wiped their hands clean of the situation that they created for me. I could not in good conscious recommend someone I liked fly AA.  Walking to your destination would be better."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,THE WORST,"I wish I could give 0 stars. The absolute WORST customer service. Had me stranded in OKC TWICE. Cancelled flight two times, resulting in wasted time, wasted money on ubers and hotel rooms, missed work, frustration, cat being left alone for longer than expected and my husband ALMOST missing a surgery. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. NO reimbursement for any additional expenses incurred from their cancellations and incompetence."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,"If I get COVID, it’s because of AA flight","Not sure how they use the word “American” in their name. They claim to follow CDC guidelines, but allow masks proven to be to increase spread of virus (those with valves, neck gators), fill every single seat, don’t seat households together unless pay extra, allow people to keep masks off with water bottle they hand out sitting in front of them (the whole flight). Then the intercom recommends 6’ distance as you leave plane. Profit over people. This organization lacks integrity."
Date of travel: August 2020,30,They are so-so,I flew out of LIT and had to fly all the way to CLT before going back up to DSM so that was kind of annoying. Over all the flight went good. The staff was super nice about everything. There was absolutely no social distancing and the planes was packed as full as they could hold but they enforced the mask rule hard core so hopefully that helped. It was rather uncomfortable planes and no drinks or any form of entertainment (except this cute little blonde that was sitting near by lol) idk I will probably use them again but if possible will use some other airline.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,The flight attendant made it a great flight!,"Our beautiful flight attendant made this a flight to remember.  She was friendly, informative and could not do enough to make our flight enjoyable."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Worst Decisions and Communication to Customers,I am getting ready to board my flight and the gate person says we are ready to take off. I ask the if they are going to just sit us on the runway for a few hours due to weather because I don’t want to do that with Covid 19. They promise they are a go for flight. I say okay. I get on the plane they close the doors and immediately say we are grounded. Thanks for the straight lie and lack of accurate communication American Airlines. The lady sitting next to me has been hacking up a lung for the last hour!!! Maybe I’ll send you our family doctor bill.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,absolutely no social distancing,American Air are filling every single It is ridiculous. Planes are packed to capacity. The service is non existent. No rules are being followed by this airline. Book another airline.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Would not recommend!,"I see all of these reviews complaining about American Airlines not doing enough to make sure everyone social distances, that’s not my issue at all. I know it would be almost impossible to stay 6 feet apart in an airport or on a plane. My problem is that I booked my flights several months ago. They rescheduled my direct flight so that it included a layover. The layover was so short it was very difficult to catch the connection. Especially coming back through customs. My daughter’s flight was cancelled and I had to call 3 times to get that straightened out. We weren’t offered water as they said it wasn’t loaded because of a storm. I’m missing one of my bags! It would be 4 hours of driving for me to return to the airport to get it. Now I guess I wait for them to have it delivered. American Airlines was definitely NOT a very good travel experience!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,No social distance,Just flew round-trip to Chicago to Jacksonville Florida. Plane was packed. No social distancing effort. Extremely disappointed and dismayed.
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Hadn't flown in 20 years,Excellent flight. Took initiative to have wheelchair assistance for me on arrival. Attendants made sure passengers were compliant with masks.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,American Airlines needs to go,"Just so everyone knows... Just 5 minutes ago on Flight 635 it was witnessed that a flight attendant removed a family off of a 40 minute plane ride because their child was eating food and removed his face mask to do so... Right in the middle of taxiing the flight attendant, after confronting the family, mother explaining that her child was eating, returned to the front to call to the pilots to return to the terminal and the family was literally removed from the plane because the flight attendant says ""This is a federal offense."" If anyone goes to the American website you will find that it clearly states ""You can briefly take your face covering off to eat or drink, but you must put it back on when you're done."" People are now going to be missing their connecting flights due to this altercation. I want everyone to know that some of this stuff is getting way out of hand. Yes we need to protect our passengers... Yes please wear a mask. But please also allow us to eat especially if you are going to be giving us snacks on the plane. Is this the kind of world we want to live in?"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Social distancing nightmare,"The airport made it seem as though the airline cared about our safety during COVID, however, the airplane told the true story.  No middle seats empty.  The empty seats were all in the front and required an extra payment. The back of the plane where the seats are closer was packed tight. The airflow was minimal and there was no sense of American trying to prevent the spread.   Waiting to see how many on this trip come back positive.  Shame on you American."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,The official airline to get COVID,"Shame on American Airlines for booking full flights and endangering everyone with no social distancing of seats, and not giving notice of their change in policy to do so or refunds, then preach BS to us on the plane how our safety is their first priority. Disgusting"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Endangerment and Delay,"I’m currently sitting onboard an American Airlines flight that was supposed to leave at 1:25. It’s 4:01. We were delayed 20 minutes at a time, over the course of two hours, due to maintenance, switched to a new airplane, and then forced to sit on the runway for over an hour now because of maintenance issues with our second flight. I secured a seat with a gap between myself and another patron in my row, allowing us to distance somewhat, and our flight attendant just forced another person from the back of the plane to fill that seat, DESPITE there being two empty rows in the back of said plane. We’re being given cookies and water in pre-packed paper bags to stay our discomfort, forcing everyone to breathe the same air at the same time. There are no visible social distancing measures in place. I’ve witnessed seven patrons with masks off or pulled down from their noses and the flight crew is doing nothing about it. In addition, they’re rude and discourteous every time an issue is raised."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,"No hope of social distancing, and no mask enforcement on flights.","Flight was packed like cattle and there was zero enforcement of masks.    Some passengers just ""snacked' the whole time as an excuse to not wear a mask.   Inexcusable.If you want to experience a potential COVID hotspot first hand, definitely fly with American."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Do not get American Airline insurance coverage thru Allianz,DO NOT get American Airline insurance coverage thru Allianz that's there 3rd party insurance that they offer to protect you incase there is an issue with your flight.  But it's a total rip off.  Trust me the can't speak English on the customer service. And they really don't and not going to pay for anything.  Biggest rip off.  American Airline should be Ashame to be affiliated with them.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service,"I called American Airlines to see about changing a ticket. While I was speaking to the agent the “even exchange ticket” supposedly went up $120 (this occurred in a matter of less than 5 mins). While I don’t agree with this I guess it is possible. However I feel you should be granted the price you were originally quoted 5 mins earlier.The problem I have is when I said to the agent “wow, that really stinks”. She said, “sucks for you but it’s great for us. We want your money.”Seriously???? Is this how you train your customer service reps? Terrible! If there were another option from our tiny airport, I would have taken it...no matter what the change in price would have been. Terrible!!!!!! Maybe American should monitor their reps a little closer and teach them better customer service skills"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Worst customer service out there!!,Don’t fly. Saw a guy get banned with no notice or reason. Un-American Airlines is more like it. Worst customer service ever. Even more so than Spirit and that’s saying something.
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Fly with southwest!!!!!,There is no social distancing and they took my money and didn’t give me what I paid for! Then half the workers aren’t very smart.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Do not recommend,"I highly DO NOT recommend AA. They have awful customer service and every employee I have called or came in contact with has been so rude and not helpful. I am a veteran and I fly with an emotional support dog, my flight was very last minute to go see family and they’re doing nothing to help me with the requirements for an emotional support dog. He already has his ID stating he’s an emotional support dog. Just save yourself the stress and DONT fly with American Airlines."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Poor service,"No food or beverage options available, they claim it is for our safety from COVID. However the plane was completely full people sitting shoulder to shoulder. What I found really interesting was the fact that our safety prevented them from providing a food and beverage service but they still tried solicitation of their credit card applications. So you can get the COVID by eating and drinking but not a credit card application. I’m sure they are saving a lot of money using COVID as scape goat excuse."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,AA saved my trip!,"I had a brief 4 day trip planned to Sedona, Arizona - flying into Phoenix from NY.  Unfortunately I was notified the morning of departure that the flight was cancelled due to the tropical storm that was to impact the east coast that day.  I called American Airlines, afraid my trip would be ruined.  Customer service put me on a very early flight for the following day and were able to change my return flight to a day later so that I could extend our trip by 1 day (and not lose any time).  They did this at no extra charge to me.  The flight change ended up working out great!  I actually gained a few hours in Sedona thanks to American Airlines.  I had never had to deal with a cancelled flight before and they made it foolproof for me!  On the day my son and I were to depart back to NY, we missed the return flight due to the car service arriving 2.5 hours late to pick us up.  Traveling with my son (a child) I was very nervous of what might now happen...if we would be stranded in Arizona with no hotel and no flight.  I also had poor cell phone service so every time I went to call AA I ended up getting disconnected.  Once I arrived to the airport, at bag check-in, the attendant was super helpful.  She worked very quickly and gave me the two best options, and my son and I were able to grab a snack and catch a flight within an hour or so.  Again, just as I ever had a cancelled flight, I also never missed a flight either.  AA was understanding and accommodating in BOTH situations!!  These mishaps could have potentially ruined my short vacation, but thankfully AA made sure that didn't happen!!I also hadn't traveled on AA in quite a few years. It seemed the various plane cabins we were on were upgraded (even in the basic economy section!).  Everything was very clean.  We had more leg room and with our return flight we even had touch video screens on both planes, which was a welcomed perk.  AA staff did a great job spacing people out on the plane.  My son and I had a row to ourselves on each flight.  They made sure people felt safe, especially traveling during Covid-19.  I also saw people ask to re-arrange their seating so that families could sit together and they arranged that as well."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,DO NOT RECOMMEND,"Terrible customer service. Tried to change the nameOn an already purchased ticket and change transfers a ticket to a different flight. The rep I spoke to was super rude & refused to help in anyway. Basically told us we should have booked with a different company. Offered NO solutions or alternatives. Extremely disappointed, we booked flights for 8+ people & Will NEVER USED AMERICAN AIRLINE AGAIN!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Do NOT rely on them for a flight,"My wife came down to see me while I was home in NJ. We never get to see each other because I’m in the military. They decided on their own she wouldn’t show up for her flight back to Ohio. They gave her a refund of the price she paid. BUT to get her seat back on that same plane, charged her all of that refund plus an additional $80.00. This will be the last time we fly with them. Making someone pay to get back on a flight they already paid for because the decide to kick them off? Could not be more disgusted in a company.On top of all this, I was unable to walk my wife to her gate. I wanted a few more minutes with her because neither of us know when we will see each other again. The lady at the front desk was rude enough when I asked for a pass to get through the gate, it felt as if she was insulting my wife for ‘misunderstanding’ what was said about others walking through without a boarding pass. The gentlemen checking everyone in was even shocked."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Perfect and early ,We flew to Denver from Phoenix for a week with American and loved the experience with our masks. I used the wheelchair in Denver and every thing was perfect
Date of travel: August 2020,10,worst ever- will not fly AA from now on,Worst Airline ever.. Book a flight 2 months ago- my 6 hour flight turned into a 24 hour flight. a flight was cancelled by the airline so they put me on a new flight arriving in Miami 2 hours after our next  flight was to leave- luckily I checked on this before we flew- but that is what put us on a 24 hour flight with redirecting and layovers- Got to my destination- The day I was leaving they had computer issues and we (about 18 other ppl not related to me) could not get on our flight - mind you they only have ONE flight from St Croix out to Miami per day- so we had to stay an extra day- luck right?? well not so much ( No vouchers of any kind were offered even tho it was there error- super disappointed) it put everyone on standby for the next day around 18 ppl only  2 ppl made it on the next day flight- luckily I was one of the 2.. and again my 6 hour flight home turned into a 48hour flight - no compensation what so ever- I called Delta and book another flight out of  Miami so I could get home- Thank goodness for Delta for saving the day- yes it cost me another ticket but AA had me on a 12 hour layover in Miami so I would have gotten a hotel anyway. Just not a good way to have ppl come back to your airline if you mess up the least you could do is give a food or room voucher. but we will not be flying with AA again they have really lost us with this one..
Date of travel: March 2020,10,American airlines is the worst!,"First off I've traveled with american airlines 4 times in the past but this last trip was the worst. I can honestly say I will never travel with them again! I get there an hour before boarding the lady at the desk takes so long that I hit the 30 mins till take off mark that i have to reschedule my whole flight. So she says shes putting me on stand by i ask her that means i need to rent a hotel room another night or i need to wait at a gate. She says to me ""do you not understand the word standby"". So she tells me to go to the gate. I have two little ones with me and have to wait on standby for two hours. So finally I get on the plane first plane was the best I was attended well and everything. Well second plane is what really made me never want to travel with American I have two kids a newborn and a 2 year old. And I'm carrying my carry on. The lady refuses to help me put the carry on in the compartment. Another guy traveling helped me. She was so rude!! She even told me next time if I travel with children I can't have a carry on. Excuse me I have a newborn which requires bottles milk and diapers. American airlines is the worse!"

But for 1st class was given a very cheap food, if you call it food! A package consisting of two crackers, three chunks of cheese and some grapes! Really for first class I was expecting more then this. American Airlines...never again."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Sorry Airline,This is one sorry  airline . Everything they do is not cordial at all! I would not suggest flying this sorry airline !! AVOID!!

Date of travel: July 2020,50,nice flight,American did nice job making me feel safe during Covid19 crisis. Was not sure about flying at this time but extra safety measures made me feel secure with decision to fly.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Traveler,"I've tried to upgrade to bigger seats now 4 times after long travel days. Not once did they allow me no matter who tried to help. They nickel  and dime me to death for everything. Yet when I'm willing to pay anything for an upgrade they say, sorry, I dont know why, but even when I call my headquarters they say no. So, like usual I board, pass 5 first class empty seats and end up in a miniature seat surrounded by 3 toddlers. Toddlers aren't the problem, the adults in charge at American Airlines are infants!!! Never again!!!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Bring on the covid,Zero social distancing here. Overbooked the flight and then huddled us all in to figure out who was getting booted. Flight is late leaving because of it.  Every seat is packed. Pathetic.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"Horrible Customer Service, Jacked Up Prices","I can't believe how horribly American Airlines treats their customers. They changed my flight to a different day and then jacked up the prices when I tried to change my flight back to the original. They first wanted to charge me $18 to change flights, I said I'd think about it, when I called back 10 minutes later they insisted on charging me $45 instead. Their agent was incredibly rude and short with me. They are inflexible and have no regard for the concerns of their customers. I will not be flying AA again."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Worst Airline,Trip to St.Martain disaster! Paid for direct flight canceled at 4am. New flight delayed.They gave of valchers to fly again because of our experience. Next flight Denver 1st flight canceled another flight delayed sitting in airport. This airline needs to be investigated! I would rather walk!
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Crappy Ticket Agents,"Rude Agent when trying to drop off my Prepaid Checked Bag.  Told me to go to the Kiosk and print out a Luggage tag.  Machine could not locate our record.  Went back in line and after waiting to get to the Front, I am told I need to go to another line to be helped.  The agent had the nerve to say if i let him finish talking he would tell me what to do, oh by the way he interrupted me when I was still expressing my frustrations.  I now finally get an another agent to help while waiting in ANOTHER line.  She asks me what I was doing in the that line, other employee didn’t even let her know.  Great way to help a guest and your coworker.  New agent is going through the process and finally tells me it’s too late to get my bag on this flight.  I can either go on another flight and meet my family back in Kansas City 4 hours later.  Other option would be to go through Airport Security with a Bag that is too large to go on a plane.  Reason we were checking the bag!  I was told you should have gotten to the Airport sooner, I just wanted to drop off a Prepaid bag for a flight that we checked in for the night before.  Guests don’t want to hear excuses but want to see results and not being passed around.Family decides to go on original flight and makes it to the gate when plane is leaving.  Plane left over 10 minutes Before the Departure time.  Gate agent tries to explain to my Wife and kids that we were being paged.  Great reasoning to tell a Family with kids that we could not reach you.  Families traveling with kids are more focused on getting to the gate than listening to the paging system.  More excuses!!! Shame on you American Airlines.  Flight crews and staff at other airports during our trip were great.  I would fly American Airlines again but skip the Agents in Orlando."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,NO NO NO.  Do not fly!!,"I wish there was a 0.  No no no, do NOT fly this airline. I paid 1200 for a first class ticket. Here’s what it was worth. No footrest, no entertainment, no food, & one flight No BEVERAGE!  Not even water.  I was lied to about what the flight was offering and was not told no food on a 6 hour flight until I asked at the gate and was told after paying 1200 for a ticket I could purchase my own food and bring it on the plane;  oops not..since didn’t have advanced notice there wasn’t enough time to purchase food. When I called to complain the representative was rude and not even apologetic. Everything was COVID.  Well hello every airline is dealing with Covid-19. Again I will NEVER, nor any of my family will ever fly AA and I suggest you don’t either!!!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,No covid-19 precautions,This airline has signs all over the planes and the airport stating that their passengers' well-being is a top priority. They make sure you have a mask on when you board but then do not make rounds to ensure they are still on. There was NO social distancing attempt at all even tho the plane was almost half empty. They are still filling in the seats from front to back rather than spacing people out. I was stuck between 2 strangers only to turn around towards the end of the flight (after a nap) and see LOTS of empty rows and that the person next to me was no longer wearing their mask. Don't say my well-being is important and then not do anything proactive to protect it. Don't make false claims. Just be straight forward that it is all about the money and convenience for the business. Not the passengers.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,No tact Ms. Lisa,"American Airlines’ (AA) check-in crew Ms. Lisa in La Guardia Airport has no client orientation.She could have said I’ll see what seats are available in front, if any, and the additional cost, instead of saying “Your tickets are basic economy.  You should have purchased your seats.”Flight 879’s cabin crew on March 12, 2020 distributed only the Turks and Caicos health and customs forms but not the immigration form.An AA flight crew also said one form per family was needed.  That was true for the customs form but the immigration and health forms had to be filled out for each family member.When passengers finally reached an immigration officer in Providenciales, many did not have the immigration form.  We were in line for 1.5 hours as several flights arrived.  A long wait that passengers did not have to experience had the AA crew been knowledgeable."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Fraud,I booked a flight. Paid for seats.   American airlines changed it the stole my money from the purchased seats.  This is a con.  I hope someone investigates this airline.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,worst airline ever,"this was my first time flying and american airlines is by far the worst airline! they cancelled my flight after delaying it 3 times due to weather then i almost got kicked out the airport for wanting to sleep there cause they wouldn't pay or give me a discount for a hotel but keep in mind they had flights going to miami and jax which makes no sense, cause the hurricane was hitting these cities my boyfriend also wrote them a bad review on twitter and they said my needs werent there problem which is completely dumb im flying YOUR airline my needs should be your top priority but anyways safe to say i wont be flying with them again."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Do yourself a favor and fly Southwest,"I usually fly southwest but American had a great deal! I was flying with my 2 year old. Southwest employees are always so nice and make sure my son has snack/ drinks, even during pandemic. Two male American stewardess were so rude! Made a huge deal about people wearing mask “the right way” and said if you don’t they will make sure you don’t fly American again. Well don’t worry I won’t! This poor lady was readying a book and her mask was over her nose but not up far enough according to the stewardess, so they gave her a citation! Also, they came on intercom several times saying “We don’t want to see your nostrils” and “make sure when you wash your hands, you wash your thumbs too”. I don’t need someone to tell me how to properly hygiene! What really sent me over the edge was a mom had two kids that were crying. They didn’t speak good English and the stewardess told the mother “this all needs to end now before we take off” they didn’t offer to help or empathize at all! A nice man a few rows up gave the kids a snack and helped calm them down. Flying with kids is not easy and for American Add more stress on that poor mother! Never flying American again! I hope they go bankrupt! And the Captain should have put a stop to it or put them in check!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Not Friendly,"We have never flown with American. Due to the pandemic it was the most available option for us and we had to push out vacation. Upon booking my child was under age. We flew out 72 hours after my child turned 2 years old. American Air refused to price match us, we had to pay over $400 for a ticket for a child who was 72 hours of being 2 years old. We couldn't even utilize her seats because she was rows ahead of us. This occurred on ALL 4 flights. The employees on the first flight from Dayton,Oh were great. The next 3 flights were awful and disheartening. Staff on and off the flights was rude and not helpful when trying to arrange seats together. She was a lap infant all 4 flights. Overseeing 4 kids, a baby and trying to get checked in for a flight can be a struggle to run smoothly. Myself and 3 children are exempt from wearing masks. I stated that and moved on. On the 3rd flight an employee actually followed me down the boarding aisle while talking loudly to have everyone in my group put masks on. She caught up to us as I was folding the stroller to put off to the side to make a scene infront of other my children and other passengers about the Non mask wearing. For the children who are able to wear a masks I gave no rebuttal about it. She's an airline employee not Doctor. Her opinions will not trump medical advice.  Meanwhile American Airlines own flight staff didn't even comply with a mask (which I don't mind). However I was harassed by ground service staff. Picture provided.  If I could of got my phone out fast enough and recorded her coming down the boarding aisle and the conversation exchanged I would of sued her for harassment. I own a HomeCare business and have never nor would never treat my clients this way. I hope American makes this right."
Date of travel: August 2020,30,Doesn’t enforce mask wearing,"Several people not wearing masks or wearing below nose, one or 4 flights a lady was asked to put her mask on but heard from other passengers she took it back off and nothing else was said. The attendants walk up and down the aisle and don’t enforce the masks although there are plenty of announcements to wear masks. I tried getting the attendants attention a couple time without making a scene but was ignored. 2 guys traveling together barely wore there masks at all and was never approached, finally at the end of flight one of the guys stood up and I yelled at him and his companion that we are still on the plane to put his mask on. I mentioned it to the attendant when exiting the plan that no body enforces the mask rule and she asked did you notify anybody and I said i tried and she replied you should of tried harder, I was amazed at her reply. While waiting to board another flight i witnessed 2 cleaning crew members both wearing there masks below their noses entering and exiting the plane. The actual flights and flying experience was flawless but how they advertise safety withe the COVID is bs maybe the other airlines are the same I don’t know but I will choose a different one next time"
Date of travel: July 2020,50,The Best,I have flown with American now for 13 years.  Without exception the staff have always been first class and helpful.  The quality of food continues to improve and cannot be faulted.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,AA refusing to apply ticket voucher and refusing to refund change fee,"American Airlines is refusing to apply my paper voucher amount to an upcoming reservation. They claim I need to book a flight 12+ days in advance via the phone and mail in the voucher. This is not practical.This was also not communicated to me when I received the voucher on March 17.  I cannot book a flight 12+ days in advance because due to COVID-19 changes / cancellations could happen and I do not want any more vouchers. American Airlines also charged me a change fee for a flight change due to COVID-19 on March 18, 2020.I have attempted to have this resolved via phone and email to American Airlines several times.  Most recently 03 Aug 2020 when the Supervisor hung up on me.I have filed complaints with the FAA/DOT and the BBB.  I am researching a lawyer to look into a possible class action lawsuit.  AA was provided government assistance during this time, I was NOT.  It is stealing and unethical to keep my money."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Poor COVID compliance during flight!,"While I was waiting for our plane to depart flying from Dallas to San Diego I remember hearing the flight attendant through the speakers thanking us for flying American and how the airline is doing everything they can to protect us during these times... I felt a chill run through me as I watched a plane full of terrified passengers. Such a surreal image in front of me, I felt mocked and ridiculed by American Airlines. This is what I experienced:1. Seating- We were a group of 3 traveling together but our seats were apart. When I approached the flight attendant at the gate (in Dallas on our way home to San Diego) to ask if they could move us and have us sit together (because you know, there is a pandemic going on and we wish to stay within ""our bubble""), he didn't even look at the screen to check he simply said: this is an full flight. WHAT? The announcement left me flabbergasted. A completely full flight during a pandemic? Didn't American reassure me they were doing everything they could? What happened to the promised social distancing measures on the aircraft to ensure OUR safety?  What happened to leaving empty seats to try to maintain distance? How come small businesses have to comply with this measure costing them greatly but one of the biggest corporations in the world can't be held accountable? So WHY is the company not implementing social distance guidelines? Furthermore, this employee didn't even try moving passengers around so we could sit together; not just for our safety but for the safety of others. Did not bother, did not care.2. Boarding- all other major airlines I have flown with since this whole thing started have been boarding backwards starting from the end of the plane. This is to avoid people standing in the aisle while people are seated. But not American Airlines, no. As we sat, there were hundreds of passengers looming over us waiting for the line to move. INSANE.3. Other concerns- Another thing I didn't see was the temperature check. I saw at least 1 very sick passenger, pale with visible sweats and barely able to stand or walk straight. I am not saying it was due to COVID but I had to certify that I didn't have any symptoms when flying so why was this person traveling with an illness? I would have expected any sick person to STAY AT HOME and for the company to implement that so passengers feel SAFE. Another thing that concerned me was that a lot of passengers were wearing their masks under their nose and the crew members allowed them to.So when I received an email with a survey asking if I would recommend others to fly American Airlines the answer is simple: NO. Or at least NOT YET. Even though American Airlines have implemented many other excellent measures (requiring face masks during the duration of the flight as well as adding HEPA filters and electrostatic sprays inside the aircraft to kill germs and viruses), this is simply not enough to travel with the absolute confidence you promised us. Small locally owned businesses with less resources have stricter rules and more drastic measures than what I experienced during my flight. I will hold American Airlines (and any other major corporation) to the highest standards simply because WE SHOULD."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,"Terrible experience, not Safe, No wipes to protect COVID-19 spread.","It was the first time seeing an airplane that doesn’t have enough fuel to get to his damn destination.. we had to go back to our get the in Charlotte,NC to get more fuel.. this is the most horrible experience I’ve ever had with an airline no more trip with them. You just lost your AA advantage member 7CV43V2."
n/a,30,My flight from houston to dallas fort worth airport,Recently i flew with them from houston to dallas fort worth....its a short 1 hr flight and the experience was quite ok.The plane was relatively empty so not much issue of social distancing.....The onshore staff was polite and helpful....seats were ok with reasonable legroom....and the flight attendents were good and courteous.Overall a decent experience and would like to fly again.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Terrible!! DO NOT FLY,Absolutely awful service. They cancelled my flight twice and when I asked how long it would be for a refund so I could use a different airline they told me a minimum of 8 weeks for a full refund. Terrible customer service.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Not safe to fly American Airlines,"My flight experience with American Airlines was horrible. They packed us on the plane with no respect to distancing recommendations - every seat was occupied on my cross country flight. Before boarding and once we were on the plane, they announced every passenger over the age of two was required to wear a mask covering both their mouth & nose with the promise violators would be asked to cover up or not fly with AA again. On the first leg of my flight, there were four people in the rows immediately next to mine that either didn't cover their nose or removed their mask for extended periods of time (and were not eating/drinking), and the flight attendant looked at them multiple times and didn't say a damn thing. The second leg of the flight, we were not provided with sanitizing wipes or anything. They still board the plane from front to back, so you have to walk by every person on the way to your seat. They sent messages touting how they were leaving open seats and making changes for our safety, but the only change I noticed was the decline of in-flight service. I'll never fly with American Airlines again."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"Typical Poor Travel accomodations, now also heartless","I tend to fly American because I live in the DFW area.  I will however make every future effort not to.  My family recently suffered a tragic death.  I booked a one way flight home quickly in the stress of events, then realized it was the wrong day within minutes.  I cancelled this ticked within minutes of booking and then booked the correct travel date. When I was still charged on my credit card, I was met with a rude and cold tone.  The explanation of events meant nothing to them.  No condolences or sorry for your loss comments even bothered to be delivered with the news that “your ticket is non-refundable” and that’s basically my problem to deal with.  Rude and cold is an understatement being on the other end of that phone line.  I can only pray that the last good thing to come out of this pandemic will be AA going out of business."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,I have never been disappointed in American Airlines,We are returning from a trip to Denver on American Airlines. I am almost always traveling with my child in tOw and this is a great family friendly airline. Even if there is a delayed flight I find that the staff are always kind and helpful. I have always experienced great service from checking in to landing at the airport. I think that the gate staff are patient and kind. Most people who travel have experienced someone somewhere who makes an experience unpleasant. That’s never been the case for me with American Airlines. I find consistently good service all the time. The fact that they are so kind to my children when I fly really means a lot to me. I appreciate and respect the hard work that these people do especially with all of the Covid precautions they must add to the list. Great service and great people.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Missed my connecting flight and was told to kick rocks.,Never flying American Airlines! Due to “weather” me and 7 others missed our connecting flights to seattle By 5 min. American Airlines told us there is nothing they can do as the plane still sat in the Parkway not pulled away from the ramp! We where rescheduled to fly out the next day. Told us to go find a hotel and transportation on our own dime! And it is not their problem! Are you kidding me?! Iv personally sat in airlines airplanes that waited an extra 15 min for connecting flight passengers to make it. You don’t tell a customer to wait a day and then make them pay out of pocket for your overnight stay because you don’t have any other flights leaving today! I wish I could leave you a 0 star review because I will never fly American again and I will warn everyone about your customer service Deptartment.
n/a,10,Scariest place to be,I've heard it was bad didn't know it was that bad. I paid for a non stop flight but I got a connecting flight coming home. I was charged for a non stop but I got a connecting. Both planes I got on coming home did not give out sanitizer or water anything. I had my music on most the ride on the connecting flight from Charlotte to nyc. I finally pause my music to my surprise the person behind me is sniffling over n over. I get up and look she has her mask under her nose with her sniffling nose exposed the entire flight. If I had the non stop I wouldn't have even been on that second flight with that girl behind me. Today I don't feel so well so American airline if I have covid 19 and pass the blood is on your hands thank you so much. I'm glad money is more important than safety.
Date of travel: July 2020,50,The whole plane crew above&beyond helpfully I have learning issues &anxiety and they were very kind,"I'd give them the best review. loved my flight. The pilot&,staff so friendly keep me so calm +beautiful flight. They all go beyond their jobs to make all comfortable. American Airlines I loved+if I choose to fly again in future if pick them"
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Hit or miss,I had some good past experience and bad. This time of course covid is in the way. I was happy when they informed me months ago that the middle seats would stay empty. Apparently they didn’t inform people very well when they stopped that policy. Crew did the most minimum of job. Which is understandable under the current state. One positive note. That’s the cleanest plane I have ever seen. Even the window was clean.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Major Changes,"There were major changes to my itenerary that forced not only an over night flight, but a full day in another city. The lady I spoke to with customer service was very short with me and kept saying that the airline was authorized to make flight changes no matter how drastic and it was my choice to accept the changes or cancel my flight all together. I didn’t feel that she sympathized with my situation at all because it was obvious she deals with these calls everyday. I didn’t give her a reason to be short with me but my situation is that we are paying good money over $1000 I think for these flights and now with this change we’re going to have to pay for transportation throughout Miami, an extra day for our dogs to be boarded, an extra day for parking at the airport, a hotel, and an extra day of meals. That is easily going to come to $300 if not $400. While I understand the situation with COVID is hard for everyone I would appreciate a little understanding and compensation. It wouldn’t have to be a lot and at this rate I won’t be flying American again if this is what is to expect."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,No Covid precautions. And stay on a heated taxiway with reduced AX,American airlines.is allowing middle seat seating. And on flight 2554 to Sacramento they made us board early and then stayed on a taxiway because of inspection of rubber on the runway joint. In the hot summer. With reduced AC.  So why the hell board early in the first place? With a Mandatory.mask....in the heat in less air....not sure if they are more okay with all of us having additional breathing issues.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Hate them,"This was my first time booking a flight.  Two weeks before my flight, my friend couldn't make it so I decided to cancel the flight and call them to get it changed.  They did not do anything and effectively said, ""Too bad, so sad, thanks for the $500!""  I then decided to take the flight anyways since they wouldn't change it, which is unbelievable by the way, I don't know any other business that does that.  I gave them plenty of time. Anyways, they said they couldn't give me my ticket back because I had cancelled it not an hour earlier. WTF?   It was 2 clicks to cancel my flight, they made it that easy.  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CONSUMER BENEFIT TO CANCEL YOUR FLIGHT, it only benefits them.I hate this company, they were apathetic.  I will never fly AA and I actively encourage others to not fly AA.Do your heart a favor and skip these weasels.Thank you."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"American Airlines - terrible experience on more than one occasion, never on time.","Never count on AA to leave on time, and I mean by hours late or cancellations, not minutes late. Had to cancel vacation plans; hotels, car rental, and an excursion due to flight cancellation. Then, got on next plane, taxying and getting ready to take off (four hours late) and had to return to gate due to a maintenance issue. Three more hours to wait on repair.....very unreliable, very frustrating. Reconsider your choice in carriers, if you have plans and actually want to get somewhere on time or at least on the correct day."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,During COVID avoid American at all Cost,"Recently flew on American and had and highly suggest you don’t. My GF was flying Delta and had a much better experience. First off American doesn’t block center seats. I understand the unit economics don’t work long term with this model but if you’re going to take government (taxpayers) money then you can block the seats during COVID until things start to get back to some resemblance of normal. Secondly, if you can’t even do that at least hand out sanitizing wipes so passengers can clean down their area. This little gesture would have even gone a long way. Delta not only blocked their middle seats but also handed out sanitizing wipes. There is a reason why Delta’s stock and market cap surpasses American and it’s because they genuinely care more about customer service. I’m had status with American for years (and have been flying them most of my life) since growing up near Philly (US Airways). It’s time to switch.  American can do better."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,American Airlines got me bent,Mfs cancelled the flight I was suppose to be on the day before I was suppose to leave. What kinda time y’all on bro. I got a pregnant wife at home and kids that need me to take them to soccer practice. American Airlines isn’t for its customers and def ain’t for the kids.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,I HATE THE AA FLIGHT ATTENDANTS,They were all so rude. I got kicked off bc my dog coughed and the flight attendant got scared. Yet they still shipped our bags to the final destination. I hate this airline don’t fly with them.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,HORRIBLE,This woman kicked us off the flight bc I had brought my dog. The lady was afraid of dogs and without telling us she kicked us off which was completely uncalled for. She then threatened to not let us board. She then became very violent and abusive with her words. This was the worst experience ever if you have a dog I do not recommend American.
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Excellent!,"Flight was nicely distanced, and even came with a free first class upgrade. It was our first time flying with American and won’t be the last."
n/a,40,Finally modernizing planes ,Although American airlines is becoming more like a discount carrier I was pleasantly surprised from the upgrades. All the seats have video screens and power outlets which is common for most carriers. Improved legroom and free two carry-on bags.
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Think...before,"The women need to be retrained at check in. I was called hon, in return I said babe. People are not honey to strangers In the me too movement respect deserves respect. In this instance it was tossed at the door!"
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Decreased service no decrease in price,Flew from Sacramento to DC on 7/22/20 via Phoenix. Flights 1867/685 first class. I do understand that Covid-19 has had major changes in the way things are done . My  issue is that with the decrease in the amount of service you receive in 1st class there has not been a decrease in cost. Obviously I don't mind paying extra for the extra service but I do have a problem paying extra with no return on investment.  A box of cheese and a drink on a four hour flight? Come on now!! I will say that both legs of the flight were on time. I won't comment on the social distance practices but hey cant get much distance on a full flight right?!! Mask rule was enforced which was good.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,profit before safety - I can't believe I use this airline,"After cancelling 3 times, I finally got on a flight to Vegas to visit my Mom.  Flight was, again, OVERSOLD.  Unreal.   It was clear that everyone on the PACKED plane was new(er) to flying.  Walking on board with wayyyyy too much personal items (though no one stopped them) and no one could find their seat, etc.  Boarding took 50 minutes.  Masks hanging off their faces, tons of kids (who bring kids to Vegas in July?? and during a pandemic??) with no mask because they were under 10.   It was pretty chaotic.People on the plan screamed in excitement at take off and screamed in fear at turbulance and the whole plane clapped at landing. Finally, talking to someone waiting to deplane and find out they booked their flight for $49 each way.   And so did the 28+ people that came with them.   Most who have never flown. Happy they got their first chance at flying and of getting to Vegas on the cheap.  BUT just goes to prove that AA would rather sell seats at $49 than keep their regular - and higher paying - customers safe.  Not an empty seat on the plane - and not too many people wearing theirs masks correctly - if at all.   Amazing how people - all of a sudden - are eating when someone walks by.  I really need to find another airline."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Social Distancing....right.,"Packed planes elbow to elbow during COVID.  Their system changed my seats several times on its own separating me from my wife. Gate agents had to be pushed to correct seating issues.  Mask requirements are a joke as they threaten people telling them if they do not wear a mask they may be prohibited from flying in the future.  I would like to see that list...I bet it has no one on it.  On my flights, some people left their masks off until they saw a flight crew person coming down the aisle.  Chicago connection.  Ohare was jam-packed with people. Very little social distancing.  Had to go all the way across the airport for my connection past thousands of people, very few social distancing some not wearing masks.  Did not see one person in Chicago doing any sanitizing or cleaning.  I am very disappointed with the airlines and airports needless to say.  When I arrived in Tulsa the only people in the airport wearing masks were the gate agents.  The local population seemed blissfully unaware of COVID. I won't fly again until there is a vaccine."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Shame on you.,"While the AA staff and crew continue to be excellent, their bosses need to be taken to task for their behavior during this pandemic.They cancelled all other flights to SAC and only flew one out of DFW. Bringing disparate people together into a central hub and then sending them out again is a great way to make a huge spread in disease. Also, since other flights were cancelled, no one on this flight asked for this. This plane is completely packed. Shame on you cancelling and condensing flights to completely packed ones and still charging for basic features during this time. If this is what is required for to be profitable, there is a problem in your business model.Shame on you. Contrary to your videos, “our safety” is clearly not your priority."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Try another airline!,"Just returned from roundtrip cancun to charlotte. In both trips, earlier flight cancelled so american could jam all passengers on one flight. Both packed full, middle seats and all! Figured I was with 6 ft of at least 12 passengers, likely 15. But they insist on deboarding one row at a time, in order to social distance!? This is my fourth trip to the US since the virus hit, all for medical reasons. Will move american to the bottom of my list for future flights. Ridiculous!"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,5 Hours to get a resolution,"I couldn't check in so I went to the agent.  She told me I didn't have a ticket for my flight.  I disagreed since I had email confirmations and a charge to my credit card.  They asked me to call reservations to get it sorted out.  I called Reservations and they told me to work with the agent to get the ticket reassigned correctly.  The agent said they can't.  They sent me back and forth for almost 20 minutes,  Finally the reservations agent decided to do what she could.  I didn't purchase the ticket and it was changed the next day for an alternate date.  The customer service rep attached the change to the wrong locator number thus causing an error in the system.  It took 5 hours to speak with the right individuals and even then I had to walk step by step through each transaction for them to finally get it.  In short, I spent more than a half day fixing something that wasn't my mistake as every reservation and change were handled by the 1-800 reservations line.  And guess what.... it still isn't resolved.  I had to pay an additional $570 to get home because their system went down and they can't access my information.  All of this after I was on the phone for an hour then they say I'll have to call back.Once this is resolved I WILL NEVER fly American!  This isn't customer service when you have to be persistent in order to be treated as a customer.  The gate agent ""Leslie"" in Louisville KY was horrible, rude and blatantly demonstrated that she didn't care nor wanted to hear my situation.  She kept looking away or helping other passengers while I was trying to get this corrected so I could go home."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,American puts Profit before Safety during the Pandemic,"American placed a passenger in the middle seat next to me  (assigned on day of flight) even though there were dozens of seats still open in the main cabin (seats considered premium cabin)  My complaint is not that there were more passengers on board, but that the American Reservation process seats passengers in the middle seats even though there were dozens of empty seats and whole rows open.  All the best cleaning efforts were for naught as I had to sit in a seat occupied by another passenger until he was moved.  This challenge and resulting customer dissatisfaction is a simple results of American placing the extra value of certain seats ($20-$50) above that of the safety of the passengers.  I recommend that middle seats only be assigned if the other seats are occupied."
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Unaccompanied minor fee,"They charge 150 each way for an unaccompanied minor to basically show them their seat, that’s it! They don’t sit with them...check on them... talk to them...the fact that they charge more than double the ticket price for a round trip to do the same thing an adult passenger does is absolutely insane and taking advantage of long distance parents wanting to see their children. They should be ashamed."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,American doesn’t care about their customers,"I never want to fly American again. My flight from Springfield to Dallas was delayed because I pointed out to the flight attendant an overhead panel that came dislodged. I pointed this out! This delayed our first flight by over an hour. I knew I was likely going to miss my connecting flight from Dallas to Abq. The flight attendant knew this too, even spoke to everyone on the plane who had connections and were likely to miss. Not only did they take no action to notify our connecting gates that we would be late they were completely indifferent to us missing our next flights. I ran to attempt to get to my connection and before I could even get on the tram my flight had not only left, but IT LEFT EARLY! How? American knew I was going to be delayed, all they had to do was hold the gate for 10 minutes! By the time I was finally helped by an agent (almost an hour later) the agent could care less about me making it home. I specifically asked if they could rebook on another airline so I could be home that night, not only did the agent say no but she said there were no other flights to Abq that night from Dallas. Which was simply not true there were actually 2. On top of a very indifferent and unhelpful agent they provided the cheapest and most inconsiderate compensation. A cheap old run down hotel. Only $12 for meals, this was at 7pm. I would still need dinner and breakfast. My option for dinner was the hotel and their entries started at $15, the voucher didn’t even cover dinner! Let alone breakfast. The next flight they could put me on was a 9am flight from Houston to Abq. This flight would make me miss work in the morning. So on top of having to spend my own money for food I was also going to loose a morning of work. American didn’t care, they didn’t care about my well being, and they certainly didn’t care about me getting home. Maybe I didn’t complain enough, but that shouldn’t matter. It was their fault my first flight was delayed due to mechanical errors, which I so kindly pointed out, and they did nothing to make sure I could make my connection. I never want to fly with American again, they don’t care about their customers. Oh and on top of all of this they aren’t taking CDC recommended precautions on flights either."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Terrible airline policy,I had a scheduled flight one month out.  The times were changed on me.   My arrival times at 6 hrs different on both departures and arrivals. American will not refund me and allow me to find another flight.  They say that they are sorry but they are just the problem   How long will we continue to be taken advantage of from big airlines.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Booked months in advance with no notice of flight change,This is THE WORST AIRLINE I HAVE WVER BOOKED WITH! I booked my round trip flight from Seattle to Miami two months in advance. Both flights were direct flights and my return flight I upgraded my seat so I would have more space because I was getting plastic surgery done and needed to be comfortable on my flight home! The day of my departure flight I realized that my return flight had been changed and it was no longer a direct flight and also my seats I selected were no longer available. I never was notified that this flight had been changed or that I would need to be at the airport 5 hours before my original flight. I am scheduled at a recovery house so having to tell them the day of the flight that my flight times have changed was not ideal nor fair. My transportation to and from the airport was already booked and changing it the day of my flight it ridiculous! I called the airline and they blew me off making it seem like I was at fault for the airline changing my flight. I was then told I needed to pay for my seats AGAIN and that there was nothing they could do about it! I then hung up and selected my seats paid for them. Then received a notification that my request couldn’t be processed but the money was taken off of my card. I then called again and was told that they couldn’t see anything basically telling me I was lying. And to top it off when i finally just tried to check in to my flight I received an alert that I would have to see someone in the airport to do so. I am beyond disappointed and livid with this airline. If they would have given me proper notice I may not be so mad but the fact I was never even given an opportunity to cancel my flight and book with a different airline is infuriating and I will never fly with or recommend this flight to anyone! Very disappointed that my trip that was supposed to be amazing was ruined before I even started it!
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Wheelchair assistant,I twisted my ankle while on vacation so on the way home I requested wheelchair assist. My flight to Dallas was held up a little bit causing my next flight to be tight. My assistant was awesome he ran his butt off he was sweating and he made sure that I got to my next gate Within plenty of time. His name was Fernando and he deserves a raise.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,American Airlines Rude Flight Attendant,"Flying used to be a pleasure but not anymore. In these times it has become an inconvenience at best and American Arlines has got to be the worst! Their flight attendants are rude and act as if we the passengers are an inconvenience and nuisance to them. I have a medical condition and can’t wear a face mask so I purchased a shield for my trip. The one and only flight attendant that said anything to me about it was rude and very snobbishly said to me that I must have a mask on. I asked him, even with a medical condition? He answered very snidely, “that excuse won’t work after the 29th of July”. Until then I wasn’t aware that a medical condition was an excuse. I guess that as of July 29th, on American Airlines, a medical condition is cause for refusing a paying passenger to fly. I won’t be flying with them again!"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,COVID-19 AA does not care!!!!!,"07/26/2020American Airlines does not care about nurses. I recently booked a flight from Phoenix to Cancun for my family. My wife is an ICU nurse, and I am an ER nurse (in Phoenix, Az.). We made the reservations for non-stop from Phoenix to Cancun and back for a much-needed break and stress relief from Covid-19. I made these accommodations with American Airlines because I trusted them, and the flights where direct to avoid Covid-19. I was notified less than 36 hours prior to leaving that the flight was changed from direct flight home to a two-hour layover in Dallas. Of all the places to send nurses, the hotbed of COVID, Dallas? I explained to the customer service representative that we are nurses we can not go through these states due to the COVID 19 outbreak and could potentially keep us from work (saving lives) two weeks, Marlo (customer service representative) replied you should be lucky you are going, you can cancel if you want to. I tried to explain how much this vacation meant to us and that we have not gone anywhere since the winter rush of 2019 (September 2019). I expressed the mental stress we have been under trying to avoid COVID stay healthy, working conditions, and dealing with angry patients/family.  American Airlines does not care. I would avoid doing business with American Airlines at any time, but especially if you are in healthcare. I feel bad for all the customers unaware of the danger American Airlines is putting them in by sending them through Dallas airport at this time. It is exceptionally dangerous to send unwilling customers into a city that is currently plagued with the epidemic. American Airlines does not care about the health of their customers and cares less about the work and dedication that healthcare workers are doing. Brian T. McCullough RNTeresa L. McCullough RN"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,They do not enforce CDC guidelines at all,We just had a very nice vacation the only stain on this trip was this airline. I personally am not one be all freaked out about this virus stuff but The staff tells everyone to wear a mask and social distance but do not enforce anything they say. People line up on top of each other just to board they don’t say or enforce anything and these planes are packed. They say once when you board to keep the mask on but several people on the flight kept them off the whole time and one with no mask on was coughing up a storm the entire flight some of the other passengers notified the attendant of this behavior they didn’t enforce anything they just made an announcement to wear the mask no one listened. When we landed they say everyone leave in small groups to exit. No one listened everyone stood up and rushed off the plane in a big mob the attendants did nothing they did not enforce anything every seat on the flight was
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Pay a little bit more for a better Airline -flew with an infant-,"This was our first time flying with an infant and the flight attendants did not care. They had my husband and I on different seats even though we bought the ticket at the same time. They just assign your seat wherever they want. We asked to switch seats with others and the flight attendants told us we couldn't. The flight was so full!!! I also had to hand pump and I was extremely hot and uncomfortable. I had the cover over me and was sitting there sweating trying to hand pump to feed my hot and fussy baby who my husband had in a different seat section. The personal AC knob was far off to the window, not even directly on you. I had a isle seat.  I'm never flying with them again. The seats are also thinner than normal. Also you have to decide to bring to the gate your baby's carseat or stroller, you can't bring both through the gate. My husband literally had to carry out 16 lb baby in the carseat throughout the airport. On top of that our connection/layover was from TX to UT and they only gave us 35 minutes to get to our next gate. Our first flight arrived on time but we were waiting for the plane to park so we could run to the next gate. By the time we got off the plane we had to run (mind you my husband is running with the baby in the carseat) and we had to get to the other side of the airport for out TX to UT gate. We and to take the shuttle and were sprinting. They called our names over the intercom and said final boarding. We barely made it. Why did they schedule us on that layover with such a short amount of time to transition?  They just see you as money and don't care about your experience. Southwest is the best!"
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Small seats and damaged luggage,"We flew on american from Orlando to OKC but had to change planes at Charlotte.We flew basic economy, the seats are small, but expected that. Thet are not serving drinks or snacks on flights so basically not much service.When we landed in OKC found they had broken one of the wheels on our new luggage set."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Terrible!!!!!,"We borded the plane. I informed the flight attendant that my seat was broken and leaned back without me pushing the button. All I had to do was lean against it and it would recline. He seemed disinterested. While preparing for landing, another flight attendant asked me to bring my seat upright. I inforced her that it was broken.She went and told the original attendant about it that I had already told earlier that my seat was broken. He asked me again to return it to an upright position, by this point the whole thing is becoming absurd... !! Let me ask you American Airlines, how many times do I have inform someone that my seat is broken before they leave me alone? So he then leaned over and pushed the button to bring my seat to an upright position......So I informed him AGAIN THAT IT WAS BROKEN!! He then looked at me like I was disobeying him..... No wonder I never fly this crappy airline ... I'm tired of being treated like crap!!!!"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Never Flying Airlines Again,"My sister and I have had such a bad time trying to even get ready for this flight! First of all, flying to Idaho to Nebraska we were to have a layover in Colorado and now we fly all the way to Dallas at last minute. Trying to check in was a day process and so frustrating. If we paid $600 for plane tickets, why can’t me and my sister sit together? With COVID going on I really don’t want to be sitting next to any strangers. When flying delta to Idaho we had an amazing experience and the plane was very clean so now we know American Airlines is the worst company to fly through"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,PACKED Plane during COVID-19,"Honestly with the airlines that are blocking out middle seats, good for you!!!! This American Flight is absolutely packed and ridiculous in times like this. Keep your travelers safe or you may have no travelers left!!! Middle seats should be blocked for couple travelers. I’m Sitting next to a complete stranger!!! Coming from LAX (everyone knows the LA Covid-19 numbers. This is ridiculous for an essential worker (Working trough the whole pandemic) to have to be satire this and risk my life for travel."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Stupid,"Trying to check in with the app is impossible. If your flying with more then one person, expect to pay to even just sit to each other. Our first flight on delta was so easy and I sat with my partner they handed out sanitizer and were very careful about COVID. Have yet to get on our flight tomorrow and we are already pissed. Highly suggest a different airline."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,STAY AWAY,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES. We are in the peak of a pandemic and they had our plane at almost 100% capacity. Even first class didn’t have an empty seat. Almost every row is completely filled. This airline clearly doesn’t care about anyone’s safety. I will never be supporting this company again.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Stay Away,Please refer to the attached photo.Please refer to the attached photoPlease refer to the attached photo
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Do NOT fly American,"If you want to guarantee that you’ll catch COVID, then by all means, hop on an American flight. I took a a flight from Charlotte to Boston today (July 23), and it was not only booked solid with no empty seats, but people were not wearing masks until being repeatedly told by the staff, and a bunch of dummies were actually vaping. Genuinely taking off their masks, smoking, and blowing it out into the cabin. It was the most ridiculous flight I have ever been on.If it weren’t for my mother having a heart attack, I never would have risked this. Shame on you, American Airlines. You have to do better for your customers and employees."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,Terrible experience,"Bought my elderly mother a first class seat. She didn’t realize she couldn’t keep a purse or item if she sat in the very front seat and the stewardess was extremely rude and embarrassed my mother rather than politely explaining how the front seats work. There was no inflight entertainment, no food or drinks offered. Basically, the only difference between flying first class and flying coach is that in coach she could have had her iPad to entertain herself. Can’t recommend you buy a first class ticket as there are no perks to doing so. Also can’t recommend American Airlines due to the rude service."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,😐,I will not be flying with American airlines again if i can help it. They told us to social distance as we boarded but then u dont even social distance in your seats. Also the flight was delayed which seems pretty normal for American airlines. It wasnt to big of deal for me but thot i would leave an honest review...
Date of travel: July 2020,10,AA is the worst! ,"I will NEVER fly AA again. The absolute worst airline I’ve ever used. The customer service is terrible and they will come up with every excuse to make the customer sound wrong. I have never been treated as poorly as I was trying to talk to them. We were rerouted to an airport we were never supposed to be at for FIVE HOURS! Missing our connecting flight and they didn’t do a single thing to help! Sitting in a “closed” airport for 5 hours is rough. Finally getting to Charlotte and guess what, our connecting flight had just left. Needing a hotel room, did they compensate? NOPE! We had to pay out of pocket and wait for an additional 2 hours in the heat to get our shuttle to the hotel. Hundreds of people missed their flights this day and the airline did absolutely nothing to help! Told is that is we wanted our checked luggage we would have to wait a minimum of 3 hours to get it! Are you freaking kidding me?!? Let’s not mention there was absolutely no social distancing taking place on the flights. Full planes for all 4 flights. I’ve sent several emails and they’ve basically told me that bc it was weather there was nothing they could do. I was told by the girl in Greensboro that it’s their obligation to help when we are redirected to a different airport for ANY reason. I’m just mostly upset with the way we were treated. I’m a paying customer and they wonder why they have the worst reviews! I will use any airline besides them in the future."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Terrible experience. Will never fly with them again.,"I bought a ticket to Austin Texas flying out of philly. It was a direct, nonstop flight because I didn’t want to deal with a layover. I even spent extra money to get this flight and turned down the cheaper flights with layovers. American decided to change my flight to the layover flight without any reasoning. I didn’t mind much until I landed in Charlotte for my layover and couldn’t leave due to weather. I sat there in the terminal watching other flights from different carriers as well as other flights from American taking off after being delayed for hours except mine was canceled. I even watched as a Dallas flight took off even though I was flying just a 3 hour drive away from Dallas. I attempted to talk to the help desk but was given a card with a number to call to plan a new flight. Talked to a very miserable lady who said there was nothing they could do because it was a weather cancellation even after I explained this was Americans fault because I shouldn’t even been on this flight in the first place. She proceeded to call me a liar after I told her that I watched flights board, pull away, and take off because according to her screen everything was grounded. In an attempt to make things better they gave me cookies.... absolutely pitiful customer relations. Overall my experience with American was worse than terrible and They have lost my service as well as all of my friends and family who I am going to tell never to fly with American."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Another bad trip,"Hands down the worst airline. Customer service refuses to help. They take your money and offer you nothing. The airplanes are small, poorly ran. If given the option a flight with Delta with a connection, is better than a non-stop with AA. 5 out 5 experiences were terrible. #nobailoutsforpoorservice"
Date of travel: July 2020,20,Crowded flight with a rough group of passengers,"American Airlines Flight 1993MCO-PHL2:04-4:35 pm Airbus A321This flight was to return from a quick weekend trip to Orlando, and since it was our second AA flight that weekend, we were a bit more prepared for the lack of social distancing and crowded nature of being on a plane than we had been two days before. We knew to expect that no seats would be blocked out for distancing purposes, and that it would probably be a pretty full flight, which it was. Overall, the flight was ok, but the crowd of passengers was really rough, with a lot of very loud kids and adults and poor compliance with the mask-wearing requirements, which was disappointing.   We had purchased Basic Economy tickets for only $40 each, and we decided not to pay for seats in advance, since a good number of seats had not been assigned when we looked at the seat map a couple days prior. There were three people in our party, and we were assigned a standard row of three seats toward the back of the plane when checking in online right at the 24-hour mark. Since we have the AA credit card, our checked bags were free, making Basic Economy really no different than paying for a much more expensive regular ticket. It was a good deal.When we arrived at MCO for the flight, it was immediately clear that this airport is busy. It wasn’t as busy as it would have been a year ago, but it was much more of a “normal” feeling of commotion than we witnessed at our home airport (PHL) two days prior. The AA check-in area was crowded, although we were able to find an open kiosk immediately and were on our way quickly. When we were in line for the bag drop, I definitely noticed that people were not very good about leaving space between parties. It would have been a big help if AA had included social distancing markers in queues to help groups see where they should stand while waiting. The agent who took our bags was very nice and quickly had us on our way.Although it’s not AA’s fault, we saw a lot of poor compliance with mask wearing at MCO. So many people (passengers, staff, and airline crew) were not wearing masks properly, and leaving their noses or mouth (or both) uncovered, with no one to really enforce the rules. We were pretty uncomfortable walking around MCO due to the combination of crowds and lax mask wearing. This is unlike how it generally is where we’re from in the Northeast, so it was a little surprising to see.The flight boarded on time, and proceeded very much the same as always, with people crowding the gate trying to board the plane. Since we had checked our luggage and didn’t have carry-ons needing overhead bin space, we decided to wait until the very end of the boarding process, and we were some of the last people to board once everything was clear.  The flight was pretty full, and the seats with standard legroom that we had in the main cabin had the standard space and comfort that you’d find on any AA flight. Everything did seem relatively clean, but not noticeably different from any flight before the pandemic. After we wiped down our seats with Clorox wipes, one of the flight attendants pointed out to us that our seats had small paper garbage bags in them that we could use to dispose of the wipes, which was nice. I don’t think our flight on the way to Orlando had these, and it was nice to have something to hold small trash items.Unfortunately, right around us were a lot of the worst behaved passengers on the flight, which included a lot of groups with loud, unsupervised kids, and adults who were equally poorly behaved and not wearing masks properly. The groups around us would have been gross on any flight, but especially during the pandemic, we could not wait to get away from them ASAP.On this flight there weren’t as many announcements made about safety and modifications related to Covid as there were on our way down to Florida, but announcements were made about the mandatory mask rule and the fact that flight attendants would be monitoring compliance throughout the flight. I appreciated that one of the flight attendants actually did come by a couple of times to check masks, and corrected those who weren’t wearing them properly.We ended up leaving the gate a few minutes early, and waited about 20 minutes to take off, even though there didn’t seem to be any planes ahead of us waiting to take off. The flight was fine, with no food or drink service provided due to the pandemic, making it a pretty basic, bare bones flight. Other than any cost difference, there’s really no reason to choose American over a budget carrier like Spirit or Frontier right now. The A321 doesn’t really offer any amenities, although wifi was available to watch free in-flight movies on aa.com. The flight was uneventful, with very little contact with flight attendants since no service is being offered. We arrived at our gate in Philadelphia right on time.  Just as they had done on our flight to Florida two days earlier, the flight attendants made an announcement after we landed to encourage people not to jump up in the aisles as soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off. They asked everyone to de-plane row by row in order to promote physical distancing. It was very disappointing that a large number of passengers on this flight ignored this completely, and felt the need to jump up and clog the aisles/have unnecessary contact while waiting to get off the aircraft.Overall, our flight to Philadelphia was fine, but we were not comfortable with the combination of AA not creating any space on the planes and the crowd on this flight being very rough with lax behaviors around mask wearing. We did our best to keep to ourselves safe, but we didn’t enjoy the flight experience."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Our flights changed twice,"Communications between American Airlines and the ticket holder ... the one paying is non-existent , they changed the flight time leaving Anchorage without telling me, then they changed the gate number at Dallas without notification ..had been sitting there 4 hours. Paid for the tickets in January for round trip to Anchorage in mid June. Airline  employees at the desks snickered about my missing the flight and REFUSED to get a Supervisor. Had to wait another 4 hours to catch the last flight of the day.NO WONDER AMERICAN AIRLINES ARE IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. Their front line employees are useless and totally unprofessional. Hey they had my email and Cell Phone number ... too sorry to even contact the contact number."
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Not bad for a flight during the pandemic,"American Airlines Flight 1565PHL-MCO8:20-11:01 am Airbus A319My wife and I recently took our first flight during the height of the pandemic for a weekend in Orlando. Overall, the flight was fine, since we made it to Orlando quite a bit early and had no real issues. However, the lack of any sort of social distancing or spacing on the flight felt a little weird, even though I already knew that American wasn’t blocking out seats on its flights anymore and that this flight would be full. We’re not particularly nervous about traveling, or we wouldn’t have taken the trip at all, but it was just a little more jarring than I expected to walk back onto a full flight for the first time in months.The day before our flight, we received an email from American stating that our flight was going to be full, and that we could switch flights for free if we wanted to do so. The flight was so full that the app was also offering compensation to anyone who was willing to give up their seat. We didn’t have any flexibility in our plans, so we stuck with this flight anyway.We had purchased Basic Economy tickets for only $40 each, and we had paid an additional $15 each for advance seat assignments to ensure we’d be seated together. Since we have the AA credit card, our checked bags were free, making Basic Economy really no different than paying for a much more expensive regular ticket. It was a good deal.When we arrived at PHL in the morning, the airport was very dead compared to what we’re used to. The check-in counters for Terminal B/C had no lines, and we were able to check our bags quickly using one of the kiosks. The same was the case for security. We were told that Terminal C security at PHL was closed (which is typically where we go for precheck), so we went to the Terminal B security checkpoint and expected that we’d have to do regular security. We were very pleasantly surprised to find out that one of the lanes at Terminal B was being used for precheck, so we were able to have expedited screening.The flight boarded on time, and proceeded very much the same as always, with people crowding the gate trying to board the plane. Since we had checked our luggage and didn’t have carry-ons needing overhead bin space, we decided to wait until the very end of the boarding process, and we were some of the last people to board once everything was clear.  The flight was completely full, and the seats with standard legroom that we had in the main cabin had the standard space and comfort that you’d find on any AA flight. We were lucky that the third seat in our row ended up being one of the only empty seats on the plane (solely because a third member of our party who would have been seated there ended up not coming with us on the flight, but never cancelled his ticket). Everything did seem relatively clean, but not noticeably different from any flight before the pandemic. Once boarding was complete, the pilot made several announcements related to health and safety, which we appreciated. He went over the mandatory face covering requirement and specified that flight attendants would enforce the rules throughout the flight, with a threat of being banned for life for any passenger who refused to wear a face covering. He also discussed the extra cleaning procedures and function of HEPA filters on the plane. All of this made me feel a bit more comfortable about flying. It was kind of annoying that once everyone was seated, several passengers started getting up and trying to switch seats or get new seat assignments. It seemed that a bunch of people traveling together had purchased Basic Economy tickets and ended up with scattered seat assignments, but wanted to be together. In my opinion, the flight attendants were too accommodating with these requests, which led to a lot of commotion and unnecessary contact between passengers as people around us were all getting up and switching seats after everyone had already all been seated. We ended up leaving the gate almost 10 minutes early, and since air traffic is limited right now, we took off quickly. The flight was fine, with no food or drink service due to the pandemic, making it a pretty basic, bare bones flight. Other than any cost difference, there’s really no reason to choose American over a budget carrier like Spirit or Frontier right now. The A319 did have power outlets at each seat, which was nice, and wifi was available to watch free in-flight movies on aa.com. The flight was uneventful, with very little contact with flight attendants since no service is being offered. We arrived at our gate in Orlando over 30 minutes early, with a couple minutes of an extra wait on the ground because there was initially no ground staff available to help park the plane at the gate.The flight attendants made an announcement after we landed to encourage people not to jump up in the aisles as soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off. They asked everyone to de-plane row by row in order to promote physical distancing. I was actually shocked that for the most part, people did listen to this and did not stand up until the row in front of them had cleared the area. Any time I’ve seen flight crew ask passengers to remain seated in the past (such as to help people with tight connections get off first), I’ve very rarely seen people listen.Overall, our flight to Orlando was totally fine. We were happy to arrive early and we did everything we could to be safe. Mask compliance was pretty good on the flight (although not perfect), and things felt surprisingly normal once we got past the initial stages of uncertainty of how it would be to fly right now. It would have been nice to see more distancing or lower capacity on the plane, but AA is simply not offering this anymore."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Me,"The worst company to travel, race’s staff Not recommended at all Very bad service I travel a lot with other companies and most of them are great Never ride it again"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Terrible customer service,"This is my first time flying American and will be my last. After paying extra to select seats when it came time for my flight I was told they had no evidence of ever selecting them. Then there were storms and clearly no one at American Airlines knows how to deal with bad weather. They changed our departure gate no less than 5 times,  forcing a herd of people to move back and forth between terminals (because it was never just one gate over). They gave us no explanation when we watched multiple flights that were scheduled to depart after us board and leave. In fact they kept us in the dark until the last minute about why we were so delayed once the weather cleared up. They don’t value customers and I am ashamed that I paid money for such an awful experience."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,Shame on AA,"In these days of COVID-19 illness, American Airlines needs to be ashame of themselves. There was no social distancing; almost EVERY seat was filled. They used a commercial size plane to accommodate. We just came from CT and RI, MA and have their stuff together. I have another trip planned in October, but if there's no social distancing compliance, I'll try not to use AA."
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Flight time was messed up by the booking agency,"I booked 3 tickets for the exact same flight under the American Airlines agency. The agent confirmed the dates and times yet when we arrived at the airport I was informed that one of the tickets has been booked for the earlier morning this caused us to miss our flight. I spent an hour on the phone with reservations who provided me with minimul help. The highlight was a lady named Sasha working at the tickting booth who was able to figure all of our flights out for the next day and even fixed another booking error that the reservation office made while attmpting to ""fix"" our flights. Sasha the tickting agent at the ABQ airport was the most helpful and understanding employee that I have met so far and she definitely deserves a raise!!!"
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Long and complicated flight to freedom,"Minimal service.  Paid business class.  only received a small bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water on each of our 3 hour flights.  Had to ask for beer, only got one on 2 of the three flights.  Original flight was cancelled with no notice to me from the airline, only noticed because I checked the APP daily.  Forced to overnight instead of a single day trip.  one flight went mechanical, 1 hour delay onboard, had to change terminals to get a new plane, original plane sat too long and failed a start up test.  On the good side, the plane was clean."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Nonexistent Social Distancing,"Don't expect social distancing.  You'll be inches from a complete stranger.  I was told that they would not book the middle seats.  That was a lie.  Now only was every seat booked, they were over sold by 3.  Sure we wore a masks, but putting profits before people is pretty horrible."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,Last resort during COVID-19,"Currently the airline is filling all seats.   I was under the impression an email would be sent if the flight was full, and then you could decide to change to another flight.  No email was sent, but I did notice after check-in that they were offering vouchers for people to change flights (no reason listed, but as such I assumed full flight).  I had purchased a seat (shown in the picture) by itself.  The only reason I chose this seat was because it was by itself.  Once I boarded the plane, I realized this seat was not by itself but there was two seats in that location (not as pictured when purchased).  I was not notified the plane had been downgraded therefore changing my seat to now be next to someone.  AA declined my refund stating I was still in upgraded seating.  Needless to say, I will avoid flying AA during this time."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,American Airlines Sucks,"American Airlines delayed our flight over an hour simply because they did not perform the necessary checks previous to the flight and therefore we were not able to fly on the airplane we originally boarded bc it was deemed unsafe, so we were unloaded and put onto a new plane all because American could not properly perform safety checks prior to the time we were supposed to departure."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Horrible - run away from this airline as fast as you can.,They made my mom who has a disability cry. Both Caucasian and African American female agents were rude and condescending to my mom and I. Take your money elsewhere. American Airlines is a disgrace. They do not care about you. They have ZERO humanity.
Date of travel: July 2020,20,"Rude Employees, Slow service",Employees are rude and snappy. Service as slow as it gets. They're about as friendly as a budget airline but with the price of a full service carrier. Would not recommend
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Horrible ,"Two flights, all delayed, communication was non existent and I missed my connecting flights. No one was at terminals to answer questions, stay away from American Airlines. They definitely are not American!"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"Left Underaged Girl’s Parents At Terminal, Worker Looked at Mother in the Eyes as Door Closed.","I am a 17 y/o girl flying to Florida from Ohio for the first time. My parents followed us as we boarded, we were the last group to board. Apparently, the guy shut the door on my mom and they just said, “We’re already set to leave.” Parents got there at the scheduled time for departure but me and my s/o got there first. Instead, they stalled the plane 12 mins to let us out but didn’t stall for 1 minute to unlock the door for my parents. I asked why open the door to let us out but not to let my guardian in? Worker replied “We have a process” in the nastiest tone. I would have been devastated if they forced me to stay on the plane."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,NEVER AGAIN,"I will never fly American Airlines again & as a 21 year old, there was a lot of miss opportunity. Even with calls from gate attendants during our short layover, they still would not let my dad and I on for arriving at 12:11pm when doors close at 12:10pm and departure is at 12:20pm. However, somehow our first flight was 15 minutes late due to boarding."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Checked baggage damage,"Just left the Lexington Kentucky airport and the baggage management was amazing. After noticing damage to a wheel on one of our checked bags, and a quick google search later, we asked management to fill out a liability report for the damage. She took note of the damage and rolled out an equal (if not better) piece of brand new luggge. She explained we could either swap the two or send ours in for “repair” & receive a new one at our address at a future date. We chose to switch then and there. She took info from us, was super nice & accommodating; the whole “ordeal” took less than 10 minutes. VERY PLEASED WITH THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE"
Date of travel: July 2020,40,First Pandemic Flight,"First pandemic flight.  Easy check in and TSA process (you now swipe your own ticket and lower your face mask so the TSA can check against photo identification). Airbus 319.  3-3 seating.  Plane was almost full.  Everyone had masks.  So I had a window seat (which is recommended to avoid coronavirus), but someone sat in the middle seat next to me.  No food or beverage service on the plane.  On time departure.  On time arrival.  Overall no surprises except that the plane was almost full."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service,"I booked a flight for my birthdat with American Airlines from O'Hara to Miami. It was suppose to be a girls trip but as you all probably know Miami has been shut back down. Yes, I chose to cancel the flight and they gave me a credit for 6 different travelers instead of a refund. Even though my group was not wanting the credit we still accepted it. However, I tried using my credit of $107 to book a flight to Denver for three people which totaled out to $148. I was willing to pay the difference (with the same card that was used the first time) but the customer service representative stated I would have to wait 14 business days for a voucher to come in the mail. I explained to the rep that will not work due to the price change the tickets can have by then or availability. They are not willing to compromise AT ALL I've been transfered to so many different people. I was told to go on the website and chat with someone just for them to tell me to call again. This is the worst experience I've ever had with an airline! It's enough Miami was shut down but now I have this Airline giving me a hard time and they are showing no sympathy towards my situation. PLUS, the ticket insurance was not available upon purchase so they have it set up to where people can not get a refund no matter the situation. I just want to book my flight and never deal with them again. Do not book with this airline they are unprofessional and the customer service is horrible!!"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Terrible Service! Never flying American again,"I’m so mad about the service we received!! Our first flight was delayed about 20 minutes. I’m not sure why, but we sat on the runway for a long while before we took off. We flew American Eagle for our first flight. Because of the limited space, they had to put our carry on bags under the plane. Once we landed, I headed to the next gate because we had a connecting flight. My husband waited there to get our bags. I got there right in time. They let 2 girls get on right in front of me, but I was waiting on my husband. He was running through the airport because our connection was in a different terminal. I told the employees at the gate that my husband was on his way, but they said nope...he wasn’t going to make it, and they were shutting the gate. The plane was still there, and the flight wasn’t leaving for 8 more minutes, and it was their fault that our flight was delayed!! They were so rude about it too! Now we are out $400 for the money we spent on our hotel at our destination. I have had such a terrible time with this airline. From now on, I refuse to fly American. If y’all are looking for a good, accommodating airline, I recommend Southwest. They would have held the door open a few minutes knowing that we were coming from a connecting flight! They are the best!!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,No Compassion,"We booked our flight before the covid-19.  Our flight suppose to flight out in June.  When the covid-19 announced, we panicked and worried about the safety of our family so we called to canceled our trip in April. They issued eticket instead gave us a refund.  We found out later that the actual flight got cancel. Recently, we loss our job so we try to reserve money. We called American Airline to get our money back.  We explained our situation to both the manager and the customer care team.  Instead of showing the compassion to our situation, they rejected our request.  They said ""Because you voluntarily canceled your flight, I must respectfully decline your refund request."" I won't recommend American Airline to anyone.  They showed no compassion to anyone.  They only care about making money instead the safety of other people.  Very bad customer service. Very disappointed..."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,Changed flight and didn't let me cancel,"Got a call from American saying my flight departure time had changed. The new time did not work for me, and they were unwilling to refund the ticket. I could get an airline credit, but this couldn't be used to book a flight with the other airlines that had flights at the times that worked for me. Very disappointed with American Airlines customer service."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Flights too FULL! Loading the passengers the WRONG WAY!,"I will say we flew Delta to FL, and American on the way home… Delta was the better option by far!! They’re only allowing 50-60% capacity and loading the passengers from the back to the front, vs American.. YUCK! On the way home we flew American, the plane was full and they loaded passengers front to back… So everyone was squished and walking past each other! If I was exposed to the coronavirus, it was on the plane ride home with American!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,"Disgusting, Terrifying","I flew business, never do this.  But during this pandemic we wanted as much space as possible.  Jammed flight, some without masks.  Flight attendants (what a job now) seemed miserable and robotic.  Only small screen entertainment options, minimal at best.  Hopefully never again.  Only flew as we had to get home to east coast."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Disastrous,"The transfer for suitcases broke and the ordeal I had to go through to get my suitcases checked in in another terminal was extremely unprofessional and exhausting after I traveled from the other side of the world during pandemic. The lines where LONG with people been right next to each other and wearing no masks. 5 months after my arrival I called American Airlines to cancel my return flight to Europe due to second Covid 19 wave and uncertainty regarding safety... All I got was double talking frustrated, completely careless rude, ignorant behavior... Since my flight was a bundle with British Airways, I called them and they refunded my return ticket, with exceptional customer service, incredibly polite, answering all my questions, a total Class Act. It's Mind blowing how this American Airlines representatives are able to keep their jobs. Thank you."
Date of travel: July 2020,40,"Better than expected, great job AA","Each flight experience is unique and no flight is the same.  I have had flights with satisfaction levels ranging from 0-10.  I was reluctant to travel during this global pandemic.  But after letting the idea settle I decided to travel to St John taking a direct flight from CLT.  However, AA changed my non-stop flight to a 1 stop flight with layover in MIA.  I was really disappointed about the situation.  But I did understand the reasons as AA is consolidating flights due to the pandemic.  Putting this particular issue aside, AA and it’s employees have done a great job to keep us safe during this pandemic.  Both flights were on time.  I believe they have put in place the proper check-in, onboarding, in-flight and disembarking procedures.  No issues on this trip.  Hopefully there are no issues on our way back."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Worst flight experience ever,I’m traveling with my 14 year old daughter and never again will I allow her to be subjected to the uncleanliness and rotten attitudes of the staff. And they don’t have a drink or food/snack service on a 3 and a half hour flight! And there was no time during layover to get anything because the first flight was so late (another American Airlines flight). This was supposed to be an amazing vacation getaway for my daughter who has never flown before. So thanks a lot for ruining that too aa.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,This is the truth about American Airlines commitment for customer safety,"We recently returned to Philadelphia from West Palm Beach Florida. We were very hesitant about flying during the pandemic, but after reading American Airlines commitment to passengers safety, We felt they were doing everything possible to ensure safety and decided to take the flight. My husband & I purchased 1st class seats in the first row. We decided we would be able to board last and exit first, which made us feel safer. When everyone was on board the flight attendant made an announcement stating that everyone’s face covering must be worn throughout the entire flight, and if not, you will be  banned from flying American Airlines in the future. This also gave us a sense of security! We noticed when we walked into the airplane the flight attendant didn’t have her mask over her face, she had it hanging around her neck. We realize that it takes a lot of getting used to and at times we may forget to cover up, however, this was not the case on our flight. Our 1st class attendant never once put her mask on her face for the 3 hours, she left all of us passengers at a health risk! I started a live chat with American Airlines from my phone while this was all happening to ask them what the protocol was for their flight attendants. The answer I received was that their flight attendants are required to wear a face covering, just like the passengers on every flight. I sent an email to their customer service and the answer was less than concerning over this incident. Seems to me the rules only apply to the passengers and not their employees. Thank you American Airlines for putting our health at risk!"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,American Airlines,American Airlines will steal your money without accommodating their customers who pay for their tickets. I had the worst experience with American Airlines. First I left my AirPods on the plane and 20 minutes after returning to recollect my items they were gone and there were only personnel on the plane. Then I attempted to change my flights during the current pandemic and they had no accommodations despite COVID-19 and made me stay in their unsanitary airport for hours. This I felt was irresponsible to risk public health for extra money. Completely unsatisfied and will never travel with American Airlines again.
Date of travel: June 2020,20,Not a great experience during COVID,I was surprised to find every seat of my flight filled during COVID outbreaks. Everyone had masks but proper use was not enforced. The airline did send an email before the flight saying that it would be busy and offered a flight change free of cost but I overheard a passenger in front of me saying she took advantage of that and was still rebooked on an overfilled flight. I don't think I'll be flying on an airline that doesn't leave middle seats open during COVID.
Date of travel: August 2019,10,Warning if you have to travel with a pet!,"I wanted to write this to warn others considering AA Pet services.  I wrote the company detailing my experiences and I have not received any kind of response.  This is a VERY abbreviated letter I sent to them.  My trip was from JFK to San Diego.  This all happened pre-covid. I have shipped pets before, so I know things must be done perfectly and had all required paperwork properly completed.  I used the website for pet requirements, had questions, and called the 1800 number. I got a very terse woman who told me she knew absolutely nothing about shipping pets and proceeded to read the ENTIRE website to me.  I called someone else and got the info I needed. Strike 1.The instructions told me the time and place to go to.  I was there in plenty of time.  After waiting 30 minutes for the VERY SLOW employee, someone else told me I was in the wrong place.  I was exactly where the instructions told me to be.  They said I was, but I should be somewhere else and this “happens all the time”.  Strike 2.This is where things REALLY turn nasty.  We got to the correct building and there was this person by the name of Yvette.  She proceeded to tell me I was too late.  I tried to show her what the problem was and that I was sent to the wrong place.  To make the story short – basically it was all my fault that I was sent to the wrong place and it WAS NOT her problem.  The supervisor, who was only ever referred to as ‘the supervisor”, came out to tell me the same thing and that it wasn’t their fault. There were raising their voices and, not to exacerbate the situation, I assumed the role of the grown-up and professional.  All they did was shout that it wasn’t their fault and not their problem.  Strike 3.I work in customer service and if I had EVER treated a paying customer like that, I would have been fired on the spot and probably thrown out into the street – and I would have deserved it!  There was absolutely no effort to try and find a solution to the problem, or even listen to the problem. This is an indicator of poor senior leadership, where employees are afraid for their jobs and are quick to shift blame instead of finding a solution.  I had to call the 800 number again to rebook and I showed up 4 hours early.  I was working with another employee who was very helpful until Yvette showed up again and said ‘Oh – you were here yesterday’.  Yes, in fact, I was.  The supervisor showed up and had cooled off enough to have a civil conversation.  Since I was finally able to get a word in edgewise, I explained to him what happened the day before and he was receptive to my explanation and then turned very civil and helpful.  He even complimented me on how level headed I was the day before.  I told him that acting like a jerk never solves anything, which Yvette could learn something from.We were moving along, until the note from the vet about temperature requirements.  As clearly stated on the website and the instruction email I received, that paper was required after May 1, and through certain cities, neither of which applied to my situation.That is when Yvette interjected herself and said ‘the customer doesn’t state what is required – we do’.  Now I need this other paper from the vet, just because Yvette says so.  It was as though she was doing everything she could do to make what was already a difficult process almost impossible for me. It took the vet a while to fax it.  Yvette sat there scowling at me and finally disappeared when it started looking like things were going to work out.  That is disgusting behavior from an employee.  The supervisor went along with all of this.  Who was in charge? – is what I ask.In San Diego, I went to the baggage assistance to find out where to pick up my cats.  I was told where to wait and that it would be a while. Pets were coming out, the employee there kept assuring me they would be coming.  After about 2 hours and watching pets come out from flights well after mine, AA Cargo called me and told me my cats had been there for 2 hours and where was I?  I said I was right where I was told to be.  Well – once again I was given the wrong place and I was supposed to be at the other end of another terminal.  I went to the cargo area and I explained to the gentleman behind the counter the situation and he said that ‘happens all the time and they should change it’.  Well – yeah!  But these men were nice, helpful, gave me some bottles of water for my cats and said they wished there was more they could do.  THAT is what customer service looks like.  Yvette could learn something here.Believe me - this is the very short version of what happened.  I cannot believe the treatment of a paying customer, and the level of service being given.  I fly all the time.  There are so many excellent choices out there.  With the unnecessary aggravation and drama, not to mention the added expenses of this experience and non-response to my complaint letter, I can’t think of any reason to EVER fly American Airlines again."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,American Airlines - No Communication Again,"Emailed earlier this month and on 12 July to Customer RelationsHow American Airlines functions to provide great service to its customers.  July 2019 (first few days of the month) -Booked roundtrip flights from Bogota to Miami to Milan for May 2020.March 2020 -Modified our flights due to COVID-19 and Italy not permitting flights; we changed our trip to October (as listed above).May 21, 2020 -Viewed flight information online - only listed the roundtrip flight to Miami (we received no communication from American Airlines that our flight to and from Milan was eliminated).We called and our roundtrip tickets were changed to flying from Bogota to Miami to London to Milan.June 28 - We called American Airlines because of the EU restrictions on Americans due to COVID-19 and knew if we waited until early July, we could rebook for May, 2021.July 3 - We called American Airlines and changed our flights to May, 2021. We booked roundtrip flights from Bogota to Miami to Milan. July 5 - We viewed our flight information - it now listed us flying from Bogota to  Miami to JFK to Milan.  In Miami, American Airlines gave us 24 minutes to go through Customs and make the connecting flight to JFK.  The return showed Milan to JFK to Miami.  In Miami, we would have to stay overnight and fly home the next evening (we again received no communication from American Airlines that this had taken place).  We called American Airlines (very early in the morning) and canceled our tickets after questioning the Customer Service Representative about if we would receive full refunds.  He assured us we would and helped us do this process online.In addition, we have incurred additional charges since we had modified hotels and tours relying on the American Airlines reservations we had made for May, 2021.Can you please tell us why anyone would consider ever flying American Airlines ever?We would have been flying with them May 2021 and that time line is not available, so I clicked on July 2020.  There are other flight numbers, but enough is enough with this horrible company."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Social distancing? Not!,"When I boarded the first leg of my trip, I was a little surprised at how crowded the American Eagle was.  I consoled myself by thinking, ""Well, they sure couldn't pull this off on a longer flight.""  I was dead wrong.  American Airlines had made the most money possible by filling every single seat on the plane.  We're talking breathing bad, possibly contagious, air made worse by the sardines-in-a-can approach that AA took.  We're talking sitting elbow to elbow with complete strangers.  We're talking practicing absolutely no social distancing boarding or leaving the flight. We're talking passengers completely ignoring the instructions of the attendants, knowing full well that nobody would correct them. Again, my naivete kicked in while vacationing as I convinced myself that the whole trip to Cancun must have been a fluke -- especially when my daughter, coming to Cancun on a different airline -- praised her airline because they did not fill the middle seats, and cleanliness seemed to be a priority. American Airlines would surely respond with a better approach.  Wrong again. The trip home on American was the same nightmare.  Lesson learned. I will never fly that airline again. They've lost a good customer."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"My son, soldier, was not allowed through the gate right after hey shut it when he was late from another flight.",My son coming home from deployment was late from another flight on American Airlines.  They were supposed to communicate to hold the gate.   He was there 2 minutes after they shut the gate.  The plane was still there.   They just did not want to wait just 2 minutes.  My son has not been home for a long time.  :(:( :(
Date of travel: July 2020,10,American COVID policies not consistent with country policies,"Scheduled flight from Columbus to Aruba for 1 week vacation on 19 June with the airline.  Aruba Tourism Authority indicated a negative COVID test was required to board the aircraft, 72 hours prior to departure and to be uploaded no less than 12 hours prior to flight - requirement based on being in Ohio, which is currently seeing spikes in the virus.  This guidance was provided after 1 July.  Given scheduled travel on a Tuesday, we were forced to move our flight because the 72 hour requirement put us into a weekend, with no testing.   NOTE:  I listed traveling in July 2020 - had to put something in the block - did not actually travel.After contacting American Airlines, they refunded the points and the taxes for the flight; however, they refused to refund the additional money paid for seating upgrades.  The point was made that Aruba required this test; and, there was no possible way to meet the 72 hour requirement; where American responded that it is not their policy to refund the additional funds because the flight was not cancelled.  However, we would have shown up and not been able to board, given the country requirements.  American responded with a statement indicating that it was Aruba's policy and not American's, even though we would not have been able to board; AND, all policies were instantiated AFTER we bought the tickets - beyond our control.I am attaching the content of the email from the Aruba Tourism Authority below:Bon dia, hope all is well.Thank you for contacting us. In regards to your question:Correct.  To complete your online ED card process, it will require you to either have uploaded your results or opted to the test on-island (note again that exceptions apply to the list that was sent earlier today). After doing so, you will receive a confirmation that you need to show to the airline at the time of check-in, as they will request this in order to be able to check you in.  So if you did not include your negative results or opt for the on-island test, you will not receive a confirmation.  We know that labs/ facilities may not open on certain days, such as weekends, hence we have the option to test on-island.  What state are you residing in? (Note if you are residing in one of the states listed, that the system will automatically reject if you opt for the on island testing). Let us know if you have any further questions.Masha danki, thank you – warm greetings from the 'one happy island'.We will find another airline to travel with in the future....NEVER American Airlines, again.  I have been a customer with them for almost 20 years and have the executive card; and, am a member of their Admiral's Club - all of which will will be discontinued from this moment.  The refund would have been on the order of a couple of hundred dollars; AND, we would have re-spent the funds to re-book a few days later to meet the testing requirements.American Airlines should do the business case analysis on the impact of their policy to their bottom line - pretty sure they are going to lose more than a couple of hundred dollars in the long run.  If I need to travel, I will find another airline, travel by car, rail, or WALK before I set another toe on their aircraft."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,one of if not the worst airline to travel.,One of the worst experiences I have ever had from an airline. From the attitudes of the employees to the cleanliness. I will be sure to avoid this company at all costs.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Horrendous,"This airline is terrible. They took no precautions for Covid other than requiring a mask. No temperature checks and no distancing. Every seat on both flights was filled. Our return flight was canceled without any notification, which caused us to be stranded another night in Boston. We had children we were due to puck up that day so this created a huge crisis and cost us another 250.00 in hotel fees. I was signed up for text alerts and they had my email and phone number but didn't have the courtesy to contact me about this cancellation. We talked to several agents and received different stories about what happened. They did everything they could to deflect the blame. Very poor business practices. Customer service is useless and rude. I will never fly American again."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"Don't do it, you will regret it.",What a total nightmare. American airlines has the absolute worst Customer service. Everyone we encountered was extremely rude. We flew out of Orlando no issues. Coming back the ladies that scan your tickets at LAX gave us a hard time about our luggage. The attended did not see my 5 year old son and was trying to say we had too many bags that exceeded the limit. I KINDLY  told her oh no ma'am I'm sorry these are my sons he just can't roll them hence the reason I was wheeling two bags. Then she presumed to make up excuses that they were too big. I said no maam they meet the requirements and I picked them up and placed them in the luggage checker she didn't like that and told me the plane had too many bags and we would have to check the bags. I told her rudely at this point NOPE Not gonna happen I was group 5 and sitting in row 15. Hence the plane was not yet full.  She was mad that I got her and she did not want to be wrong. After getting on bored with my luggage and switching planes in North Carolina I had received a text saying my connecting flights gate was changed i just wanted to confirm so as we came off the plane I asked the lady at the american airlines desk she legit rolled her eyes like I was just bothering her. I will never fly american airlines. Ps. There planes have no charging ports nor a TV for entertainment so if you are taking a long flight make sure you have a battery backup pack. I highly recommend you stay far away from american airlines avoid it like it has the RONA.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Poor social distancing,Do not fly American if you don’t feel safe with a packed plane. They are filling the middle seats to make money.   My experience with another airline is that middle seats are left empty.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,COVID 19 Runs Rampant,"No cleaning was done before we boarded and after the previous flight deplaned. Not one min. of hesitation between last passenger to deplane and first passenger to board new flt. Dirt and grime in every crack, on every ledge.... I wiped touchable areas with alcohol wipe. It turned black. No distancing of passengers; every seat was filled. Yet, they threaten to forever ban any passenger not wearing a face covering and advertise non-stop their thorough deep cleaning. Liars! No food or drink provided. Oh, wait...a small bag og graham crackers...cost $715"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Masks not used by crew members on long haul flight,"Flew American to the UK and back to Dallas after going back to London to deal with the aftermath of my mothers death from Covid-19.Had a crew member who refused to wear a mask. Passengers are informed that without a mask they will be unable to fly and  possibly banned from flying American, but crew refuse to wear the thing."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Shame on you!,"ZERO stars. American Airlines pretends to care about your health and safety but they allow prominent senators, FROM TEXAS NO LESS, to go maskless on the flight. Everyday civilians are DRAGGED off the flight for not wearing masks but this guy gets a pass? Shame on you!"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,American Airlines is not following recommended Social Distancing Guidelines,"My 16 year old minor child was flying as an unaccompanied minor.  When I checked his baggage in at the service desk I inquired about how the airline was enforcing social distancing.  The airline representative informed me that the flight was almost at capacity and the airline did not have a protocol for distancing its passengers.  The second leg of my sons trip he at full capacity and he was seated between two other passengers, one of which was a minor child who carried two buckets of chicken onto the plane.  In order to eat the food, this passenger had to remove their mask potentially exposing other passengers.  If that is not bad enough, the passenger while eating and not wearing a mask, drooled on my son.  This entire experience with American Airlines was extremely uncomfortable.  During a time when our country is exposed to a potentially life threatening virus, why wouldn't an airline take precautions to protect their passengers.  It is very disturbing, especially when other airlines are taking the pandemic seriously and ensuring their passengers safety by socially distancing.  Needless to say, my son will not be flying American on his return trip."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Never again,"We went to Cancun . Bags were two Days late. When we got them things were missing . Sunglasses , perfume . Nothing crazy expensive but enough to make us mad . We called American Airlines . They said when you go the the airport for your return trip you need to file a form . Of course when we got to airport they said we only had 24 hours to make a claim. We got played . Will never travel American Airlines again. Very dirty business"

Date of travel: July 2020,10,American Airlines - THE NO COMMUNICATION AIRLINE,"I booked these flights on November 19, 2019.I called American Airlines numerous times and was assured and told there were no problems with my flights through Miami, Florida to Raleigh, North Carolina.This morning, July 13, 2020, I called and was told my flight from Bogota to Miami had been canceled.  They never communicated anything to us about this taking place.This is the second time we had to cancel flights with American Airlines where we experienced this issue of no communication being sent to us.We have, again, incurred costs canceling hotels due to American Airlines negligence.I have sent another complaint to American’s customer service - they did the same thing to us last week with an illegal connection of 24 minutes and booked us returning and having to stay overnight - NO COMMUNICATION FOR THESE FLIGHTS EITHER — requesting they explain to us why this takes place and what they are going to do in the future to assure this does not take place again.Hopefully, I will hear from you and you can tell me why and what can be done to assure this does not happen again. The flights were for September 1.  The trip advisor site does not permit me to enter September 2020 for When Did You Travel.  I entered July, 2020.Andrew Billetz"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Bad experience on American Airlines regarding Covid.,"Bad experience on American flight.  The requirement that passengers wear masks was not enforced. I spoke with a flight attendant twice about a woman and child not wearing masks 2 rows in front of me.   Although I feel I was not upset, she told me to calm down. Once she told the woman masks were required.   As soon as the flight attendant left, the woman removed it.  Ten minutes later, I told this to the flt attendant. A general announcement was made, which the woman ignored. I told the fat attendant, I wanted to change my seat, and the announcement said if anyone wanted to change seats, an attendant would be walking through the cabin This never happened. In fact, during the flight, the flt attendants were barely visible at all. They wanted through the cabin twice at the very end of the flight to collect garbage.   On my way out of the plane, I stopped to speak to the flt attendants, and it was clear they did not care about the safety of the passengers. They were close to being rude and not at all helpful.  Finally, the pilot brought me to an American worker in the terminal.  She told me the only thing I could do was go on their web site and write a complaint. This woman said it was not her department, so she couldn't help me.  Overall, American Airlines has very lax safety practices, even though the web site says masks are required. No enforcement.  The attitude of the American employees I encountered was one of total  lack of concern for the health and safety of the passengers."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"Never again AA, truly disappointed","Terrible customer service. Family of 5 at gate B46 tonight with Kenneth Wallace, supervisor. We RAN to our gate because no fault of our own, our flight was delayed. Arrived at AA gate B46, fuselage wasn’t closed when we got there however we were denied entry. Kenneth and fellow employees were of no help. It’s 9:00 PM, work comes at 6:30 AM and we now have a 5 hour drive.I would not recommend AA to anyone, will pay more to NOT use this company. One would think during this time, they would appreciate and accommodate customers, yet don’t get your hopes up. It’s not the case. Never again American Airlines. You’ve ruined our family vacation but I’m not sure that you’re too concerned. Never again. You don’t need our business."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Social distancing is a joke,"Seriously, they tell you to spread out in groups yet they split you up from the people you live with and pack you in rows including the middle seats with random people. Seriously?! It’s laughable how much they don’t care about their customers. If I didn’t have to be somewhere this last weekend, I wouldn’t have flown American. Seriously the worst customer service. I hope Delta stops cancelling flights so I never have to travel American Airlines again."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,DIRTY THEY HAVE NO RESPECT OF COVID19,"guys i booked this flight 2-3 days before my travel as it was empty. They never informed me in advance that this DIRTY flight is at FULL CAPACITY. They are ridiculous and they are all about money. I NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO fly with them and i think they should go OUT OF BUSINESS. The whole flight industry needs to change, they are ridiculous and have 0% safety policies.Never fly with united again period."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Worst Airline ever,Horrible experience over all and still waiting a full week later from Complaints department and refund. So here's what happened. My flight got delayed. No biggie cause I had a 4.5 HR layover. It then got further delayed which would have caused me to miss my connecting flight. So they put me on another flight to Dallas. Ok sweet ill still be home tonight. We all Board the plane and we get to the runway and sit there and sit there and sit there. Captain comes on says there's an issue with weather. Gonna be about 10 min. Ok cool no big deal just inconvenient.  An hour later were pulling back into the terminal. At this point I'm missing my connecting flight that's now in Dallas fort worth. So I speak to the staff and she informs me that at this point I'm either going to be stuck here or stick in Dallas Fort Worth. She said I need to go ask the service desk what to do from there. Im a little worried and nervous at that point but ok. They'll prob get me a hotel or something cause that's what airlines do. Im standing in line There's about 10-12 people ahead of me. All on that flight. next thing you know we're all being yelled at top either get on the plane or stay. At this point i still have no idea what to do. I try to ask the employees and they just keep telling me either get on or stay. I talk then I can't get stuck i need to be home. Basically got a we don't care. Either get on the plane or stay in line. I literally break down full on panic attack. Im clearly in distress instead of answering my questions I'm being yelled at. Im so upset I call John cause I have no idea what to do and he's pretty good at talking me down from a panic. There's still 5 people ahead of me from the same flight. Its full on chaos and all of a sudden the desk help literally walked off and never came bank. Then the doors shut. Not permitted on the flight. So again full on panic attack and no one would help me. Except John on the phone and then 1 person that was in line that had me go sit down and she held my place. I finally calm down slightly. I get up there and the man that was utterly rude and yelling at me rebooks my flight for in the morning. And basically tells me to get the hell out of the line. I asked about a hotel they said no. I asked where will my luggage be. He says in Tampa. I said how it getting to Tampa He said on the connecting flight. I said I won't make the connecting flight it leaves in less than an hour from Dallas and I'm still standing here. He then so rudely tells me he told me to get on the plane because they were delaying the connecting flight. NOT ONCE DID ANYONE EVER SAY THIS OR I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BACK ON THE PLANE. They told me I was either stuck here or in Dallas. So because no one would communicate or answer anyones questions I was sent on my way with a we don't care where you sleep that night.after all of that i still had issues on the rescheduled flight. I had to run from one side of the airport (and I am not in good health) only to make it right before the doors closed. Then when I got to tampa more issues finding my baggage. Have heard nothing back from AA despite numerous emails and phone calls.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Small plane packed full.,"Small plane packed full.759557787I booked this flight months in advance, prior to the pandemic. Two weeks before the flight, I received a phone message that the flight was cancelled. I called the airline, since I had already paid to re-book. Our non-stop flight was on June 29, 2020. I was told that there were no direct flights and had to stop in either Dallas or Charlotte. Then the agent said he found a direct flight, so I took it. When I received confirmation the date was JULY 29, not June 29. I had to call again and wait on-hold and spend another hour re-booking. They found me a direct flight on June 30 instead, so then I also had to change the date of my rental car.Arriving at the gate for departure, we found that the flight was fully booked. It was a small plane with only 2 seats on each side of the aisle. My wife and I did not get to sit together. She was in row 14, I was in row 20. I had to sit next to a large woman who took up her seat and 25% of my seat as well. I could not lower the armrest between us of course, so her body was in full contact with mine. Wearing masks were mandatory for the entire flight, and no drinks or snacks were given. A few people took their masks off during the flight and the flight attendants said nothing. After being packed in like sardines in a tin can, they said ""due to required social distancing, you will remain seated and depart one row at a time"". Sounds like a bad joke, but it was not."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,No commitment to have passengers wear masks,"No commitment to have passengers wear masks - directly in line with the lax approach American Airlines employees take while boarding priority customers, they had to take the same approach to enforcing masks on flights. During this flight from Miami to Denver American Airlines employees made no effort to have people put masks on. Contrast that with the flight home on frontier, frontier employees continuously in a nice pleasant way reminded passengers to wear masks. American Airlines obviously needs new lead ship to fix what broken and get rid of employees that are not committed to the success of the company!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,"Crappy Airline, cramped, poor service, in flight entertainment filled with AA commercials","airline sucks, late departures, crammed plane during the COVID crisis!  Delta makes sure you have empty seats around you and gives you wipes to do extra cleaning..NOT American, crammed in like an old greyhound bus.  Thankfully I fly 99% with Delta, gave up on american years ago, thought I'd give them another try during the COVID time, NOPE NEVER going back....still suck.  Also, the in flight entertainment is constantly interrupted with American airlines commercials!   Total BS!  Thankfully other airlines do not do this,"
Date of travel: July 2020,30,First trip since COVID 19,"This is my first flight on American Airlines in over 5 years, and first flight since COVID 19 took over the world.  I am a Delta member, but they didn’t have any flight out of my area on the day of my departure.  So that made me pick American from Fayetteville, N.C. to San Antonio, Texas.  The first leg of the flight was not too bad about 25 minutes from Fayetteville to Charlotte. The second leg was not as nice.  I did fly first class and the seats were not comfortable at all.  The seats were large with a lot of leg room; however the lumbar support was very uncomfortable.  The other thing that was a little annoying was no TV screens in the seats.  We even had a newer plane returning from San Antonio and it didn’t have TV screens, so make sure you bring a device to watch the free movies/TV they offer.  Staff was very helpful.  There was a young lady and her baby sitting near me and the flight attendant gave her some special attention, as well as taking care of the rest of the passengers in first class.  American thanks for having a flight available for my trip, and ensuring everyone was safe on board. I would only book another flight if my normal airlines doesn’t have flights.  Mask are required to be worn during the entire trip!"
Date of travel: May 2020,50,Trip to Mexico,Straight flight to California - enjoyed the ability to watch things on the screen -- made trip go by a lot faster to have this option.  Also the screen that showed the progress of the flight was very nice to know how much time you had for your trip - with the time changes- it was hard to remember since our phones were on Airplane mode.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Terrible flights may be cheap but not worth it,Terrible just terrible my flight has been delayed because of mechanical issues I have a connetor flight. Originally I had a straight shot but the airlines called and said that they were changes to the flight. I swear never had an issue with United it delta but flying american it has been awful never will I ever fly with this airlines again and the hostess were rude
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Worse experience,"So the flight number 1198 was returned back to SFO , AFTER takeoff because the windshield was broken . Then we were transferred to flight 2904 with no social distancing and sat in airplane and now this airplane has defective valve so air conditioning is not working and we are waiting for plane to be repaired.What the $&@#  is going on ?"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,They will not refund tickets.  They website has created a loop.  You and not speak with anyone.,"American Airlines kept our refund request under review for more than 10 days, then refunded us the amount of the preferred seats only.  $38.60.  They did not give us a refund for the tickets.  Trying to contact them is impossible.  They created a loop.  The website gives you a contact number for refunds and the contact number refers you to the website.  They have literally stolen our money."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Worse Airlines Ever,"Flight was delayed and caused us to miss our connection. Had to fly to different airport and drive five hours to get to our final destination. Ended up having to pay over $350 for the new rental car since we never made it to our original airport. American does not care whatsoever. No apologies, no compensation, nothing.  About to fly back home and tried to move our flight up a couple hours in case they delay us again, we would have a backup option. They have seats on the earlier flight but want $200 extra for each ticket to be put on that flight. I would NEVER use this airline again. Go ahead and use this if you want to be nickel and dimed to death and end up with the worse service ever."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,"Terrible company, terrible customer service. Fly with anyone else.","So I went on the American airlines site to book a flight, put in all my information and went to complete transaction. Then when I submit my payment,the website tells me tells me to unable to connect to servers, try again or try again later. So I resubmit it, get the same response. I needed to book a flight asap, so I assumed payment hadn't gone through and booked with delta instead with no problems at all. I was on family vacation mind you, so wasnt checking emails, didn't think I needed a reason to. Sure enough, the payment automatically went through regardless, after the fact I'd already booked a different flight with delta. My card was charged the day before the flight, which is how I noticed when I checked my card balance. The delta flight I payed for AFTER the trouble I had with their website charged my card two days prior. So how did a flight I attempted to book before the one I successfully booked with delta, get charged to my card a day after the delta flight? So realizing I had actually purchased two tickets, I immediately went to the airport to speak with an American airlines associate. There was no one working the desk. So after finally getting through with customer relations on the phone, I was told initially that I could get a full refund, then almost immediately told they actually wouldn't be able to because the flight has to be canceled a full day before departure. So after their website told me my purchase was unsuccessful two times, they took the money off of my card somehow after the fact anyhow. Seems like a scam if anything, I can't believe they can get away with that. Probably even worthy of a lawsuit. As if times arent hard and money isnt tight enough right now as is without getting that happening. I was so livid, the lady from customer relations said I could make a more detailed complaint expressing the complication I had with their website and my card being automatically charged, so I did. Got a response email saying they had received my complaint and I'd be hearing back from someone shortly. Nearly two weeks later, not a word or email from anyone from American airlines. So needless to say I will never fly with this company again. Will book with anyone else but them and will encourage anyone else flying to do the same."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Avoid flying with this airline!,"Not only once, but twice has this airline screwed us over just within the past month alone. Had a trip from ROC to FLL that ended up with a small mechanical error with one of the overhead compartments. We were delayed hours and I missed my connection resulting in not only missing a funeral service but sitting in the airports for an additional 8-9 hours. No customer service number offered and only online claims. Finally received a response in which I got a measly apology. Now moving on to the second trip which was just completely canceled by them and rescheduled from an evening flight to a morning flight including adding a 4-hour layover which was not previously there. My boyfriend and I scheduled an evening flight so we could still work that day and not use additional vacation days. Upon contacting customer relations online once again, another measly apology with no reparations! Although an apology is needed, this company is not willing to make their customer happy in any other way whether it be miles, refunds, whatever. This is why I will absolutely never fly with them again!"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Honorable customer service,"Our AA flight was delayed, but we were told that we would still all make counting flights. I double checked when we landed and were assured. We sprinted to the gate, and were 9mins early. The gate closed infron of us as we ran up. The desk clerk said they couldn't help us. Would book us for a open flight and said we would have to wake two days. So... if you want to trave please don't use them."

Date of travel: July 2020,10,"Not worth the risk, shameful flight experience","Yeah there is a global pandemic, but it should be your goal to provide a smart way forward.  This flight experience and other flights like it will only contribute to the easy transmission of covid19 through your greedy and untimely efforts.  There was little signage, direction or difference from an ordinary flight say 5 years ago.  People wore masks, but other than a simple direction to wear masks little was done for social distancing or other measures.  People were crammed in, no effort to board plane differently, and no difference getting off.  If you don’t get coronavirus on the plane or in the airport I would be very surprised.  Passengers were rude and had no common sense.  American needed to explicitly tell passengers how to behave because it was obvious nobody cared.  Even though this was the cheapest ticket ever purchased for a flight it was a horrible buy.  They make you seem like when you book you can change tickets to other flights at no cost, but they fail to mention there are no other flights available because everyone is already on your flight getting sick.  Worst time in history to fly and this airline is the absolute worst of the lot.  Fly anyone else, even United or some lame budget carrier.  My wife had a decent experience on Delta and Southwest and Alaska seem to care about the customer.  Still don’t fly period.  It’ll be the death of someone."
n/a,10,Cancelled flight.,They cancelled flight. Promised full refund. Refused to refund. They want me to use Airline credit. I already rebooked with them because they lied to me saying this flight would be refunded. Never will I fly American after these flights unless they change and right the wrong. I'm letting it known wherever I can!
Date of travel: July 2020,20,"Book one itinerary, get another. Get seated separately from other members on your booking. Won't be booking again.","Since when can airlines change your trip on you? Our original flight had a one hour layover arriving mid day and they changed us to a four hour layover arriving at night, our flight was 5 hours and now our travel time was doubled. When they notified me of a ""flight change"" I guess I was wrong to assume we stayed with at least something that resembled our original purchase. I don't go to the cafe ordering a latte and am okay with getting a chai nor am I okay with this airline completely switching what I booked and blaming it on me for not checking when they CHANGED what I booked.They seated us far apart. How is sitting with the passenger you booked with a luxury that requires paying for? Just ridiculous. As I write this another couple who booked priority had their seats changed to sitting on opposite ends of the plane.Now American Airlines has a bunch of couples that they literally separated and sitting next to other couple's other half during a pandemic. Wouldn't it have made sense to keep me next to the person I already share germs with? Unlike United Airlines they didn't provide wipes to wipe down your seats either.For being a middle class airline I am thoroughly discouraged about their business practices.Proceed with caution and double check their emails when they say your flight has changed. And double check your boarding pass as they have likely changed your seat from when you checked in online.Don't bother picking out an itinerary or seats since they will be changed anyways, and probably for the worst.I won't be booking with them again."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Worst flying experience in my life.,"A 1hr flight took 10hrs, had to switch planes because of a mechanical, didn’t give us any food even though we were on the plane all day, missed connecting flight, missed an extra day of work,  animals home alone now Because the sitter didn’t know we’d be gone an extra day, completely understaffed at the service help desk, service help people actually left to pass out fliers while 100’s of people waited in line, and  flight attendants were rude. Oh wait we finally got a hotel and $12 whole dollars to use on food. These people should be cutting me a check for $2k with all this crap they put me through."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Horrible,They packed the plane and when flyers dont wear mask and huffing the employees ignore it. When I asked the attendant to say something the other party tried to fight me and attendant still while just happening 2 be in the middle ignored it.

The flight was packed and no one enforces the mask rule. The attendants don’t check and don’t tell people to wear masks. Avoid American Airlines and any American carrier if you can. There is a reason why the USA has a Covid19 problem. Hypocrisy, ignorance and creed."
Date of travel: June 2020,20,no customer service,"I completely agree with what other travelers are saying about their lack of screening or care for the coronavirus.  there was zero social distancing or even something as simple as hand sanitizers.  but what really upset me was that they were understaffed and had no concern for getting people to and from their destinations in a timely manner.  the gate person was manning more than one gate, and decided to board another flight ahead of ours making us so late that we missed our connection, and had to rent a car and drive the remaining 6 hours home with 3 kids.  there was no concern for this, and when I complained I got a response of ""I'm sorry we let you down"" and no attempt to remedy the situation.  I usually fly southwest and am always happy there--only flew this due to the fact that the flight i needed was not available thru southwest.  Will only fly american air in the future if in desperation!!! It's not worth the stress."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,AA has chosen business before safety,"I was horrified when I arrived and realized that AA has booked every seat: no social distancing, no health screening of passengers even when leaving a hot spot for COVID 19 (Arizona), no monitoring of mask usage while in flight.  I felt so sorry for the flight attendants who have to work to ""pay the bills"" and did not seem to have training on appropriate mask usage for infection control.  I even felt sorry for the first class passengers who had the ""privilege"" of boarding first only to have a crowded line of people going to economy breathing on them with wonky masks on."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Worst Airline Ever,"This has to be the worst airline ever.  They wont give you a glass of ice or a soda but have no problem giving it to first class.  The had no ac on the plane for 45 minutes, nothing to drink, and warned all passage to social distance from the employees yet they had no problem that they wont do it for their customers.  They jammed packed the plane and decided not to service their customers with cold drinks or a/c.  Shame on American Airlines.

Date of travel: June 2020,10,Disaster in the Sky,"We had to take a very short notice journey down to AZ as my mother was passing away, and purchased flights (two) on Delta to get there, then our return was with American to get home 11 days later. The Delta flights (both) had attendants offering us antiseptic wipes to further wipe down our seat, tray table, etc, and American offered nothing. Also, Delta did a great job of selling only about 50% of the plane capacity to keep people safe during this pandemic, but American, as we were shocked to see, had sold every LAST SEAT on this flight! We were crammed together like sardines, with NO regard to personal safety during this dangerous time, and especially leaving Phoenix Airport, which is one of the three major cities in the U.S. with fastest increase in new cases of Covid-19. This was done, very likely, due to nothing more than corporate greed to sell more seats. We feel that American Airlines has little regard for personal health and safety of their passengers. We're done with AA!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,"If it's nightmare travel you want, this airline is for you","AA stranded my family in 2 different cities in 2 days due to delayed flights with mechanical issues. As I write this, they're still not home. Will it be 3 cities in 3 days? Simply unbelievable, but perhaps this is why AA is consistently ranked as the worst airline in America."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,Flying home from Texas.,"I flew home yesterday from Texas to NY on American Airlines - flight AA1011. While the airplane itself seemed clean, and the flight attendants were friendly, the flight itself was substantially booked in terms of passengers. Now, I think it goes without saying that amid the pandemic, especially coming from Texas that is now seeing it's surge in cases, the flight should NOT have been that full. My entire row was booked, as were many others, and I sat next to a young woman who had her mask off for majority of the ride (which was only three and a half hours) as she was eating. When she wasn't eating, she was watching a show on her phone, with her mask off. While you can't tell someone not to eat, I still think it defeats the purpose of safety on the aircraft considering the circumstances of the virus. In addition, although I had my PPE on, I would think that if it were a shorter flight like this one, the airlines should make it a policy so that eating and drinking were prohibited. If this can't be done for reasons that are circumstantial for specific individuals, then the airlines should not book to almost full capacity. I found out half way through the flight, that there maybe were available seats towards the front of the aircraft. At that point, I had already been exposed to the woman next to me and to any potential health risks that came with sitting next to someone who does not have their mask on. About half an hour before landing a stewardess came by, noticed the young woman next to me, and kindly asked her to put her mask on. I feel as though there should have been a greater effort by the attendants to make sure everyone was complying with the rules on the flight, yet everything seemed to be said last minute. I know many people may see this and think that I am taking my experience too seriously. But, when you have lost people in your family back to back from the virus, I think it goes without saying how much being exposed to certain conditions can enrage you. Even though I knew flying home was taking a risk unto itself, I had no choice. Additionally, some may say that going to ""extremes"" such as prohibiting eating/drinking on short flights is unnecessary. I disagree; allowing people to freely eat and drink and talk with their masks off in ANY kind of closed quarters only helps promulgate confirmation bias. The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and observation of others not taking it seriously anymore will only confirm what others wish to be true - that the virus does not exist anymore. They are wrong. American Airlines should have been doing a better job, especially coming from states that are now seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Cheap ticket? WRONG!

Explain to me why a button someone pushes to say i have it or I dont is non refundable?! This did not cost AA any money its just a way to steal $50 from people like you and me, because they can.And where will that $50 dollars go?

Date of travel: July 2020,10,Former Elite Status - Switching Allegiances,"I have flown on AA - a lot. My reasoning was that they are the biggest and therefore offered the most opportunities to get to where I want to go, when I want to go there. After several years of experiencing countless delays, cancellations, and frustrations with policies and procedures that blatantly put the interest of the customer on the bottom shelf, and the interest of revenue above everything else, I gave up. I let my Elite Status lapse, and I’m now trying to use my last remaining miles to get to Athens, Greece, and they've pulled the classic bait-and-switch. Web Special evaporated after flight cancelled, and now I’m faced with spending somewhere between 3 and 8 times as many miles, and 50 times more in taxes and fees, to get to my destination. Classic. At least half the trips I have taken on AA have involved getting screwed in some way or other. I’m done. No more."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Customer Service HORRIBLE!!,"I had a flight booked from Chicago to Jackson hole in July. Apparently my flight there was cancelled and I was never notified that the flight was cancelled!!!! Called American Airlines and their rep told me that the flight was canceled and I asked about surrounding airports, if they had any flights on the same day, the rep said yes but I would have to pay a different fee due to not flying out of Chicago. I asked why is that when you (American Airlines) canceled my flight and didn’t notify me the least you can do is switch my flight to another airport so I can still make the flight that day, my returning flight is still the same. I asked to speak to the supervisor, Sam, I believe was his name. SUPER RUDE and when I asked who received my money for the tickets because I had booked through Hotwire he hung up on me!!!!!! Worst airline ever!!!! WILL NEVER BOOK WITH THEM EVER!!!"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Ms.,"Do not fly American Airlines unless you want to go ahead a get COVID 19. I am sitting on the plane now with passengers that do not have their mask on and the flight attendants say nothing. Every seat is booked. We are packed in like sardines. The confirmation I received from my travel agent showed our family sitting together, but that was not the case when we got our tickets. Will not fly with them again. Safety is not a priority for American Airlines!!!"
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Pleasantly surprised,"I have avoided American (and United) like the plague for years because every experience with either managed to be worse than the last. When I’d have no choice but the fly them, I would pad my trips by 24 hours to account for the inevitable delay, cancelation, and/or missed connection that would leave me stranded overnight. The few times I made it to my destinations, my checked bags wouldn’t...So today’s flight was my first American flight in years. I had no choice because Covid rearranged the flights I would normally take with another carrier.And I have to say I was impressed. Most importantly, both flights were early. Getting stuck overnight in a layover city is annoying during the best of times, during a pandemic it could be awful. Grateful it didn’t happen. Kind of sad that getting paying passengers where you were paid to take them at the time to said you would warrants praise, but these days it does. But the reason I’m writing the review was for the awesome flight attendant handling the First Class  (it didn’t cost much more to upgrade, I’m not some oil tycoon or movie star slumming it while their own jet is in the shop).His name was Magnum—no joke; and he was as awesome as his name. Incredibly attentive service. Also hustle to get people seated quickly because he said we had a narrow window for takeoff and didn’t want us to miss it.He managed to professionally manhandle the folks that in the back that lacked the spatial reasoning ability to fit their bags in the overhead while they stood in the aisle trying every combination over and over again except the right one. Anyway, thanks to Magnum and all the folks that got me where I was going on time, I am willing to give American another shot. To;dr: used to hate American, but awesome flight attendant named ‘Magnum’ was so great I will give the brand another chance. Give the man a raise!"
Date of travel: June 2020,20,"Might as well spend the extra money to fly other airlines, you'll end up spending it anyway.","1. Packed plane during Covid they were asking for volunteers to forfeit seats for vouchers because the flight was oversold. 2. The plane wasn't loaded from back to front as stated on their website.Just business as usual for AA3. Damaged carry on luggage after gate check4. Poor customer service5. This is the 2nd time I've had a bad overall experience with this airline. They've fooled me twice, shame on me.After returning our rental car my boyfriend and I were turned away after arriving at 1:20pm 10 minutes after the 90 minute cut off for a 2:40pm flight. There were no lines at customs nor TSA and the plane arrives at the airport at 1:50 so it was not loaded with any luggage and boarding hadn't started yet. Moreover I was placed on standby for a flight departing for the following day which I was also not able to get on because the flight was filled. I was forced to spend $80 in roundtrip transportation and $200 to stay at a local hotel in hopes of being able to fly yhe following day. After being put on standby and turned away the second time in a row the only choice I had was to purchase flights to Puerto Rico and another to New York at a cost of $997 and spending $1300 to get home and avoid getting turned away for a 3rd time in a row. Most other airlines at the very least offer confirmed seats for an extra fee which would've paid since I was unaware of the cutoff time, AA just expects you to wait on standby."
Date of travel: June 2020,20,Damaged luggage and ZERO social distancing,"My suitcase was damaged and I was told they didn't have any to give me and suggested I file a claim when I get back to Dallas.  When I got back, I was told they, too, were out of luggage and to come back to the airport with empty suitcase.  Neither the lady in Pensacola or the gentleman in Dallas offered to assess the damage and at least start the claim and I was just told on the phone that I had to get back to the airport within 24 hours and I cannot get there today.  I spent $60.00 taking that suitcase to my destination and back and now also have to buy new luggage. For that reason alone, I will never fly American again. Even more surprising though was the fact that my flights were booked solid and there was ZERO social distancing."

Why bother? We were packed in like sardines, no food or beverage (infection issue). The man next to us wore his mask under his chin. The stewardess walked past him 4 times ""to make sure we were wearing masks"" and to collect trash. I would have to be desperate to use this airline again. Also, the dining area in the terminal was filthy"
Date of travel: June 2020,20,Just a Sh*t show.,"This was our first experience with American... We knew and understand that the Scamdemic covid is changing how things are.. but that is no reason to have lackluster poor service on a premium seat, on boarding we were handed a paperbag with a bottle of water and a cookie, asked to sit down in our seat.... no food service, minimal drink service... just a bus ride, the front of the airplane was operated the same as the back of the airplane.. not too excited for our ride back.... its sad american wont be keeping another set of travelers for routine revenue."

Date of travel: May 2020,10,An Exercise in Frustration,"I had three days only to go see my brand new granddaughter.  My flight was from Albany to Philly and on to Nashville.  The employees could not figure out on the first leg if there were supposed to be 40 or 41 passengers on the plane....causing them to sit at the gate for an hour and a half...causing some of us to miss our connections in Philadelphia.  I had to sit in Philly for 7 hours waiting for an available flight and then after paying extra for a window seat on original flight in hopes of separation from others due to the virus I had to sit in the aisle seat right next to someone. This was on 5/28/20.  Also, the plane did not seem very clean and there was no social distancing.  When I applied for a refund of the fee I paid for a window seat I received a portion of it."

Covid or no covid, the passenger next to me dumped her throw up bag on my seat 20 minutes into a 2 hr and 20 minute flight. The male flight attendants handed me napkins with alcohol on them to ""clean up,"" I scrubbed my leggings with soap and water to try to get as clean as possible, praying I didn't get sick. Afterwards found out there is no blankets even in first class so I had to sit on napkins with wet pants the rest of my flight. Americans response ""sorry I didn't make it to the restroom quick enough, and we're flying at 85% capacity, hope your next flight is better"" no refund for my checked bags, no miles back, no voucher. What a trash of a company, hopefully you are one of the airlines that goes under, because you definitely don't care about your passengers."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Disappointing in every way,"Flight between TPA and DFW was packed both ways (with no prior notice to customers to rebook), little opportunity to social distance.  Their website does not show 'blocked' seats as other airlines do.  They did not board back to front.  They did not encourage customers to deplane row by row so as not to crowd together. Although we included our frequent traveler # when booking, we did not get TSA stated on ticket.  Their return flight from EGE apparently is a disaster day by day as they scramble to the last minute to calculate number of passengers and bags for weight limits.  We were almost two hours late leaving and they were still trying to count passengers to the last minute; many missed their connection at DFW.  Disappointment in every way."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Certainly has improved,"The seats were relatively comfortable and the service was quite good, very professional staff. Legroom was about average and recline was too. Seatback monitors on a domestic flight is a plus."
Date of travel: June 2020,30,Nice staff (besides the one hostile flight attendant),"For food, I was offered a small bag of pretzels and a plastic cup of water, but they had a few other soft drinks as well. Legroom was ok, the main discomfort is not being able to recline much.  I paid $17.00 for the WiFi and it wasn't reliable. Sometimes it would randomly stop working. It doesn't seem worth it unless you desperately need internet access.  The In-flight entertainment was good. There were a lot of TV shows and movies to choose from. I was able to view from the built in screen in the chair or from my iPad. Customer service: When I boarded, I noticed a subtle gesture from one of the flight attendants that seemed somewhat hostile, but I shrugged it off as a possible misinterpretation.  This would come back later during the flight, when AA staff announced over the speakers that a premium headset from 1st class had gone missing. To paraphrase, they said: the person who has the premium headset can discreetly return them and there will be no problems. If we do not get the headset back, the deboarding process will be delayed and security will get involved. Shortly after this, the plane was about to land and they announced over the speaker to put our trays up. I was in the process of removing the items from the tray, so I could put it up when the previously mentioned flight attendant approached and snapped at me to put up my tray. She then asked me if I had stolen the headset I had from 1st class. I told her no, then she went away. Based on that unpleasant exchange, I was half expecting to be met with a team of police officers after exiting the plane. Fortunately, nothing out of the ordinary happened after landing and I was able to deboard without any further problems.  I don't know if they ever retrieved the missing headset. This incident prompted me to research what type of headsets they offer in 1st class. It looks like it's Bose or Bang & Olufsen. My headphones were Sony WH-1000XM3, but who knows, maybe they look similar."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Terrible customer service,"As the title says, terrible customer service! I bought a plane ticket for my grandmother so she could fly down and visit my dad for fathers day. She had to cancel due to being sick. AA told her on the phone that she would be able to get a voucher, since the ticket was non refundable, which is fine until you realize she probably will not fly again due to her age and health. I attempted to get it changed into my name, since I purchased the tickets and they told me they wouldn't do it. I find it weird that United Airlines accommodated the request but American can't? Thanks for stealing from me!"
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Terrible Airline,"AA is all about the $. They have the worst customer service if you have a problem, as each representative tells you different information.

Date of travel: June 2020,30,HEALTH RISK/COVID -19 HEALTH ALERT - AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT ATTENDANTS FAILED TO ENFORCE MASK COMPLIANCE,"The New York leg of the trip was fine, with adequate social distancing between passengers and EVERYONE HAD ON THEIR MASK!.  However, THE MIAMI LEG OF THE TRIP WAS HORRENDOUS!!! CLEARLY AMERICAN WAS ABOUT THE $$$.  The flight was packed, I saw numerous people without their masks even though there were EXPLICIT announcements both in the boarding area and before take off that masks WERE TO BE WORN FOR THE DURATION OF THE FLIGHT, ONLY TO BE REMOVED while eating.  I shared a row with a couple who boarded without their masks!!  I watched the flight attendants pass several times one even had the nerve to tell me to adjust my arm rest (I'M AFRICAN)  but failed to say anything to the couple (they were probably intimidated because the guy was really tall).  I confronted the flight attendants as I was leaving the plane and informed them that it was a HEALTH RISK TO NOT ENFORCE MASK COMPLIANCE.  One attendant who was a white male claimed that he hadn't seen them, but I checked him and let him know that he had in fact seen them because (A) he and the other attendant had to stop at our row, to collect garbage, the guy was TOO BIG TO MISS! THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T BLACK ON THEM is because I had on a Mask, and I didn't want his breath on me.   Clearly Florida hasn't gotten the memo, as evidenced by the increase of + COVID cases but AMERICAN AIRLINES YOU HAVE TO DO BETTER.  OH AND YES THE COUPLE WAS CAUCASIAN.  I've TESTED NEGATIVE FOR COVID, if I GET ANY TYPE OF Disease WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH - AMERICAN AIRLINES WILL BE SHUT DOWN."
Date of travel: June 2020,20,NO SAFETY in mind,"Booked in February to go to LV to celebrate our anniversary and my mom's 75th bday.  She lives there.  So we needed to be super careful and called the AA several times to be sure that the flight we had was not over-booked.  Told 85% capacity.  Told that no one else would be seated in our row.  We are both gold status and paid for premium seats.  We were told TUESDAY night that the flight (which was not listed online to buy seats) was at 2/3 capacity and again, our row was just us.   WEDNESDAY we get an email informing that they are offering $400 vouchers to change our flight plan because the flight is oversold.  Go online, and now, the flight is online and seats are being offered at $600-$1100.  The only 7 open seats are in the front of the plane and the rest is packed tight. How can I visit my 75 Y/O mom after rubbing elbows for 6 hours with 200 people and feel good about that?  I can't.  And so, we canceled 10pm Wednesday night, 14 hours before we were to leave. Thanks AA for serving your 25+ year customers like garbage.  I'm crazy sad about not seeing my Mom.  But I couldn't live with the thought of possibly getting her sick."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Racially profiled,The employee Alvin Alvarez that works at the check in stand was very rude to me. And I believe I was racially profiled.

Once I gave myPurse toSomeone else he still continued to make a issue out of myBags for NO REASON I have a carry on bag & a small personal bag which is free with myFlight so he had no reasonTo say anything to me AT ALL.I should Have been ableTo scan my boarding pass and kept moving.

Date of travel: June 2020,10,"Disgusting airplanes, non existent service, unsafe conditions","First flight of the day was on AA2029, an A319 from AUS-CLT. Cabin crew never said one word to me, and handed me a bottle of Nestle water and packaged nuts in an already used paper bag. This was handed to every passenger on the flight, so the guy in coach who paid $70 for the flight got the same food and beverage service as the guy who paid $600 in the premium cabin. I’d give this flight 2 stars, because they got us there on time (only happens 40% of the time on AA). Second flight (AA 4693 opb Republic Airways from CLT-HHH) was an absolute disaster. Pilot came out and said flight would be diverted to Savannah and we’d be delayed at least 2 hours. Gate agents said the plan was that we’d be forced onto a bus which would take us to HHH airport and that entering the terminal was not permitted. On the plane, flight attendants gave a different story and said Uber and Lyft vouchers would be given at SAV and we could go straight to our homes. This plan was changed AGAIN in Savannah where they gave us taxi vouchers and pooled us into cabs and took us to Hilton Head Airport. Overall, AA was unorganized, dishonest, and not following their COVID policy. Both flights were completely full and no cabin crew member wore a face covering and middle seats were filled. Also, both flights were absolutely filthy and were clearly not cleaned the way AA said on Social Media. My business to Hilton Head will now be fulfilled  by delta from now on."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Horrendous Policies and Customer Service,"First of all, to those who actually believe that any airline is going to maintain a 6ft distance between every passenger and make everyone ""safe"" is delusional! They exist to carry passengers from origin to destination safely, not make them feel all warm and cozy..My experience is with the asinine policy of requiring masks on all passengers when most of the masks doing little if anything for protection, and most take their masks down or off for much of the flight!  Let those who wish to wear a mask wear them, but do not force everyone into a false sense of security. Also, to not provide ANY service during a flight is an abomination! I purchase an expensive first class ticket to have some level of comfort and service during my trip, and all I get is small bottle of water and some cheese chips!! Give me a break! Change the Policy!!! Will not fly again until this changes."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Not enforcing social distancing or use of masks in flight,"Very disappointed. Very worried.  May not fly American again even though we are a top tier customers.  AA does not enforce social distancing, flight was crowded. AA only enforces masks for the boarding process.  The attendants were called by all of the first class passengers due to an irrate and verbally abusive passenger on our flight also in first. AA is not a safe airline for COVID  concerns, read the hundreds of complaints that are posted on fb, instagram and other social media.   AA attendants told all of us that there was nothing they could do!  The passenger seated next to this person even asked to be reseated as per AA policy, she was denied a new seat.  This made her seat mate even angrier and be was shouting, spitting all over the other passengers.  AA attendents just ignored him.  very COVID SCARY!   Same boarding cattle call as pre COVID.  Why? Southwest boards in groups of 10 at a time so they avoid the crush.  AA also allowed some passengers to carry on 6- 8 bags per person in coach.  AA management can you do better, or do you want to go BK again?"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Worse airlines ever !,Ok first of all worse customer service ever and uncomfortable for the price!!! I checked in and I’m also a military dependent to get my first check bag free like any other airline would accept it except for this whack airline ! I was caught by surprise with that. The lady told me I haven’t heard about the other airlines that do that like lady are you serious?!  Damn well she knows working in a airport WTF. Also when you self check in they print out the whole strip to put it on your bag which I was confused with. First time I ever done that. So someone had to help me because I didn’t want to put in the wrong sticker or forget to put the sticker on the bag... they need to have CLEAR instructions for that! Iam a frequent flyer by the way so I’m used to the employees doing that for you. So I think that’s super weird. Also I had to pay a 100 bucks because it was over 9 pounds cool I get it but still expensive as hell wtf. Might well get a second carry on next time. Be aware people worse customer service in the way they talk to you too like the lady said (oh you have to go into another line to pay the 100 bucks and she kept pointing and I’m like ok)one associate said (don’t forget to put the heavy tags on and the lady stated said “oh they will do all that” to me that was lazy as hell!  Iam not rude at all. It’s just annoying to deal with. Never flying this piece of crap again. the seats are uncomfortable for the price you’re paying!!! Gabage!Don’t do it !
Date of travel: June 2020,10,A lot has changed!!!,"A lot has changed for me and AA since 2018/2019!!!  My experience last Friday on 2 American Airline flights from Florida. I was not aware that American Airlines stopped practicing 'social distance seating', when I asked the stewardess about this she proceeded to yell as me in front everyone in first class and anyone else within earshot. 'Karen' told me I was free to leave the plane and rebook a less filled flight because this one was ""fully booked"".  'Karen' lectured me about airlines offering 'social distance seating' as a courtesy not as a requirement. 'Karen' continued to lecture me on how airlines couldn't make money if they didn't sell seats. For the next hour, 'Karen' frequently stopped by my seat to continue to harass me. I would also like to say that my connecting flight, on American Airlines was also filled to capacity. 10 days before, I had flown Delta and the experience was wonderful and 'social distance seating' was in practice. Travelers were offered hand sanitizer and wipes along with a bag with snacks and a water. American Airlines provided absolutely nothing. After being stuffed on both flights like sardines, at the end of each flight the captain announced that upon leaving the aircraft, travelers were expected to follow social distancing practices by leaving the plane one row at a time....WHAT A JOKE!! I sent a complaint to American Airlines customer service. This was their response: Hello Susan:Thank you for contacting Customer Relations. My name is Emma and I'm here to help.First and foremost, I sincerely regret the poor customer service experience you had onboard your flight to Charlotte on Friday. I can absolutely understand your frustration with being embarrassed repeatedly by our flight attendant. That's never the kind of experience we want you to have with us and I'm disappointed you did not receive the treatment you deserve from Karen.American continues to limit the number of customers on each aircraft. Additionally, American Customer Service agents also may reassign seats to create more space between customers or to accommodate families who need to be seated together. Once boarding is complete — taking in consideration any aircraft weight or balance restrictions — customers can move to another seat within their ticketed cabin subject to availability. As more people get back to traveling and loads are higher, American has deployed new tools to notify customers and allow them to move to more open flights when available, all without incurring any cost.I'm truly sorry that you have perceived a lessening of the warm, friendly and professional attitude we expect our people will project. I've made your comments available to the appropriate management personnel so that we can ensure better service moving forward.Susan, we appreciate you very much and hope to welcome you onboard a future AA flight. Take care and stay well.Sincerely,Emma FrostCustomer RelationsAmerican Airlines"
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Poor customer service,"I was scheduled to go on vacation in Jamaica, but corona put a cramp in that plan. American Airlines understandably cancelled the flight, and I had a non-refundable ticket. I attempted to use there online refund but was denied. I called in and they asked me the same questions over and over. I was finally informed that I cancelled my fair for the flight, which I certainly did not! They also said because I supposedly cancelled the flight, that I was not eligible for a refund. Flight records also show that there was never a flight from Cleveland to Charlotte (the lay over) or Jamaica.Poor customer service and worse policy.  After I use my remaining balance of flight points with AA (im not dumb enough to throw hundreds of dollars away), then I will never be using AA again."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,"Terrible customer service, rude flight attendants and outdated aircraft features.","Horrible check in experience. Rude flight attendants, seem like they hate their job and zero ability to provide good customer service. I’ve been traveling with same carryon luggage for over 4 years, flying at least 5 times a year, and have NEVER had an issue with luggage. Watching people walk on ahead of me with oversized Carry on luggage and then flight attendant rudely pulls my bag out of my hand and says she’s going to check it because she can look at it and tell it’s too big. At check-in for first flight, my bag was placed in the size determining measurement at check-in and fit just fine and I was told it would be fine for carryon. (As it always is.) When I start to board the second flight of my trip, the rude flight attendant grabs my bag and says she is checking it. Doesn’t measure it and doesn’t try it out in the sizing bin. Rudely tells me she doesn’t have time to check. This is unacceptable service. Do better, American Airlines. In these times during covid19, you should be making your passengers feel welcome and taken care of, not knit-picking and being rude to customers. I will never use your services again unless this issue is made right."
Date of travel: June 2020,30,Full Plane,I was quite surprised that our planes were so full.  Going from Phoenix to Charlotte the plane was 85% full from what the flight attendant said.  Going from Charlotte to Phoenix on. June 17th flight 22 the plane was packed.  Middle seats were not open.  If I knew they were going to allow the plane to be full I never would have flown with them.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,6ft Social Distancing,"On today’s flight# AA895, I notice that American Airline is not following the 6ft distance and I asked the flight attendant if they are able to move the passenger next to me to stay 6ft distance and the flight attendant was rude and disrespectful and asked me to get out of the plane if I am not comfortable. So I requested to speak with the pilot and he was generous enough to move the passenger. I have been a member of AA for years and this is was the worst experience I ever experienced. The flight attendant should of took action and resolve this issue instead of me telling me to get off the plane.  American Airline is NOTA following the guideline with wearing the mask at all times and 6ft Distance. I am angry and disappointed by the flight attendant."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Never see me again,"Full 100% what about social distancing? Paid for the ticket double price. This airline is sh*t. This is just ripping people off.they are acting like this is normal, is ok but why to rise the tickets prices and fill the plane at maximum?"
Date of travel: June 2020,20,My Safety was NOT their priority,"We booked flights on two segments, Denver to Charlotte and Charlotte to Portland ,Maine. American, along with other airlines,  had been promoting safety measures as they related to Covid-19 such as passengers and crew must wear masks, social distancing like not booking middle seats, no food or beverage service, etc..Our flights were both fully booked including all middle seats. Many passengers removed masks after boarding with no visible encouragement by flight attendants to replace them (at least not  the 9 passengers surrounding us who were not wearing masks). My wife and I are in a higher risk group being elderly with some medical concerns. Our age range is obvious and the flight attendant should have encouraged passengers to wear masks and enforced the rules the airline set."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Missed flight due to American Airlines/ Terrible customer service communication,"I am incredibly displeased with American Airlines and this has been the worst experience I've had with an airlines company.Our original flight was from Laredo TX to Dallas Fort Worth with a 3 hour layover. They changed this layover to a 1 hour layover. Originally we were estatic with the change because this means we would be home sooner than expected. However we were incredibly wrong. Our flight from Laredo to Dallas was an hour late and the plane was further delayed as the manifest did not match the headcount. So naturally the airlines waited an extra 15 or so minutes to figure it out which I can understand. We finally made it into Dallas and our connecting flight to Buffalo left as we were taxing in Dallas. Noone held the plane for us so ultimately we missed out flight. We spoke with tbe Customer Service desk and they advised us to call the Customer Service Helpdesk and they told us that they can get us 3 seats on a flight back to Buffalo On Tuesday (original flight was sunday) and the 4th seat on Thursday (total party size of 4). They assured us they would send us an email with the flight details. We waited for 2 hours and didn't receive anything so we called back and were on hold for an hour before considering driving all the way from Dallas to Buffalo.We ended up renting a Tahoe for $1300 and drove to Hope Arkansas to stay the night. This would allow us to be in a better position to drive to Buffalo or if the airlines did finally send us the information, we would be in a reasonable range to get back to Dallas. Needless to say, we never heard anything further from American Airlines. 22 hours of driving later and an extra $1300, we finally got back to Buffalo. I had a plethora of emails back and forth with Customer Support and they offered us 4 $100 vouchers as compensation. This is not compensation but rather a lack of justice for my family. We all missed work for an extra 2 days, cost us a rental, another 2 rooms for a hotel and 22 hours of stress. I wasn't looking for a full refund, but rather a refund for the cost of the flight that they caused us to miss. I dont care if weather caused the first plane to be delayed, this is about the lack of action on their part to get us on a flight back to Buffalo. I will not be considering flying with American airlines again. My loss alone weighs more than the net worth of tbeir compensation. Let alone, my parents and my fiance who lost money from not working. Im appalled by my experience. Ive never had an issue with Southwest or Delta. I fully question American Airlines loyalty to their customers because its apparent to me that they don't really care about us."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Engineer,They packed on 5 plus airline employees not in uniform while 32 passengers were on the waiting list for the same flight.

Date of travel: June 2020,20,AA Not Safe During Covid-19 Pandemic,"I felt unsafe during both of my flights during the COVID-19 pandemic as both flights were as full as possible. Social distancing was not followed. My connector flight was actually combined with another flight to fill the plane. I understand that traveling during a pandemic is a risk, but American Airlines could have done more to promote social distancing & prevent exposure."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Flying Covid Petrie Dish,"I decided to visit family in panama city, fl.. even though i had fears about Covid.  I took Southwest airline to get there and was very appreciative of the empty middle seats.  My American airline flight back was packed.. zero empty seats.. and the carrier (mesa airline) from panama city to dallas had very poor circulation, was so hot everyone had their masks off and were fanning themselves with the flight magazines.  If anyone on the plane had covid we all have it now."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Never Encountered a Problem,Of all my years riding American (10 years) I've never encountered a problem. The staff are mostly kind and friendly and the seats were very nice. Very good IFE System and since there weren't many passengers onboard everyone got their own row.  Amazing Flight :)
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Awful customer service and employees,"Of course as a mom of an infant and all the added stress of traveling with a young child I just started crying. We ended up leaving all our belongings behind except for the diaper bag, carseat/stroller and headed for security. Got thru security, the gate attendant checked our carseat and the plane still left 2 min early.  Fast forward  I contact AA to file a complaint and the response I get is thanks for being a valued customer, sorry for the inconveniences and we will tell the airport manager that the wan was rude.  THATS IT!  Inconvience? Yeah I paid for service, stood in line waiting for it and then was told too bad. I came to an airport stressed and anxious then told I have to leave everything behind.  I spent a good portion of the flight crying and stressing over the added expense to find clothes, shoes, socks, underwear etc for my entire family.  Yet all American Airlines wants to say is sorry for the inconvience?"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Mr Brown,This is absolutely the worst airline I have ever flown on.  Missed my connecting flight both on the way down and on the way back due to delays from AA's incompetence.  I had to wait until the next day to fly out both times and was given no vouchers for hotel room's.  They ended up offering me $100.00 for a future flight on AA.  I would rather walk.  Never again will I fly American Airlines!
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Worst airline ever,I’ve never been to more disappointed with any airline I’ve ever ridden on . I had to have a layover for one night which wasn’t stated when I purchased the ticket and wouldn’t come a hotel room or pay the difference so I could reach my destination same day. This was even talked to coustomer support managers.  then I missed my flight aka my connecting flight yes my fault. so I had to purchase a new ticket which was $540 when my original ticket was only 150$ then to top it off I had to pay 30$ Again to recheck my bags which I had already paid the first time so had to pay  $30 2 separate time a and they wouldn’t even comp  that . They milked me for almost 700 dollars plus a hotel stay overnight An additional 150 hotel 50$ fuel  so 900$ one way ticket which is crap and it started as a 150$ ticket so 750$ come up for them. Worst experience with any business I have ever had I will ALWAYS 100% of the time go out of my way to bad mouth and talk this business down and will never ride with these greedy jerks again. Worst business in the world.
Date of travel: June 2020,20,Covid precautions,"So today I took a flight from jfk to south bend, no social distancing on flight, I felt like even if they can put someone in washroom they will put it, no sanitizers offered . My flight has a stop over at North Carolina so I was hoping flight from there will be better but still the same . Everyone sitting together . I flew from delta 6 days ago and no issues . No one was sitting near to Me. Sanitizers were offered twice. Biscuits and waters were given in disposable bag, felt so save in delta. If time was not an issue i would have taken delta again and again. That is so bad they know what is going in whole world still no safety measures were taken."
Date of travel: June 2020,30,Flying in the age of coronavirus,"very disappointed in  the messaging of cleanliness and requirement of wearing face masks only to find that it was not a requirement on the duration of the flight.  American Airlines requires a mask boarding and disembarking from a flight, but when passengers are on the plane, apparently, those requirements are ignored.  And I traveled in fear of the airborne virus. I was hesitant to bring in to the flight attendant because a few passengers on my row were insistent about taking their masks off.  I know that AA has a policy of requiring masks during the duration of the flight because my next leg of the flight (#3881 DFW to COU) we were told constantly from the flight attendants to wear them."
Date of travel: June 2020,20,COVID-19 precautions just for show,"I traveled on a completely full flight from CVG to DFW with a lap infant. It was a 40+ row plane with 3 people on each side of the aisle. The plane was completely full, yet during take-off flight attendants said to “social distance” when up in aisles putting away carry-ons and that if you want to sit somewhere else to allow more social-distancing then just ask an attendant. Yet the flight was FULL. Neither “precautions” were possible. Also, when we got to our seats there were used tissues in the seat pocket, making it obvious that the seat was not cleaned as it should be. I felt American Airlines were saying they were taking more precautions for cleanliness due to the COVID virus, yet it was all talk. Also, the process for reporting a lap infant is terribly confusing though they must have MANY lap infants traveling every day. The AA website says to call reservations to report traveling with a lap infant, yet when I called the answering machine would not let me get through to anyone to report my infant. I was not impressed."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE,"NEVER in my life will I fly American Airlines again. I got to the airport 50 minutes before my flight (because I am pregnant and was experiencing horrible morning sickness which kept me at the house longer than expected). I get to the kiosk to find my flight info, check bag, and print boarding pass. It made me enter my confirmation Number THREE DIFFERENT TIMES before it actually found my reservation all the while it was “thinking” slower than any computer system on the planet. By the time the system found it, it was ONE MINUTE past the 45 minute window allowed for checking a bag. Instead of doing the right thing and running the bag to where it needed to be so I could make my flight, I was made to miss my flight, wait at the airport for 4 hours to fly standby for another flight that got me to Tallahassee at 10pm making me miss my grandfathers memorial service all together. I explained all of this to the most horrible customer service supervisor on the floor and he still did not give a crap. Actually, he yelled at the other customer service rep who was trying to call down to the gate and help me. American Airlines should be put out of business."
Date of travel: June 2020,30,DFW to ORD on AA 787-8,"My first trip after the Covid-19 pandemic.  This was a 787-8 and I was looking forward to an ""open middle seat.""  Some airlines guarantee an open middle seat, apparently, AA is not one of them.  AA1258/12JUN2020 operated DFW to ORD with about a 75% load factor (guess).  Very few middle seats were open.  On the plus side, flight attendants handed passengers snack bags as they entered the aircraft.  The bags consisted of a bottle of water, pretzels, and Biscoff cookies.Let me say this about the 787.  Despite the technology with auto-window shades, pressurization, and IFE, I would not want to fly this plane on any of AA's international routes.  The economy class seating is the most miserable experience on a two hour flight, I cannot immagine what a 14 hour flight to Asia would be like."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,worst airline,"everytime I fly with American airlines i have always ran into issue with them. During my flight to Miami which I was connecting to go to Orlando. They wouldn't let my bag into plane, which they claim no more space but when entered plane. So much room was there for carry on. Also it is crazy that we are supposed to social distance but yet they book a full flight. No space between anyone."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,8 weeks till I get my refund !!!,I booked a vacation package with them. they have a 24 hr window to cancel it. I did that an hr after I booked it. they said no problem and got an e-mail to confirm the cancelation. waited a week for the credit to go to my card... called them and was told it would take 8 weeks !!!  they are holding my money hostage !!! they took the money in a flash though. this should be illegal !!
Date of travel: June 2020,20,No food or drinks!!,No drinks or snacks even available on flight!!! Not even to buy!! Wow. Never again. Im flying with two kids. ALL of the airport stores and restaurants are closed and no flippin drinks. I die.
Date of travel: June 2020,30,What happened to the COVID-19 safety practices?,"I recently took my first “non-essential “ travel to Florida to response to a family medical emergency. After great consideration and the reports of others who had flown recently, I decided to take the risk of flying with proper PPE and the stated safety accommodations the airlines were publishing.  I was surprised at the casual massing of flying customers at the gate. Some wore masks, others didn’t. I’d read that careful boarding (back to front) helped avoid unnecessary jamming of the aisles and reduced multiple passes be other passengers.  To my continued surprise, the same group boarding group cattle-call was in effect, with a long line in the boarding line, ramp and in the aircraft. At least everyone was wearing a mask ( of sorts... bandannas, tee shirts pulled up, etc). My next surprise was the announcement that this was a “full flight.”  I assumed this meant that, with staggered seated for social distance, the flight was a capacity.  I was more and more concerned as the seats filled in. I guessed families flying together would sit together until my row filled in too. As I strapped my mask tighter, I sat shoulder to shoulder on 3 of the four legs of my 6 hour journey from San Diego to Orlando ( change of planes at DFW).Flight crew instructed that masks “should” remain on throughout the flight, but could be removed during eating and drinking ( American offered a small courtesy bag with a half-bottle of water and a small pack of cookies)... no food or beverage services throughout the rest of the flights. I noticed many folks without masks during the flight- not apparently eating or drinking and the passenger in my row fell asleep with his mask halfway off.  Flight attendants have a hard job and COVID-19 must make it that muck riskier. However, I didn’t see any attempts to ask passengers to keep masks on or clear the packed aisles when boarding and deplaning. I asked about the full flights and was casually told they had to aggregate flights to assure they could fly economically and some flight will either get canceled or other would sometimes be completely full.  I am pretty brave about taking estimated risks, as a medical professional, but I will try my best to protect myself and those around me. It felt like American had chosen economics over reasonable safety precautions.  I know people are of vastly different opinions about how to or whether they even need to wear masks and other PPE, but medical science and the CDC are pretty consistent about what reduces risk and what increases it.  I felt I was taking an informed risk based on advertised safety precautions.  I don’t recall the Airlines announcing an easing of their concerns.  You’d expect the flight crews to be concerned and at least push for distancing and tight cover regulations.  Good luck to us all.  I finished my self quarantine after flying and am symptom free this time!"
Date of travel: June 2020,20,Social Distancing policy makes no sense,"My husband and I recently flew on American Airlines. They kept mentioning their new social distancing. So basically it was a PACKED plane, every seat was full. The only thing different is they don’t serve any food or drink (unless you are first class, I guess then you can’t spread covid) in order to maintain social distancing. They also did not enforce wearing a mask. So what’s the point of denying food and drink when you fill up the plane and don’t enforce your own rules?"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Did not/does not abide by social distancing aboard the plane.,"The plan was unexpectedly/disappointingly packed. Seating was not staggered. There were 3 people in my row, the row in front of me, behind me, and throughout the plane. Profit-mongers."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Travelers beware of American Airlines!!,"I had a very unpleasant experience recently and just want to warn travelers on American Airlines. I booked a round trip flight from Houston to Springfield, MO with connections in Dallas Fort Worth. I thought round trip meant that you departed from and returned to the same airport. This is not true with American. I departed from Bush airport and parked my vehicle there. They returned me to Hobby airport. When I contacted them to complain, I was told that it was my responsibility to notice that it was returning to a different airport. Obviously my definition of round trip and their definition are different. I didn't realize that I was not returning to my original destination until I arrived at the gate in Dallas for my connecting flight. I had to take an Uber ($34.00) from the Hobby airport to the parking lot at the Bush airport where my vehicle was parked. I have flown many times with Delta, United, and American. This  has never happened to me with other airlines.So--free advice is: when you book a round trip ticket with American, make sure to notice which airport they are taking you to. IAH means Bush airport, HOU means Hobby. I thought HOU meant Houston. They are both in Houston, but several miles apart! I will not fly with American again unless there is no other airline that I can use."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,DO NOT PURCHASE MILES!!!!,"The pilot of an American Airlines flight FALSLY advertised American Airlines miles in order to persuade myself and others to sign up for a Barclays credit card. Not only does this practice violate standard good faith conduct, but it aggressively indicates the type of conduct this business endorses. The pilot claimed “with 60,000 miles you can fly anywhere in the U.S. TWICE or bring a friend with you once.” I Can’t event fly solo from San Diego to Chicago (round trip) ONCE with 62000 miles!!!! During COVID circumstances!!!!! the supervisor I contacted suggested this was not false, it just had to do with “availability”. Has it EVER been MORE available??? —-The miles reward program is a complete SCAM! It’s misleading and an aggressive way to get you to waste your money. —-"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,No mask for Flight Attendant between Champaign IL and DFW,"Flew yesterday, 15 June, and the flight attendant was not wearing a mask, neither in the terminal as she arrived at the gate nor on the plane.  At all.  Meanwhile, the two pilots with her were wearing a mask in the terminal and while in the cockpit during boarding. This is not rocket science.  American's website says that their crew will wear masks.I sent a complaint to American today, and their ""bot"" answered that they apologized for ""passengers not wearing masks"".  THAT was not the issue.   Every passenger I saw was wearing a mask.  It was the FLIGHT ATTENDANT.  Hello?  Bueller?They apparently don't get it."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,NO BAILOUTS FOR AMERICAN,"I am thoroughly disgusted with American Airlines for packing their flights full during this social distancing time AND cutting all services out. Basically they are cutting all costs out, drinks, service, snacks (first class gets a snack box) and packing us in, surprised the flights weren't OVER SOLD AND they are asking for bail out money, SHAME ON THEM!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Lost my luggage,From California working in Alabama for a month and American Airlines lost my luggage and customer service is zero help
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Horrible Voucher Policy,"I received two paper vouchers in October 2019 and I was told that I could use my vouchers for any flights that appeared on your website.  Today I called to verify this and was told that is correct and was told to go to the airport and I could book and pay with my vouchers there.I go to the airports and the two ladies at Hartsfield Jackson had no idea what I was talking about and told me that I needed to call AA and reserve my fights first and then they could figure out how to process my voucher. While sitting in the airport,I called AA and spent an hour on the phone with a nice lady who I believe tried to help me but was unable to book the Qatar flights because Qatar was no longer showing up in your system.  The solutions were more than I wanted to pay since the Qatar flights were $800 and the option she gave me was $3000.  So I drove an hour to get to the airport, sat there for an hour, and drove an hour back due to bad information.I just called AA again because I found a flight that is on your site for under $800 and I'm told that I can't book that flight because it has a connection and Cathaway handles the rest of the flight.  WTH.  So now I'm being told that I can only book flights that are AA all the way.  Basically nothing international.  If I would have known this I would have never accepted the voucher.  Instead, I was told several times the vouchers were good for any flights booked through AA.  If you move me off of an international flight and give me vouchers for the inconvenience then you should give me vouchers that work on any international flight you sell.  I'm a travel agent and have never heard of this policy.  This is a horrible policy and policy!!!!!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Don’t Believe the Safety Promotion,"I fly a lot with AA but probably no more. All the talk about face coverings on flights is just that- talk. A passenger sat next to me and wore his face covering by leaving his nose open. Me and other passengers asked that he covers his nose and he refused. I called the flight attendant who reluctantly suggested that the passenger covers his face and left without any action. The next 3 hours, we all traveled as such. I filed a complaint with AA who sent me a sanitized, copy/paste reply which said nothing for any practical reason. This is AA at its worst, unable to protect its passengers from hazards."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Mindy rocks,My flight from Dallas to Denver # 2635 today was first class because of the service from Mindy. I wasn't in first class but she made me and my fellow passengers feel like it. Thanks
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Do not fly AA during COVID-19 pandemic.,"Please consider another airline if you must fly during the corona virus pandemic.  Despite multiple emails from AA with assurances of safety our recent flights were frightening.  The planes were completely packed.  Stand by passengers were allowed so middle seats that might have been empty were filled.  One gentleman crammed in next to me asked to move up to the completely empty exit row when boarding was complete.  He was told no.  Not only told no, but told he had a chip on his shoulder and should just go to sleep.  There is NO enforcement of the facial covering RULE.  Simply pulling a scarf up over her face allowed one woman to board.  The young family seated immediately behind us never wore masks.  Even one of our flight attendants never wore a facial covering.  She was constantly walking up and down the aisle finding passengers to talk to on our early morning flight.  There was no beverage service on any of the flights so fewer flight attendants are needed.  Medically exempt personnel should be found other positions.  I hve shared my feedback with American Airlines and received a standard Customer Service response.  I will not fly American Airlines anytime in the near future despite being an Advantage member."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Rude flight attendants. Will never fly this airline,"Rude staff.  Flight attendants do not care or are interested in customers.  Barely see the, working in isles.  It was a burden to ask for tea.  Will NEVER fly nor recommend this airline"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,WORST AIRLINE OF ALL TIME.,Flights were overcrowded / overbooked during COVID-19 and it made me feel unsafe. I was told my bag was going to be complimentarily checked and it was left at my departure destination. After filing a claim I was told my luggage would be at the airport the following day only to drive out there and not have anything change at all. They continued to tell me my bag was on consecutive flights but I did not get it back for several days. Incompetent at every level of service.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,NEVER FLY AMEEICAN AIRLINES,"The most unprofessional airline on Earth!! NEVER ontime...no amenities, tons of empty excuses and NOT worth the fees!! Fly ANY other airline unless you enjoy getting ripped off!!"
Date of travel: July 2019,20,Rude flight attendants,"I was sitting in an exit row with my mom. I was 16. I guess I looked young, but I'm very strong for my age doing multiple sports, boxing, weights etc. The flight attendant looked at me and asked me what my age was. When I told her I was 16, she was really rude about handling the situation. She clearly did not know that the minimum was 15. Instead of saying, ok let me go check the requirements, in front of everyone she started pulling other flight attendants aside to her (right in front of us and everyone in the seats next to us) to figure it out. Shouldn't you know the requirements if you work as a flight attendant? I fit all the requirements. I can't quite explain how rude she was, but I felt very underestimated and called out in an unprofessional way. It was not how she should have handled the situation. I get the importance of making sure that the people in the exit row are capable of doing their job if a plan goes down, but I am never flying American Airlines again. Horribly rude and unprofessional flight attendants. It was so unnecessary that I thought maybe it had to do with my race, but I'm not even going to go there because I believe making assumptions does not solve problems."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,UNFAIR TREATMENT,"I went to dispose trash in the back of the plane where condiments & refreshments were, without knowing that passengers were not permitted back there. My seat was just a few rows distanced from that area. The supervisor flight attendant saw me in the act and berated me aggressively about the area being restricted due to their social distancing policy. After the incident, I watched plenty of passengers entering that same area and walking through it to circle the plane without being turned away or stopped by flight attendants. I felt very disrespected and unfairly treated by the supervisor flight attendant and won’t be flying AA again, or recommending you to anyone in the future."
Date of travel: June 2020,30,Beware of Dallas/Fort Worth,"Everything was fine. Checking  in  at Indy and the flight was great. But one I landed at Dallas for my connecting flight I dealt with rude Tsa,rude counter people  and a stewardess  that was very pushy. Next time i fly to Vegas i will make sure to avoid changing over in Dallas. Everything was fine with american airline the rest of my trip."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,"Horrible service, missed flight and no refund (paid extra $300)","I arrived at the airport 20 minutes from when my flight was scheduled. This was because the airport did not have a shuttle and it took me 25 minutes to walk from my car to the check in. I was told (By Gary G) when I got there that I could not check in and the flight has already pulled away and is on its way to take off. How would he know this if he did not even call to verify and just immediately stopped me. I tried to say that there is no way that the flight has left because of the status of the gate. He then raised his voice and said THERE IS NO WAY!This caused me to miss my flight and pay an extra $300 for a one way flight. Upon trying to look around other flights so I can arrive on time because I have a hotel scheduled at my final destination, Gary G. did not help me at all. He suggested flights that were in the evening and then proceeded to say that I can look for flights myself, when I asked if there’s something earlier. I then did so and found a flight that is leaving at noon. He then was having trouble with getting my payment. He had to swipe my card multiple times and finally after 45 minutes pass, I got my ticket. I checked in my two bags and he just sat them there behind him and did not send them in. I do not feel assured that I will 1) get my bags at my final destination and 2) I won’t run into this problem again."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Terrible communication,"Plane had maintenance issues, which happens. The issue is they were not being upfront with how long the problem was going to take. Said they didn't know how long it would take, but told a couple they had plenty of time to get dinner after they'd already delayed the flight once. Had they been upfront about how long the issue may take, could have rented a car and driven to Austin from Dallas. Instead, ended up missing my grandfather's 90th birthday. So. Thanks American. Going to follow Warren Buffet's lead and make my money back by shorting their stock."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,As good as any other airline,"On this specific flight I was in business on the 77W from LAX to LHR, which was overall fine.  The plane was showing its age and the crew somewhat less impressive than on other recent flights on the same product.  The seat itself is among the most comfortable anywhere.But this review is more for the airline in general.  American gets a bad wrap because they move more passengers than any other airline, many of whom fly infrequently and are on basic fares with lots of strings attached.  Many of these passengers romanticize about air travel and are surprised to find out that it usually just sucks.  American does little to make their lower-tier customers feel appreciated, but no major airline does except perhaps Southwest, which has enough other drawbacks that I chose to fly American given the choice.  Why do I fly American over any other airline?  They have a complex network and can get you to far more obscure small markets than any other domestic airline, with many more departure and route options.  Work travel will have flying from home in Reno to small markets - Moline, Yuma, Savannah, or internationally - Frankfurt, Paris.  American's network will get me anywhere.The service is usually mediocre.  Comparable to Delta, better than United, worse than Southwest, in my experience.  Sometimes it's awful, sometimes actually surprisingly good.  Averaging over 75 flights/year, I'm usually in MCE or first on domestic flights, usually premium economy on international legs, maybe in business 25% of the time and MCE about the same.  In any cabin, the service is variable but always tolerable and again, comparable to every other product.  For international flights, I find their premium economy to be better than Lufthansa's product and business class far better than what British Airways has on offer.Reliability is good as far as I'm concerned, I get where I need to go.  Most delays are short and for good reason, and they've put me on other airlines to get me to my destination on time (Copa, Lufthansa, United), so I completely disagree they just leave you somewhere with no options.American's AAdvantage loyalty program has worked great for me.  With devaluations by United and Delta, American's mileage program is way better for booking international destinations in premium cabins.  My business travel gets me far more miles than I can use and status that has me in the front of the plane usually for free or a small amount of miles - and I'm still a tier below Executive Platinum.In summary, American is nowhere near as bad as many make it sound - when you compare it to any other viable alternative.  I wish they'd take some notes out of the Delta customer experience playbook, but Delta doesn't serve my city (Reno) well so end of story.  Definitely the best domestic airline given my needs."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Nightmare,"SDF to DFW was delayed because the plane struck a bird on arrival.This caused me and my girlfriend to miss our connection to PDX. They made up for this by booking us a flight to Pheonix. No connections, just a flight to Pheonix. I can only hope they intended to purchase a complimentary house in our name.After reaching out to customer service, we were told the only way we could travel home together was if we stayed overnight and took the first American Airlines flight to LAX, and then they booked us an Alaskan Airlines ticket to PDX from there.We made it to LAX, but got rejected at boarding for our flight to PDX because I was given a boarding pass with no actual ticket. After LAX staff sent me all over the place not knowing where their own airlines were, American assigned us another Alaskan flight, for 8 hours out. At the time of writing, I'm still waiting.We had to stay overnight at a hotel in Dallas, and now we have to spend our day waiting in LAX for a flight. LAX customer service didn't even provide any kind of compensation, you'd think such a monumental waste of time and patience would warrant at least some money back.Next time, I'll book Alaskan. God help anybody who dares book American."
Date of travel: June 2020,30,Fair,"PDX to DFW was smooth, went to plan.DFW to SDF was delayed with a variety of reasons given. Initially they needed paperwork, then they said vital phone lines went down in Pheonix. Eventually they gave up on that particular plane and moved everyone onto a new plane, where they boarded us and had us wait for a fuel truck to fuel the plane. All in all, we waited about an hour to two hours inside the two cabins before actually taking off."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Absolutely Horrible,"I have flown on easily hundreds of planes and this is by far my worst experience ever. We got on the plane around 4:00 and did not take off until 6:00. The flight had “maintenance problems” because they had let it sit in the hot sun for 8 hours. I had a connecting flight to charlotte that I missed due to the issue. While we were watching waiting on the plane there were three fights and someone’s dog had crapped. By the time we landed it was about 7:00. We sat in an airport for an hour with no food, no shelter, no plane. Finally the airline booked us a hotel room and we got a cab and went to the hotel. The next morning we woke up to get on our flight and almost missed it because they were boarding early. A week later we were on our flight back home and the plane didn’t take off for 30 minutes and they did not turn on the air conditioning. It was 98 degrees inside the plane. I will absolutely never fly with american again and i recommend that no one should."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Worst Airline Experience (Will not be signing up for their credit card now),"Hello,I don't normally write reviews, but I had to get this off my chest for others to hear.I will not be traveling American Airlines again. I was looking at getting their credit card to get the benefits and the bonus miles for signing up, but I will now be looking at United or Delta Airlines.To start off, our flight from Philly to Phoenix scheduled to leave at 7am was delayed first 20 minutes, then another 20 minutes, then 2 hours. After that they got another airplane to leave from a different gate for those who still wanted to take the flight to Phoenix. However, that plane also had problems and was delayed until further notice. Couldn't even give us an expected take-off time. Customer service did the best they could to find us new flights because we missed our connecting flight from Phoenix to Redmond. However, the best they could do was tell us to wait until our delayed plane took off to Phoenix, then stay the night in Phoenix, then they got us a flight from Phoenix to Portland at 7:30am the next day. Yea that's right Portland. 3 hours from Redmond, Oregon which is our destination. They did not have any more flights from Phoenix or anywhere for that matter to Redmond. To make things worse we are traveling in a group of 7. We all got on the flight from Philly to Phoenix that finally left at 11:30am (4.5 hours later). Then we all stayed the night in Phoenix because they had no more flights from Phoenix to Portland or Redmond that day. They did give us 2 free hotel rooms (they told us it would be 3, but when we checked into the hotel it was for only 2 rooms). That's not a big deal, but why tell us we have 3 rooms when we only had 2 rooms?Now, I am writing this review in Phoenix airport at 9am. 5 out of our group of 7 got a flight from Phoenix to Portland at 7:30am. That leaves myself and another person stuck in Phoenix until our flight at 2:30pm. Now, our group of 5 friends have to wait in Portland airport from 10:15am when they land until 5:15pm when us two land. Then we had to rent a car for $100 that we will have to drive 3 hours from Portland to Redmond because Redmond is our final destination. So after everything said and done, our group of 7 will now be in Redmond, Oregon around 9pm at night on Friday. We were supposed to be there at 1:30pm on Thursday. That's a whole day and a half misssed of our vacation.To top it all off, my girlfriend had to check her carry on bag. So it was on the plane that we were supposed to leave on from Philly, but it got put on another plane and did not get to Phoenix until 9pm later that night. So we left the phoenix airport at around 4pm when we got there then had to go back to the airport from our hotel to get her bag. I normally do not write reviews, but this was a horrific experience. I know American Airlines did the best they could, but it seems like there are always issues with their planes and departure times. It was just a mess as there was not enough customer service staffed in Philly. They said to keep our receipts from uber and the car rental place for reimbursement, but they said they doubt we would get reimbursed. So we have to spend extra time and money to get to our destination that they will most likely not reimburse. That is why I gave them 1 star. Not everyone has had this experience. Just know that it could happen to you if it happened to me and the way the whole situation was handled was very poor."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Families seats broken up with young children during pandemic,I checked in 24 hours in advance and also called American Airlines 48 hours prior to boarding to confirm my family would not be broken into different sections of the plane. Upon arrival at the airport all of us were broken into diff seats and it is also a fully booked flight. You would think with the pandemic you would keep families together so they could distance from other people. I do not recommend families with kids traveling on American Airlines until they figure out how to seat people.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Every time I fly with American the plane breaks,I have had to change my plans around numerous times because American can never get it together. Every time as soon as boarding starts there’s an issue with the plane and the flight gets canceled or delayed. I mean go for it if you want a cheap uncomfortable flight and you have a lot of patience and time to spare. Otherwise this is a joke of an airline and I hope they go bankrupt :)
Date of travel: June 2020,10,The McDonald’s of airlines,Made us check out carry on bags due to their own negligence then nearly sent my checked (should have been carry on) to another state because they gave me the wrong label and thought I was someone I wasn’t even after scanning by pass. And apparently “it’s not working so we’re going to turn it off and back on again” works for airplanes (Yes it happened) 🤷‍♂️
Date of travel: June 2020,10,American is a Joke,"This is wonderful.  2nd time I have flown you, in my life, and you lost my luggage again.  Here is what is humorous (otherwise, it would be conniption worthy): you can't locate the damn bag.  We are going to West Plains, Mo today to look at property and we have zero supplies. Where is our bag?  Supposedly, it got from Reno (our original beginning point) to DFW (that is what the attendant said, but she also took our number down incorrectly).  I want our bag and I want a status.  My wife has meds in the bag and so do I.  Not to mention about $600 worth of clothes and other items. Not that AA will read this review, because you flat out do not care."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Ok Overall,Overall the experience was fine. The flight was on time. The service on the flight was as expected. Nothing good or bad about this flight.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Horrible customer service,"Traveled with my elderly mother which is wheelchair bound. They were late taking off from Spokane because 1 they aircraft arrived late, 2. They waiting for a lady who “lost her phone”. They arrived LATE at Dallas but the other connecting flight even after talking to the flight crew LEFT early.... and this is with us paying and flying First Class....we will NEVER fly this pathetic Airline again.... Missed the flight by 10 minutes..... 3 first class tickets wasted!!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Terrible Customer Service and False Charges,"This terrible airline charged my card, and didn't send a confirmation email. Now they are saying they never charged my card and cannot refund me. Wow so take my money, and not give me my flight. I don't ever write reviews but I have been on hold for hours for the past 2 days and no results. American Airlines will NEVER get my business!"
Date of travel: July 2019,10,Rude female stewardesses,Flight attendants are rude to customers! Dallas Texas. Never fly this airline! The security guards at the gates are so power hungry they instigate trouble.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Worst customer service ever,When I booked our flight at the end February the website said book with confidence.  The only thing I am confident of is that they will keep your money and never send you any confirmation emails.  They have changed their story for a refund 4 different times and I am still waiting on my confirmation emails of my flight and tickets.  I can only assume they never sent them because they wanted a way to not let us know the refund policy.  I would do do everything in my control to never fly with them again.
Date of travel: June 2020,40,No SD,"We had these tickets book before the Covid attack.  We kept them, using them to attend a wedding.  I heard about Social Distancing on the planes ---- Not so --- Full.  Ok by me as I am in the masses who do not believe much of what is being said about Covid.  Had or was requested to ware a mask ---- Hated it, cannot breath.  Plane air conditioning going and coming was not working well as was HOT.  However 2.5 hours going and 3 hours coming back is GREAT!  They gave us a snack in a bag with a bottle of hot water.  Love water ---- Just love it cold."
Date of travel: June 2020,40,no phone charger,this is a great airline but it is a no water no phone charger  plane the staff is great need a little up grade
Date of travel: June 2020,30,Use Caution Amid COVID-19,"With limited flight options and a strong desire to return from San Diego to Indianapolis, I booked a flight on American from SAN with a stop in Phoenix. I was very hesitant and anxious to fly American during (and before) COVID-19, and a number of my anxieties proved quite valid (particularly during the SAN-PHX flight). Unlike carriers Delta and Alaska, American needs to ensure maximum profits by filling as many seats as possible, regardless of COVID circumstances. My flight to Phoenix was 98% full. While not every single seat was full, only 2 or 3 were. Which is just unacceptable. I felt very annoyed and worried, as this is not just a disturbance because passengers take up space or act annoying—this is because health is at risk. Masks may help (and I personally expect everyone to wear them at all times in public), but I feel safe on Delta and Alaska because they go the extra mile by spacing; restricting; and ensuring the sparseness of every flight they operate. This is simply not the case on American (*at least on the flights I took*). Now that leads me to the service and staff: the flight attendants on both flights were very friendly, welcoming, and generally attentive to passengers’ needs. I particularly commend one FA on SAN-PHX for working to move me to a slightly better seat (at least no one directly next to me). Still uncomfortable, but better than the squished place I sat earlier on. The gate agents at PHX, one woman in particular, seemed to enjoy their jobs so much and provided the most excellent service. Well-done to them and all the other friendly faces!! I’m impressed!!In summary, while there were friendly employees and the flights were on-time, I still would not personally book American again unless they are the only carrier (that was the case here). Please, please exercise caution when you fly, and only fly if you take the appropriate precautions and are not sick. Public health depends on us as individuals. Try to negotiate with gate agents to find a better seat if the flight is fuller than ideal in these conditions, and don’t be afraid to respectfully voice your concerns. I feel that most employees will understand and exhibit care and understanding, as was what I experienced on my trip. Stay healthy, safe, and well! Thanks for getting me to IND on time and with a great personality, American!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Don’t care about COVID-precaution,"During this COVID era, precaution is life-saving. I therefore recommend to NOT fly American. I have to fly for work, also during this pandemic. I’ve flown many airlines in the past few months and they were all considerate and took precautions. Not American. My flight from LAX to Chicago was overbooked. Which I think is absolutely not-done in these times. Also, they let groups pile up during boarding with crowded isles as a results. When I asked the crew what was done to sanitize the plane on arrival they couldn’t answer. One of them said he didn’t think it was sanitized at all and recommended to clean my seating area myself. My flight from Dallas to Amsterdam, same thing. Or even worse. Some of the crew members didn’t think it necessary to wear face masks and had a swell old time talking to each other without any face covering. One of the female attendants had way more attention for her phone than her crowd as she missed several times that people were getting up although fastened seatbelts signs were on, and passengers were wearing No face coverings. Not only will I never fly American again, I also feel these airlines should be marked and fined for not executing and/or enforcing COVID-precautions."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,ESA Disaster,"On June 6th I flew American to LAX with one layover. That trip was fine, even enjoyable with my ESA. Today I am flying from LAX to MDT and it was a nightmare. First, I get to my gate to be told I have to check a bag. I explained how ESAs do not count as a carry on to which the woman counted “1 bag, 2 bag, 3 bag” like I was an idiot. I said, “yes I understand there are three. One is an EAA which doesn’t count.” This woman was so rude to me and her boss finally came over and said that I was allowed to take all three bags onto the plane. THEN, I get on the plane only for someone else to come tell me my ESA wasn’t registered. I explained that I sent the form in and had a hard copy. She said that the hard copy wasn’t signed by my doctor. I said yes, I know, I have an online version on my laptop. They made me take out all my carry ins and get my laptop out only to be told that an online signature Doesn’t count. I explained that because of the virus I literally couldn’t see my doctor in person..duh. She said you have to pay 125 or get off the plane. I was like absolutely not it’s not my fault American lacks the organizational skills to equip ESAs. I said I sent the paperwork on and it was approved both online and in person at the front desk. They finally let me stay. She said she was “giving me the benefit of the doubt.”Ridiculous. Never again. I understand why these flights are so cheap; it’s because they have the worst customer service."
Date of travel: June 2020,30,"If you take COVID precautions seriously, fly American at your own risk.","I understand many folks think COVID precautions are nonsense or even destructive.That being said, today we flew two different airlines called American Eagle.One took all necessary precautions throughout the process.The treated the precautions with passive indifference.Crowded concourses and full flights could be viewed as a potential potent purveyors of plague.My diabetic cancer survivor wife and I pray we are over reacting."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,The worse Airline EVER,"My Mom had a connecting flight from DC to Chicago last week. She had a extra bag which she paid for online ($200). She purchased the extra bag with her ticket from Qatar Air line. Her final destination was Tehran, Iran The problem started when the associate at American Airline said we didn't pay for the extra bag and we need to pay again. We had the receipt and showed it to the supervisor but the supervisor was so rude and didn't want to hear me at all. She kept saying you need to pay again, you need to pay again. Her boss walked by and she looked at me and said ""I dont care you what receipt you have it's not in our system so we can't take your bag. keep in mind we travel a loooooot. My family travels alllll the times and we NEVER  run into any problems. I explained to the supervisor that what I'm guessing is that you guys probably haven't received the payment from QatarAL yet and that's not my problem, it's between you guys. As muti billion dollar companies you guys need to get better at communication. So anyways the supervisors at American Airline were so rude and not friendly or helpful at all. That day my mom end up paying $200 extra for her bag to get in an empty air plane. We later called Qatar Airline and told them about the situation and they said we had the receipt and AAL Should've accepted the extra bag. Qatar used that as an excuse to not give us our money back  and they basically said you guys had the receipt and they should've accepted the bag. My problem is not the money, it's the lack customer service in the AAL culture. . I understand customers are not always right but as a supervisor you have to be able to be a leader and control the situation instead of being rude and offering nothing to better the situation. I will never fly with AAL again and I will advise you too if you're not trying to deal with people who would make your life a bit harder."
Date of travel: June 2020,20,Limiting Seat,American has given up on their own promise to limit seating due to covid 19 I flew 4 times on American in 2 weeks and each flight was packed. So we give them 4 billion dollars and they repay us by jamming every flight and offering zero service. WTF? If you are going to pack every plane stop lying about it and at least offer some service.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Customer Service - What is that?,What a shame to Customer Service profession as well as American Airline community Kimberly (#EKS) is!She was very rude and talking over me to even answer her questions to understand the reason for my call. After waiting almost an hr to talk to someone like Kimberly (#EKS) was an awful experience.Shame on you Kimberly (#EKS) and your immediate manager who has not paid attention to your incompetence as a human being.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,X,COVID 19 LIARS. My fiancee received an e mail saying that his flight was filling up and offering another flight. We called there were no flights that day.So we asked the associate what American was doing for social distancing. The associate assured us that the middle seats would be unoccupied and the plane would be no were near full. This was a lie only 7 open seats and most middle seats were occupied. I called and spoke to a supervisor Willie RNM...I could barley understand his English and he basically told me sorry but things are starting to open up soon.He had no answer when I replied soon but not yet and the attendant lied to us over the phone. American is more concerned with $$$ than the safety of its customers.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Beware the Award Miles System,"My wife and I had 64,000 ""miles"" from my mother's estate. Of course, they aren't miles, they are points (this misnomer is only the first part of the process that is misleading by design). If I were more experienced at booking flights (which I am now- believe me), I would have known better, but when the system told me that it would require 84,000 reward points to go to our destination, I though that was the total for both of us because the form asked how many were going and the results screen did not say it would be 84,000 per person. So I foolishly bought 20,000 more unrefundable miles. Only when I then slected the type of seat I wanted did the new screen inform me that seats would cost 84K PER PERSON. That is not nice."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Worst flight experience ever,"Booked with Alaska and AA was first up to connect me to Chicago, flight was late so missed connecting flight. First attendant was rude and insentive to my frustration and didn’t help me. Second attendant told me to call AA as they were the ones who caused the missed flight. Call AA and they told me flight won’t be till tomorrow and I’d have another connecting flight to Dallas. No thanks what if I’m late again?! Then I asked where am I suppose to sleep and they said well you’ll have to go pay for a hotel for the night, outof pocket 🤦🏼‍♂️  I’ve had delayed flights before and have been treated very well with other airlines. This one takes the cake. Never again"
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Good,"Nothing good or bad about this flight. Service wasn't on the level of how I get from Japanese airlines but nobody was rude, quarters weren't dirty, etc. Will use AA again, thanks!"

Date of travel: June 2020,10,American Airlines is only after your money and I don't care about how I treat your customer,I booked the flight from my daughter in California to come visit me in Colorado 2 months ago. American Airlines change the flight by 12 hours and didn't tell me. Instead of spending four days with my daughter I get to spend one whole day with my daughter and I only see her once a year. When I called American Airlines and ask them why they did not let me know 14 days in advance as their policy requires all they could say what they were sorry and offered me a refund. My daughter is flying in tomorrow it's a little late for a refund to try to find another flight. Alfred no compensation whatsoever and I got a lot of money on a reservation at a hotel I lost money on having to rebook a car rental and I lost money on purchasing a pass to go on a hike and the representative at American Airlines only offered a refund. This is unacceptable customer service!
Date of travel: June 2020,20,Absoulelty terrible,The flight attendants are rude. The one on this picture was a complete jerk who tried 5o make me feel it was my fault the flight was delayed when we've already been delayed for over 2 hours. I needed to use the restroom.flight aa496
Date of travel: June 2020,10,AVOID AA-FALSE ADVERTISING,"HAD To travel. Received a msg from AA two days prior to departure indicating flight “busy” and I may want to consider changing flight - click below to change flight. Clicked and response was no change options available (or wording to that effect). Had no alternative other than to Watch flight and seats closely. Changed seat day before departure (June 1) to ensure most space between me and others. Arrive DFW. Lots of signage, recordings and announcements Re mask requirements onboard and social distancing. At gate many without masks (including crew servicing plane I was about to get on)!  Wayyy too many people on this flight. Doors close and attendant starts making and allowing many seat changes in my area. I was in row 18A and row was empty when I chose seat and when doors closed. Within minutes attendant had THREE strangers sitting in the TWO seats in my row that were previously empty resulting in a young couple eventually settling in. I let the chaos conclude and looked around plane for more open rows (and there were!). After takeoff I spoke with a different attendant from the one who allowed the chaotic seat changes and indicated that I was not comfortable in a row of 3 and could I move to a row with less. (Please note I had paid for this seat and would have paid more for more space!). Long story short. Request to move was DENIED (seriously!!) stating most rows have 3 people (NOTE:  there were rows with less than 3) and that she could not GIVE me the row in front of me (I did not ASK for it) because it’s an exit row. At that point = trapped and uncomfortable and told attendant AA Just lost a long time customer and that AA could take the 2 credit cards I hold and shove them too!  (Maybe she will remember me saying that and it will be easy for AA to ID her and either retrain her or kick her to the curb!). I would not recommend traveling with AA. I will not do ANY business with them. They tout the phrase “Social Distancing” and its a clever tactic to get the business of those who may be wanting to feel a little safer about traveling. They have NO IDEA of its meaning nor do they even attempt to keep their passengers safe (as can be at this time)! Oh and may I add that the female in my row chose to remove her mask during part of the flight. Unless you WANT to be packed in very small seats in grossly oversold planes avoid AA at all costs!  I will use every venue I know to report this deplorable situation!"

I slept about 30 minutes. We landed some 30 minutes early"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,I was deceived so I would buy a ticket,"I am a Chilean citizen currently studying in the UK. I got a ticket from London to Santiago with a connection in Miami (MIA). At the airport, I was not allowed to travel because of US restrictions.The main problem with this is that I called American airlines several times (before and after buying the ticket) and during the calls, I asked if connecting through the US was possible, and every time they said there should be no problem, they said they checked in the computers. Later I had to stay in a hotel near the airport, as I was left with no solution and on my own at Heathrow.  I thought this would be temporary, but the next flight to Santiago was 2 weeks later, so I had to pay £800 more than expected.I asked for a refund of the £1123.00 the ticket cost to me in order to cover the hotel and food expenses, but they said this was not possible as my ticket was not refundable, but that I could use the value of the ticket with the company. I am not interested in travelling with American at any time soon, but the money would be more useful as now I and my family are struggling monetarily because of this.I do not get why they sold me the ticket in the first place, as it was known I could not travel. I know the countries’ restrictions are very confusing, but that is why I asked, as an airline, they deal with this every day.I feel like I was lied to so they could get money from me."

Date of travel: May 2020,20,Refused refund after initiating the process online,"A family member was to fly but unable to obtain identification with the DMV closed. A spokesperson from American Airlines was told of the situation,  the flight was cancelled before scheduled time, and was told that there was a good chance the ticket would be refunded. Out 491.00, the ticket cannot be transferred to the purchaser, and the person it was bought for cannot fly before it expires."
Date of travel: May 2020,30,Checked Bag Fees,"I booked a flight for my wife with my frequent flyer miles, and charged the fees on my American Airlines credit card.  The credit card promises no checked baggage fees for you and family members when you use the card.  What they don't tell you is that you have to be booked on the flight with them to get the free baggage check.  There is no way that this is spelled out in the credit card agreement.  Just another way that American takes advantage of its customers during hard times."
Date of travel: June 2019,10,This is not the airline you are looking for,"What happened to the days when an airline screwed up they helped make everything better? Never take this airline they are just as bad as the budget airlines and will never take responsibility for their actions. I hate going with Frontier or Spirit airlines but i wish i did this time, American airlines is no better then the budget based airlines.

Date of travel: May 2020,30,Inconsistent policy regarding passenger wearing masks.,"Even though AA has posted an official policy of only allowing passengers wearing masks to board, AA Flight 2 on May 28, 2020 was understandably crowded as it is a popular fight but had at least one passenger allowed to board while not wearing a mask. I do not know if the passenger was offered a mask and declined or not. This was a crowded flight with many middle seats filled. I think AA should either enforce their policy or not have one at all. I saw a lot of very nervous passengers who were seated around this passenger. It threw all of AA public stated concerns and their efforts to make the cabin safe for travel in question. I do applaud the top notch fight crew who had to work in these conditions."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I originally had a reservation to fly to Sacramento on June 2 (landing 11:57am) from Phoenix (leaving 5:15 am) using a connecting flight from Dallas. However, I received an email on May 29th saying that the flight was busy and the company was willing to change flights for free if I clicked on the link. I clicked on the link but ""system error"" was all that came up.Due to this, I called customer service for tickets and talked to a lady about changing times. She told me that all planes arrived at the same time and there was a plane leaving at 9:20am. I thought what a great time and was happy that the arriving time stayed the same based on what I was told. However, when I looked at the times I saw that the plane is arriving in Sacramento at 7pm. I was very upset and disappointed about the miscommunication that the service lady provided me. I called ticket service again to try to get my flight adjusted to either the original reservation or time/date where landing into Sacramento was not so late. However, there was no flights that worked. I asked for the supervisor to see if they can do anything due to the miscommunication. The supervisor was rude and tried to put the blame on me. She said something about ""How I should of done the calculation"" and that she was not willing to work with me. The original flight that I had reservations for, just a couple of hours ago, now only had one seat left so that was not an option. I have never been treated so poorly before and I'm astounished how the service I was provided was not customer oriented. At this moment after this trip, I will not be using American Airlines for sometime if ever again. END STORY DO NOT USE AA! if you want good customer service"

Date of travel: May 2020,10,Terrible terrible customer service ,"Booked a flight for about a month out and had a family death so I tried to switch my dates called and they said it would be $600+ extra to switch flights so I just told them I wanted to cancel and go with a different airline and since I called within 24hr of booking my flight I would get a full refund to my card I had paid with. She confirmed that my flights would be canceled and I would get a refund. Yesterday I get an email telling me to check-in for my flight that was supposed to be canceled. I called and the lady was kind and told me she would cancel my flight but I would have to send an email and explain why I would like to get a refund on my card instead of credit towards the airline. I sent the email and got a call, explained my situation, and the man told me that all he has on file is that I called and canceled today which is after the 24hr of booking so I’m not able to get a refund on my card for the $1000+ this flight has added up to be and that I can only get a credit towards future flights. I asked him if he could listen to the recording of the conversation I had with the lady that I clearly stated I wanted to cancel my flight, he told me he does not have access to listen to the phone recordings (what are they for then) and was being extremely rude and would not try to do anything for me. He also would not let me speak with anyone else and told me all I could do was send another email stating the same thing and he himself would review it again and the same thing would happen."

Date of travel: May 2020,10,I hope American Airlines fails.,"I know everyone is having a very difficult time with travel and airlines these days, however, American Airlines deserves to be called out on their policies, their lack of social distancing, and their treatment of their clients.We had round trip tickets from New York to Buenos Aires, where we live during the winter months. American Airlines never notified us that they were cancelling our return flight, and I know this has happened to friends as well. My partner had to stand in the heat for two hours in line in order to clarify the situation. After months, with help from the U.S. Embassy, we finally took a flight from Buenos Aires to Miami on another airline. We boarded our first class seats on American from Miami to Laguardia only to find that American had sold every single seat on the airplane. So much for social distancing! They handed us a bag with water and chips, blaming the lack of service on the pandemic, however there was no reduction in price. They would've done much better to hand us Clorox wipes. It was a complete disgrace given what the World Health Organization recommends. This airline should be avoided. They only have their own self interest at heart!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Ms,Absolute GARBAGE . And the women working are atrocious jealous counterproductive and dangerously stupid . Be careful and fly virgin :)l
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Social distancing?,They made many announcements about social distancing yet filled the cabin to about 100% capacity. Mask on the plane wasn’t even enforced. People would eat/drink the snacks that where handed out then just keep their mask off for the remainder of the fight. A flight attendant even had his mask off the whole flight. Are employees immuned to covid-19? Maybe they had the vaccine already.
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Terrible. Worst flight experience of my life.,"TERRIBLE. WORST FLYING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!Let me start by saying I am not one to complain or even take the time to write reviews but I am so upset and this is all I can do! the aircraft was terrible old quality. It didn’t feel safe, nor comfortable. Crammed space and no leg room at all. Tiny windows that you can’t see out of unless you’re in the window seat. I am supposed to arrive back home tonight at 10pm. I have to work tomorrow morning. I can not miss work. They let me know that my flight was delayed (causing me to miss my connecting flight. I’d either have to pay for an entire new flight or pay for a hotel in the connecting city because I won’t get home in time). They are allowing me to change flights at no charge of course, but this doesn’t help me since the next available isn’t for 24 hours. Meaning I won’t just be late for work but I will miss the day entire DAY of appointments. When I called customer service they said there’s nothing they can do for me, and HUNG UP ON ME! I’m screwed over."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,I cancelled the same day and they have my refund under review,I contacted an agent who told me they would send a refund within five days. That was three weeks ago. I go to their refund site and it read Pending Review.I think they are stalling in case they go bankrupt - they are liers
Date of travel: May 2020,50,Thank you for quick COVID refund!,"We booked back in Dec for a trip to St. Lucia the beginning of June.  Several of us could not have safely traveled during this pandemic and we were waiting it out to see if our flights would be canceled. I followed two pieces of advice I found online; wait as long as you can to see what the airlines will do and speak very politely to the customer service folks. By mid May, our flights were changed enough that we qualified for a full refund. I was leery of canceling online as our family of 7 was flying on several different reservation numbers and it wasn't clear I would get a refund. I called AA and requested a call back. I very politely let them know that I was worried about our trip and unsure how to wrangle all the different reservations. The customer service folks were very understanding and did a great job of sorting out all the reservations, assuring me we would get a refund and making sure I had all the info to request refunds for each ticket. I did have to enter each ticket separately online to request a refund, but two weeks later and the refunds have all shown up on my credit card. We really appreciate the great service and hope to re-book in the future!"
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Extremely poor customer service,"We had to cancel a trip to Costa Rica due to COVID 19 and the Costa Rican government not allowing visitors into the country. Communication from American Airlines was nonexistent. After canceling our flight, we were told by the airline that customer service could only be reached by online form or written letter.  We have done both repeatedly with no response.  This is very disappointing. I expected more from this airline. I understand initially they were likely very busy, however it has now been over two months and we have heard nothing."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,UNIQUE WAY OF CHEATING CUSTOMERS,"Booked the shuttle from Kingston, Jamaica to Miami, USA. PNR : VWUVIY. The booking reservation was sent to me without a ticket number.The trip got cancelled due to Covid-19 crisis. When I went to ask for refunds on AA.com, they asked for my Ticket No which was kept pending and wasn't sent to me. So, I couldn't claim for a refund.I have never encountered such a unique way of duping/cheating people of their hard-earned money, thanks to American Airlines. It's surprising to see that this Airline can still fly in USA. Delta have refunded my money. JetBlue has kept them in the travel wallet for future flights, but AA sucks. Will take legal recourse against them. Let's see how they can operate from India.Have promised to pay three times the airfare to any other airline than flying AA. I never like to fly with a Cheat and a Fraudster."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Jam packed plan during COVID- Lied to by American Airlines.,"Required for health to travel during COVID. They only care about the money- not safety. No reason to jam pack flights during Covid. I only booked with American because they stated on the website they would not fill the plan. I feel they were not honest with any of us passengers and put our health at risk. On top of having a jammed back flight, why would they not board from the back to the plan to the the front? Such a simple way to minimize contact. I will never fly with American Airlines again."
Date of travel: May 2020,20,Packed Flight,"So much for empty middle rows on the plane. The first plane we were on had an issue and they crammed us in another plane that was supposed to be bigger. People are packed pretty tight on this plane. If you want people to fly, give them space and have your planes work."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,THIS AIRLINE SUCKS,"AA is the absolute worst!  On a scale of 1-10, they are a negative 20!  On the first leg of our trip, we decided to try to upgrade to first class. The system online said seats were available, my husband clicked, we were IMMEDIATELY charged and when he went to chose our new seats in first class, there was only 1, not 2 like the system said.  We called the airline and asked for a refund...still waiting on that.  When we called, they assured us they were practicing social distancing.  THEY DO NOT PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING....THE FLIGHT WAS OVERSOLD AND WAS PACKED!!  When my husband went online to check us in for our return flight, our seats were gone.  We called once again.  It turns out they changed planes and eliminated our seats and then wanted us to PAY EXTRA $$ SO WE COULD SIT TOGETHER!!  They absolutely REFUSED to do anything about our seats and basically said ""tough"".  We spoke with ""Jonathan"" who was supposedly a manager.  He is the one who said too bad, after the agent told us the same thing.  THEN, when they transfer for you for the survey on how the service was, the chickenshit Jonathan transferred us to a different department so we could not give him a bad review.  Cannot wait for this company to go belly up!  Better use those free points people.  Another employee said they were going to make them go away so people can't use them before they file bankruptcy!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Rude,"Lady at the front gate, she looked Indian, was really rude. All I said was “Hello” and she right away gave me an attitude and asked if it was for my seating assignment because they would call my name. Which is completely fine, but I value customer service and with all the anxiety going on with traveling it would just be nice to have basic customer service from their employees. - Gate A51 at 1:33 PM."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,"No Social Distancing, Dirty Planes, Packed Flights","I am writing this while on the plane.  This is a round-trip for essential business from MCO to MRY (connecting through DFW).I am a business traveler and this is my 4th flight this week.  I receive weekly emails from AA stating how they care for customers and are going through extraordinary efforts to sanitize planes during the COVID crisis.  I am not seeing any real evidence of that.My flights between MCO and DFW were absolutely packed.  No social distancing in effect on jetway, boarding, exiting or seating on flight.  NTSA needs to step-in and regulate and enforce social distancing.   Planes are not clean either.  Plane was just cleaned between flights and their are cookie crumbs all over my seat (thought the seat belt is nicely folded).  My previous flight that was supposedly thoroughly cleaned still had the dirty wipes from the previous passenger stuffed in the seat pocket.  These are serious quality control issues.Its an interesting contrast when so many hospitality businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and stores are being so very careful to enforce social distancing and cleanliness.  I just don't see AA taking this serious, despite repeated announcements that they are.  It appears its business as usual for AA despite the COVID crisis."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Horrible Horrible airline company,Absolutely atrocious customer service. This airline is a horrible company and is NOT worth the cheaper flights. They have little resect or sympathy for their customers and their plans and payment.
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Management,My flight left today from Atlanta at 8 am.get into Dallas ft work the crew didn't show up to work plane is having problems no one knows anything. We keep getting on and off the plane please don't fly with American airline ever
Date of travel: May 2020,20,All Four Flights Completely Full,"I took a quick 3 day weekend to Georgia since it was open for a few weeks, going well, and Savannah is a great place to see the sites while able to be socially distant. I had heard the airlines were taking precautions like keeping middle seats open.That was not the case at all. Yes, they required masks, and they handed out water bottles and package of cookies upon boarding in your own little paper bag, but each of my four flights were completely full. Both big jets and smaller planes...packed to the gills.I'm just a person trying to use common sense, not paranoid at all. I was a letter to have a great time in Savannah & keep safe, but non of my flights on AA felt safe at all. I felt when I got home like I needed to self quarantine because of the full flights. AA should have disclosed the flights could be full when we were booking!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Mr,If I could give 0 rates I will very bad customer service my wife had a ticket and did all check in require for her and her kitten then was inside the plane one of the attending told her she have to leave the plane because her kitten cage won't fit under her chair she told him there is plenty empty space she can pay for a seat to her kitten he refuse and get her out the ✈️The ✈️ took off and his supervisor told he he shouldn't get my wife out and there was many space he can put her inThey will hear from my lawyer soon
Date of travel: May 2020,10,They are GREEDY,"I have to say that Covid 19 has affected everyone in different ways. Everyone has to comply with the mask, the social distancing, and the complete inconvenience. The airlines are giving false advertisement when they say that the middle seats are blocked off for Social Distancing. AA is not, they don’t serve drinks or snacks but they will sit people on top of each other. In my town people were almost arrested for having a picnic in the park and playing football with there kids but we can fill the plane like sardines. They have cut flights down to 90% but please put people lives at risk. I know it’s a choice to fly but the airlines should be held to the same stands as everyone else on the ground if not stricter."

Date of travel: May 2020,10,HORRBLE/RACIST,"I would never fly Miami International American Airlines again!! They were very dismissive towards me and refused to assist with my flight issue because i was not hispanic. They put me (AN ESSENTAL WORKER) on a flight for the next day and i was denied a flight again due there being no more seats. I had my job, my money, and my safety on the line and they did nothing at all to help. DISGUSTING ! STICK TO DELTA"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,NO social distancing on my 4 hour flight,"I am very disappointed w/ American Airlines.They talk about how they're creating more space inflight through May 31, 2020 - to give passengers more space and about how their #1 goal is to keep everyone ""as safe as possible.""But my flight on May 16 from LAX->ORD was full!Although I paid to select my own seat, I was moved to a MIDDLE seat and had to sit right between 2 people for the 4 hour flight!It's obvious that American Airlines is more concerned about filling the plane and their financials than keeping anyone safe.I would rate them a ""0"" for their concern for passenger (and crew) safety!"
Date of travel: May 2020,20,Where’s the social distancing,My wife hade to fly back to Maryland for a family emergency.  She said there was no social distancing and the plane was packed!!! She said something to the flight attendant which replayed we can only fly full flights if we intend on staying in business.
Date of travel: May 2020,10,ABSOLUTELY SUCKS DO NOT FLY,"This is the worst airline. I hate flying them. I had to fly through Dallas to get back to San Francisco. The plane to Dallas was on time but they stayed on the runway for 45 minutes. I ran to my gate for my next flight but the FLIGHT LEFT EARLY WITHOUT ME EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW I WAS COMING AND THERE WAS NO OTHER FLIGHT.  Now I am in a long long line with everyone else to find out what else is next and who wants to stay in a seedy hotel with Covid going on. Absolutely no customer service. I hope they go out of business and our tax dollars do not support them. I have always avoided them, but NEVER AGAIN."
Date of travel: May 2020,30,Social Distancing,Airlines are not practicing social distancing onboard. In terminals you’ll hear to wear masks and practice social distancing. At gate you will be asked to not congregate. While boarding you must wear a mask and social distance. Once onboard you will find most seats are filled including middle seats. You are given option to request a seat change if available and the flight attendant will ask you to keep your mask on during entire flight except if eating or drinking.
Date of travel: May 2020,10,NO social distancing on flights,"First of all, I changed my seat on my first flight because I was uncomfortable with how they sat us all close together and the flight attendant gave me such attitude. My second flight was completely full and there was no effort to social distance. Horrible. A lot of people were visibly upset and many were verbally complaining. At least if you're going to have packed flights, WARN people ahead of time and give them a choice to switch planes or something.Horrible customer service!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,COVID-19,"On May 13th, I flew American Airlines from Tucson, Arizona to Portland Maine. The trip had three segments, two layovers. Tucson to Dallas, Dallas to Philadelphia, Philadelphia to Portland Maine.When I booked the flights, I booked on the premise that American would follow the medical guidelines as they relate to COVID-19, In particular social distancing. At the terminals, American is serious all customers must wear masks and practice social distancing. Not so on any of my flights. The planes were full, as if there is no pandemic. American advertises every middle seat will be vacant. Not true. On my flights there were elderly and children. In my opinion, American has compromised the well being of all on these flights.Had I known the planes would be full, I would not have flown.I cannot express how concerned I am.Please be careful and stay well."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,No social distancing on a sold out flight,"Terrible flight, just because of the profit over people. My flight was completely full, how can you “social distance” when you are crammed in like sardines! I’ll never fly American, if ever again...if myself or anyone else gets sick from this, I will pursue a class action lawsuit. I can only pray..."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Absolutely God Awful Customer Service,"AA has absolutely the worst customer service department. Every-time I have called I have always been met with abusive customer service representatives and managers. I do not understand why they have not fired their customer service department by now and replaced them with more friendly people and advanced training on customer service. If you plan to call them, be prepared to met with customer service representatives that will berate and make you feel un-valued as a customer. If I could rate them a -10 I would rate them as such. I say to them ""Bless your Heart"". I will never fly with AA again."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Verbally Abusive Customer Service,"I will now go out of my way to avoid AA at all costs, and here is why. I arrived to my flight 2 hours early. The bag check in desk printed my flight at gate 10, the person at the desk told me sit by gate 10, gate 10 had my departure time, flight number and destination on the board. When time was near to boarding no one was there. With 15 minutes to spair I ask the personnel woman at Gate 8, 50 ft away from gate 10, if everything is ok w my flight. To which the personel behind the desk said "" we are done boarding, where were you""? I responded ""where I was told to go"". I missed my job interview,  business meeting, but the gentleman next to me missed his Fathers funeral. As you could imagine he was very upset. No one told us, no one called us, no one looked for us. The worst part is they lied. They lied to our face that they called us over the intercom. We were two rows over. I would have understood a mistake, but to out right lie to our faces is inexcusable. We had to argue with a manager that we be rescheduled because we were still being blamed for their mistake. When the gentleman asked what is he supposed to do with a flight that lands 6 hours late, the personel yelled ""YOU'RE AN ADULT!!! FIGURE IT OUT!!!"". This man just lost his father and because of this mistake he can't be at his funeral. The manager did nothing but hold the door for her as she walked outside."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Bait and Switch,"AA cancelled my flight at the terminal with no warning or email notification.  My flight was cancelled and they offered no assistance for same day resolution.  After looking on departure board, I noticed their was a flight to Philadelphia.  Co absolutely baited and switched. The flight which had less than 10 people on it, Cost 5X the cost of originally agreedUpon price to New York.  Called AA today and they are blaming me, the customer for their incompetence. I understand things happen but the way this entire situation was handled was absolutely horrible.  What a garbage co. I will never fly American again.  American should get out the people business and transport packages and livestock.  Sincerely Stranded, Baited,Switched and Screwed in Savannah."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Not abiding by any social distancing rules!!!,DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE UNTIL THERES A CURE FOR COVID 19!!! Flights are pack without social distancing. Customer service is the worst that I’ve ever imagined possible for an airline in business that many years!!
Date of travel: May 2020,20,Not at all what I had envisioned..,"The flight from Montreal to Charlotte was very nice.  With the Covid-19 Pandemic people were properly spaced and socially distant.  However, when I arrived at Charlotte, N.C. Airport, I was appalled!!  There were no social distance metrics in place. The attendant at the podium told us to enter the plane six feet apart.  They let first class on first, then filled the entire plane!  At least they could have filled the plane from the back forward. I’m going to have my COVID-19 test tomorrow and pray to God I do not have it. I would not recommend this airline, especially seeing as my taxpayer dollars are funding them!!!!!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Changed my flight without contacting me and I had to cancel a lot of plans! - Have not traveled yet.,"I am irate. I had book this flight back on April 30th, with the intention and planning of arriving in San Diego at approximately 1:43pm on May 14th. However, my flight time was changed, which, tends to happen. What I am upset about, is the fact that I received NO ALERT. NO CONTACT was made with me to inform me of my flight change. I had to log on to the American Airlines website to see that my flight was changed. 'Surely this must be a mistake' I thought, as I had heard nothing from American Airlines. When I called the Customer Service number and finally got ahold of an agent, I was told that, ""it says in the notes that someone had called you on May 6th to inform you of your flight change, and that they left a message.""I checked the calls on my phone, I had ZERO missed calls from anyone on May 6th. I then checked my voicemails (and deleted voicemails) to find a message on May 6th from a number that was only 5 seconds of static, and nothing more. Below the message play button, the words showed ""Unable to Transcribe This Message"".So not only was I attempted to be contacted ONLY ONCE, but I was also only contacted via voicemail. When I asked the agent why I hadn't received an email as well, they stated ""I'm not sure, I'm sorry about that"".Then I asked if there were any other flights available from any other New York City airports that would get me in earlier. Unfortunately there were none. After explaining that this miscommunication would set me back a night in my final destination (as well as having to COMPLETELY alter my plans with my acquaintances), and explaining that I was going to lose a deposit, I asked if I could be compensated with miles or some sort of refund. I received the answer, ""I'm sorry, but it's not within my ability to do something like that.""I am now having to cancel time with friends (some I haven't seen for 5 years!), family, and lose my deposit, all because of this negligence.I am sorely disappointed."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Customer service,"Awful, I would not recommend this airline to anyone else and I will not be using them in the future."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Really excellent crew that made a short flight great.,Carolyn CC flight attendant What an angel. Best flight experience I’ve ever had. Immediately Carolyn is so genuinely sweet and warm that I wish I could fly with her every time. Beyond exceptional customer service skills. You can just tell how hardworking this woman is and it shows on all levels.
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Absolute garbage airline,"The employees are rude, they changed our flight twice and gave us wrong times then made us pay money to change it to a more convenient time then the one they chosen without consulting us. The online boarding passes were glitchy and hard to use, and the internet service on the plane was horrible as well. I will never travel with American airlines again!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Dangerous,American Airlines is NOT complying with the social distancing policy!  I flew because of the reassurance that every other seat was  left open and that social distancing was in effect. The flight was completely full!  There was maybe two empty seats.  When we received our seat assignments my husband and I were in different rows.  I assumed this was due to their social distance policy!  I could not have been more wrong!  We were in different rows seated next to complete strangers.  The mask was required to board the plane but after that people removed them and not one person was asked to put their mask back on.  The flight attendants did offer the option to change seats with the exception of the back and front rows to protect the crew and allow them social distance!  How thoughtful of them!  It wa then announced that the option to change seats wasn't available because the flight was full!  I will NOT fly on American again!  Obviously their bottom line is more important than the well being and safety of their customers!
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Garbage airline,"Worst customer service I’ve ever experience. Rude, dishonest and were not willing to help find me a same day flight. Highly recommend going with a real airline, Delta instead. Thanks for ruining my only vacation this year american airlines. Piss on you."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Complete failure to protect passenger & staff during COVID pandemic,"American Airlines should be ashamed for putting both their customers and their employees at risk during the COVID pandemic. Some of us don't have a choice but to fly right now, whether that's for a family emergency or other reason, although the risks of doing so are obvious. I was some what reassured by my experience with Delta (flown on the first leg of my trip); Delta required face masks on their passengers and crew, managed to not overbook their flights thus creating reasonable distancing on board, AND managed to provide each passenger with a consolation bag (no in-flight service) of water, snack and hand sanitizer. Meanwhile, American Airlines could not even manage to require face masks. My flight home from SC on AA was a nightmare. People crammed together, many opting not to wear face masks because the airline didn't require it until May 11, and not even a bottle of water offered. What's the point of having attendants make a big speech instructing passengers not to crowd galley ways or bulkheads because the airline is practicing ""safe social distancing,"" when the airline had already failed at that before any of us even set foot on the plane?"
Date of travel: May 2020,50,A plus,"I would like to complement the entire crew of flight #809 from Tampa to Philadelphia on May 8th at 2:21 Pm for caring and handling my situation so well. At security checkpoint they forgot to put my personal items back to my backpack, including all my keys. I realized it on the plane when the door were already closed. I dumped the entire content of my backpack on the seat next to me and there was no key. I told the flight attendant I need to leave the plane. I was panicking and sweating imagining arriving in Philly without my car and house key and all the problems involved. I would rather book another flight. But the captain came, calmed me down and send somebody to get my keys from security checkpoint. The flight attendants offered glass of water to calm me down. Thank you for A plus service and caring."
Date of travel: August 2019,10,Unethical business tactics regarding refunds,"We paid for 1st class round trip ticket from San Francisco to Rome in 2016. Our return flight was cancelled and we were put in coach on another flight and told there would be a refund which would be $2614.80. We called AA 4 times that year with promises the payment was coming. We finally tried Airhelp and they refused to respond to Airhelp. So we keep trying and today, 4 years later, they tell us it is too late. Unethical and disgusting business tactic. They owes us $2814.80, they know it, we know it but they will do nothing about it."
Date of travel: May 2020,20,Extremely disappointed in covid-19 accommodations,"Just flew West Palm Beach to Chicago extremely disappointed in Americans accommodation to covid-19. Many passengers not wearing masks. One passenger behind me repeatedly coughed and became hostile when I asked him to cover his mouth. 3 passengers within 6 ft with no mask. Not even one mention of covid-19 adaptations during check-in or flight. No request to social distance. Passengers deplaning close to each other breathing heavily on other people. No offers of face masks, cleaning wipes, or hand sanitizing at airport or on plane. Seems like American has had their head in the sand for the past month and adapted much less to covid-19 than Walgreens, Publix Supermarkets, Home Depot, and Lowe's, They need to do better, much much better if they ever want to get the public to fly again I will choose Delta next time instead of American"

Date of travel: February 2020,10,Horrible Experience,"I am disgusted by the service I received for this trip. I booked off of Justfly 3rd party booking, I paid for my seat do to my shoulder disability restrictions I needed to be with my left shoulder toward the window. A day before my flight it showed I no longer had a seat reserved I called Justfly who said I needed to call Finnair who then said I needed to call justly and then of course directed to American Airlines where I asked why I was told if you don’t book direct it is only a request not a guarantee. (Who pays for a request? And why was this never advised?). So I had to get a seat once again. I arrived to the airport after a 4 hour drive which got cancelled less than 3 hours before take off due to weather. I called AA who insisted they could not rebook me I would have to call Justfly or Finnair and called both whom directed back to AA I repeated this cycle 3+ times before AA finally put me on a flight the following day. I had to pay for a hotel for the night as well as transportation because I did not live there and I was dropped off for my flight. I got put on a packed flight and of course had to pay for ANOTHER seat which did not accommodate my seating needs. I was miserable the whole flight in horrible pain due to my shoulder, I have to lean into the window and could not do so because I got put in a right side window seat. When I rebooked I was advised to call after I get to my destination and request a partial to full refund so that is what I did, of course again no one wanted to speak to me I was just referred in circles again between justly, Finnair and American Airlines. I do not feel Finnair honestly could help me in anyway however Justly and AA chose not to I ended up asking to talk to a manager when calling AA. A gentleman got on the phone and overtasked me, would not listen and his response was “if you have the a problem call the weather station and complain not us” I asked for his name and in return he hung up in my face. I then moved on to chat so I could track just how badly the service was between all parties. I have never felt so undervalued by a business I give a lot of money to in my life. Out of all the people I spoke with not one even showed the littlest bit of WANTING to help me or understand my frustrations."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,"Disappointing service, disappointing customer relations.","Was stranded in the US for an extra 8 days over my scheduled return home date due to American Airlines cancelling my flight from CLT-LHR. When I tried to make a claim with my insurance company and asked for American Airlines customer services representatives to outline that my flight had to be cancelled and rescheduled due to CLT not being a government approved gateway, as per their press release statement, they refused to do so. They instead said CV19 safety precautions even after I explained what and why I needed this info, 3 times. I was transferred to a BA flight from STL- Chicago - LHR which had no social distancing on board. The flight was completed full with many unwell, elderly and pregnant people on board and we were crammed in like sardines. On this flight my seat was moved several times so others could sit together, it was very stressful.  American Airlines claim they have social distancing in place but this doesn’t extend to international flights. A shame really. I wish they could be more transparent and helpful to frequent, loyal flyers during this time. Will not be flying with American again anytime soon. Attached is a picture of an air hostess in Chicago taking selfies amid a pandemic, as if the cancelled flights are a joke. The picture was taken after she called me to the desk for a passport check and then telling me to go sit down (for 1h)."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Hours spent on hold and then hung up on. Waste of time. Poor value for money.,"After 2 hours of trying to cancel my trip, one disconnects. 1 month after my flight, I received a cancellation notice. That is how far behind they are. After an additional two hours trying to rebook, I was told I have a remaining voucher for $72 only valid on American Airlines cannot be used for baggage and expires in 1 year. That is going to be a waste as I will never fly American."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,AA in Miami can be a challenge,"I flew during the early days of the Covid-19 scare, so the planes were still pretty full, and since Miami is a huge Latin Hub, many spanish speakers were on-board. The Miami ground staff for AA is bi-lingual, as is the cabin staff - for good reason with the heavy South America passenger component. The reality is that English speakers often cannot understand the PA announcements, even the English versions because of the heavy latin accents. If you don't live in Miami be prepared to struggle with understanding the instructions. Having said that, I don't find AA  to be as bad as many of the reviews, I'm sure there are bad flights and bad crews on all airlines, I sometimes think the criticisms are a bit overdone, and most of my half dozen annual flights on AA are good to very good. As far as the physical facilities, AA's Miami concourses are impressive works of architecture. For those who flew here back in the 60's & 70's it is a matter of night and day - it does sprawl and you need to learn to use the people mover if you are over 60, but it is quite a nice facility. My one exclusion would be their airport lounges, during peak times they are  grossly overcrowded - the main terminal is more serene than the lounges during those periods.  All in all, I would rate my experience here as acceptable."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Honestly... it was better than I expected.,"Look, I've heard and read the same terrible things about AA that you have over the years, and as a result have generally avoided using it whenever possible. That said, in February we took a family vacation to Arizona — and found ourselves needing a flight home to Boston that was A) Nonstop; B) Not a redeye; and C) Not crushingly expensive. We usually fly Jetblue everywhere, but they only offered a redeye, so my choices were essentially American... and American.So we booked American, and after a great trip in AZ we arrived at Sky Harbor airport ready for what I'd anticipated would be a long and unpleasant flight — esp. given that we'd be seated near the back, and would be among the last to board.Turns out... it was totally fine.  Standing in line to drop off our luggage and check in? Relatively painless, and the agents were friendly and professional. Boarding?  Handled cleanly and without confusion. The seats? Reasonably sized and comfortable. Yeah, we missed the built-in seatback screens of JetBlue, but one quick app upload made it easy to stream video on our phones. (I just wish I'd been smart enough to download a couple of movies before we got to the airport -- my bad!)The flight was smooth and essentially on time, and - miracle of miracles - our bags even came out quickly and efficiently at Logan Airport (which NEVER happens when we fly Jetblue). So all things considered, it was a really good trip. I don't know if we just lucked out or if reviews here tend to skew negative just because it's hard to write a review of a flight that went fine, but... my trepidation, at least in one case, proved unfounded. Nice work, AA!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN,"I have had the absolute worst experience. They didn’t have a direct flight to Phoenix and both of my flights were delayed by 30+ minutes. The staff was not friendly. Honestly, everything about my experience with this airline was terrible. I will NEVER book another American flight again. DELTA IS THE WAY TO GO!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,I know for a fact that no one chooses to fly with this airline,"I feel so bad for people that fly this airline as I know they must have had no other option. What a horrible airline,  they change important flight information (flight #, departure time, etc.) often, the planes are dirty and outdated, the staff are remedial and rude. I'd rather fly on a small and questionable aircraft then by a ticket and give American Airlines my money."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Never again,"I flew from Ronald Reagan (Washington DC) to Wausau, Wisconsin via Chicago O'hare. The day started with a rude check-in agent who was passive aggressive and verbally assaulted me for not knowing how to put on my luggage tag. I asked for help but she was not happy. Pay for a checked bag and they make you feel terrible about it? Strike 1.TSA was pretty slow at Reagan but I can't fault the airline for that. Also the food options were very limited in the terminal and generic, I will happily fly out of BWI (1st choice) or Dulles (2nd choice) instead. Arrived at my gate about 2 hours early before boarding and relaxed. Before I knew it, the aircraft pulled up to the gate... wait, is that the emergency slide hanging off the side of the aircraft?! Yep, their crew accidentally deployed the slide so they delayed the flight 2 hours to repair it. I get it, mistakes happen and they brought out food and drinks for passengers to eat in the meantime. Not a bad thought and appreciated (the only good part it seems). After I got some food, I went up to the gate agent and confirmed I would not miss my connection in O'hare and she assured me I would not.2 Hours passes and they extend the delay another hour to make the repairs. At this point, I would miss my connection so I went to the gate agent again. I asked if I could get on another flight so I could make my connection and she asked my ticketing class. She gave me side eye and said ""oh theres nothing we can do"". From this point on, she refused to acknowledge or help me in any way. TStrike 2. To Customer Service I go to rebook my connection. See, this could all be avoided if my ticketing class was economy and not basic economy, lesson learned. My rebooking options were terrible and the only other flight from Chicago to Wausau was 8 hours after my original flight. This suddenly became the layover from hell. No compensation or anything, they would not work with me unless I bought a whole new ticket.  Strike 3.3 hours go by and still no word so they delayed the flight another 20 minutes. Then another 20. And another 20 minutes, no communication from staff and they would not let me rebook unless the flight cancelled. Essentially, they could delay into eternity and I would be held hostile. 5 hours and 45 minutes after the original departure we could board. The gate agent was yelling at everyone to board faster so we would not miss our departure slot and I was happy to leave Ronald Reagan. Strike 4.Arriving in O'hare, I went to the service desk to beg for compensation, all I could get was a meal voucher and boy did I have to move mountains for it. My connecting flight left on time (a regional jet) and the flight itself was a dream, minus the miserable flight attendant. Strike 4.5 (lol).Overall, I learned an important lesson, basic economy is tempting but you essentially sign over all your rights. It is fine if nothing goes wrong but if it does, you are mercifully screwed and at the will of the airline. Next time, I'll pay the extra $60 for economy but I will never fly AA again. Terrible customer service and HORRIBLE flight prices. United is far better for regional services and Southwest for anything else. #neverAAagain."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Won’t support their business anymore,"This airline is hypocritical. As of May 11th they are restricting our rights by forcing ALL CUSTOMERS to wear “face coverings” during services. Not only is this ignorant but after flying with them just weeks before this mandate, it also appears hypocritical. Their stewardess don’t wear masks, and the ones that are we’re using them improperly. They make a huge deal about “social distancing” (we are all sharing the same air!!!!) but it was evident after multiple flights that only was the case if they couldn’t sell enough tickets to fill the flight. If the flight was full, all rules went out the window. Obviously this has a lot less do to with “public safety” and more about publicity and profitably. Won’t fly with these guys again, this whole situation is absurd and senseless. Lost a customer for life."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Safety procedures lacking at PBI AA checkin; appears AA packing people on plane,"I took my mother to the airport this morning. The security at airport entrance unhelpful and rude despite few travelers.  Several if not half of AA workers at checkin counter wore no masks or gloves. When I questioned it, they said they don’t have to until May 11. The gentlemen who came to wheel my mother had a mask improperly below and exposing his  nose. I brought it to his attention and it remained below his nose. He then proceeded to wheel my mother and another woman side by side. The flight to Charlotte had many seats available when we booked, but when I questioned moving my mother’s middle seat, checkin told me the “flight was heavy”, no open seats on 3 rows. Appears to me now AA despite its “cleanliness” video is not having any regard for social distancing. Other airlines are using care to separate passengers. So sorry we fell for false advertising. Just praying we won’t be sorrier."
Date of travel: June 2019,10,Never Again,"If you like to be seated on top of the person next to you and not have the ability to put your tray table down because the space between the seats, this is the airline for you.  if you are of average height and weight and would appreciate some space to be able to move, better to look elsewhere.  There were two of us flying and what should have been a total of 6 boarding passes round trip, ended up being a total of 58 boarding passes.  All mechanical issues, flight diversions, more broken planes and terrible customer service.  What was supposed to be a celebration trip for the completion of cancer treatment turned into a nightmare!  It was absolutely the worst travel experience of my life.  I am not a novice traveler either.  American has become a sub-par Airline.  Poor aircraft, poor customer service, uncaring flight attendants.  I will never, EVER fly AA again!  Unable to provide pictures as I was told to delete the ones I took and put the camera away or I would be removed from the aircraft."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Delayed and Not A Great Flight,"Long delay in Dallas.  We were told to board then turned back by one of the gate agents.  Seemed they had to replace (recirculate) air in the plane.  We waited at least 45 minutes and lost our spot to leave on time.  I guess we should be happy they were concerned about the air, but could have handled it more efficiently.  Not start boarding then turning people back.  Flight was OK, hard to like the plane after coming off the great plane from Maui."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Plane and Service,"Similar plane to the one we took to Maui, just a little different configuration, but pretty much the same.   Same partition, making the seats private with flatbed seats.  Service was great.   We loved the new planes, so comfortable.  Food was good especially the MaiTai and hot fudge sundaes.  If I had know that would be my last meal out for the next 2 months, I would have asked for another sundae.  It was a nice, enjoyable flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Wonderful Plane for The  Long Flight,The first class on this plane was great.  Seats are divided with a partition making the seats very private.  You are literally sitting alone.  Flat bed seats were very nice as well as service and food.It was a very enjoyable trip to Maui.
Date of travel: April 2020,50,Great service in giving refunds for cancelled flights,"I don't often submit reviews on Trip Advisor, but wanted to give a shout out to American Airlines for how they handled our trip to Rome in May that was cancelled due to the coronavirus.  I had been worried about this for weeks -- how to get a full refund rather than credit for future flights.  When I called customer service, their agent immediately suggested I go to their website to request a refund, and took the time to walk me through the process step-by-step, giving me the ticket numbers to enter for each charge.  Just got emails from American this morning saying that everything had been approved and money refunded.  So nice to have a travel-related success story these days!  [Note: To submit this review I had to select a date that I traveled, but in fact did not travel -- our trip had been scheduled for May 6-17 2020]"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Short Flight to Dallas,We were lucky the bad tornados early on this morning 3/3 did not affect our flight. It was a 5:30 AM flight and we had been up since 12:30 AM watching the weather.  Our fight left on time and was uneventful.  We felt that was the best we could ask for considering the bad situation in our city.  We were traveling to Maui through Dallas.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,AA Policies,"My complaint is with their policies. I was flying “internationally” and AA messed my flights up and I had to fly out the next day. Of course disappointed but I was able to stay at the hotel near the airport and flew out the next day. For my troubles they paid for the hotel, and gave me a 200 credit to use anytime, anywhere. Fast forward, I tried to use my credit and told I can’t use it on another international flight. Excuse me are you kidding me. You messed up my first international flight and now I can’t use this credit on another international flight. I don’t get it, everyone says the same we can’t, we can’t we can’t. Please explain how this works? Sad to say, I will spread the word and won’t use them anymore."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,No Social Distancing on American,American canceled our flight and put us on an earlier flight. The plane was delayed due to mechanical issues. 40 minutes later we board. Small plane and packed.  No social distancing at all! Broken items on the plane. Finally we were told we are getting off this plane and will be getting on a new plane. Still waiting so let’s see
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Destination closed borders, flight went ahead anyway.  Refuse to give me a refund.",The borders closed in switzerland.  The flight continued anyway.  I did not take the flight as I did not want to get to a closed border and fly right back home.American Airlines refuses to give me a refund on a ticket that went nowhere.Please give me a refund on my ticket price.Please have some integrity and do the right thing.
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Customer service lies to you!,They try and force you to fly in the middle of a world wide Pandemic!!  What a joke! You have to use your ticket by December and there is no indication that the Pandemic will be over by then.  You are just out of luck and lose the money.  Unlike Delta airlines which has extended their window of flight to the entire next year.
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Fly another airline,Terrible Airline! Customer service is a joke.  They lie to you and then try and cover it up.  Do not fly this airline.  You will be disappointed.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Morning flight from Chicago O'Hare to Los Angeles,"The boarding process went smoothly. The aircraft had 6 across seating in the main cabin with comfortable seats and adequate legroom for my 6'2"" frame. There were entertainment consoles in the seat backs. There was free soft drink/snack service with the option for meals and alcohol for a fee. The approximately 4 hour flight arrived on time."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Early morning quick flight from Milwaukee, WI to Chicago, IL","The boarding process went well. The seating was 4 across with a comfortable seat and adequate legroom for my 6'2"" frame. The flight was well under an hour and there was no food/drink service except upon request. There was no entertainment provided except for the airline's app on one's own device. The flight arrived on time."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,RIPPED,"I spent over $500 on a flight to AZ, which was cancelled due to the covid pandemic. I spoke with numerous AA reps who each gave me different information regarding my refund. I was told I would be given a full refund in the form of a voucher, minus what I paid for my seats (rip). Then, each rep gave me different dates the voucher would expire. NOW, I received an email stating I am only receiving a voucher for $150.00, which is only a 30% refund! AA you are disgusting. This is how you repay your valuable customers? Never ever would I recommend this thievery airline. Terrible! You should be ashamed of yourselves."
Date of travel: April 2020,50,Refunded all four of my upcoming trips!,They could have just given me credits but they gave me FOUR refunds for the COVID-19 situation. Yaay American!!
Date of travel: April 2020,10,"Patrick, the rude steward",Patrick is rude and has a power trip issue.  He would be better suited ad a fry cook at McDonald than that of an air steward.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great service and flexibility,I just want to say a big thank you to american airlines for still operating during these times and allowing people to get places where they need to go even with the whole coronavirus situation. I have been traveling with them for 6 years regularly now and really enjoy their service and flexibility with getting flights off the ground and allowing people to get to and from where they need to go.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Flight to Panama City, FL",I've flown American a number of times and I'm well pleased with the service I receive.  I always fly economy and have rarely had a hiccup in service.  Airline schedules are always subject to change but for this flight everything was right on time and went smoothly.(This was pre-pandemic.)
Date of travel: April 2020,10,They don't care about us,"Amid the Corona virus pandemic, social distancing is essential, and ordered by Governors. Airlines care about your safety. Right? Wrong on both accounts, at least when it comes to AA. The flight looked fairly light, when I checked in, with plenty of empty seats for social distancing. However, they managed to fill it up, with stand by passangers, such that virtually all seats were taken. When I questioned the flight attendant about social distancing, he called a security agent from the gate to get me off the airplane. Yet, they still blocked the first and last row, and didn't serve any drinks on the 4.5 hour flight, to maintain social distancing for the flight attendants. Not for the passengers though. I really hope they will not be allowed to take a government bailout from taxpayer money!!"
Date of travel: April 2020,50,Amazing service during pandemic,My flight was on time and it wasn’t cancelled even though it was the start of pandemic. Inflight service was excellent and we were assured the plane was cleaned due to concerns about covid-19.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,I Get Penalized For Buying 2 Separate Tickets,"My DCA-MIA-BCN on January 22 and return BCN-MIA-DCA on 28th.  I used AA points to purchase DCA-MIA-DCA segments and regular purchase for MIA-BCN-MIA.  On the 22nd I could not check-in my luggage at the kiosk.  AA agent went back and forth to her supervisor finally saying that because I had bought 2 separate tickets they could not be linked.  Its bolony as I had done it in the past several times.  So when I arrived Miami I had to pick up my luggage, check it again at the regular check in area, and go through TSA again for the BCN flight.  So am I getting penalized for using AAdvantage miles?  What is wrong with AA?  Put those DCA employees to work.  New name for AA frequent flyer is DisAAdvantage Miles.  On my return flight the BCN check-in counter agent not an AA employee checked my luggage all the way to DCA avoiding me the above AA employee created inconvenience.  Keep up the good work, AA."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Why pay $$$ for 1st class?,"I am going to post video of our 3+ hours of the flight from hell with 2 spoiled brats screaming and crying in 1st class and NOTHING done about it except a token note of apology written by flight attendants because THEY knew all other paying 1st class customers were beyond ticked!  I sent letter to AA and NOTHING was done.  My husband is platinum for life and at one time 4,000,000 miler and in those many many miles on AA has never experienced a nightmare like this flight!  We should if nothing else been refunded miles if not $ for this horrible experience.  Feel free to contact me AA and I’m happy to send you the SCREAMING brat video!"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Awful Trip To Aspen,"Our original flight schedule DCA-ORD-ASE on January 9th and ASE-ORD-DCA on 13th.  We avoid Dallas due to unpredictable weather and prior bad experience with AA.  Very uncomfortable lack of padding seats and leg room on the almost 3 hour regional jet flight.  On our return the ASE to ORD flight got cancelled and rerouted via LAX on a red eye.  We had to wait in Aspen Airport check-in area with no vending machines for even water for FIVE hours.  TSA did not allow already checked in passengers go through security and wait in the gate section where there was food and drinks for sale but that will go on another review.  Flight from ASE to LAX delayed to begin with, regional jet with bad seats and leg room, this time on the back of the plane which was warm and noisy, thus temperature inconsistent throughout the cabin.  After boarding was complete the pilot said there was an overweight issue and called for 11 (eleven!) volunteers to deplane.  After 6-7 volunteers deplaned the flight took off with over an hour delay.  Seat cushion on the LAX to IAD 737 was short so half of my thighs were off (I'm an average guy).  Cabin extra leg room Ok thanks to my Gold status that does not give much.  Unexpected red eye flight messed up our sleep cycle and disrupted our lifestyles and performance for the following days.  We had to pay an additional $50 for cab ride as IAD is further away from home than DCA.  Thank you AA  for this awful travel experience and wanting us to never return to Aspen."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Short flight from Toronto to Chicago,Had a short flight from Toronto to Chicago with American Airlines. I don't recall anything special about this flight.
Date of travel: April 2020,50,Good work on all sided,I took this trip with much trepidation . But I had little to worry. AA is a classy act - everyone from the gate agents to the flying staff were amazing. Thank you American - you make us proud.What you are doing with the The frequent flyer program will keep us as loyal customers as soon as this blows over- can’t wait for my next flight .Keep the flag flying high!
Date of travel: April 2020,10,They are keeping your money. They don't care about Covid19.,"What a shameful and heartless people. They get to be bailout by the government and also keep the money of all the passengers that for any reason due to Covid19 have to cancel their flights for a specific event. I had a wedding in Las Vegas that had to be canceled so I am not flying anytime soon so they get to keep our family $1300 and get bailout by the government. What good business manners are this?.  Stay away from flying with them. Read all the reviews they have gotten for the same reason keeping students and families money because all their events have been canceled. The customer service just laughed and said "" the flight is there, you just don't want to flight""She didn't listen ""the wedding is canceled"". She probably didn't even know about Covid19"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,NEVER EVER WILL I FLY AMERICAN AGAIN !,"American has ZERO customer support.   I had a flight diverted to DCA when I was supposed to go to BWI.    Plus, it was late because we had to wait for flight crew...lol  .  American makes it SO difficult to contact them at a later date to arrange for a resonable compensation for inconvenience.    They said, since I agreed to take the flight they will not give me voucher.  That is crazy, because during the Pandemic they were offering no more flights.      Shame on American for not willing to work with me on this issue........I leave them as an UNHAPPY customer"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Don't waste you money on American Airlines,"I was going overseas but left a day early for LA in case of weather to have extra time. Weather was rain moving across the country. We sat on the tarmac at Phillie for 2 hours. The pilot periodically talked to us. He said at the 2-hour mark that we'd be leaving in 10 minutes. Instead, 10 minutes later he got on the intercom and said he'd timed out and needed to return to the gate! How could he not have known minutes earlier that this was going to occur? At the gate we left the plane and got back in line to rebook - 3rd in line (we were seated in 1st class). But AA staff told us no need, that they were going to have another crew come to the plane and fly us to LA, so we sat down. After another hour we were informed there was no crew coming, and the flight was canceled. What!? We were lied to by the pilot, and now the ground staff, and now 100 people were in that line that I was earlier 3rd in but told to leave. We got on the phone to rebook, but they only could offer us 1st class 30 hours later - not in time to make our flight to Tahiti. Normally, they would book someone in the next available flight, even if on another airline, to maintain decent customer service and relations. Obviously unimportant with AA. After over an hour on the phone we finally insisted on talking to a supervisor and explained our situation again. The supervisor was able to put us on another AA flight later that night, but in economy. I was told that I would be reimbursed. Unfortunately, with the original flight canceled and no solution in sight earlier in the evening, I had to cancel my original hotel in LA so I would not be charged. Once they were eventually able to find me a later flight, I tried to rebook at that hotel but they had filled up. They booked me nearby but apparently at a hotel without a 24-hour shuttle. We arrived at LAX at 11:30 but the shuttle to the hotel stopped at 11 PM - thanks, again, American Airlines! So far off to a terrible start to my Tahiti vacation! Upon my return to the US, I called AA and asked if I could have the 1st class going back across the country, as I'd originally booked 1st class going west, but economy going east on my return. I figured I'd give them a chance to make it right, again, and live with it. They of course let me down again and I went economy. So - what would happen with my refund from the fiasco at the beginning of the trip? The supervisor I spoke with upon returning to the US assured me that I would be reimbursed. Once home I tried calling but AA forces you to do things online to avoid dealing with actual people.  I followed the procedure for getting a refund, was left a voicemail by someone but no callback number. I sent email to them and finally was given an amount - it was laughable. I should have been reimbursed about $700 or $800 per ticket. Instead they said I was due only a few hundred $. $200+ was all I was reimbursed being bumped from 1st class to economy? Were they kidding? I sent several emails stating my displeasure and disbelief over it. I should have had at least another $500 refund per ticket. They responded to my email finally with some numbers for portions of flights, lame apologies, etc. But their own numbers backed up my assertion that I was woefully under compensated for the refund. If 1st class was only a few hundred $ more than basic economy - I'd fly it every time. But it is not - so why steal from me? They also in their numbers had a larger ticket cost for the economy they 'graciously' put me in on the later flight, causing me to miss the shuttle at LAX and costing me a cab fare now.  When people are rebooked through no fault of their own, the airline either absorbs the cost if it is more, or silently pockets the profit. But in either case the passengers are not asked to make up the difference nor refunded a dime. I was made to pay more for this flight, thereby reducing my refund even more. But even assuming that the higher flight cost is acceptable - AA still owes me 100s of dollars refund per ticket. I am still waiting even after being home almost 2 months, but I suspect they will continue to hide behind fine print and not answering me and nonsense math that truly makes no sense. I gave them several opportunities to be straight with me and try to make things right somehow - but they failed each time. And they are refunding me a pittance of what they should! Their customer service is terrible, their staff lie, and they cheat their passengers. Why would I or anyone fly with them again? I won't fly American Airlines again!  I'll pay more if need be to get more respect and better service, and without lies and hiding from the public they claim to want to serve. Don't waste your time and money with them!Seats had cramped legroom; value was pitiful; they cheat the customers."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,"With a 25 billion dollar bailout, still could not help me","I am high school teacher who had plans to take three students to a National Journalism Convention.  I bought the tickets months in advance without insurance (I take responsibility for that) before COVID-19 hit.  When my school district canceled all fieled trips and travel,  I promptly called American Airlines for help.  With my students's families paid their way for the trip and  I wanted to give them their much needed money back.It took two weeks to get through to someone.  The first lady I spoke to was kind, but unwilling to refund my tickets.  I asked to speak to a supervisor who was very rude.  She did not listen to me and talked over me every time I tried to ask questions or explain myself.  In the end, they did not refund my tickets because I canceled the flights.  I canceled, submitted refund request (that was denied and the reason why I called in first place), and was told that if I had waited for AA to cancel, I could of got my money back. So, in the end, after a 25 billion dollar bailout to the airline industry, and just because I was proactive, I couldn't not only get my money back, but the families who paid for their kids to go an educational trip."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,American airlines should update their computer systems on refunds stop using windows 1970,okay I understand the coronavirus is going on my flight got canceled got issued refund been over a week have not received it getting told by management an American airlines customer service that their system is old they can't process all the refunds in a timely fashion guess what that's not my fault you can't keep your business afloat and keep adjusting to modern times maybe you should close and not stop taking our taxpayers money...

Date of travel: November 2019,50,Wonderful treatment,Very helpful personnel and comfortable seating.The flight was very smooth and landing was excellent.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,One of the best of the few remaining major US carriers,"Like most major US carriers, American has jutted its frequent flyer program. You can still get an upgrade and an occasional reward ticket but not anything like in the past.  Internationally they are at least on par with other carriers.  The Premium Economy is worth a little more per ticket but usually start out way too expensive.  You can keep checking and sometimes you will find a reasonable Premium Economy international fare."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,What a joke,I normally do not leave bad reviews but this time it's worth it. We had a trip planned for my son's 18th bday/graduation. We booked this trip in December of 2019. It was for April 4th 8th. Due to the Covid viruse the event was cancelled in Tampa. The airlines said our flight was not refundable unless the airline cancelled it them selves. Well they did call and tell us the departing flight was cancelled. We could book a different flight. We did not want to since the reason we was flying was cancelled. We asked about a refund. We was told by a gentleman that we will get a Full refund. We asked him what about the returning flight. We asked if we cancelled that part of the trip since the airline cancelled the first part if we would receive a full refund for that part. We was recorded as he told us YES! He cancelled that part of the trip as well as the other. He gave us a web site to visit and told us how to request the refund. We did that. A week or so later we got an email that said our departure flight was refunded but the return flight was denied. I called airline and was told by a lady that it was an ERROR on their part. That the locator numbers for both flights were different that we needed to go back online and repeat the refund process. We tried to do that but the web site would not let us change or add anything to it. It was in the same status of pending. So I called the airline back the next day. Spoke to a different lady. Explained it all to her. Was told by her that we should get a refund that the flight was cancelled by the airline. She put me on hold to check the status of it. Came back and told me to hold for a supervisor. Well the supervisor told me it is NOT REFUNDABLE. She told me that the refund department makes those decisions and the associates can not tell us if it can be refunded or not. So no one should of told me that it would be. Here's the thing. Those calls are recorded and three different times three different people told me we would receive the refund. It's why we cancelled the returning flight to begin with. Since the airline cancelled our departure. What the hell. Supervisor told me that we could take up the complaints with the complaints website and explain it all. Why should I have to do that? We made a decision based off of what the airline associates told us to begin with. It was not our fault. The supervisor also told me that it explained it not being refunded on the Covid page of their website. However why would we go to that page? The airlines contacted us telling us it was cancelled. And they we could cancel the return flight and receive a full refund. So glad other companies at this time are looking out for people and consumers right now. Definitely NOT American Airlines!!!! Don't use them it's not worth the hassle especially since you can't trust what is told to you not by one or two but three associates!
Date of travel: July 2019,10,WORST. AIRLINE. EVER,"Last summer, I was supposed to fly from Myrtle Beach to Providence via Charlotte. The day I'm supposed to fly out, they keep delaying my flight to the point where I would've missed my connecting flight. They put me on the same route for the very next day. The following day, I get on the flight to Charlotte and things are starting to go smoother. I board the plane to Providence, but they keep delaying the flight and it eventually got canceled. I wait in the customer service line for 2 hours to find out that all flights to Providence the next day were all booked so they send me to Martha's Vineyard of all places. Fast forward to getting to Marthas Vineyard, I get to the airport to find that they misplaces my luggage and getting those back was a pain in the butt. When I finally do get them back though, all my clothes are damp. From that day forth, I vowed to never fly with them again."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Cleanliness lacking; Inflight wifi and entertainment poor,"I booked roundtrip tickets from Philadelphia to Waco, Texas, using frquent flyer miles.  I was saving the miles for a different location but the amount of miles needed to redeem for that trip would have been so high for an 11 hour flight or I could have used less miles and taken 27 hours to get there instead of 11 hours.  Therefore, I booked that trip with frquent flyer miles from a competitor airline, using the minimum number of frequent flyer miles and minimum amount of travel time. Once my America Airlines frequent flyer miles are all redeemed, I do not plan on using American Airlines again. This trip was taken 2/29/20 to 3/3/20, prior to a severe coronavirus outbreak in the US. I was very bothered by the cleanliness of the aircraft. Initially when I sat in my seat, I noticed a used napkin in the seatback in front of me. I wondered how well the plane was cleaned inside, such as emptying seatback pockets, wiping down tray tables, armrests, seats, and headrests. This should always be done, especially when coronavirus was starting to affect the US.     The wifi and inflight entertainment was aweful. Since inflight movies were not accessible, Frozen II was shown in the cabin.  I wanted to access wifi, even if I had to purchase it. Wifi connection was unavailable. I didn't bring things to do on the plane since I thought I could select a movie to watch or use wifi. The unavailability of both made my flights seem very long. I am very used to 11 hour flights since I have flown to Hawaii from Newark, New Jersey 17 times. However, having inflight wifi, movies and entertainment can make an 11 hour flight not seem long at all. American's lack of functioning inflight wifi and entertainment made a short trip from Philadelphia to Dallas seem extremely long. American Airlines needs to improve greatly to have customers fly their airline again."
Date of travel: April 2020,30,Rude worker alert,"I purchased my ticket from Travelocity which messed my tickets up with the Covid going around so many flights were changed without my knowledge or last min changes that don’t relay to the airlines . With that being said I got to the airport about 30 min before my flight was supposed to board and unaware they were about to cut off checked bags. I get to the counter to check in and Victoria an American Airlines employee said I was too late and was supposed to be there an hour before my flight. She was speaking to me in a very nasty and mean manner which I am in front of My 4 year old child so I’m trying to remain calm. As I’m trying to remain calm because at this point she can’t find my ticket because of Travelocity mishap, Victoria the American Airlines employee then asked me why am I even late because there is no traffic so there should be no reason I’m late. I don’t know this lady so I’m appalled that she even felt comfortable talking to me like that and even after I traveled an hour and a half to get to the airport from Fayetteville. I then asked for her supervisor and she was pointing behind me where there was no one in sight and I told her no one was behind me and she was still being rude saying well my supervisor is right there I can go get her or if I’m ready I can let her find my ticket and if I want to proceed she would need my I’d. So I took out my I’d to hand to her and she looked at me and told me to put it down instead of me handing it to her. So at that point I’m still asking for a supervisor that I did not get. Victoria then asked the other employee Scott to finish me off and she walked away instead of getting the supervisor I asked for. I told her I was going to share a review and she just kept saying go right ahead go right ahead. How rude and having my child with me going through that with Victoria was very embarrassing and unprofessional. However Scott from Pittsburgh was a great employee and he took the time out to explain the situation and what he could do to fix the situation at hand!! Thanks Scott! Also when I found out I could not get on my scheduled flight I called my ride who parked outside the doors and came in to help with my child and while doing so she came out to find a ticket on her car which was right outside the ticket counter so she was concerned about the ticket when all she did was come in to grab my child while I was checking in my luggage in and back the rental cops outside were very rude and calling her names like stupid and retarded all the while the police officers were allowing the rental cops to speak to us like that. Just a very unprofessional experience that I had."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Health scare on flight from Florida to Michigan,"Last month at the airport, tensions were noticeably high as we waited for our flight due to the coronavirus pandemic. Once we boarded the airplane, a young boy sitting directly behind me was coughing non-stop. This was concerning me so I quietly found something to cover my face. When the child's father saw I had done this, it upset him so he began antagonizing me by fake coughing. After this went on for a while, I stepped to the back to speak with a flight attendant and request that I be moved to a different seat. She was helpful and used her seating chart to locate an alternate spot for me. As she led me to my new seat, another flight attendant came from the front, visibly angry and stopped us from proceeding. She began pointing her finger at me and yelling. She forbade me to sit there and became more aggravated when I asked that she stop shaking her finger in my face and yelling at me. At one point, she went to the boy's father and he lied. He told her he was about to offer me a mask. We never had any proof that he had any masks and he and his son were not using masks themselves. Her temper continued to escalate when I asked her for her name and she pushed her nametag towards my face and told me it was Jennifer. Her anger towards me caused her to yell at other passengers. In the midst of all of this, another flight attendant suggested that Jennifer contact the captain to resolve the issue because she kept yelling and was acting unprofessional. But Jennifer went to a phone in the front and called the police. She slammed down the phone and continued to hit things the whole time. When the police arrived, Jennifer was shaking in anger and shook the door trying to open it for them. They escorted me and my sister off the plane and forced us to take a later flight. Despite our attempts to get American airlines to cover our hotel, they were unwilling to do so. All attempts to contact the airline and voice my dissatisfaction with the staff's lack of concern for their passengers' health or the way I was treated by Jennifer have been met with resistance. They continue to show no interest in rectifying the situation. I have never experienced such treatment from any airline before and will avoid flying American ever again after this experience."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,God Bless Mrs. Cook,"God Bless Mrs. Cook! (American Airlines)In mid-March, my wife and I were on week three vacationing in New Zealand when we received an e-mail from American Airlines that our return flight had been canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic global crises. The airlines indicated they did not have another flight and provided us with a number to call. We telephoned the 800 number and to our surprise it was answered in short time by Mrs. Cook. She explained she was a rep for American Airlines working out of her home in South Carolina. She understood our predicament and stated she would do her best to get us a return flight. She kept us on hold and checked back every couple of minutes as she navigated several contacts to various “help desk” and other agencies to search for a flight. We used Alaska Air miles to make our original purchase which also complicated matters. Mrs. Cook was successful in getting us a return flight on Qantas Air out of Sydney, Australia. She made all the connecting flight arrangements and provided us with all the information to accommodate the journey. This became very important as Qantas had no offices in New Zealand and a five hour wait on the telephone. The airports in new Zealand and Sydney were bursting at the seams with stranded Americans and Canadians trying to return to their homeland. We cannot say enough good things about the pleasant and professional service we received from Mrs. Cook, American Airlines. We arrived back to our home well aware there were many folks not so fortunate. God Bless Mrs. Cook!Walt805"
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Domino effect of negative events,"After calling AA customer service I was advised by supervisor Tatiana(she was very helpful) to send a formal email about my complaintregarding my trip from JFK to Madrid; Nov 13 - 19, 2019. I spoke withTatiana on November 20, 2019 at approximately 4 pm est.I am extremely frustrated and disappointed with my experience withAmerican Airlines. This is not my first problem or complaint but it ismy last straw. For the cost of the flight and additional fees, itwould have made more sense to pay that amount for a better airline.The airplane was very tight and uncomfortable, especially fortraveling overseas. The air was also not on and somewhat stuffy. There were a few incidents during that flight that made the entire ride very uncomfortable and nerve-racking. The first incident was a woman feeling hot and dizzy andthrowing up. I moved my seat, to then have another woman feel sick anddizzy and pass out. She ended up falling face first into the wall andthen fell on my feet. Additionally, another woman was in the bathroomfor approximately 2 hours throwing up. All of these women were olderand a few passengers were complaining it was too hot (which may be whythey were not feeling well on top of being in a small space - the twodon't mix well). As you can imagine, the entire flight was extremelyuncomfortable with all factors combined. I already have an extremeanxiety with flying and was using so much energy to keep myself calm(had trouble breathing and not feeling sick myself). Adding all thatchaos was not helpful. The flight on the way back was alsouncomfortable as the space, again is very claustrophobic and thisflight was an additional 2 hours flying time.Overall, I have had nothing but bad experiences with American Airlinesand am requesting a refund for this trip. What made this matter worse is that one of the customer services representatives I spoke with said they had no documentation of these incidents - which is a problem in itself. Either he was uninformed and someone dropped the ball, or he was lying to me. Either way, every single experience is bad in some way whether it be at the gates and/or in the air and I still was denied a refund. I didn't even request a full refund, just for the flight and not including the extra fees. Definitely not worth the stress or money."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great First Experience,"I flew to Jackson Hole from Boston with AA. The check-in process was easy enough going both ways, including dealing with checked snowboard gear. It was a stressful time to travel due to the covid-19 outbreak just starting. The staff did a good job dealing with the problems and keeping the operation running smoothly."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Worst company on the planet,We purchased tickets in Nov2019 to travel in Sept 2020 to Rome. In Jan 2020 AA changed our seats from row 8 to row 25 and never advised us. We checked their abysmal website and discovered this ourselves. Sometime later we again checked our ticket status and on their website discovered the flights were cancelled. American Airlines never even sent us an email to advise the cancellation . When we repeatedly requested confirmation of their cancellation they refused. This is the most offensive and foul corporation for any consumer to suffer through. Fly Any Other airline as American Airlines are true business pigs!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Courtesy king,"Due to convid-19 my business plans were canceled. Including my flight arrangements. I booked through Expedia and could get through to a csr online or on the phone. So I called American Airlines direct. I spoke to the nicest csr.) I wished I could remember her name) and she explained to me that Expedia was down, and even though I was supposed to take care of my canceled plans with Expedia, she would help me any way. She gave me a full refund because my flight was canceled. I appreciated the understanding, the tone of voice and the concern given to me during our verbal encounter via phone. I would fly with American Airlines anytime."
Date of travel: August 2019,10,Terrible all around.,"I have flown American for several trips, and not one of them has gotten me to my destination on time. Their business practices when it comes to flight cancellations and delays are criminal. Do NOT fly American. Ever."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Absolutely Appalling Service Damaged Bags,"We flew from PIT to MIA on 30 October 2017 and one of our checked cases were damaged beyond repair, I lodged a claim that went unanswered, I contacted in writing and lodged a further four claims over a two month period and still no response. It is now April 2020 and still no response from AA.AA treat their Customers with contempt and do not value them. There staff are rude at check-in and I will no longer ever fly with AA again."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Cramped seating,The seating situation has gotten rediculas. Wedged against seat in front is unacceptable. In the greed to get more seats the airlines are stuffing us in. Its not right. I arrived with a big divit in my knee from the map pocket. Makes flying unenjoyable.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great Flight experience,"Took the flight from miami airport for vacation to Spain.The flight was great. The flight was clean, well kept, staff were friendly and helpful if we had any questions.In flight entertainment and amenities were good and overall was a decent flight."
Date of travel: April 2020,40,exemplary service,"Booking was London to Toronto, make our own way to NYC and back from thereDidn't actually get to travel because of the shutdown. Looked at their website and they were asking people to wait to near departure before contacting them.Got an email well before departure saying flights cancelled, providing a UK phone number to arrange refund.Called the number and it was answered first time, confirmed booking ref and refund sorted and in bank 4 days laterWll done AA. Your rivals are trying to make us take vouchers for cancelled flights. Won't be happening.Obviously can't complete the questions about the flight but have done 4 stars anyway!"
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Bad customer service,"My wife and I booked airline tickets from a third party, Friend Z Travel with American Airlines leaving Detroit Michigan and arriving in Orlando Florida on the 3rd of April. With a stay at home order being in effect and the hotel where we are going is shutting down. American Airline will not refund any of our funds for the tickets all they will do is gave us a travel voucher that must be used by December 31st. Not knowing when we all be back to work and when it will be safe to be with around people there is no way of insuring us that we will be able to use the vouchers by the expiration date, so we are out 782 dollars between the third party (Friend Z Travel) and American Airlines.  American Airlines will be keeping $422.80 while Friend Z Travel will be keeping $360.00 for no services rendered. I am sure that the airline industry is one of the companies that will be getting part of the stimulus package to help good companies to stay in business, The least that you could is to say thank you to the taxpayers and the customer that they are cheating out of money, and yes part of the stimulus package is my tax dollarsI would of aware of flight and booking with companies like American Airlines and Friend Z Travel because neither are very American or Friendly"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Thank you!,"Booked months before travel on our regular route, unfortunately I broke my leg three weeks prior to travel. Contacted American via the website to request assistance , received a phone call to confirm my requirements and then treated like royalty from check in to plane both going out and on our return via New York.Thank you for your exceptional service on our Journey."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Poor customer service ,I called this morning requesting information about my cancelled flight and rescheduling information. I was very polite and patient but I couldn’t believe how rude the rep was on the phone and the attitude she gave me. I will be avoiding American as much as possible.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Left me stranded and then want to cheat me on the refund!!,"The original flight was 1st class with a lap child departure 3/6 and return 3/16.  The total fare round trip was $1645.07 . The return flight was cancelled due to travel restrictions on the 15th.  However, the president of Honduras issued approval for US citizens to return and I was able to reschedule the flight for the 3/27.  We then planned on returning at that time as we were told that was the first available flight.  On March 20, a friend in Honduras told us that someone they knew that worked for American at SAP said that our flight would be cancelled.  I called several days in a row to check on the status and was told the flight was still on schedule and it was on my AA app.  On Monday the 23rd, I called reservations and they told me the flight was cancelled.  To this date, I never received a cancellation notice from American.  At that point, I had no choice but to get a flight with united ($3200) to get home.  Now, they don't even refund half of the cost of the ticket?   It is quite convenient now for the representative to claim that the return flight was cheaper than the flight there.  I have been a long time customer and am very disappointed in the poor service I have received.  In fact, numerous times when I have spoken to representatives regarding this matter, the response has been argumentative and unsympathetic."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Not being flexible during this pandemic,"Unfortunately American Airlines (and Sun Country) is still pushing their usual policy and not being a nimble business during these hard times. Our trip was cancelled (understandably) and Sun Country will not give us a refund per their ""policy"". Everyone needs that little bit of money right now and it's disheartening that this airline isn't supporting what is necessary to keep the country healthy. Be more like Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Damaged Bag,"After the second bag I checked in the past 2 months had been completely damaged, I decided to do a baggage claim.  The bag was under 100$ and they would not reimburse because it was slightly outside the 24 hour timeframe. I am active duty military and could not make the timeframe due to my having to report to duty.  Under these circumstances there should have been SOME leniency. Terrible customer service."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Absolutely disgusted with their refund policy in the midst of this crisis.,"I cannot believe that American Airlines is rejecting customers from refunds through the month of April! Our nation is in the middle of an emergency, funds are low and people have become extremely desperate without many resources. I purchased two tickets to travel to Miami from Dallas April 10th I canceled my ticket shortly after the president stated we should stay at home! I had to email, text message for about 5 days before I got a direct email from someone who was supposed to be in charge of customer relations. Today I finally got a phone call and I could not be more disappointed with the lack of empathy and flexibility with the policy. In fact Helen, the lady I spoke with just kept telling me about policy and that my ticket was not refundable. My family is without work and has been for weeks and are American Airlines wants to keep almost $400 in tickets instead of giving me a refund. They want to offer me credit for Future travel. When your entire family has become jobless, and you're trying to figure out what you're going to be eating by The Weeknd, traveling in the future is no longer and the picture. We won't be traveling in 3 months 6 months a year or anytime in the near future while we try to recover from this. We need our money! We need our money badly and we need it soon! If you can help me out at all with reaching out to American Airlines to adjust this policy or offer refunds to people who are in my situation I would greatly appreciate that! My job for the next several days would be making everyone aware of this unhelpful policy during a very stressful time for our country."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Do not fly this Airlines!,"My review is of the airlines not the flight itself.  My flight was cancelled.  American Airlines refused to give a refund.  Al they would give me was a 6 month period to use my ticket. Not a voucher.  With the world wide Pandemic and my age I am at there is not way I am going to be flying in 6 months.  I discussed all this with American Airlines and got no where.  It actually appeared they were encouraging people to fly, for non-essential, reasons in the next 6 months.  I was shocked at how clearly they were unconcerned for my safety.  We have been asked by the governor of our state and the president of the United States to not make any unnecessary travel.  I guess American Airlines doesn't believe what the President and government officials are saying.  I would not fly this airlines!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,A million thanks,"Countries closing their borders in March 2020 caused many problems for our cruise - how would we get home?Azamara got us to Miami, and then chartered a plane to get us home (for which I thank them).That flight home was operated by American Airlines, and frankly I was expecting bread and water and distant staff (at best).Instead we were greeted warmly by a wonderful crew, who gave us a near-normal service (I was feeling quite mellow1)  In the circumstances, they were quite heroic.When we arrived, the passengers gave the crew a well-deserved round of applause - when did you last see that?"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"Morning flight from Chicago O'Hare, IL to Milwaukee, WI","My boarding screw up was mostly my fault. When I read the departure board it looked like my gate was G18 so I walked all the way to that gate. It was over one hour to boarding time for my flight. I heard announcements for many flights over the public address (PA) system, but none for my flight. After a while I realized there was something wrong so I rechecked the board and the gate was not G18 but G1B. As I was walking the length of concourse G, just as I approached gate 1, I finally heard an announcement for my flight over the PA system--it was the final boarding call. I managed to board about 1 minute before they closed the aircraft door. The cabin crew was helpful in getting my luggage stowed. The main cabin had 4 across seating with comfortable seats and adequate legroom for my 6'2"" frame. There was no food or drink service except by request as the flight was very short. It did arrive on time."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"Red eye flight from Los Angeles, CA to Chicago O'Hare, IL","My boarding experience was a total foul up. Somehow I managed to get my boarding pass without having checked in for the flight!? When I had my pass scanned for group 5 of 9, it was rejected. I had to deal with the other gate agent (who had a bit of an attitude) and by the time they got me straightened out group 9 was boarding. Fortunately for me (and the airline), the flight was not full and I could stow my carry on luggage. After boarding, we sat around for about 15 minutes for a crew member to arrive. The seating was 6 across in main cabin with a comfortable seat and adequate legroom for my 6'2"" frame. There was an entertainment console in the seat back. In spite of the late departure, the flight did arrive on time."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flying home wtj family,Had to call in Miami several times for wheel chairs but after that all went well. Treatment on aircraft and in terminals improved a great deal. Still haven't figured out why we had to fy thru Boston.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Airline,"A competitive airline left us stranded in Taiwan without notice, American stepped up and rescued without hesitation. Service was extremely professional and with partner airlines service was exceptional. No longer will fly with the other airline."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Pathetic service (baggage delayed and reimbursement policy),I Don't see 0 star to rate this airlines. They missed one of my big suitcase to deliver me at Houston Airport. When i filed the claim for reimbursement for amount $165 then they just reimbursement for $50 product. They made un-necessary excuse for other product and did not reimbursement. When i told that i am gonna put this review everywhere then their executive said 'THAT SHOULD BE FINE'. Really pathetic service. I Won't prefer this airlines to anyone.
Date of travel: April 2019,40,"Aircraft seamed quite ""old""","Although the flight was comfortable, the aircraft of or second leg seamed quite old and used. The seats had several scratches. Finally we had to wait for our departure due to some technical problems with the aircraft. As the aircraft was old, we had a limited entertainment program. In opposite, on our first leg from Montego Bay to Philadalphia, we had a autie new aircraft. In Philadelphia, we had to hurry for changing planes and no time to go to the duty free or drink a coffee, as the line at the immigration was quite long. (We had one ticket for both legs.) The service at check (Montego Bay) in and in cabin was friendly. The food on the second leg (long haul) was good, on the first leg (short haul) there were only snacks for sale."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"Average, need to work on IFE app","This was my only option to leave Grenada as no direct flights could be obtained due to the COVID-19 issue.The plus side was that I had priority boarding so I was able to put my luggage in quickly and the crew seemed pretty upbeat in spite of the situation. Legroom was OK - maybe slightly higher than average.The downside was that the IFE app that you download to your device prior to flying was a little confusing to navigate. Movies were really easy to find, but what about music or live TV as was advertised? It was rather difficult and still couldn't find what I wanted. Another downside was the fact that I couldn't pay for anything in cash, but a lot of airlines are like that - but I've also traveled on airlines that did accept cash. These are small potatoes that can be ironed out.Overall, there wasn't anything amazing or awful about this flight and with the current situation, I'll take what I can."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Good and bad in all!,"Firstly our flight to NYC via JFK left and arrived inside their published times and service on board (a drink) was excellent, aircraft are clean and tidy and now have WiFi available at a cost.Entertainment is second to none with loads of movies, TV and games.However, the new menu on transatlantic flights has moved backwards in my opinion, with the good old pasta and chicken being replaced with, pasta or chicken balls ,what was the check Value for the master mind who did this?Leg room on the 737-800 was far better than the 777- 300 transatlantic, it seems the people in coach have to give so the rich at the front can take!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Dirty crew,Had to fly for business during corona epidemic flight is almost fully empty but the flight attendant still chose to seat me close to people breaking social distance standards. Would not fly again as American Airlines clearly hasn’t trained their attendants to adequately handle simple situations.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,A really great product offering,"I make this trip quite frequently and I try very hard to fly AA for it because I love the 787 but I also think AA offers a very good product on this route. My seat was main cabin extra so the leg room was very good. AA always gives you free wine on any international trip but with main cabin extra you also get free premium alcohol so I definitely started this morning flight with a bloody mary.The library of movies on the IFE is always the most current releases and this was no exception. A much better selection than BA.The food was also very good and I feel like AA gives you a pretty good spread. We had a full breakfast, a snack mid-flight, and then a hot pocket before landing. I really like these hot pocket snacks. This time I got the buffalo chicken. It was good but I've had a bbq beef one previously that was even better.I think we all know that AA can definitely improve their service because their flight attendants can be less than friendly for sure. But strictly from a product offering perspective, I think this is the best economy flight from LHR to ORD."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Pretty good flight,In July of 2019 I flew as flight 128 from shanghai to Dallas Fort Worth was good but can you improve the seats please? Overall pretty good food and service. 🙂
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Worst place to fly,"Got me to Colorado, cancelled my first return flight and made me call to reschedule, cancelled the rescheduled flight and offered me to option home. Had to buy Southwest tickets, now American is saying I qualify for a refund, welp it's been 6 days of the 7 it takes for a refund, and now my refund request is magically lost and they won't let me submit another. Trash company, hope there's a class action lawsuits for all this BS. Made me miss two days of work and show no empathy or care, won't even pay me back for the flights they cancelled! Horrible company, fly somewhere else."

I had a return part of a ticket on American for October 2020, they did let me change the ticket for a fee of $118, but they got me back to Miami. Nice flight, the food was pretty good and a nice selection of tv, movies.  Thank you to all the crew on AA that day, 22nd March Heathrow, Miami 09.45 AA39."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Inflexible and ill-informed supervisor,"When I called to inquire about the possibility of either a refund or an extended flight voucher, because I am not able to use my ticket by December 31, an American Airlines   supervisor was unwilling to grant me either of my requests. I explained both my extenuating circumstances and logic for cancelling my trip, given the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk I could put others at during travel. The supervisor was not aware that an American Airlines flight attendant has already passed away due to the illness, who was stationed right in Philadelphia --my final destination-- and when I tried to inform her of this she continued to deny the facts. I brought this case up to demonstrate that I should not be penalized for choosing to cancel my flight. I only cancelled to avoid putting others at risk, such as this flight attendant. It is unfortunate that American Airlines has supervisors unwilling to inform themselves about these tragedies, and unwilling to be flexible for those who chose to cancel."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Premium seat, average service","Boeing 777-200.  After flying Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines last year(very impressed), I wasn't sure how American would stack up.  I had read several reviews that were for the most part very good.  We sat in the middle section bulkhead row and while I prefer a window seat, this location was great.  The bulkhead on the 777-200 has tons of legroom, enough headroom to fully stand when the overhead bin is closed and the bulkhead seats have actual leg rests vs the foot rest only on the other rows.  You also don't have anyone reclining into your space making it easy to get up and move about.  A minor drawback(very minor) is the IFE system screen unfolds from the seat which reduces set width slightly at the knee area but, the other positives far outweigh this.  The food was quite good.  The only disappointment was the service.  It wasn't bad, just not great.  Anytime I needed a drink or something else, finding a flight attendant was difficult.  It seemed as if they were always in the back somewhere.  This was the biggest difference(there are a few others) between my good experience on American vs wonderful experience on Singapore.  Although this was an award flight, I would/will certainly fly this airline and this plane again in premium economy."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,First time in Business,"First time in Business class on an award ticket for my wife and I after saving for a while.  Boeing 777-200  Nice window seats/compartment at the rear of the 2nd mini cabin.  Flight boarded and departed on time.  IFE system had plenty of movies and shows.  Food was good and nicely presented.  Flight crew was exceptional and made sure everything was taken care of.  After the meal and a movie, I managed to get a few hours of sleep before our decent to Paris(I had requested not to be awakened for breakfast).  Business class passengers were given priority passes for immigration line upon arrival which was a nice gesture but not really needed at 6:15 am when we arrived.  Would love to fly this way again."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Terrible customer service,Due to COVID I needed to cancel my flight from fll to phl because my cruise was cancelled.  I was told that AA would waive the $200 Change fee for travel before October 2020 (1 year from purchase date) My husband does not like to fly so I asked if I could absorb the cost of his ticket that I could use for a solo trip. The representative on the phone suggested I write to their customer relations department. After a week I received the same response. I can not believe that in these trying times they are so inflexible. JetBlue put our money in a travel bank that anyone can use until December 2020. Needless to say I will NEVER purchase another American Airlines ticket.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"BEWARE American Airlines' ""Flight Credit"" is trash, and their Customer Service goes down fast","Upon canceling a flight online i was informed that I had a flight credit. After calling them and providing all of the necessary information for both my old and new flight,  the  system suddenly  kicked me out.I call again and got a new rep who while short with me, informed me that the flight change was successful and I could go online to view it, which I did.The following morning I get an email from American Airlines notifying me that the flight I'd just booked was CANCELED, with no explanation. When I call American Airlines again  I encountere a representative who speaks to me in an extremely condescending manner and acts as though I'm making up the fact that I'd recently rebooked my flight. After I brought his attention to the fact that my NEW flight information is mentioned within the cancelation email, he became agitated and accused me of yelling at him, before hanging up in my face. I then call American Airlines again and ask to speak with a supervisor. I explain everything to the supervisor and once I'm finished  I hear absolutely nothing for 7 to 10 seconds. This was the start of one of THE MOST oddest conversations I've ever had. Repeatedly I'd say something and hear absolutely nothing in response for 7-10 seconds and then as I'm saying ""hello"" to make sure she's still there, she would aggressively pop up and accuse me of talking over her!  Soon thereafter the  American Airlines SUPERVISOR HUNG UP in my face!Shame on American Airlines for treating loyal customers this way"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Run Around and Failed to Get Refund,"My business trip was cancelled due to Corvid-19 and so I went the route of trying to get a refund for my flight. After 2 weeks of phone calls and trying their online refund option as well I got nowhere. I canceled my flight a whole 16 hours after their 24 hour time frame and that was ""outside of their availability to refund."" SERIOUSLY?! The World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control have said that it is unsafe to travel.Regardless I was told that I would not be receiving a refund for my flight but I would get a voucher for future travel (don't forget that these expire). But who is to say that my business will still be going in that time frame. So I could potentially be stuck with a voucher and no job....I can honestly say that I will not be using American Airlines ever again!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Stressful time but American Airlines got me home,"My flight home was cancelled by American Airlines due to the Coronavirus pandemic.    They put us on a new flight from a different city.  My connection in London was not confirmed and we did not know if we had a flight until we checked in.  Very stressful, however, once at the airport the check in staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.  The flight was on time and got to london early.  The flight attendants were very nice.  The lounge in Miami was great and thank goodness for the American Airlines lounge in London as most everything else was closed.  Great people in london.  Will definitely fly with them again."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent Service!,"Although it was a short trip, Durranny Lobban made us feel well taken care of.  He offered us pop, chips and a cookie.  Durranny was very helpful and gracious.  We enjoyed meeting him!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best customer service ever,"I just had the best customer service experience I think I’ve ever had over the phone by Quentin. This person, in my opinion, deserves a raise, as I was able to get a replacement ticket for one that was impacted due to the travel ban. After trying to get some help from the site I bought the original ticket on and getting absolutely no help whatsoever, I decided to call American Airlines out of desperation. Going into this call, I didn’t know if I would get the help I needed, but I was surprisingly wrong. Due to the customer service, I am a lifetime American Airlines customer now."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Fast and confortable flight,"Despite a very convenient fee for this flight we had a very pleasant and comfortable flight, the cabin crew were really efficient, and, on our flight back thanks to favorable winds we arrived almost 2 hour earlier that scheduled. Very pleasant experience for a good price."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Nice flight,Great price and on-time flights. The staff was great. Seats were comfortable. In-flight entertainment movies/tv shows were helpful to pass the time and make the flight more enjoyable.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best Flight Ever!,"On our morning flight on 25 March from London Heathrow to Miami we had the best service from the lovely flight crew. It was during the coronavirus scare, so we probably had more attention than on a normal flight, but the crew treated us like royalty! It was the most enjoyable flight I've ever had and I would love to thank the crew for taking such good care of us. Probably the best airplane fold I've ever had as well!"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Not The Best,"On a 5 hour flight, round trip, it was frustrating that I couldn’t even watch/hear the on screen TV and movies.  The outlet on both flights to plug my EarPods in was broken. I mentioned it to the flight attendant, and all I got was a RUDE, “I can’t do anything about it”.  When it came time for the flight attendants to hand out snacks, we were given the choice of a tiny bag of 5 pretzels or a tiny stick of two cookies.  On a long flight, I was hungry, when they came around for the second round of drinks, I kindly asked if it was possible to get another pack of cookies, I got an attitude and the response was, I will have to find them. The flight attendants were not friendly at all, they all gave the attitude like they hated their job and everyone was a bother to them.  Not a comfortable or friendly flight at all."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Brilliant customer service - AA got us home in a time of crisis!,"My partner and I were unable to make our original British Airways flights from Costa Rica Via Miami back to the UK due to Covid-19 and U.S border closures invalidating our estas. Essentially, we had to stay an additional day to be able to travel home and British Airways (who we booked with) were unable to offer any alternatives flights home and trued to charge us $6,000. American Airlines customer service staff in Costa Rica were amazing, they made the necessary phone calls, found us a couple of flight options to get back to the UK that weekend and even were able to sit us together! They did all this free of charge and made it a lot less stressful than trying to get through to British Airways on the phone lines (impossible!). The service on the flight as well was brilliant despite stressful times for everyone given the current situation.Morale of story - Avoid BA and fly AA! :)"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Slightly Disappointing,"We splurged with first class tickets and the service and comfort were great, as expected.  I was disappointed to find there were no tv screens built into the seat backs as it was an older plane.  I had counted on being able to watch a movie in-flight.  This service is heavily promoted as part of first class service.  There should be a pop-up message or some sort of disclaimer that not all planes have movie service available.  Also when the person in front of me reclined, it was impossible for the window seat passenger to get out to use the restroom.  Otherwise, it was great."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Flights back to US cancelled with no notice - customer service suggests seek refund,"We had a confirmed flight back to US from Roatan (3/22). We called AA to verify flight and was told the flight was cancelled. They nicely rebooked us for following week (3/28). Couple days later we called again to verify and was told that our flight was still valid, after asking a few more questions to get a better assurance, agent told me the flight was cancelled and that there was nothing available until early May and she suggested we cancel reservation and seek a refund. I asked about their help with finding another flight on different airline and was basically told - good luck, your on your own. After many calls and conversations with different airlines - United Airlines added a couple more flights and we booked through them. unAmerican Airlines - leaving customers stranded and not offering any assistance to get back home - boo boo - not cool"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Every one is not 5 feet tall or under,I really hate flying on American.  I am pretty short but the distance for leg room is almost unbearable.  Our flight was supposed to be 4 hours but it ended up being 5 because so many planes were landing.  We circled for 30 minutes and then sat on the tarmack for another 30 minutes.  The stewardesses were pretty rude and it did not help to have zero room to even move.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Light load and 45 minutes long,"Very uneventful flight, the airbus was about half empty. Only water was passed by the flight attendant. It was cold and no blankets were onboard. Attendants were professional and respectful."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Loved the Monterey Airport and the employees - they were all great!,Ticket agent realized that my husband had a medical issue and was able to put us in seats that would be more comfortable for him. Felt like they really cared! Husband had just been released from hospital and we were returning to east coast.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,First Flight Ever - Impressed,"The girlfriend and I booked a trip out to Hawai’i to see her dad who is stationed at Schofield Barracks on O’ahu. I’m 23 and it was my first flight ever so I was sorta nervous. We had one stop on the way there and back. We started in STL on a 737-800 and landed at ORD. Changed planes at ORD to a 787-8 and flew +\- 8 hours to HNL. I was very pleased with the flight. The flight attendants were nice, and even wore Leis. They offered one meal, and many complimentary N/A beverages as well as free TV/Movies and even let you stream Apple Music for free. I do wish they had free WiFi, but I do understand it’s expensive receiving internet from a satellite. One more thing, you are packed like sardines and the seat doesn’t recline a whole lot. I hear this is how most airlines are. Make sure to bring a neck pillow. Complimentary blankets are placed on everyone’s seat to use. No hassle whatsoever flying with AA. I’ll be using them for our next trip out there. This time we’re flying main cabin extra. Take this with a grain of salt though, this was my first flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Flight to Tampa,Crowded flight ..no surprise since it was very cold and who wouldn't want to go to FL in February . Nothing too exciting which is good and well before the pandemic had taken over..so flying is no treat and this was a very standard flight which in itself is  what one hopes for ...
Date of travel: June 2019,10,Pathetic Service from a Once Great Airline,"DCA-ORD: FA BAD attitude, surlyORD-PDX: No pre-departure beverage even offered (FIRST CLASS) 30 min taxi-out. Smooth climb to FL350, level off, Capt makes his PA and the FA STILL sitting on her ass playing with her phone (min of 40 min into flight and she hadn't lifted a finger...cept to tap on her phone)"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Not a good way to start a trip,"We had an early morning flight, AA personnel NOT VERY HELPFUL, NOR PLEASANT, NOR UNDERSTANDING to check in at the gate.We were flying first class so one of the first to board.  The attendant checking our boarding pass said that our one carryone was too ""stuffed"" to be allowed (we were entitled to 2 carryons).  While I was explaining that we had our important medicines in the bag, another attendent was taking the bag and took it away.  I was not given the chance to get our medicines out nor anything us.  We boarded, not to cause any further delay, and I did explain to the cabin steward our plight.  He tried to retrieve our bag, but it was gone. Even the Captain got involved and both tried to assure us that our bag would arrive with us.  What aggrevated us even more were the sizes of the bags that the gate attendent allowed which much bigger than ours.   Flight left on time and arrived early on the connecting and final leg of the flight but it was very stressful.  Plane was comfortable.  Thankfully our bag made the connection  and the second flight has personable, pleasant staff."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Visiting Friends,"The planes we were on going to Tucson will completely filled.  Fortunately, we had assigned seats.  We were able to board early and proceeded to wipe down all parts of our seats (front, backs, buckles, seats, arms and trays).  We observed flight attendants using gloves when providing beverage service.  All in all, it was a normal flight experience."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,"Delay, delay, delay.....","We had a direct flight scheduled for our vacation to Costa Rica out of Sky Harbor in Phoenix and everything was going along fine until 2 hours before departure, (Mind you, our flight was scheduled to leave at 11:00 PM.) and than it was announced that the flight was delayed until 9 AM the following day. No one came to the gate counter to explain or offer any alternatives. I went to their customer service counter to complain because we had a shuttle service waiting for us in Costa Rica and lodging reservations in Costa Rica where the owners of the unit would be waiting for us. They first offered a voucher for a hotel room for the night but that did not help us with the inconvenience they were causing with our transportation and lodging. The attendant then offered to re-route us through Miami which would get us to Costa Rica around 11 AM instead of our original scheduled time of 5 AM. I understand that situations/circumstances happen all of the time but notifying passengers 2 hours before flight time and not immediately providing information about possible alternatives is not acceptable. Our trip was almost ruined because of their lack of communication. (as a side note, we made it to Costa Rica a couple of days before Costa Rica went into lock down status.)  Also, the airline offered no explanation for the delay but I later found out that it was because they did not have a crew for the flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Gainesville to College Station Texas,Short turn around from previous flights.  Know nothing was cleaned in-between.  Travel between March 11 - March 15.  Before the big COVID-19 warnings came out.  Hope cleanliness procedures have changed.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,They got me home!,"American got me home from the UK.  I had a trip over to the UK to see my mother who is alone at 88.  I had booked the return for October 2020, as I did have a Virgin ticket to come back on the 25th of March.  Virgin cancelled the trip and just me  high & dry.American did charge me $118, to change the ticket from October, but I was glad to pay.  The flight come over was probably about 48 people capacity wise & I am sure they lost money!Thank you American Airline for getting me back."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,I travel nothing but American,"This was my flight home after my school was cancelled and had us vacate campus. I was heartbroken, a bit of a weepy mess, and the flight attendants were incredibly kind and understanding. They chatted with myself and other passengers, they handed out extra snacks to those who wanted them, and kept us updated at a constant as to gates, connections, etc. Even in the airport, the workers were friendly and taking care to sanitize everything and calm people who were clearly agitated."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"If you have long legs, triple check which row you are in.","As with most airlines, American puts as many seats in the cabin, as they can fit.  Unfortunately for those of us with long legs, we end up with our knees jammed into the seat in front of us.  If the person in that seat leans back, I might as well spend the entire flight standing.  For some reason, this airline won't let the flight attendants allow passengers to move to another row, with more leg room, even if the row is empty, because those are premium rows and cost more.  I'm not asking to be moved to first class; just a row where I'm not in pain.  It's especially irritating, when I'm looking at the shorter person in this row all by himself, stretched out, crossing his legs, like he's in a recliner at home.  It's ridiculous to have to pay extra for adequate leg room."

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Travelled on our original itinerary,The plane from Key West to Charlottes was full.  The flight from Charlotte to Buffalo was less than half full.  We stuck to our original schedule and had no issues.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,LAX to SYD Premium Economy,"With 6 of us flying to Australia , we couldnt afford our usual business class, so we went for the next best thing, Premium Economy.  We certainly had some anxiety not being in business for a 15hr flight but we were pleasantly surprised how comfortable the seat was.  There are only 3 rows of Premium Economy on the 787, so it felt very private and quiet.  The seats remind us of domestic Frist class but recline farther back and theyhave a foot rest. We slept well, appreciated the special menu just for Prem Econ...all in all , it was a great flight , great value for the money."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,American Airlines is a joke,Cancelled our flight one hour before at 12:00 am. We are traveling with an infant.This airline is pathetic.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Wide-body flight from Miami to Dallas,"Everybody is doing their best. Airlines are a corporate mess, but the flight attendants and the pilots and everybody working on the front lines for American Airlines is doing a great job in troubled times."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,I guess third times a charm,"This time everyone was nice, polite, and understanding with the Coronavirus situation going on. We were given options to separate for safety reasons. . When leaving Cedar Rapids no flight attendant was available so one of the outside workers handled seating changes and explained that the ride to DFW would probably be bumpy. Then the pilot apologized for the rough ride and tried to find a better altitude to no avail But we made it home safely.Last year I was so angry with them, I had planned to never fly with them again.  I feel better now, and I think they have improved their customer service"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"As an active duty Marine, I will never fly or get my dependents to fly with AA again.","I was excited when I booked my wife’s flight to come live with me at my current duty station, and my wife was gonna bring our son, (family dog) which is the only kid we have. I planed it out with attention to detail, getting my dog a health inspection days prior before the flight. I talked to a cargo rep over the phone and asked about the size of the dog, my buddy only weighs 80Ibs and with his cage it would put him a few pounds over the 100Ibs there hold for AA, however the representative assured me that it no problem, and I was willing to pay more due to him not meeting the standard weight requirements. However, my wife got to the station hours before boarding her flight and the BAD NEWS happened, I got the phone call that my best buddy wasn’t coming. American Airlines refused to put  him in cargo “stating he is too big” my wife told me multiple people came to confront her at the airport pulling up their “policies and procedures”, my wife felt horrible due to the fact she had to leave him with family and knowing how important my dog means to me. If they are willing to practice this lack of empathy they should educated their employees of their practices so they do not mislead customers with the services they provide."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Charged us  for bags that  were to be free.,"I used my  credit  card to purchase  trip. We   are  to have free bags according  to Citi  Card.

He said customs and immigration had never been ""so easy"", and then he proceeded to cough, mouth uncovered.  I was furious and terrified. This was right after the news broke about all flights from Europe being banned two days earlier. I have been self-isolating ever since and it's been 8 days. Hoping and praying that the country gets better both in health and economically, and sooner rather than later! God Bless."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Overall aerage experience,I flew economy class from Toronto (YYZ) to Miami (MIA) . The service was very basic. Worst part is that I felt very cramped in a middle seat.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Thoroughly disgusted,"As a reliable venue to me numerous times in the past as I look to develop travel plans, I am writing this review on Trip Advisor, to share my recent experience with American Airlines. As all of us have had numerous changes in our lives related to covid-19 and continue to experience uncertainty as changes are daily and often extensive. My daughter's university closed and she was forced to leave campus. We determined it best to have her come home as soon as possible. She has a dog. We made flight reservations, when she arrived she was told crate would not be accepted. We were able to make a flight change for the next day. Now 2 nights stay in a hotel, and the purchase of acceptable AA approved crate- she arrived again at the airport this morning and was told now unable to fly with dog because temp in Boston was expected to be below 45 deg. I called the airlines to beg them to reconsider as given the uncertainty and potential at some point for further restrictions on domestic travels and/or assistance with alternatives- the first women I spoke with Linda, told me there are no alternatives per their rules with regard to pet travel. I explained the situation (my daughter has no housing, Uof A- Tuscon is now closed for the remainder of the semester and  her friends are gone). Linda told me quite inappropriately that my daughter's ""dog would die on the plane so she might as well just let the dog go at the airport and get on the plane"". My second call to a customer service rep, now with a request to either get refund or credit as I am not a meterologist and temps to any airport in the northeast are quite variable this time of year, and again begged for consideration  due to significance of current circumstances with covid-19 - they refused stating rebook from yesterday to today constituted my ""1 covid-19 waiver"".  I fully understand rules are rules but with these incredibly extenuating circumstances, one would think compassion would exceed profit and rules. Neither I nor any of my family will again travel via American Airlines. I sit home in CT planning my drive to AZ as I am unable to lose further money with airfares to try to get my daughter home all with the fear that further travel restrictions are looming. American Airlines is truly poorly named."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Wonderful uneventful flight - friendly flight attendeds,Check-in - the flight checkin was very smooth. Friendly check-in staff Boarding - boarding was smooth. Although boarding families with kids early would’ve been better. Flight - flight was bumpy but captain managed it well. Landing was rough though. Immigration- officers were very friendly and welcoming in-spite  of the COvID concerns and stress due to that on them controlling our boarders. Fly AA any day.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Intrusive,"Flight was fine, pilot did a very good job of communicating when we expected turbulence and for how long along with ETAs of arrivals. I was VERY put out that during a length of 2:20 min flight, for which the lights were off the whole flight (left at 7:04 PM), they turned the lights in n with more than 1\2 he left me n the fight they turned the lights on, made a very lengthy announcement and peddled a credit card offer. The flight attendant walked backward through the aisle essentially showing the brochure specifically towards every person individually, then repeated the process back up the aisle. They then turned the lights back off and resumed the normal flight. I found it very unprofessional, not the flight attendants, the practice the company made them perform."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Nice flight on modern 777.  Seat pitch terrible.,Checkin did well to get me on flight.  Had to cancel flight to Rio previous day due to Corona still not sure if I will be reimbursed.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Trip Cancelled because of statewide Shelter In Place order (non-refundable)(,"California has a ""shelter in place"" order that caused me to cancel an upcoming flight on American Airlines.  When I requested a refund for the ticket I could no longer use, this was the response from AA:Thanks for your request. We're sorry your travel plans changed but your trip is non-refundable.Please call 800-433-7300 to rebook your ticket or check your available credit.When you rebook your trip keep in mind:The same passenger must travel on the rebooked ticket.Travel must be completed before your ticket expires.Other fees may apply.Thanks for choosing American Airlines.This is TERRIBLE service during a time of crisis for our country.  I've flown almost two million miles on AA; I won't be flying many more."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Great short haul flight but wifi unreliable,"I took the 7:27 evening flight from Los Angeles to Vancouver.  The flight is operated with an E175 regional jet configured 1X2 in business class.  This is a nice regional jet as the overhead bins are large enough to accommodate standard size roll on board carry on cases so there was no need to gate valet check carry on luggage as is the case with older regional jets.  I had seat 1A, the single seat in the first row.  It is both a window and an aisle seat and being a bulkhead seat, the legroom is outstanding, better than on larger A321 jets.  The captain announced flight time was 2 hours 29 min.  Dinner was served on the flight, though it was cold food due to the short length of the flight.  I had the Asian salad with sesame dressing with a side of chicken, and there was even a small slice of cake for dessert.   The other choice was a Greek platter, presumably vegetarian.  For a short flight, I thought the meal offering was very good. Entertainment on the flight is supposed to be by connecting to the wifi and viewing the free movies and TV programs.  However, though my phone indicated it was connected to the wifi, there apparently was not enough signal to get the entertainment, or e-mails or whatsapp. One thing I did for the most recent journeys on American Airlines is to download the AA app, which I found to be quite useful as it reminded me of flights times, boarding times and boarding gates, but in particular for the track your bags feature which was very timely and allowed me to check on each flight that my checked luggage had made it onboard the plane.  Once connected to the in flight wifi, you can access the functions of the AA app for free (except of course on this flight on the E175 where I could not get the wifi to work, on previous flights on A321, the wifi and the AA app worked fine)."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,another unforeseen circumstance and got screwed again,"after American Airlines cancelled my nonstop flight to China while other airlines where still flying there, i had to repurchase a new ticket to China flying through Japan on Japan Airlines.unfortunately it was a code sharing flight and i ended up back on AA.  i've had intended to purchased this flight on Japan Airlines over the AA flight because JAL generally has better service and better food.  normally, this would have not been such a big deal to me but we've run into some strong winds on the day and was sitting on the runway for 2.5 hours and cannot takeoff.  at this time, an announcement was made that the crew would have ""timed out"" if they would have completed this flight, and that we would have to return to the terminal.   They now need to wait for a new flight crew to make this journey.the weather condition was not AA's fault but i don't understand how, for a 11-13 hour flight, they didn't build in any contingencies in the schedule for a 2.5 hour delay.  not sure if timing out is safety issue or if the airlines won't authorize overtime pay to the crew, but whatever, i'm not an expert and this is the least of my issues with them on this day.as we returned to the terminal, we had to wait 7-8 hours before they can arrange for another crew for this flight.  my mid afternoon arrival in tokyo turned into a late night one, and this creates huge problems for me.i ve purchased this ticket because it had a long layover where i can spend a late afternoon and evening in tokyo before flying out the next morning.  the late night arrival means that i lose this time in tokyo, lose my opportunity for public transportation to my hotel (taxi's are expensive in japan) and lose the use of this hotel room.i had asked for one extra night stay in tokyo as they ruined my original schedule, they allowed the flight change, but i was not compensated for the hotel room.  i felt it was the least they can do after mismanaging the 8 hour delay."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,unfortunate circumstances but was not properly compensated,"i've bought 2 round trip tickets from Shanghai, China to LA.  due to the corona virus, my return from LAX to Shanghai was cancelled and had to repurchase a flight back to China through Japan on a Japanese airline.  my new one way flight back to China was the cheapest flight at the time but was still considerably more than half of my original round trip ticket.  i would argue that they should make up the difference as it was their decision to cancel the flight as a that time there was other airlines flying to china.should have known that was wishful thinking as much less than half of my round trip ticket price was refunded.  they claimed that the first leg cost more than the return.  how am i suppose to know that?  i didn't buy each leg separately.  i bought a round trip fair.  i've also paid to reserve seats for this flight and also was not refunded.  now this is just blatant robbery!why do i have to pay so much extra and waste so much more of time to rectify actions/decisions that were made by American Airlines"
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Not a happy camper,"I had booked my flight 3 months in advance but American doesn't let you pick your seats when you purchase and then not at all if you don't pay to do it. What a crock!My husband and I got the last  row center seats, I was fuming, and to top it off, he had to check his carry on, of course, we were in the last row. The bag never showed and finally in a ditch scan he noticed it on a cart that a worker had, ugh, the worst, I will avoid this airline in the future."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Taking advantage of people during pandemic. Shane on you aa,"American corporate greed at its finest. American Airlines has no customer service and wants to pocket as much money as they can during this pandemic. At the end of the month my foreign exchange  student manuel was supposed to go on a trip with the foreign exchange program to Washington DC. We booked a flight through Alaska Airlines to go there and a flight with American Airlines to come back. The trip was canceled obviously and Alaska Airlines was kind enough to let him transfer the $135 ticket to somebody else's name since he will not be able to use it but American Airlines decides to keep the $355 ticket and won't let him transfer it to anybody else.He is going back to Spain today so obviously he cannot use that $355 it expires at the end of the year. I hope we don't bail out companies like this. For years they have been profiting millions if not billions of dollars off of high priced tickets and crammed seating with horrible customer service and during this worldwide pandemic they aren't even willing to make exceptions because it affects their bottom line, making money.We got denied on a refund which I expected, but you would think they would be willing to credit the money and let somebody else use it the way Alaska Airlines did.Shame on companies that are using this time to take advantage of customers."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Roundtrip from Philadelphia to New Orleans,"Nice flight! On time departure, early arrival! Flight attendant let my husband and I move to an empty row of seats after take off."

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Change in flights wasn't an issue.  Customer service very helpful and friendly.,"When I arrived at the airport the customer service rep told me that my flight, which was to be at 11.30am, had been changed and I was now flying out at 4.30pm.  She quickly noticed that I had a connecting flight (Cancun to Miami to LA) and worked her  magic and got me on a flight leaving at the same time as my original flight , going via Houston, and arriving at the approximate same time as my original flight. She was fabulous.  And patient while I moved stuff from 1 overweight suitcase to another. The flight it self was ok, nothing to complain about."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Getting family back to Texas,"My trip was about returning a family member to her new home in Texas. Mentally and physically exhausted we were treated with the kindest people. The staff on our journey were kind, patient and helpful. WE could not have had a better flight. Thank you"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight to NYC,The flight arrived ahead of schedule even though we left the gate a few minutes late.  The flight attendants were very friendly and accommodating.  Only drinks and a packaged snack were served as the flight was just over an hour.  We flew first class this time as the price was worth it when checking bags.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good Service,We flew home from a cruise in February via Philadelphia on American Air.  A direct flight would have been nice as the couple hour layover ( in Philadelphia)was not something we would have  chosen to do after disembarking from our cruise. The plane had the usual leg room and seat space...okay for me as I am not tall..but perhaps not as comfortable for larger passengers. We  did have screens( seat back) for watching movies or TV which helped pass the time. Beverages are complimentary ( non alcoholic) Flight crew were friendly enough . The second American Airlines plane we boarded for the last leg of the trip was a very small commuter plane...about 56 seats in all. As the weather had been nasty in Toronto we were not only delayed in take-off but once we were close to Pearson Airport we had to stay in a holding pattern until we were able to land. This flight was a little rocky ( weather related ) and the landing also pretty bumpy...but we made it safely and that's what counts. Both planes were clean tidy and staff pleasant.
Date of travel: March 2020,20,No refund without cancelling? HUH?,"""Due to the status of your itinerary we are unable to complete your refund request. Your itinerary needs to be cancelled prior to requesting a refund.""Due to weather, our flight was delayed.  Naturally, we missed our connecting flight.  I asked the person at the counter what to do. They said they could book me on a flight the next day.  We wanted to get home.  I said ""What if we buy a ticket for a different airline.  Can we get a refund for the last leg from AA?""  He said ""Sure.  Go to the refunds page of AA.com tomorrow.""  Well...Now, I get this error message:  ""Due to the status of your itinerary we are unable to complete your refund request. Your itinerary needs to be cancelled prior to requesting a refund.""   What???  I cannot access my itinerary naturally.  Any suggestions?"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight 693,"While vacationing in Cancun, found out that my sister  was critically ill. Needed to change our return flight ASAP. After first getting cut off after 1 hour wait, left message. Got callback later from Stacy at AA and she helped us to convert our split flight to a direct flight to Chicago and they waived all fees. Her quick action enabled us to get to the hospital before my sister died. So grateful to Stacy and American Air!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great flights,"Family vacation we flew from ICT to DFW then from there to MIA. Great service on both flights the second plane was a 777 which are wonderful planes and the ones I look to fly on. They have with huge 1st class seats with tv to your self, pair of ear phones, blanket, and seats can fully recline into a bed. You will receive nuts drinks of your choosing even alcoholic drinks which are included no extra charge then you get a meal my family always pics the cheese and fruit tray. When flying 1st class you will also receive 2 free checked bags ( 70lbs or less) so this is also nice as you won’t need to lug around a carry on in between airports. You also have a huge over head bin all to yourself just in case you do need to take a carry on."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Helpful staff in light of pandemic happening,"Basic aircraft, no extras like in seat video, was happy to get off the ground and home safely.  Airline was more than helpful and calm and made this flight enjoyable at least.  Quick efficient in flight snack, full can of soda and no rush to finish.  Comforable seats for this long flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Satisfactory trip,Flight was fine flew into Chicago O Hare expecting a mess from tv days before but airport was empty.  Tried to change our flight to go through Dallas or Houston but the airline wanted $200 each more so did not change it.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Staff wasn't overly friendly,"The staff was not friendly.  I paid for First Class and was offered a beverage however, I wasn't offered anything more than 1 snack for a 2 hour flight.The plane was freezing but the overall comfort was ok."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent Service,"For a minimum upgrade price, my wife and I chose to fly First Class on a round trip to New York City. We don’t do it often, but it was a great decision. The service and comfort was outstanding, and even more importantly, both flights took off and landed as scheduled. Great job American Airlines."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Good food but dirty seat on flight and nice renovated Admiral's Club lounge at Charlotte Douglas airport,"I connected at Charlotte Douglas airport for a flight to Los Angeles and used the Admiral's Club lounge at Terminal B which is the smaller but recently renovated AA lounge at Charlotte.  The lounge has plenty of seating and attractive clean decor.  There is also a buffet area with a salad bar, daily hot soup and a daily grains bowl.  I enjoyed the hot potato soup supplemented with diced chicken pieces from the salad bar for a substantial snack. The flight was operated with an A321 configured 2X2 in domestic First Class.  I had seat 1C which has extra legroom due to there being no seat in front.  However, half of the overhead bin above row 1 on this side is taken up by equipment and not usable.   For a second flight in a row, I boarded to find my seat very dirty with crumbs and even an oily stain on the seat bottom.  The incoming flight had arrived much earlier so the airline certainly had time to clean, but apparently did not do so at all.Flight time was announced preflight by the captain as 4 hours 50 minutes but it ended up being longer as our flight was directed to use the Pacific approach.  We ended up landing about 20 minutes late. Despite the cabin steward in my incoming flight taking noticeable further precautions due to the coronavirus pandemic, the cabin steward on my flight did not seem to take any extra precautions.  In flight service consisted of drinks on boarding and hot lunch served in flight.  The choice was vegetarian pasta and short rib.  I chose the short rib and it was very tender and delicious. The meal was nicely presented served with an appetizer of shrimp on coleslaw and sprial pasta and beans under the short rib.  Ice cream for dessert was offered at the end of lunch. In flight entertainment is by connecting to the wifi and accessing the free movies and TV programs.  There was a good selection of programs and I found the connectcion reliable.  However, you have to use your own device to access the system.  Note that there is no in seat power outlet at my seat so you have to rely on charging up your device prior to the flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"Limited service on short haul flight, poor cleaning of seat","I flew from Fort Lauderdale to Charlotte to connect to another flight.  The short, less than 2 hour flight, is operated with an A321 configured 2X2 in domestic First.  The flight was full in First as American Airlines almost always are due to its program to upgrade frequent flyers on a complimentary basis. On boarding, I noticed my seat was full of crumbs, obviously no cleaning in the short turnover time between the incoming flight and my flight.  I ended up wiping all around my seat thoroughly. During boarding, drinks were offered.  After takeoff, drinks were offered again together with a basket of snacks such as apple chips, cookies, granola, oat bars and nuts but as it was almost mid-March and the coronavirus concern was raising in the US, the cabin steward was wearing gloves (but not a mask) during the flight and he handed you your snack selections and you could not reach into the basket yourself.  In flight entertainment if by accessing the wifi on your own device to watch free movies and TV programs.  It worked well during my flight.  However, one has to make sure one's device is charged since there is no in seat power outlet in my seat, 1C first row aisle.For a short flight with limited service, it was fine."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight made by excellent service,"The flight itself aside from being quicker than expected was pretty standard, but the service we received from Durranny Lobban was excellent. His demeanour was upbeat and pleasant and he was willing to help in any way he could to make every passenger's flight better than expected. American Airlines, you need to hire more people like Durranny, he is an asset to your company.Durranny, thank you for making a standard flight EXCEPTIONAL, best of luck for the future.Flight details:17th marchPIA to ORDAA Flight 4069"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Great, comfortable flight","I was really expecting something bad, judging from earlier reviews on various sites, but our flight went great. We were in a beautiful, clean plane, in a huge seat with mucho leg room. The food was more than decent and rather innovative. We were served an appropriate amount of drinks and food. All the stewardesses were professional. Our flight was one time. Our luggage was all there. What's to complain about?"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Pathetic food for premium economy on AA HNL-DFW 18 Mar 20,"Really enjoyed the premium economy seats and B 787-9 on AA today.  We loved the B-787's clean spacious cabin, quiet engines and large clean bathrooms. We moved from Germany last summer having flown Lufthansa (LH) for most of our trips there for 3 years.  We found LH's service top notch; free adult and non adult beverages on most flights w/professional and customer oriented flt attendants.  In less than a yr back in the US flying w/US carriers, this level of service has not been the case, including today's flt from HNL to DFW. The one free"" meal"" offered on premium economy was pathetic. A turkey sandwich w/one small piece of turkey on white bread was served. The dinner box included a pack of nuts, a decent cake dessert and a salad which had some type of cheese and small green like pebbles. We had no idea what it was...tasteless.  True, this was a night departure, but the level of service just wasn't there.  If Jeb Brooks would have rated this flight on his ""Jeb Scale"" it would have been rated poor.  Other air carrier evaluators we watch (Non Stop Dan and Sam Choi) would have rated it the same.  I was really surprized AA put this product out."

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Wonderful flight,"Great flight.  Nice wide body Airbus jet.  Paid extra for seat up front with extra leg room.  It was well worth it for a 4 hour flight.  Free drinks when you get upgraded seats.  Left on time, Arrived an hour early.  Nice smooth ride.  Great flying experience."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Great airlines,"I think the flight going there was a lot better then the return flight. The flight attendants had a lot of attitude and were sassy. Our seats were changed on flight without any reasoning, I was told to close my window because the sun was in her face, and they were being snappy with other passengers. Overall the flight was great, the pilot made it very smooth, and the food/ snacks were excellent."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,"We flew ""First Class"" on this extremely tired, almost pathetic, joke of an airline.","We have a point of reference. We flew on another airline who's entire home country 'boasts"" a population 1 million less to that of the entire Washington DC metropolitan area.  Here's the situation: American Airlines offers Chevy Impala comfort, luxury, attentiveness at the same price that Air New Zealand offers Rolls Royce quality amenities/treatment.What's not to like with AA's sophomoric, 'its all about me,' nearly rude service?  Cavalier, ""You see what you get"" attitude. Lighting in the First Class cabin = Old K-Mart.  Food = a slight step above cheese and crackers.  First Class seating/bed = tight, coffin like encumbrances."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,You Wouldn't Believe!  But What a Wonderful Captain.,"To sum up:  Plane's systems glitched after we boarded.  Spent about an hour unsuccessfully addressing that.  Switched to another aircraft, towed out of the maintenance hangar.  Boarded after another hour.  Plane was being fueled, but new ground technician made an error in balancing the fuel.  Had to unfuel one side and move jet fuel to the other to balance the plane.  Finally pulled back after an almost added hour's wait.  Moved out to taxiway.  Pilot came on to say plane in front of us (also American) had a radio failure and was not airworthy.  Had to be towed aside because ""no way we can back up and go around him.""  Over 3 hours late, we finally took off.  Good side:  our Captain kept us fully informed every step of the way with honesty and sincere apologies for not ""providing a level of service you should rightfully expect.""  He was engaging (""in 35 years of flying I've never seen a combination like this"") and just a nice guy.  We were fortunate that we had no connections to make, but we were oh so sorry for all those who did.Did I mention I accidentally left my iPad in the seat pocket of the first plane?  We sat there for an hour, and when the order came to ""get up and de-plane"" well, I did.  My bad.  AA's ""Lost & Found"" - even with the flight number, the plane (Airbus 310), the row and seat number - just has not been able to find the iPad.Other bottom line:  even though these delays were mechanical (not weather), and even though many people missed connections or appointments by a mile, American offered nothing.  Guess that's their new normal.  When my wife explained to the AA help desk in the airport, and asked if the airline would provided any compensation, the desk agent practically reared back, raised eyebrows, and said, ""For what? What do you mean 'compensation'?""  End of review."

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Better than expected,"Had to fly back to UK via Dallas due to cancelled BA flights was a bit worried after reading so many negative reviews and we only had 50 mins between flights. However all the staff we encountered from check-in to the two flights were very helpful and friendly the business class seats are much more comfortable than BA much better configuration, and loads more room. Dallas airport is also excellent very slick operation had no problem changing planes took 15mins to get off one plane change terminals and be at the departure gate for next flight."

Date of travel: January 2020,10,First and last experience with this airline,This was by far the worst two flight I’ve ever experienced. This was my first experience with this airline so to my surprise there was no individual entertainment. It was an extremely outdated plane. There were movies on shared screens. I even heard other people complain. The staff were the rudest ive ever seen. It was a completely booked flight and there were some difficulties finding spots for carry on luggage. The staff was visibly overwhelmed and one attendant opened Overhead storage which caused bulking heavy plastic ski boots to fall on a passenger. She was clearly hurt and instead of apologizing he lectured her for not being in her seat. The food was absolute garbage. I will never fly with them again.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Good Flight to Seattle from NOLA,The best way to fly when you can afford it.  The flight attendants could have been a bit more attentive.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Excellent renovated Admiral's Club at Charlotte Terminal B and OK late evening flight,"I connected at Charlotte Douglas airport for Fort Lauderdale and as I had a generous couple of hours' connection time, I waited for my flight at the smaller of American's lounges at Charlotte at Terminal B as it was the renovated one.  The lounge was not busy at around 8 pm. The decor in the renovated Terminal B lounge is very clean and airy, and there was a buffet area a salad bar where you could make your own salad, a mixed grains pot, and a daily hot soup.  I had the tomato Florentine soup of the day and it was very tasty, made the more satisfying by the diced chicken pieces I added from the salad bar.  The mixed grains was quite good too and satisfying.  My flight boarded on time at around 10 pm for its 10:25 pm departure.  We pushbacked early at 10:21 pm, took off at 10:37 pm and arrived a little early at 12:10 am.  The flight is operated with an A321 configured 2X2 in domestic First Class. As it was a late evening flight and less than 2 hours' flight time, in flight service was very limited, just drinks and then offering of a basket of snacks such as chips, nuts and cookies.  As a result I was very glad I had a long layover at the louge in Charlotte and filled myself up with the delicious hot soup, mixed grains and salad bar. An excellent lounge exerience at Charlotte Terminal B, and an OK late evening flight with limited service."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good Flagship First Lounge LAX and mid-day flight to Charlotte,"I connected at LAX to American's flight to Charlotte.  I did not have much layover time but as my flight was departing from a gate near the Flagship First Lounge, I managed to drop in for a quick visit.  The lounge was not very busy at around 10:20 am, lots of seating and good food offerings in a buffet area.  It was still set for breakfast with a freshly prepared to order omelet station and interesting healthy drinks like tumeric carrot juice.  It was a very nice brief stop in the lounge. My flight to Charlotte boarded on time.  The flight was operated with an A321 configured 2X2 in domestic First class.  During boarding, the captain announced the flight time to be 4 hours and 2 minutes.  We had a considerable delay on pushback as mechanics determinted the plane had too much hydraulic fluid.  We were scheduled for takeoff at 11:37 am but due to the maintenance issues, we ended up pushing back at 12:29 pm, almost an hour late.  We made up a bit of time in flight but still ended up landing late at 7:37 pm rather than the scheduled 7:14 pm.  Lunch was served on board.  I had the salad with cold grilled chicken breast on the side, and a smoked salmon appetizer.  The chicken was pretty dry so not a great meal, but definitely a good satisfying sized meal.  They may have served dessert after lunch but I dozed off and would have missed it. Entertainment on board was by way of free movies and TV programs through the onboard wifi (free to use to access the onboard entertainment) which you view on your own phone, tablet or laptop.  I was able to connect to the wifi and watch the entertainment and thought the selection of movies and TV programs was very good for a domestic flight. The seat was very wide but did not have much recline.  I had seat 1C which is the aisle bulkhead seat with extra legroom.  I managed to nap fairly well in the seat but for a longer flight, the limited recline might be more uncomfortable. Overall, a good flight with good service, though somewhat uninspiring food offering on this particular flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Good flights,"The flights were good and on time for the most part. The only issue was trying to get into the exit rows. The flight from Phoenix to Miami I was told I couldn't change seats even though there were empty seats in the exit row. From Miami to Belize, they said it would cost $71 so I didn't because it was just a 2 hour flight. From Belize City to LA, they put me in the exit row at no charge. Then from LA to Phoenix, it was $12. No idea why the variations. But the planes were clean and the attendants friendly and professional for the most part."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very good product for short haul regional jet,"I took the early morning American Airlines flight from Vancouver to Los Angeles.  As the flight departs at 7 am, I had to get to the airport very early before 5 am.  American has no lounge in Vancouver so unfortunately there was no place to wait other than at the gate.  Check in, security and US customs and immigration were all very quick early in the morning. The flight is operated with an E175 jet, a small 75 seater jet configured 1X2 in business and 2X2 in economy, with good sized overhead bins that can fit regular roll on board carry on bags.  I reserved seat 1A which is a bulkhead window seat by itself with no aisle seat next to it.  As it is a bulkhead seat with no seat in front of it, legroom is excellent and I could stretch out as much as I wanted, certainly more than in the same bulkhead seats on the larger jets.Flight time was announced to be 2 hours 23 minutes, with another 10 minutes from landing to parking at gate since the plane would have to taxi over to the American Airlines satellite terminal for its regional jets.  Pushback was on time at 6:56 am and takeoff was at 7:11 am.  We landed early at 9:38 am but lost a bit of time on the taxi to the gate as there was a lot of traffic on the taxiway.  We reached our gate at 9:56 am, which was an on-time arrival. For a short flight, I was impressed with the service in business class.  A full cold breakfast was served, either cold salmon or yogurt with fruit and muesli.   I opted for the cold salmon and it was a very full tray including mayonnaise potato wedges, fruit slices and danish.  Food quality was very good. American provides entertainment on its flights by wifi (free to watch the on board entertainment), but I was unable to connect to the wifi signal.  From experience on other flights, it seems the wifi signal is not that strong or reliable on the E175 regional jet, though wifi works well on the larger planes in the fleet.  As I could not connect to the wifi, I could not view the free entertainment as there are no screens in the plane itself.Overall for a short haul regional jet flight, I thought the product was very good with a fairly new plane with regular sized overhead bins and very good food service for a short flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Delayed flight with poor service,"American Airlines Flight 2312SXM-PHL2:40-7:13 pmBoeing 757-200Although we recently had a good experience on American on our way from Philadelphia to St. Maarten, the experience on this return leg a few days later was definitely not the best. It was emblematic of frequent inconsistency in American’s service from flight to flight.We woke up on the morning of our flight to see that it was already showing a one-hour delay at 7:00 am, with the aircraft appearing to be delayed leaving Boston on its way to Philadelphia and then St. Maarten. I don’t know why that first flight of the day was delayed, but it seemed to be due to something within AA’s control, since the weather was perfect in all of the cities where the plane was going that day. The delay continued to build, and by late morning, we knew that our flight was now estimated to depart two hours late. Luckily, we were able to arrange a late checkout at our hotel and push back our transportation from Anguilla back to St. Maarten.When we arrived at SXM that afternoon, the lines to check-in at the American ticket counter were very long, although an employee opened an additional line shortly thereafter and sent us into it (while others who had been there longer stayed in the longer line), making our wait go down in length considerably. The staff member who checked us in was nice, and asked if we were aware of the flight delay and updated departure time. Once we had dropped off our checked bags, both the security and emigration lines at SXM were relatively short, largely because we were delayed beyond the time that most flights for the US leave each day. Once we found the gate that was indicated on our boarding passes, I was surprised to find that there was no staff there, and the TV monitor at the gate was turned off, rather than displaying our flight to PHL as the next flight. Because American had two flights to the US around the same time, one to Philadelphia and one to Miami, a lot of passengers were wandering around the small terminal area kind of confused about where to go. An announcement was made shortly after the aircraft arrived, confirming that it was the correct gate and announcing that boarding would soon begin.I was glad that we didn’t have to take a bus from the gate to the aircraft, which can be required at SXM depending on where the aircraft is parked. Our plane was right outside the gate, so we were able to walk right over and go up exterior stairs to board. However, one problem was that stairs had been set up in two spots: one set at the mid-cabin where Economy starts, and one set at the very back of the Economy cabin. Passengers were getting on from both sides, with bottlenecks created when people needed to get to seats in the opposite direction down the aisle or were having trouble finding overhead bin space. It was definitely a long boarding process, and even once the aircraft doors were closed, it seemed to take an inordinately long time to finally push back. We ultimately departed about two hours late, even though I think the delay could have been decreased a bit if the boarding process had been more efficient.One thing I found irritating about this flight in general was that the delay was never really acknowledged. Not once at the gate or on the aircraft was an announcement made that explained why we were delayed or simply apologized for the inconvenience. It was totally ignored, as if wasting everyone’s time and causing missed connections is no big deal. The announcement from the captain at the start of the flight neither acknowledged the delay nor gave us any pertinent information that you normally receive at the start of a flight.We had paid to upgrade to Main Cabin Extra (MCE) seats with extra legroom, and the legroom was definitely sufficient. However, as we’ve found on this aircraft before, the seats were very short and uncomfortable. I’m 5’9” and my head was sticking well above the top of the headrest, which wasn’t very comfortable, and it made it feel like the seat was miniature in size. The old 757s also really show their age in the bathrooms, which look absolutely ancient even when they’re somewhat clean.In-flight entertainment consisted of the standard set of movies and tv shows that you could stream through aa.com on your own device, and old monitors hanging in the cabin every few rows showed a movie and then a bunch of sitcom episodes throughout the flight. The seats also had power outlets between them, which I didn’t even try to use since I find that they often don’t work.Service on this flight was very inconsistent. One flight attendant was very nice and professional, even offering to get us wine from the First Class cabin when we asked for it and there was none left in the Economy beverage cart. Another flight attendant was not particularly nice, and the third was downright rude. On multiple occasions, she snapped at passengers for no reason. A passenger in the row in front of us asked her if she knew how to operate the power outlets between seats, which seems like a reasonable question. She was incredibly rude, telling him that the outlet is probably just a cigarette lighter outlet (it’s definitely not) and when he said he was having trouble since he can’t see it below the seat, she was very snarky in snapping back with “do you think I can see your outlet either? cookies or pretzels?”  It was a totally rude response for no reason. I would think from flying all the time, most flight attendants have at least some idea of how the features of the aircraft operate, and even if they don’t, a good flight attendant would be much kinder.  The same flight attendant was very snappy and rude when preparing the cabin for landing as well, yelling at both myself and my wife that we had to put away our keyboards on our iPads, which are simply part of an iPad case and clearly not a laptop that needs to be stowed. It’s unfortunate that rude flight attendants can ruin the experience even when others are doing a great job. Two complete drink services were completed during the flight, which was enough for a 4.5-hour flight. For food, a choice of Biscoff cookies or pretzels was offered, along with food for purchase. We used the online pre-order option to pre-order a couple of sandwiches before the flight. The flight attendant who was serving the food was the rude one. She acknowledged that she saw we had pre-ordered something, but couldn’t remember what we had ordered and didn’t want to look, so she asked me to tell her what we wanted. I was happy to do this, but it seems to defeat the purpose of a pre-order if the flight attendant isn’t actually checking to see who ordered what and making sure to hold those items for those passengers. We tried the Zoe’s Kitchen hummus and wrap (which was actually quite fresh and good), as well as a more basic turkey sandwich that came with a chocolate chip cookie. The turkey sandwich was a lot more basic and not nearly as good as the hummus wrap. Both options served as a decent lunch, though, and were generally worth the cost.The flight itself was otherwise uneventful. We ended up arriving at PHL about 90 minutes late, having made up some of the delay. A lot of the other people sitting around us were panicked about trying to make it onto connecting flights, since the flights they were connecting onto were going to be the last ones of the night. After we had already landed, one of the flight attendants did make a half-hearted announcement asking those whose final destination is PHL to stay seated so that passengers with connections could get off first, which I am always happy to do. However, it felt like the announcement was made much too late, and it was given without any real direction. I’ve found that announcements like this only seem to work when done earlier in the flight and coupled with more detailed information, such as the specific rows that have tight connections or a list of specific destinations that have tight connections and need to get off first. Another option is not to turn off the seatbelt sign immediately when reaching the gate, and specifically telling those with tight connections to get up first before turning off the seatbelt sign for everyone else. Either way, they didn’t do a good job of letting connecting passengers de-plane first.AA staff members were waiting for our flight after we got off and were walking toward Immigration. They were asking each passenger which connecting flight they were on, and if it was not possible to make the connection, they already had boarding passes for a flight the next day and a voucher for a hotel room ready to go. Although we weren’t connecting, it appeared that pretty good service was being provided for those who had to spend the night at PHL. Immigration was very quick, since we were one of the last international flights to arrive that night. However, checked bags took a very long time to show up at the carousel, which led to further frustration from connecting passengers in particular, who saw their chances of making their next flight vanish. I just don’t understand how American was not fully prepared for this flight with baggage handlers ready to go, when they knew we were coming in late and knew that there were people with tight connections. The lack of proper acknowledgement of and preparation for the delay (other than having the new boarding passes and hotel vouchers waiting) was crazy to me. Overall, this flight wasn’t great. The 757 aircraft was very old and needed to be retired ages ago, and the service was inconsistent. Not only did the airline and its staff fail to really acknowledge or apologize for the delay, but the one flight attendant in particular was very rude and unprofessional for no reason. We continue to be frustrated by large inconsistencies in the experience from one AA flight to another."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Good flight to start our Caribbean vacation,"American Airlines Flight 2312PHL-SXM9:25 am-2:36 pmBoeing 757-200Our recent flight from Philadelphia to St. Maarten on American Airlines was generally good, with an early arrival and good service from the flight attendants. The only negative was the old Boeing 757-200 aircraft, which was very dated and not the most comfortable.Our flight experience started out a little rocky at the check-in counters at PHL. We don’t typically fly to the Caribbean, so I assumed that the free checked bag benefit from having the AA credit card would apply to this flight. When we tried to check-in at one of the kiosks, it was charging us $30 per bag, so I went over to the ticket counter to inquire about this. The agent was incredibly rude when I asked about the bag fees. Rather than simply explaining that the credit card free check bag benefit only applies to domestic flights, she acted like I was a total idiot in thinking it would also apply to a flight to St. Maarten which, although technically international, largely feels like a domestic flight. We paid the bag fees and were then off to a much better experience on the flight itself.Boarding began right on time, but was relatively disorganized because of the way the gate was set up. Lines built up toward the gate in multiple directions, so while we were in Group 5, we were unable to board with our group because we were stuck in a line that wasn’t moving. While waiting to board, we noticed that this flight attracted a very rowdy group of leisure travelers, many of whom were already drunk while waiting to get on the plane before 9:00 am, even bringing open drinks with them from the airport bar. Since we were also on a leisure trip, I didn’t mind too much, but I’m not used to such a boisterous boarding process. Once we were on the plane, it was also a very excited and talkative atmosphere, with everyone being much more friendly and outgoing than usual, comparing vacation plans and looking forward to the nice weather. It was a festive flight.We had paid to upgrade to Main Cabin Extra (MCE) seats with extra legroom, and the legroom was definitely sufficient. However, as we’ve found on this aircraft before, the seats were very short and uncomfortable. I’m 5’9” and my head was sticking well above the top of the headrest, which wasn’t very comfortable, and it made it feel like the seat was miniature in size. The old 757s also really show their age in the bathrooms, which look absolutely ancient even when they’re somewhat clean.In-flight entertainment consisted of the standard set of movies and tv shows that you could stream through aa.com on your own device, and old monitors hanging in the cabin every few rows showed Frozen 2 and then a bunch of sitcom episodes throughout the flight. The seats also had power outlets between them, which I didn’t even try to use since I find that they often don’t work.The flight attendants were very nice, and we actually ended up with three separate drink services. They started serving drinks soon after takeoff, and had to stop due to turbulence after only having served only a couple rows, which included ours. When they came back to complete drink service later, they ended up starting back at the front of the cabin and repeating our row, and there was even another full drink service after that. We were definitely given plenty of beverages for a 4-hour flight, and I appreciated that the flight attendants encouraged all of us in MCE to take advantage of the free alcohol that comes with MCE seats, a benefit that is often not mentioned or encouraged by the crew. The plane wasn’t overly well stocked with alcohol, however. As an example, they ran out of sparkling wine at our row, the 3rd row of Economy.For food, a choice of Biscoff cookies or pretzels was offered, along with breakfast foods for purchase. Prior to the flight, I had pre-ordered the simple yogurt with berries and granola. The flight attendant who was handling the food purchases did note that I had pre-ordered the yogurt and was saving it for me. The food was fine, although expensive, at almost $10 for a basic small container of Greek yogurt with a handful of berries and granola to put in it. I was entitled to 25% off of this food purchase by using my AA Citi credit card to pay for it.The flight itself was generally uneventful otherwise. It was a little bit turbulent at the beginning, but the captain left the seatbelt sign on for almost the entire rest of the flight when it wasn’t actually needed, which I always find annoying. Although I didn’t pay for wifi on the flight, I was able to use it to keep tabs on our flight status on aa.com, since we also didn’t really get any updates from the flight deck. I was very happy that we ended up arriving in St. Maarten almost 30 minutes early on a beautiful day. It took the ground staff a little while to get the stairs hooked up to the aircraft for us to walk off of the plane onto the tarmac, and the buses they had to take us from the aircraft to the terminal (which was so close that it seemed stupid to have to take a bus) took a little while to load. However, after all of that, we were still nice and early, so it was a good flight to kick off our trip to the Caribbean!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Really like AA but any flight over 2 hours should really be on planes with personal screens,"I really prefer AA for all my domestic travels over all other airlines I've experienced (so far).  The only (occasional) disappointment and discomfort I experience is when I have to develop a crick in my neck and/or arm(s) from holding my phone / tab to view the (excellent) TV/movie content over the course of a 3:45 hour flight on the way back from where I took a 4:15 hour flight over that was on a plane with personal touchscreens at each seat.  I also really appreciate the power outlets made available on planes with no personal screens, but I have to channel my yoga guru to be able to access any such outlet (without leaning all over my neighbor(s))."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very Impressed,"I flew American for the first time the other day, from Denver to Heathrow with a connection at DFW.I had booked a return Basic Economy fare with BA so was expecting to have to pay extra to take a checked bag as I had done on the outbound (operated by BA), however American allowed me to check 2 bags free with my Oneworld sapphire status even on a basic economy fare.The lounges at DEN and DFW were pleasant with a full bar available, though unfortunately very limited food options due to coronavirus.The DEN-DFW leg was on a modern A321, with spacious seats, good leg room in main cabin extra seats, great IFE and a full bar service and cookies.Connecting at DFW was so easy- I even had time to go outside the terminal for a cigarette, and was back through security and  on the sky train within 10 minutes of getting off the inbound flight!At the gate I was upgraded to Premium Economy for my flight to LHR, which I was very grateful for as the economy cabin was completely full. The seat was very spacious, with great legroom and good recline. So good I even manged a couple of hours sleep which I usually can't! The meal service was very good and well presented. There was a great range of films and TV on the large IFE screen.We landed well ahead of schedule, and I'd made it through passport control and  collected my baggage long before we were scheduled to arrive.Based on this experience I'll be using AA alot more in future instead of sticking to BA as I always have done!"

Date of travel: March 2020,50,We Will Survive,"It was just an ordinary flight until the entire flight crew burst into the cabin with very sudsy hands, dancing, sudsing, and belting out Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” at the top of their lungs.Soon we were all up, singing, dancing, and spritzing one another with hand sanitizer. It was a blast!  We lost our fear; maybe we lost our minds.  But for a minute, we were all family."

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Treated like 1st Class,"My wife & I decided to go to Spain early in the covid19 outbreak. We knew we were taking a chance but we've never been to Europe so it was going to take more than a little ""flu bug"" to stop my wife from going. Of course we ended up having to cut our trip a week short and got out just before the lockdown there. We booked a 9hr flight to Miami for a Sunday morning. Everyone was super excited to be going home and we were all sharing our journeys. My wife thanked our flight attendant, Jan from Georgia, for being there under these circumstances. After that she was like our best friend. She probably would have put us in 1st class if there was room but didn't matter. The other attendants were just as pleasant especially Danielle. It was the shortest 9hr flight EVER!The 2nd leg to Seattle wasn't quite the same but good, cordial service but nothing extrodinary."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Scam airline companies,United and american airlines. Sure do go hand and hand while they take from people for their greedy airlines. Had an event In july. With all this craziness of this virus plans have changed. This airline will not refund money or give a credit. I hope they go out of business. To keep someone 500.00 is wrong! Give me my money back. Quit scamming people if they are no longer able to take the trip! You guys are grimy. United and american are the worst 2 airlines ever
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Comfortable,Regional flight so we were in a distant terminal—changed to a different gate pretty far away from the original. Long walk. Changed to a different plane so my chosen seat was changed—but still ok. Boarding was easy. Fewer passengers I expect due to the corona virus. The real gems were our staff ??Sharona and ??Jarvis—-I know I’ve butchered those names but they were SO PLEASANT. BIG SMILES. I’ve been on regional jets to small airports where the staff look utterly bored. These guys were radiant and made the trip. Thank you!! I didn’t need a thing but you two were fabulous!The other thing—I had to change my travel dates due to the virus restrictions. It was cheaper for me to fly AA with a new ticket than Changing my United ticket— even with a change waiver. Significantly.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,On-time & just fine!,"This series of flights were ""uneventual"" which is exactly how I like them.

Date of travel: March 2020,30,Fight for more space,My trip to West Palm Beach in an older model of the 737 was to say the lease was a feeling of a sardine. The flight was full and the seats were so close that I could not streatch out my legs without putting them in the aisle. For a man of only 5 feet 10 inches that is saying a great deal. However the return flight was much better. There were only 26 people on this flight and I was able to change to first class.

In hate flying, so I am not goin to give ANY airline a 5 star - but all in all good experience"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Perfect trip - from check-in to destination,"Courteous and friendly people, very helpful too. All went well at every step. I only have one observation. At departure at DFW, 6 people boarded the plane in wheelchairs (rightly so, for early boarding). Yet, upon arrival in CA, only 2 needed wheelchairs. On-flight healing? That's a 67% healing rate, which is phenomenal. Have seen this with other flights, mainly at DFW (but that is my point of departure). Maybe airlines should have all who board on WC to deplane on WC, as clearly this is a scam by some to board early"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Uneventful -- as it should be,This was an uneventful flight from Phoenix to Milwaukee.  That is as it should be.  No issues. The  usual tiny bag of pretzels and soft drinks but we didn't take the trip for the cuisine.

This flight was the worst, as far as customer service, I have ever experienced.   The flight attendant was rude and short.  While serving beverages, she would not serve anything with sugar.  I had asked for a juice, Dr. Pepper and she finally gave me an unsweet iced tea.  I contacted American Airlines to update them about my service on this long flight.  All I got was ""ok""."

Date of travel: March 2020,10,"""Caring For You Is Our Priority""???","I agree with reviewer Rose B...I took a flight home from DC to LAX this morning due to the Covid-19 risk.  There were several seats open in the front of economy as well as the vacant exit rows.  Meanwhile everyone on the plane was crowded close together.  A few of us asked a flight attendant if we all could spread out to limit unnecessary contact.  Seemed like a wise thing to do based the extenuating circumstances of the coronavirus, right?  The young flight attendant said OK so a few of began to move around.  I took an empty exit row behind me.  Suddenly a senior flight attendant (older male)  walked quickly up to me, demanding ""return to your original seat immediately"".  I began to explain that I was given permission to spread out, only to be interrupted at his even louder, ""People pay for the privilege to sit in these seats"".  Surprised at his nasty, impatient tone,  I slowly replied, ""I understand that.  However we are simply trying to spread out.""  He refused to let anyone sit in seats that cost a few dollars more because we didn't ""pay for the privilege to sit in them"".  So, like other reviewers mentioned, we too flew home crammed together.  How exactly is this helping the situation??    I suggest AA get it's act together quickly during this crisis and stand by it's claim that it's passengers' safety and well being are always it's top priorities."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"No problems, great, comfortable flight","We were on vacation when we saw the problem with the spread of coronavirus. We were going to fly home earlier, but decided to wait. We had a rental car to return. That went smoothly. Took the shuttle to the airport. It was a tight crowd, but everyone was upbeat and discussing the virus. When we got to the airport it was busy, but we were all following the instructions  and it went so smooth. Our first time with American and we were impressed. There attendants are exceptional. Had a good flight."

It was a ghost plane - there were only a   handful of passengers due to the COVID-19 virus.  Service was fine and flight was smooth. There was no in flight entertainment as the flight was only 2 hours long.  Seats are more comfortable than United.I know American is at the bottom of the ratings, but we have had no problems with the Airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Maui to Dallas was a shorter flight than I expected.,"We flew from LAX to Oahu for our first leg on American.  The best feature was that we were able to upgrade in economy and get a seat with more leg room.  This feature was not well advertized but was easy to do on the website for your flight.  It does cost extra and we payed about $90 each for the flight over and $73 on the flight back.  It was well worth the money.  I am tall and the regular seats on AA are TINY.  If you can't afford first class or business, this is the upgrade you need.  The Maui to Dallas flight was very smooth and got us to Dallas in 5 1/2 hours. I have no complaints with American Airlines."

BUT, don't advertise free baggage and drinks for premium economy on your website when it isn't true. AND, stop scheduling 5:30 am flights we have to get up at 2 am to catch! I won't say anything about small, hard, uncomfortable seats, trashy restrooms and headrest screens that don't work, since you're not alone in these deficiencies. I remember when flying was pleasant and enjoyable.  Going for great?  Give me a break!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Price of Seat More Important to AIrline than Covid 19 Risk,"Almost all of the passengers on this plane were economy seats and as a result we were all congregated in close proximity in the rear of the plane.  When passengers asked if they could spread out the response from the flight attendant was ""only to seats of the same price"".At a time when the entire country is encouraged to limit contact and practice social distancing, it is absolutely wrong for American to prevent us from spreading into empty rows, because we had not paid for them.  In other words, we had to pay more to reduce the risk of infection?  The plane was empty.  Take a look."

From Omaha to O'Hare the breezed past with a bottle of water and cups barely letting people know that it was available, and all that was offered was water. The flight from O'Hare to Puerto Vallarta t I was actually told I could not use the bathroom even though the seat belt sign was off and others were using it. Again the offered drinks more than water this time, and breezed through collecting trash but did not were moving so fast that unless you were constantly looking at them you did not know until they were past you. The plane was old with broken trays and uncomfortable seats. For as much as I paid for flights booked 6 months ago. I believe I will try a different airline next time even though I have only ever flown American in the past. The flight back was not much better but the first flight was at least on a newer plane."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,The worst customer service in airline companies.,"If you talk to their customer representatives about any situation you may have, they'll keep repeating ""I understand"" while showing no flexibility or doing any effort whatsoever to help you out.

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Comfortable seats and good legroom,"I flew from Wilmington,NC and purchased first class for my trip. The seat was comfortable and I had plenty of leg room. At one point near the end of the flight the attendant thanked each of us personally for selecting this airline. It was a nice touch. Previous to this I flew on the same airline and same flight but in economy. I was so cold despite having a jacket. I asked an attendant for a blanket and she replied they had none. This time, I paid for the class that I knew would give me use of a blanket. It wasn’t cheap but I was comfortable. I would recommend trying American Airlines. “Scrimp” on some other area of travel and treat yourself to this class of flying."

The air attendants would make side comments to other customers saying “flyers like that are their pet peeves”. Air attendants were not helpful, shouting that customers must put their hand carries on the upper storage even when you could blatantly see that they couldnt reach it, also adding that somebody has to close it and it wouldnt be them. You’d ask a question regarding meals and the air attendants would reply back rudely and sarcastically.. honestly just use another airline..."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Crew was excellent, cabin was packed","The American Airline flight crew was very nice, professional and alert to our needs. It seemed fewer than 5 seats were not used on both planes. One plane was on time, the second was significantly late. This was a pre-COVID-19 flight. So, thankfully there were no long lines, except at US Customs upon arrival. We were in line for almost two hours. (If you can, travel in pairs.) It seems that a few planes, arriving at the same time (mid-day) swamped Customs' operation. The customs agents worked hard and methodically. Travel was OK, but grueling."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Decent nonstop Premium Economy to and from Buenos Aires international,"I always avoid the hassles and possibilities for more things to go wrong by not choosing connecting flights. Making connections is stressful and just not worth any money saved over taking a nonstop flight.  I’m very lucky that I could go round trip to Buenos Aires and have American Airlines flight 996 nonstop available. This is another reason I don’t mind living in DFW area.Unfortunately the bean counters at all airlines continue to make sitting in regular economy very uncomfortable even for a man like me who is only 5’9” tall and 165 pounds. I have flown as a passenger since I was a baby. I notice how space in economy has become extremely uncomfortable for all. To add insult to injury Airlines are nickel-and-diming us for checking bags when flying economy. They use lowered entry prices to get you in and then start tacking on additional fees for whatever they feel like charging to get back to the profit margin they need even for the lowest basic economy fare.As I get older, with all the above facts; I now either use my airline miles or pay extra to go premium economy or business class whenever possible. Selecting to flights with wide body jets helps a lot too just from the sense of additional space overhead. Yes, airline marketing strategies have gotten to me by beating me into submission.I paid about $2000 for my round-trip, premium economy airfare on American Airlines flight number 996 in a 777-200 aircraft, nonstop, from DFW to BUE flying late February through March 2020.Doing so gave me priority boarding status group 4. It also allowed me one free check-on bag. The best part is that premium economy on American Airlines  777 aircraft provides a much larger, wider, reclining seat. You also get a little perks like the pillow, blanket, eye mask, ear plugs, toothpaste, toothbrush, and headphones. The best perk is that the alcoholic drinks are included. All of the above is especially important when you fly inside an aircraft for just over 10 hours. I cannot compromise on more decent, basic comforts we’re flying this long. So in summary I am forced to upgrade from basic economy to reach What I must have as a basic comfort level.I choose American Airlines because I really don’t have that many alternatives even being in a hub like DFW. If I could find a suitable alternative I’ll take it because paying this much money for a flight to me means I should receive service from cabin attendants  who enjoy their job and don’t mind caring for me rather than just being done with me.American Airlines usually does a fair job of getting me onboard and on time, efficiently serving (albeit not always warm and friendly), and doing their overall job."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great flight,During the month of February I recently took a trip to California from Philadelphia.  The flight attendants were very sociable and attentive.  Would fly American Airlines again.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Terrible experience,We had a terrible experience with American Airlines.   It took us approximately 30 minutes at the kiosk to print our luggage tags and boarding passes.  Needed help 3 times because machine kept shutting down and said we need to call for assistance.   Finding someone was difficult.  We finally get thru line.  Then once on plane our seats were way in the back.  They started beverage service from front.  One girl serving the whole plane while other stewardess stood around.  It was a 2 1/2 hour flight.  I finally got a cup of coffee when pilot announced they were coming around for garbage because we had 20 minutes to land.  It was terrible.  We usually fly Southwest or JetBlue which are wonderful.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Plane ride home,The was a man in 27D who was coughing incessantly and not one flight attendant told him to cover his mouth or at least cough into a bag.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,USB ports failed just after take off,"The flight itself wasn't bad, but the USB power ports and power plugs on our row all became inoperative almost immediately after take off.  This made the use of any personal electronics very difficult."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,The best AA flight in over two years,"The FC FAs were on their game.  For the first time in over two years, I boarded and the FC FAs were not staring at their phones and were truly focused on the passengers as we boarded.  I gave one of them the ""In recognition of outstanding service"" coupons to show my appreciation for being treated as a valuable customer."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First class service,American Airlines First Class service from Phoenix to Honolulu was exceptional and a great way to begin a long business trip.Excellent service and accommodations.

Date of travel: February 2020,30,Timely,"We were flying to Texas for a wedding.  We knew far enough in advance to secure a flight ahead of time.  We were fortunate enough to secure a one way flight too and from.  The flight went extremely well. It was not around 10:30 in the morning which was nice.  When we set up our retrun flight we did not have assigned seats and it was pretty certain that we would be seated apart from one another.  We are both adults and can certainly handle this fact however I do not like it and I refuse to pay for any other seat location within the economy.  This is just one more way for the airlines to make money.  what is annoying is that my wife is then forced to have to grab the overhead suitcase without my being there to do it instead.  Other than that the flight was normal and snacks were offered.  On a side note, when we were waiting at DFW to fly home, the gate number changed at least 4 times.  It was all within range of one another but with out notifications or email, you could miss it."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,No Problem Flight,"We flew through Denver, Co going and coming and didn't have one issue on either flight.  The staff was nice and the airline was clean.  If I had any complaint it would be we didn't get snacks on each leg of our flight...that would have been nice."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Love is in the air,"In the past four months I’ve flown with American Airlines three times from Kansas City to Charlotte (round trip) and every time I have been very impressed! We have always arrived on time or early, the flight is comfortable and the attendants are very friendly and helpful. I saw a graph recently that American Airlines lands at the bottom of airline rankings and I seriously have no idea why. Every trip I’ve been on has been fantastic (and the last two have happened during the whole coronavirus scare). I highly recommend flying with American Airlines!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Outraged,"Due to the corona virus, my daughter had to cancel her senior spring break to New York City. As heartbroken as my wife, my daughter and mother-in-law are, I called American Airlines. It took us 4 days with no response to see about a refund and in our last hours before our plane was supposed to depart, we finally received a phone call about what we can do to get our money back. They were very stringent in the way that under no circumstance, ONLY the three passengers that were originally bought for can use them and it must be by December 2020 even if we can not contain the virus. I am absolutely disgusted with Americans lack of sympathy and lack of flexibility with this national pandemic. So sad that an airline will not be willing to corporate and even return our phone calls to help us... and that return call be of extremely little help."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Flight attendant Robert was a rude and insulting person,"Worst trip I've ever had on aa and i use them all the time normally for my business trips, but i think it's time to find a new airline"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Flight attendant was very rude,"Robert, the flight attendant on my trip was very rude. He was mean and insulting to me and I fly aa three four times a month for business and have never been treated so badly. From the moment i stepped aboard he was insulting me and cursing me. I used to love aa for their friendly service but because of Robert I'm starting to think i need a new airline for my business travels"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Good flight,The flight was uneventful which is the best kind.  Arrived in plenty of time to make our connections with no running.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,AA flights to Kona Feb 11th 2020,"Three of us traveled from Tucson thru Phoenix to Kona via AA on Feb 11th.  We shuttled to Phoenix on a smaller commuter plane, but then were lucky enough to fly on an Airbus 321 across the Pacific!  It was the most comfortable seat ever on a flight to Hawaii!  I was in the middle seat between the window & aisle and did notice my left arm was slightly cool, compared to right arm.  My friend, sitting on aisle, had pants on, several layers, including a hood, and she also needed all 3 of the blankets provided to us.  Don’t quite understand why it had to be that cool!  But seats were comfy & had plenty of plug-in’s for electronic devises.  And, the age old question, why don’t they load planes from the back to the front?  We were seated about midway thru plane, yet were placed in Group 8 to board!!!!  I understand that since our tickets were not as expensive as others, hence our placement so far back in loading, but that’s just silly!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Horrible,"I haven’t flown this airlines in years and I won’t in the future either. The plane was small and seemed old. The stewardess wasn’t that friendly. When they spoke on the loud speaker it sounded like he had it in his mouth , as you couldn’t understand a word! I can’t imagine if it was an emergency!! No one would know what directions were given!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Boston to Costa Rica via Miami,"Using my frequent flyer miles for a trip to Costa Rica via Miami. Flight was fine to Miami with a vacant seat in the middle, comfortable. Had to paid $30 for checked luggage - stupid.Four hour layout over in Miami (good idea in Miami), walked to the next terminal E for our flight to San Jose. This flight was packed but we still arrived early. Bought Purell to fight this coronavirus. All in all a good journey.   Return flight to Miami was ok too, however Miami airport is a hot mess trying to make a 60 minute connection. Avoid if you can. High winds in Boston delayed us but happy to be back. No evidence of virus checking???"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Flight to Phoenix  & Puerto Vallarta,"Haven't flown AA in years. The attendants were most helpful upon check in at LAS, changed our seats to accommodate person with a disability. Had a wheelchair waiting for us at both Phoenix & Puerto VallartaReturning from Puerto Vallarta wasn't as pleasant. The seat belts did not fit and we were in the very last row---34. Couldn't get moved up."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"AA flight from Tampa, FL to Providenciales, Turks and Caicos","Flights were on time, service good, personnel professional and friendly.  The legs of the trip were fairly short, so the light snacks provided were adequate."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Pittsburgh to Dallas roundtrip - early or on time, friendly attendants","Smooth boarding. Early on the way to Dallas, on-time on the way back, Very friendly attendants. Typically crowded seating. Generally pleasant flights. Baggage claim a bit slow but that is normal for AA in Pittsburgh."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Another disappointment,"I shared my disappointment about our trip on American Airlines to Aruba earlier, but our return trip was very good…until the end.  Had excellent service from Aruba to Charlotte, the flight attendant, Leslie, was extremely helpful and provided a pleasant experience.  When we landed in Charlotte we had a four-hour layover before our next flight, however, we noticed that there was an earlier flight departing in two hours, thus saving us two hours of waiting.  We inquired with AA customer service desk knowing that we had full price tickets and thought we might be able to switch flights.  The Charlotte CSR was quite friendly and said she would try to switch our luggage to the earlier flight, noting that we could NOT fly without our checked luggage.  After several key strokes on her computer, we were told we were out of luck.  Hopefully, she really did try!  We were fine, no complaints, knowing that it’s a TSA rule about the luggage and we had planned to hunker down for the long delay anyways.However, the real disappointment occurred when we reached Richmond.  First, we waited 45 minutes at Midnight for our luggage to start arriving on the carousel, which made no sense whatsoever; since we were the only plane at the time (Miami arrived later).  We quickly secured one bag, but my spouse's bag had not arrived.  We spent another 10 minutes waiting and were directed to another carousel where more bags arrived, but not ours.  My spouse went into the AA office to report the missing bag and low and behold, there was his bag!  It had flown solo on the earlier flight we tried to get on.  So, AA will let the luggage fly w/o the passenger, but not the passenger w/o the luggage.  Really?"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Lima Peru ticketing and boarding,"Everytime we depart Lima Peru American Airlines had the most rudest and non friendly personnel. They act like they are doing you a favor checking you in, ITS YOUR JOB!!!  No eye contact, God forgive if you ask to be seated in a different spot, the eye rolling begins. Same at the boarding process the women act militant no smiles non friendly personnel. Defenatly not the way you want to board a plane on 6 hr. flight"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Chaos at the Amer Airline passenger gate,"Ice storm so bad in Kansas City that all flights were grounded. My comment is about the total chaos at the American Airlines passenger gate.  At about 7:30am, we boarded the plane, but then were told we had to get off the plane. We waited in the passenger area for the American Airlines staff to tell us what was happening. About 9:30, the women at the passenger gate told us to retrieve our luggage from baggage claim because the flight was cancelled. While I stayed with our carry-on luggage and called American Airlines to reschedule our flight from Kansas City to Dallas Ft. Worth to book the plane to Maui on the next day, my husband went to baggage claim.  The AA representative on the toll-free number said that our flight was NOT cancelled, just delayed. I told her that the women at the gate told us to get our luggage, no flight today. She put me on Hold. My husband returned about 25 minutes later and said that the baggage claim attendants said that no luggage was coming off of our flight; that we should return to the gate and wait for the flight. We returned to the passenger gate for flight 1261 to Dallas and the women told us that no 1261 was leaving that day. I was still talking to the  AA representative on the toll-free number. I asked her if she would tell the women at the gate that no luggage was coming off the plane. But by that time, other passengers returned to tell her she was mistaken. It took another hour before we were told we would be able to depart Kansas City that day. Now I know it was a terrible ice storm. No one is at fault for the delay in flight or the cancelling of flights, but the chaos at the passenger gate was ridiculous. Those women didn't have a clue what was happening. They told the passengers to leave. I know that many did leave out of frustration and not knowing the true circumstances of that flight. The woman on the toll-free number stuck with me. At one time she put me on hold which lasted about 20 minutes, but she returned to assure me that my flight would get out of Kansas City. She helped me get on the plane to Maui for the following day.  American Airlines has fallen greatly in my regard. In the future, I will shop around for a more customer centered airline."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Pheonix flight,Flew from Spokane to Phoenix for a vacation and service was excellent. Direct flight so no layover in Seattle or other airport which was great considering the virus problem being encountered these days. Less chance of crowds.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Is it just us noticing this?!,"Our flight (plane) from DFW was excellent- nicely upgraded seats and technologies along with nice service. But, headed back to DFW was on the otherside of the spectrum - older plane and not so stellar service.   This may be due to Health concerns and the limited options.  However,  the flight to west coast are consistently good on both to/from DFW. Anyone else noticed that as well?  Thanks AA."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,SPEND MORE GET LESS IN FIRST CLASS ON AMERICAN AIRLINES!!  ACT NOW!!,"I spent the money and would have been better off on another airline.  Folks, we live in crazy times with coranavirus in the air.  I paid for the first class seat so I may be a little safer on a packed flight.  What was surprising was the passenger treatment in the first class cabin and the overall quality of the aircraft.  The flight attendants seemed on edge, i suppose we all are. The plane did not seem clean and the 1st Class cabin was very tight (more so that say an exit row on the same plane) .  In the end be aware of what you're paying for.  In this case I payed for 1st class to be treated like a 2nd class citizen."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,American Airlines Mickey Express - on time and friendly!,"We flew basic economy, round trip, Philadelphia/Orlando in January 2020.  We found a great value in booking 2 seats, and used miles for the third seat.   Both flights, American 688 from PHL, and American 1848 to Orlando were on time, flight attendants were friendly.  Basic economy seats require seat assignment either at the airport, or 24 hours before flight time.  On the return flight, we were all in the same row, and two of us were seated together.  No complaints!  And overall, we American accommodating, and often running on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,American Airlines to Belize,This is the first time I have flown American that I can remember.  The people were very kind and the service was great.  I don't know that the seats were the most comfortable I've been on but does anybody have a comfortable economy seat???  No!!!  So they are all the same I concluded.  We enjoyed the flights and the company handled their people well.   I sure  liked American better than United!!
Date of travel: March 2020,40,nice people,the attends were very nice and helpful. the flight to vegas was great however on our way back the seats were a little tight . on a long flight there should be more space !!!!

Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Smooth, clean and on time","Flew from Phoenix Sky Harbor to Kona, Hawaii. Smooth ride, clean plane, friendly staff and most iomportantly ontime."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Worst Service Ever,"For the third time in a row out of three flights, an American Airlines flight has screwed me over with plane repairs or plane delays. Are you kidding me?! How hard is it to make sure that every part of the plane is fine and how difficult is it to have decent customer service?? Two flights were cancelled due to a part being missing, another was cancelled due to the freaking catering cart being ""misplaced"". How difficult is it to have one flight run smoothly? Get your act together American; until then, never flying them again. Three strikes, you're out."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,I wish for a refund,"Literally ran around for an hour . Gates been changed 3 times . Missed my flight and had to stay at the airport for 10 hours . American Airlines is by far the worst I ever flew with . Highly recommend spending an extra 100-200 dollars for a different airlines . No refund , no paid for hotel . Had to sleep on a chair all night without my phone charger"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Dirty planes,785$ Round trip flightThey ought to be giving out sanitizer and disinfect wipes to clean their dirty planes. I would think the airlines would do something to make things more sanitary in a crises like this. Service was friendly and on time however planes are dirty!!
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Great flight!,"There were electrical problems with the incoming plane we were supposed to take and it only took them about 45 mins. to get us on another plane.  There were some whinny babies who complained, but I thought the airlines handled it very well with frequent updates and remaining calm.  I also thought they handled baggage in an efficient manner."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"It was a very good flight, above expectations","The check in was seamless, security was fast. When it was boarding time we had  already check our main bags for free due to our Airlines Advantage member ship. That left us with 2 carry on bags. when we boarded, the gate attendant offered to check both bags to the final destination for free. We accepted, as I am visually impaired wand would have  wheel chair assistance in Dalles  and Lauderdale,  FtL. It worked. The connection time in Dallas was close but we were a little  early  and the connecting gate was about 4 or 5 gates away. We boarded and  we were delayed about 30 minutes due to air condition repairs. Other tan that is was a great trip"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Beware,"While this is certainly a nice place to visit, be advised that (evidently because of damage to the building done by a hurricane in the last couple of years) the airport there is incapable of handling the volume of flights out of there.  As a result, we were very late getting on our flight and into the air; and we,and many others, had essentially no chance of making our connecting flight at the Charlotte airport.  It would seem that the airlines could schedule flights and connections at more realistic intervals because our flight attendants said things like this happen all the time-But who am I to say: I don’t know the business! What to do? Be ready for delays at this island if you don’t want to vacation elsewhere, I guess."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,All other carriers either canceled or flew out..,American Airlines has kept us in limbo delaying again and again over 10 times. When we try to ask about our flight the attendant yells that she’s not worried about our flight right now. They’re inefficient. At one point they say it’s a lack of crew issue then turn around and say it’s mechanical so they don’t have to reimburse! Horrible. Spent over 50k with them and will actively avoid flying them ever again. This happens too often. At least make a timely decision and be polite!
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Flight change,"We booked a flight months in advance for 5 passengers.  We were to fly out of Sacramento California at 12:40 pm.  We arrive 2 hrs early only to find out, we have missed our 6:00 am flight, WHAT?? No, we tell the clerk flight is at 12:40.  Then they tell us your flight was changed and we were notified by e-mail.  No, we did not get the email, as we check again right there.  American airlines charges all of us  $200.00 fee to catch the redeye.  We are upset and pay.  Upon are return, we dispute the charges and request a refund.  After alot of back and forth with ""customer service"" they only offer vouchers, we we dont want.  We ask to speak to manager and ""customer service"" will not part with that information.  We feel this was done by airlines and we should not have to pay.  Still requesting a refund and haven see it yet.  It is not like we are asking them to pay for the one night hotel or car rental we missed out on.  Not a happy customer with this airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Trip to New Zealand,"Having had to change our flight plans unexpectedly we ended up flying with this airline. On boarding we were surprised to see the cabin crew were not wearing any recognisable uniform, looking decidedly unkempt. The attitude of the crew left a lot to be desired and the overall service was unacceptable. I would never fly with this airline again."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Uncaring, disinterested and downright rude!","Following an accident in St Lucia resulting in surgery to a broken ankle, repatriation to UK was arranged by my insurance company.  My 'Fit to Fly' documentation stated that I needed to keep my leg elevated.  A flight was arranged with American Airlines, a row of three seats being booked for me and another across the aisle for my husband.  When taken out by wheelchair to the plane I was met by a huge ramp which would not accommodate my wheelchair.  THe flight had been delayed by 2 hours, passengers had been increasingly agitated in the terminal, fearing missed connections - I was not prepared to be the cause of further delay so I hauled and hopped my way up to the plane, not ideal for a 70 year old.  I then hopped to my row to find our seats were immediately behind the first class screen, leg room seats with fixed arm rests.  I told the senior cabin crew lady I was supposed to move the arm rests to elevate my legs her response - 'they don't move' and off she went,  Had I any breath or energy left I would have asked if anyone would swap for my leg room seats, no good to me at all but I was exhausted,  Instead I suffered 3.5 very uncomfortable hours sitting next to 2 empty leg room seats and a hugely swollen and painful leg.  Thank goodness for the wonderful wheelchair transfer at Miami Airport and on going BA flight to Heathrow.  American Airlines......never again!"

Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth as Glass Trip!!!,"Our trip began with a very positive, customer-oriented staff welcoming us to check-in and continued through picking up our luggage. All of the airline employees along our trip worked to ensure that we had the best experience from check-in to flight to Admiral’s Club to second flight to baggage picking-up.  We finished our trip relaxed and ready to enjoy our family trip to Florida.  Kudos to the entire team..."

Date of travel: February 2020,10,Airlines Are Squeezing Us Like Sardines,"I love to travel but EVERYTIME I fly I'm reminded how much the airlines could care less about us. Why is there so much conflict in the cabins? I'm sure you've seen many many videos out there of bad behavior, people losing their minds. Flying is already stressful, add to that being nickel & dimed for everything, inches taken away to maximize more seats, rude customer service, etc...We need to all collectively say we've had enough."

Date of travel: February 2020,30,Nothing new here,"Loading from the front of the aircraft to the back is pretty silly. The people in the front are still getting settled as the next group tries to make their way to their seats. The beverage service missed our entire row and, while they apologised, they never returned to offer anything.  The customs cards were never distributed on the flight causing unnecessary delays at customs.I hope this flight was an exception rather than the rule for American Airlines"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Take your money elsewhere!,"I will NEVER fly with American Airlines ever again!Chose them for my flight to Cancun February 2020 for my destination wedding. My flight was delayed by 2.5 hours from PDX to DFW where we were supposed to catch our connecting flight to CUN. With the original booking, we only had and hour and a half window from landing in DFW to flying out. Also, where we had a handful of wedding guests meet us in DFW To fly into CUN together. At first they AA didn’t tell us why we were waiting for so long, then the pilot gets on and tells us that something is leaking and won’t stop 😳 At this point we already want to get off the plane, but they never tell us that that is an option. An hour into the wait the pilot says we may have to change planes because the leak isn’t stopping and there’s an empty plane next to us, but he has to wait for permission to let us board. Another 45 minutes, pilot now tells us that we are good to go and the leaking has stopped. Finally, we’re on our way and none of us know what to expect because we’re thinking AA will hold the other plane with so many of us being delayed. AA never once mentions that we should look into booking new flights or advises us if our next flights will be held for us. All they say is to check the app or website for updates. There were 13 people in our party leaving together (there was at least another dozen people who were also going to CUN from PDX as we later found out). So we finally land in DFW, no one there to tell us where to go or helps anyone getting off. Luckily, one of our friends got off the plane first and asked someone where our next flight would be. When we get to the gate, we find out our connecting flight took off 5 minutes before we landed 😒We ran around the airport trying to figure out where to find the next flight leaving to CUN.The airline had terrible communication between each other because they had us running from gate d22 to d24 for about an hour. We had no time to stop and find food or even use the restroom since no one was giving us the right information and we spent the whole time waiting in the wrong lines trying to get onto the next flight out. Finally, there were two seats available, so the groom and I sadly left our party behind in DFW to head to CUN first where the rest of our party was waiting. The people we left had to stay the night and pray for room on the next flight out the following day.Due to the delayed flights, our luggage did not get to us in time. American Airlines did offer to let us purchase items and get reimbursed, but by the time I got to the resort, everything was closed. I didn’t even have an opportunity to purchase anything to get me by.The experience gets worse!!! I had multiple items taken from my luggage. No one else, but one of my bridesmaids experienced this as well. I seriously doubted my packing and second guessed if I packed my things or not. I’m home now and the items that I knew I packed are not home either which means they were taken during transport. Some of the items taken included things I was going to use on my wedding day: brand new perfume, a soap bar (I could still smell that cucumber Dove soap bar in my luggage), Nike slides, Oregon Ducks Jersey, swim suit, hair straightener, and portable charger. After the mayhem, we learned that our guests who were stuck in DFW did get one free hotel stay and $12 food vouchers. Once we all got home, the guests that didn’t make the first night, all requested reimbursements for their lost one-night stay, They were only able to get $175 AA vouchers and no reimbursement for their lost one-night stay at our resort in Cancun. Which was at least $250 a person, so the voucher did not make up for the loss. The bridesmaid who also had items taken from luggage called AA while we were in Mexico to report the stolen items and the representative advised that when we land back in PDX, to go talk to the airline. We did exactly that and the agent gave us lost and found cards to report our missing items, even though our items were not lost by us. We go ahead and do the claim through this method only to find out it’s not the right claim. Luckily, my bridesmaid had a baggage claim phone number and passed it along to me. I finally call a week after hearing nothing back from the lost and found claim only to be told that’s the wrong claim and that I had to contact the airline within 7 days of when I began my travel. I’m livid when the representative tells me that my claim is now too late. Luckily, because the claim was done online, there’s an email and that was enough to make the claim valid. I was lucky and my representative felt sorry for me, so she ended up refunding me for my lost items. My bridesmaid was not so lucky and had a very rude representative who took her time working the claim. My bridesmaid got through to a manager and eventually got things taken care of. Lessons learned: DO NOT FLY WITH AA, don’t check in bags, and avoid connecting flights at all costs."

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Amanda was a Super Attendant!!!!,"My flight from Dallas to Columbus has been great so far!!  I am traveling First Class again and my flight number is 2207.  The flight has been great so far due to Amanda!!!  She greeted all of us as we came on board with a smile and a “Hello”!!  That was nice.  She served us drinks and nuts first and did a great job!!!  She has a super personality and I do believe, she really enjoys her work!!!!  I just talked to her and found out she is sort of the Renaissance Lady….she does several jobs and that was very impressive!!!!  She dabbles in real estate and does some legal work!!!  WOW!!!!!!  I’m sure she is successful in those other endeavors just by watching her work the First Class section!!!  The food was actually great!!!!  I had the beef ribs!!!....Amanda also provided me with an extra gin and the rest of the tonic for a second serving!!!!!  Much appreciated!!!!  Amanda, and her cohorts, are the primary reason I remain an “EP” with American.  My readers know that if I receive sub-par work, I note it….and when I receive exemplary work, I duly note that too!!!!  Amanda is deserving of magnitudes of kudos for her work so far tonight!!!!!  We are on track to arrive early and that is a good thing!!!  I really do like American Airlines to fly and again……people like Amanda, who are such great representatives of this super company, deserve super-kudos from us, the flying public….thanks again Amanda!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Poor attempt and up selling,"This airline will try to sell you seats once you’ve paid your airline ticket so you can sit next to your loved ones when the flight is not sold out. Doesn’t matter if your a family with children, or a couple, they will split you up. When you ring their office it’s a 6 hour wait before they will return your call. If you ring, expect to be on hold for hours. Very disappointing experience, they don’t provide any guarantee you will sit with your loved ones and they do this to everybody from my experience. Sometimes your best just working it yourself with another passenger."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Thanks Audrey!!!!,"My flight from Portland to Dallas was First Class (#1316) has been great so far.  The best part has been Audrey Pennings.  She initially greeted ALL us with a smile and a hello as we boarded.  She has been super-exemplary in her duties so far.  She really seems to love her job!!!..for example, she wrapped all our dinners with plastic wrap, delivered them in a very timely manner and has been back several times to make sure our drinks were filled and to make sure everything was going OK!!!!!  Audrey is one of the BEST attendants I have ever flown with and for my followers, you know I fly every week!!!!!  The rest of her crew seems great too but I have only communicated with Audrey!!!  We started out with some hot, mixed nuts and then the drinks came.  As you all know I have blasted American for years about serving their red wines way too cold…and so I asked Audrey about the temperature.  She assured me the red wine was NOT cold and guess what????  She was correct!!  The red was a drinkable temperature and it was not bad!!!  Our flight is on time, comfortable and that is a good thing!!!  This is one reason I remain an “EP” with American and plan to for a long time!!!  Other attendants ought to take lessons from Audrey on the best way to deal with their exclusive clientele, especially during this Corona Virus time!!!   Thanks Audrey for the great service!!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Disappointed with flight crew,"My flight from Dallas to Portland was First Class (#1460). Several things were different on this flight.  I have been an “EP” for a long time with American and this was one of the only times I felt the First Class attendants were a little rude.  It started off as I was the first one to board the plane and as I approached it a guy (First Class attendant) shouted at me to “STOP”.  I easily did but he did not have to yell so loud.  They were still cleaning the inside of the plane so I waited.  I shifted my weight and he said again to “WAIT”….I was NOT going to load, I had already been given instructions to wait…..just a little obnoxious.  The boarding then went OK until a woman with long hair (Another First Class flight attendant), brought around some drinks for us pre-flight (water or an OJ).  This is how it’s done a lot but this time as she came to me (I was in the aisle seat) she offered and I put up my right hand to get water but she moved the tray toward me as I was raising my hand to get the water.  She yelled pretty loud (people looked at me that were in front of me) and she scolded me and said (I wrote it down after she left) “Just be careful – PLEASE…no drink spilled at all but she said that in a very demeaning way.  It was just as much her fault as it was mine…there was NO spills but she still made a big deal of it…it just embarrassed me that people were staring at me after she yelled.  Most of the time the First Class attendants are nicer and try not to antagonize the travelers.  The rest of the flight was fine.  I am on my way again to being an “EP” again with American but I have heard that Delta flight attendants are super!!!!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Another good flight,My flight from Columbus to Dallas was First Class (#1583). Everything went smooth and the flight arrived a little early.  Good job by our attendant and were given a nice breakfast.  I had the oatmeal and juice and fruit and that started the day off great!!!!  American did great!!!!
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Simple, no issues.",COVID issues: none. Airline cleaned after flight. No problems. One customer with a mask on. Would fly again.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Turbulence well handled,"I have been flying American for years and have had very few complaints...and this flight was no exception.  Starting right from the curbside check in (the guys were so friendly and helpful) to wheelchair assistance (the women who took my friend was absolutely lovely), to the in flight crew (pleasant and friendly).  We experienced some rough turbulence right from takeoff and through much of the trip.  The captain was constantly on the intercom to let us know what was coming...at points he even had the flight crew strap down...despite this, the crew managed to serve our food, continuing to smile and joke.  All in all, it was the em0loyees of American from start to finish that helped me keep smiling."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Disappointed,I'll start by saying that the way you are treated during boarding is unacceptable. Once we boarded the plane there was a passenger that was sneezing and coughing without covering his mouth. Staff never said anything. The crew was very blah! Not at all pleasant. This was my first time flying with AA and not satisfied at all. The planes are out dated and very tight. Reminded me of the movie Soul Plane didn't like it at all.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,When will an airline executive learn how to load the plane efficently?,"For some reason this flight had nine groups to load, the wait was long in that instead of filling the plane from the rear foward we all had to wait for random seats being filled and the people placing their overhead luggage."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Clean airline ready for all,This was a long flight and we were of course concerned with the level of cleaning the airline had done.  Everything looked great and clean.  I have not seen it this clean in years. Wonderful job on the very cleaning crew.  Everything was as expected.  We enjoyed our flight.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Felt safe in Lieu of current global concerns,Though flight loads were low ( good for keeping personal space) the airplane was clean and you could smell the disinfectant on the plane which was reassuring that they are doing their part  to keep us safe.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Online agent was awful,"The booking and upgrading process was a giant fiasco bc American Airlines customer service person was horrendous. I had paid for upgrade, secured my seats weeks in advance. I call to advise our tickets didn’t have precheck on them so the woman removed me from check in and lost the upgraded seats I paid for and said there was nothing she could do about the upgraded seats but I would be refunded the money.  My seats were gone and I couldn’t do anything until I got to the airport desk agent.  Absolutely unnecessary stress added bc the agent didn’t know what she was doing over the phone."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Another great flight,"Ease of their website, friendly, efficient, food was delicious, service top notch. On time, baggage priority, comfortable seats. Highly recommend."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Great trip, can't wait to return","Great flight, really nice people, everything was either on time or early a little. Bags were checked and picked up very easy, no issues, smooth flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Aa flight Mia/stt,Check in was easy; representative was friendly & efficient. Flight departure was on time & we arrived about 15 minutes early. Pilot kept us informed and the flight crew were pleasant
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Have an awfull flight (thats what you should say!),"I'm writing this down while I'm really pissed off and watching american airlines beautiful propaganda before the plane takes off. Let's start by saying our great experience traveling with you guys on our honeymoon. On our way to aruba parting from miami we had an awfull connection, our plane didn't have a gate to park so it delayed about 30 minutes, we had to do all the procedures such as, get all our bags (yes, we had to drop off the bags, in a hurry, obviously), had to pass through imigration interview and x ray. We were worried, so every airport employee we met on our way, we informed about our connection and certified if there was no way of rushing our pass. All of them told us not to worry, the flight atendents were aware of our delay.Not to mention the distance of our new gate, we had to run, no providence was taken from the company, no one to help us, NOTHING. Even better, once we got there, we had to hear from one of the check in attendents a pissed off speach as if we were late for any personal reasons (not the case).We were in a good mood, going to our honeymoon trip, so we let it go, things happens, right?BUT there are limits, and we were not travelling for FREE, opposite of that, we paid a lot. On our way back, it was worse. When tha plane arrived at the gate for our surprise, OH YEAH a waiting line to park the plane  we thought, ""not again"". There was no gate available, so they switched to another gate but yep, we waited for more than 40 minutes, and guess what?? WE paid the price, yes we had to run A LOT from gate D28 (or more) to the gate D3, not to lose the flight, instead of having the support of the company (maybe pick us up with those mini buggie or any other provision), we had to RUN and hear our names being called on the speaker saing they would not wait. Once we got to gate, actually my husband got before, because I was almost fanting from running, and he had to hear from the attendes a scold and the following: ""your wife has five minutes to get here, or else we wont wait"". No shame?  REALLY AMERICAN AIRLINES??  We got on the plane had to go to the bathroom wash our faces, feeling sick, coughing, desperate for water and  watch for the SECOND time, everybody looking at us as if we were selfish for the ""delaying"" the flight.So from what I can see, we had to run on both times, did not have a pleasent experience and in all ocasions had to hear a scold from your employees that in no situation were complacent with the situation YOU caused us.So a special thank you for marking our honeymoon flight in a remarkable and negative way.You think it is over?? OH NO!! We got in our country after hours of flight, tired, and WHERE ARE OUR BAGS? YEP, they stayed in Miami.Who would think that the company would rush and run like idiots like we did not to miss the flight and deliver the luggage? NO THEY WOULD NOT!Got there had to fill the form, wait for your system to work, because apparently it was down, be noticed that we would wait about 2 hours for the luggage to arrive or receive at home (the least you can do) so we went home without our things and had to stay 2 days without our bags.  I PAID YOU GUYS TO HAVE STRESS, TROUBLE, PROBLEMS AND AN AWFULL CUSTOMER SERVICE, SO THANK YOU AMERICAN ARILINES."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Passenger near us coughed for 6-7 hours,Flight # 230. A woman two seats in front of me and across the aisle to the left coughed for the entire flight. The airlines should be screening out passengers who are coughing and/or have a fever. No more flying for me until the Covid-19 pandemic is under control.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Sister,My sister has pancreatic cancer. I live in Las Vegas. She lives in Philadelphia. In 2 1/2 years of chemo and treatments American Airlines associates have been kind and professional. I am happy to report she is doing well and I willContinue fly American. Family is everything.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Terrible experience,"I recently traveled on American Airlines from MCO to CLT. When I entered the airport I asked an american airlines employee if I could take both my stroller and carseat with me to the gate. She weighed my stroller and said that it was too heavy. She took my stroller and carseat and had them checked. I then had to carry my baby through security and to the gate. At baggage claim in charlotte my stroller and carseat were missing. I asked the American Airlines baggage claim employee for help. Upon reviewing my ticket she said that my stroller and carseat were under the wrong name and were sent somewhere else. I was worried and stranded with my baby and asked what I was going to do. She was very rude and interrupted me. She gave me a very dirty old carseat to borrow that I had no idea to install. I asked if someone could help me carry my 2 bags and this heavy carseat since I had no stroller which I had planned to have. She said that no one could help me do that. I had to walk to my rental car carrying a baby, 2 suitcases, and a carseat with base attached completely on my own and figure out how to install this old carseat that I was unfamiliar with. This was a stressful and terrible experience. I was able to get my stroller and carseat back the following day but I am so dissatisfied with the customer service and rudeness of the American Airlines employees."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Uneventful Flight,"Our flights were uneventful, which is always a good thing.  We were on time for all legs, there and back.I didn't know you could check your carry-on for free!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,All Good,"Trying to depart Rome due to the ?????Guess What & had no issues moving our flight back a week. Cust Svc person was very pleasant & accommodating. Flight itself was all good, on time departure, decent inflight meal & drinks. Would fly AA again when/if opportunity becomes available hopefully in near future!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Just horrible!!!,"When I checked my luggage I had 4 wheels. When I received my luggage at my destination I only had 2.I instantly went to Americans website to file a claim when I got in my taxi. The website stated I needed to upload my ID, receipts, pictures etc.In order to upload I had to scan these things. So of course I was unable to do that at that time. When I returned from my trip (I couldn't bring the luggage back) I completed these steps and was told pretty much I was out of luck because I didn't complete form within 24 hours. I'm so upset and disappointed but I definitely learned a lesson. I will NEVER fly American again even if my life depended on it. I wasn't offered miles or anything. Was told to take my luggage to the airport and they would fix it. Well I can't do that, there was no way I could bring that luggage back... Signed, Delta would never they would have done something even if that was offering miles."
Date of travel: May 2019,10,The Worst experience some one could get.,"I had a family emergency and cancelled my ticket from India to US on May 2019. They have not given my money back but gave an option of reusing the unused ticket for 1 yr. This is year i have a plan of going to India in April  Due to Increasing number of Corona cases, i was not comfortable of travelling to India. When i reached Customer Relations they blindly ignored and asking me to take risk of going to India before May. Is American airline responsible if i am infected with the Virus? I will never book a ticket through American Airlines."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very good fkight,Very nice plane with plenty of leg room. Free non alcoholic drinks but you could buy wine if required. Smallish plane but a good flight but a bit of a bumpy landing.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good flight,Good flight with a quick loading. Very clean and staff very good. Free drink on board. New Orleans airport was brand spanking new and really clean.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,CLT to CHA,"For a yet-to-be determined reason I sat in an adjacent boarding area, right next to where I should be, within the same general area but didn't hear the flight announced.  I wondered why I didn't see the flight shown on the board.  Fortunately, they called my name and I was able to board before take-off!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,BDL to CLT,I didn't check in until 9 or 10 hours before and was assigned a middle seat.  It turned out I had no neighbours so I was able to enjoy the window and a whole row to myself.  They are VERY strict about check-on baggage weight.  At boarding they offered to check my carry-on to final destination to be collected at baggage claim.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Trip to Hawaii,Excellent service and attention from the crew. It was a layover from DFW to LAX then to HNL BOEING 787
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"First class attendant was missing in action, I felt like i was in coach begging for more water",I would think being in first class would not be worse than coach when it comes to getting a second glass of water with my meal.  The flight attendant was MIA most of the flight from Dallas to Philadelphia.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,No Complaints,"Boarded on time, arrived on time, claimed baggage...no problems. Great service on board, too! Nice to see the planes being updated."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Night Flight to Auckland From LA,"This was a 13 1/2 hour over night flight that has pretty good selection of movies and offers three meals with complementary drinks.  The flight attendants  were extremely friendly and helpful throughout the flight.  One thing of caution when entering New Zealand, As we were landing the flight crew reminded passengers at least three times not to take any food, fruit or other open food items from the flight into the country.  People can be fined up to $400.00 if caught bringing food into the country."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Executive traveler,Just awful. 2 hour delay because flights backed up.  No excuse just poor planning or something..   flight attendants rude.  Pick another airline. Stay away for AA!
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Flying used to be fun...It no longer is!,"I keep trying to figure out how to get an acceptable level of service from American Airlines.  My biggest gripe is getting two seats together so my wife and I can sit together and chat.  Is that asking too much?  This time the flight was Cincinnati to Chicago, then Chicago to Miami....and of course the arrival and departure gates in Chicago were two time zones apart.  I could go on and on but you get the picture."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Red Eye,"As for every business in America, it is a difficult time.  After the announcement of Covid19, I flew a ""red eye"" home.  I understand that people were somewhat nervous.  So, most people were quiet, respectful -- allowing those resting to enjoy the peace and quiet.  When a pilot needed to visit the facilities and the first class hostess stepped into the cockpit, another young hostess stepped forward the issue began.  She was loud upon arrival in the first class section...she loudly engaged the pilot when he entered the facility and when he exited.  Single-handily she managed to rouse/disturb everyone in the first class section.  I normally rate AA very well, but this was just not acceptable."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Pretty comfortable Premium Economy and worth the extra cost.,MIA-LHR leg in premium economy and was pleasantly surprised by the updated cabin in this class. Was a 2-3-2 configuration on a 777 (I think). Service was great. Great selection of meals and drinks. Casper blanket about the size of a single bed! Great selection of movies and the VOD was seamless. Would fly again.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,American Airlines Standards Drop,"What should have been a 6 hour trip turned into a 15 hour nightmare. First off there needs to be direct flights from Memphis going anywhere! It is ridiculous that everywhere you want to go when flying out of Memphis, TN you have to get a connecting flight.  My husband and I started out adventure leaving Memphis flying to Las Vegas by way of Phoenix. We get to the airport about an hour and a half before our schedulted 7:20am flight. We board the plane everyone gets comfortable, then the pilot says there is a mechanical problem and they are trying to fix it in the next few minutes. Cool! Not a problem. 25 minutes later the pilot says everyone has to get off the plant because they don't know how long it will take to fix the issue. Those passengers with connecting flights (approx. 95%) get in line once we all disembark the plane to re-schedule flights if we can. We sit at the gate for about 2 hours before a CSR says to us, ""I have been doing this job for a long time and I suggest you re-book your flight because this one may not be leaving today!"" Thank goodness my husband called the 800 # to see if he could get us on another flight trying to get to Phoenix. Well that didn't happen, but we were able to get on the 11:20am to Philadelphia which we would have a 7 hour layover.  Now we have been at the Memphis Airport since 5:45am. At this point I was over the whole situation and if it wasn't for the fact that we were going to a friend's wedding, I would have just gone back home and fought with AA for my money back. At least the equipment leaving out of Philadelphia was able to do so on time. The CSR and flight staff were very professional, gracious and apologetic about this whole situation. What I don't understand is WHY did the airport have to wait for a flight to come in from Dallas with the part that was needed to fix the original plane that we were on? This was a newer plane, so why was the part not accessible to the mechanics at that airport? Why was another plane not brought in to be used in this situation. Ever since Usairways decided to purchase American and use the American name the quality of service has gone down, meaning the equipment doesn't seem to be maintained as well as it should. Get it together American. There are other airlines out there that would be more than happy to have more business because you are failing in areas."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Quick business trip,Good flight both legs. Only disappointment is not having the headrest tv’s to keep you entertained. Of course safety is 1st. I will just have to remember to bring a book for my battery on my phone will not last to watch through the WiFi.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent service on our Isla Mujeres vacation,"American Airlines continues to impress me with it professional, friendly staff and the total flight experience in our recent flight in February to Cancun, Mexico, as well as our flight to Scotland and back this past September.  All the airplanes we have flown on have had ample leg room and great amenities.  Staff were top notch both in flight and in the terminals.  One of our group had mobility issue and we had wheel chair service waiting to help us get from point A to point B at every leg of our trip that made it a much more enjoyable vacation journey."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,THe Squeeze Was On,"I will begin by saying all of the flight attendants we came in contact with were cheerful and professional. Being able to watch movies was a plus.  The downside......With the airlines making the seating room smaller, this causes problems for someone that's 6'2   260. I was wearing a brace on my leg so it was a tight fit to begin with. But when the person in front of me reclined their seat, there was NO room for my leg.  I had to keep it in the aisle the entire flight. Every time the steward walked by, I had to move my leg out of the way. I didn't want to tell the person in front of me to please refrain from reclining their seat because it probably would have caused a situation on the flight. Please refrain from having reclining seats. It does more harm than good. I am sure you don't want more bad publicity over a heated argument or possible altercation."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Horrible!!!!,"Worst airline ever. Would never fly with them again. Not only do they only have connecting flights on most of their flights, but they delay and cancel flights more than anyone I’ve flown with, I’ve actually only had that problem with them and I fly very often. I tried to give them more than one chance and they failed"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,First time customer,This was my first experience of flying with American Airlines. I had upgraded to Main Cabin extra seats as the flight was a long one and I was worried about being comfortable. The seats were spacious but not overly comfortable. The entertainment system was a seat-back screen with a lot of new release films and TV shows as well as games and music which was good. The food was fine but there was a long period with nothing at all and the staff were all so surly and unapproachable they made me feel uncomfortable for asking for anything.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nice flight up the atlantic,The flight departed on time and the service was very nice and smooth. We arrive to LGA early and that was the best thing for me to get to my meeting on time.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Quick flight,The flight left on time and the service was quick but nice for this short trip to Charlotte which arrived before the scheduled time.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Flying from Pearson to Mrytle Beach February 2020 with American Airlines,"American Airlines requires a revamp of their services. The flight attendant was not hospitality at all. They treated you like you where a nuisance. The person beside me closed their eyes for a bit to rest. Than the person opened their eyes within 20 minutes after the flight attendant had been around with their cart offering a non alcohol drink. The person asked for a water, the flight attendant said ""you where asleep when I first came around, that window has passed"" . That was one incident I experienced.  There where other not positive experiences with American Airlines during that flight. No custody."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flighty experience,All of the flights were staffed with very friendly and courteous staff.  The planes were clean and updated.  The flight to Miami was equiped with monitors on the seat back which enable the passenger several options to inform and occupy the time during the flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Basic economy not what it used to be...,"I originally went through justfly to purchase my flights to Merida, Mexico from Newark, NJ. I purchased an economy flight which is truly economical. Justfly switched my middle name w/ my last name which caused a huge amount of issues as you can imagine. When I called the day b4 they assured me that it was straightened out but when I arrived at airport it was a completely different story. Thank god I arrived 2 hours early & there wasn’t a huge amt of people waiting bcuz honestly I think they would not have been as helpful as they were. It was straightened out & was able to fly on the VERY basic flight from Newark, NJ to Miami to Merida, Mexico.My flight back from Mexico encountered same issues which were straightened out but barely had enough time to catch my connecting flight from Miami to Newark and I have global entry! My suggestion is to make sure names match up and you have enough time to connect when returning to US. Especially these days..."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love my AA family!,I have been flying AA over 11 years around the US and back and forth to Haiti. It’s been so great getting to know so many amazing staff.

Date of travel: March 2020,20,Squashed seats,"Although the seat comfort/space on our 3 hour flight from Austin to Los Angeles was reasonably comfortable, I could not understand why the seating on a 13 hour international flight (LAX to Aukland, NZ) was so cramped. That was made even worse when the woman ahead of my 6'2"" husband reclined her seat as soon as we took off.  Forget sleeping. Since upgrading to a roomier seat was incredibly expensive, we suffered in silence.The snacks and meals were fine, but the entertainment console was not intuitive and confusing to use."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Main Cabin Seating is Really Tight,"I'm an average sized 5' 4"" woman, sitting in the window seat. On the flight from Dallas to Burbank, there was an average sized woman in the middle seat next to me: we each had to sit perfectly still so that our thighs would not touch. I put my iPad in the seat pocket in front of me, reducing the legroom by an inch or so, and there was not enough room to cross my legs.The wifi was fine; the onboard TV and movies were fine. Main cabin snacks were ok. It just was a very uncomfortable 2 1/2 hour flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Christopher terry,On the way to cancun flight was great flight attendants were also wonderful however on the way back there was one flight attendant in particular that was very rude we were flying business class and got a half of a cup of soda for the amount of money I paid for this I expected more pleased on the way down so far displeased on the way back

Unfortunately this is the preferred provider for my company so I'm stuck flying American every time and they always seem to find a new way to disappoint me."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,over and above service,"American Airlines staff found and returned to me a luggage strap that fell off on the jetway.And....when my first flight was delayed due to a fault in their transportation system, they proactively sent me an email allowing me to re-book the connecting flight (which I didn't need to do)"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,schedule changes,My flight was changed a few days before I was to leave from an early morning to a late afternoon.  Very annoying as It practically took a whole day off of my vacation.  Layovers are always more than 2 hours.  Seats are getting cramped.  Attendants were nice and offered a drink and pretzels.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flight,On Time and ease of boarding and great flight. Staff was clear and helpful when needed. Connecting in Dallas to San Diego and always easy to manage multiple flights
Date of travel: September 2019,40,My Airline of Choice,"Use American because they travel most places I travel and Philadelphia is a major hub for American.  I also get frequent flyer miles with their credit card.  The use of the credit card gives me free luggage and priority boarding. To date, I have not had any major delays on flights.  Food is for purchase on shorter flights.  Food is included in international, but not of great quality.  Beverages are free.  I always upgrade the seating, even though I am not tall, just for comfort.  Am sometimes disappointed with staff as they are not always pleasant, nor helpful.  They need to take some lessons from Southwest!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Average... But got an earlier flight by requesting stand-by,"Flight itself was average. I really wish on short hops they'd stop trying to hand out drinks - it makes for a chaotic flight that only lasts about 30-40 minutes. Flying economy and solo, I didn't choose a seat, but did end up with a window, which was nice. On the return trip, I wasn't able to get a seat number at self check-in, which worried me. Seeing online that there was an earlier flight leaving from the next gate in about 30 minutes (I was about 1 1/2 hours early by that point), I asked if I could get stand-by on that flight. Ended up with one of the last seats on the earlier flight. Otherwise, I may have been bumped from my actual flight, so all worked out well with less waiting time. Also, I had carry-on, but because carry-on was pretty much full, I always opt to have them check it - for free - once I get to the gate."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,First class is overrated,Going there the service was on point. Coming home sucked. The seats were not comfortable at all going and coming from our destination.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Rescheduling a flight,"i was scheduled to fly form Norfolk to Charlotsville and due to inclement weather, the flight was delayed. The people at the tiket counter were very gracious with rescheduling me without any problem and I made it home on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"American, you did great!","From take off to landing, our flight was awesome!  The flight attendants made us comfortable for the long flight, the pilot kept us informed on turbulence and flew above it for the most part.  We arrived 25 minutes early!!  Plane was clean and sanitized!  Food was served due to long flight and was pretty good!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,An enjoyable long flight,"because of the Coranavirus issue, there were fewer passengers so boarding was very quick. Departed a few minutes early and landed nearly 40  earlier than ETA.  The plane looked quite new, though a 777-200 and excellent audio and visual facilities.  The cabin crew were friendly and very efficient even though negotiating the gangway with and without the trolleys was quite challenging. For aircraft food, my choice for lunch was good and there was the added bonus of an ice cream mid-flight.  As is normal, deplaning was slow but over all it was a very pleasant experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,On time and kept informed,"American Airlines was our ""go to"" airline based on the quality of the planes and the expertise of the crew.  We moved out of a major city and were disappointed the AA did not service the areas where we needed to fly from our new location.  We are finding more flights from our local region and are thrilled to be back with AA.  Using the text alert system I am never worried about missing any last minute changes.  My only complaint, baggage fees are annoying.  However with a change in packing practice, they can be avoided."
Date of travel: June 2019,40,Was on time and generally comfortable,"It was a fast, efficient flight.  On time but like all airlines very economical.  Very accommodating for my 6'5"" grandson in allowing him to move to another seat that had more leg room."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Not a""bad"" experience but I've had better. One leg was awful.","Flying from Wilmington to Phoenix starts about a 5.0 hour air time with a 35 minute flight to Charlotte and a plane change. That is disheartening at 6 AM. There is one flight that goes to DFW for that stop and is a better way to go. The return flight, last leg CLT to ILM was on American Eagle operated by PSA and the flight attendant didn't enforce the safety rules for departure and arrival. We had seat backs tilted. loose seat belts and one passenger talking on a cell phone the whole departure. She never even walked through before we landed. I'll avoid PSA in the future if possible."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,American continues to be number one,It is always a pleasure to travel AA. They are doing a great job putting the airplanes on time in the air and providing a great customer service.  Personnel are always trying to keep us customers happy and in red eye flights like the one i took they do the best to allow us to rest while taking care of our basic needs.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Small airplane was surprising OK!,"Had to transfer to a small plane to fly into Stewart Air Base in Newburgh, NY. The ride on American's Regional Airline from Philly was fine. Unfortunately, Stewart has limited flight choices and reminds me, when John Wayne in Orange County, was just a shack - but a desirable airport for business and access to cities a bit far from LAX."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,LAX to Miami,"Going from Melbourne to Miami with Qantas going to the Super Bowl, the flight from Melbourne to LAX First class was fantastic, however going from LAX to Miami was a 5 to almost 6 hour flight was the worst flight I had ever taken, after about an hour I asked for something to eat(yes you have to pay for it)a sandwich which on the menu looked more like a roll, Sorry sir we have no food on board, are you kidding me, maybe I should have check Tripadvisor about this flight. My advise on travelling to the east coast of the USA is fly Qantas Business class to Sydney First class to Dallas then American Airlines business class to your destination."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Lone flight.,Flew to Miami and had a long lay over.  We used points to fly and I think you get the Worse connections when you have points.  Food was ok.  Free wine.  Good choice of movies.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Rude and unprofessional workers.,The first lady we had yelled at my grandmother and was rude (she had a bad attitude). Then the next ladies at the ticket check-in were very unprofessional. They had bad attitudes and they even were whispering about us because the lady was frustrated because we were having trouble. If they are not happy with the job or they don't have the patience for a 60 year old lady them maybe working at a airline is not the best career option.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Comfortable Flight, easy on my wallet","Flew from Charlotte to Philly. Seats were comfortable, nice and cushiony, not like those plastic seats they cram you into on Frontier lol. Plenty of overhead space for carry ons. Compliment drinks and live tv in flight.  It was great and a good deal if you are counting coins like me."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Better than in 2019,"When I flew the Grand Rapid to DCA flight last year, I felt truly abused at all steps along the process.  It seems like American got customer feedback and is trying to meet their competitors.  They have a ways to go, but better."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nice flight and the new economy plus seats are fabulous!,"I have never flown AA before, I am mostly a Delta girl. I must say I was pleasantly surprised on this smaller plane. I was expecting not much leg room at all, even with the economy plus seating, however.. I had tons of room, and I am a 5-9 woman. The drinks were included with the seat upgrade and they were not stingy, I got a whole bloody mary can with my vodka :). It would have been perfect if the guy next to me had not decided that the arm rest and the little bit of room to the side of it was his too (after asking me to switch with him and take his window seat..um, no... there's a reason I choose the aisle. I usually use the restroom and I am tall). So, thank you for poking me in my ribs with your elbow, Mister ""Change-Seats-With-Me"", for most of that flight. Ok, so back to the trip, not the airlines fault... just a rude passenger. The flight attendant was so lovely that I gave her a little gift on my way off the plane. I am taking the same route again in a little over a month and I'm looking forward to it."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Refused Ticket Refund for Cancelled Event due to COVID 19,"My fiance and I had planned to fly from Rochester to Chicago for a conference the weekend of March 28-29. Unfortunately, the conference was cancelled due to concerns regarding the coronavirus. I am aware that basic economy tickets do not allow for refunds, but given the extenuating circumstances, I thought American Airlines would be at least somewhat forgiving. I called and explained my situation, but was told the tickets are not refundable and that I cannot even get a credit to use at another time. I will certainly try and avoid flying with them in the future. Of note, the other airlines with which we booked refunded us immediately."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"On time, no hassles","all was great, low occupancy due to covid-19, baggage and long trek to change terminals in Philadelphia, give yourself lots of time"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Lacking in terms of in-flight entertainment and variety of meal choices,I would say in-flight entertainment was very limited to American movies. There's a reason Emirates and Singapore Airlines are leading. Look at their list of movies! For meals AA could fare better. Rice cookies and pretzels alone for snacks on a long haul flight is boring.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Another uncomfortabe overnight flight,"I was tired after a two-week birding trip to Antarctica, Falkland Islands, Uruguay and Chile.  Being tired doesn't help trying to sleep on a cramped overnight flight.  The pillow and blanket were welcomed and needed.  The food was mediocre, at best.  The limited options did not appeal to me.   Not everyone can tolerate yogurt.Cabin service was okay--not notable."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Overnight flights are hard on folks,"We boarded in Miami after a layover from a connecting St. Louis flight.  The plane was packed--only a couple empty seats (and not next to me).  It helped that I had an aisle seat.  I'm not a big person, but the space allotted per passenger is meager. No matter how tired, it is impossible for most to sleep well--if at all--in the cramped position of a main cabin seat.Knowing a hotel awaited on our bleary eyed 7:10 a.m. arrival was a big comfort. Cabin service was congenial, even though nearly perfunctory."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,On time,"We had good flights on American Airlines.  They were on time, attendants were helpful and courteous.  No problems whatsoever."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Poor experience and service,"Compared to the pleasant service from BA on our outbound leg, the return trip with American Airlines to Heathrow (via Dallas) was not as good. Although the film selection was good, there was an extra charge for spirits on the transatlantic leg.  Also, the cabin crew seemed generally disinterested in the passengers on board. As with BA you pay extra to guarantee seats but we thought it was unfair not to see the computer allocation before deciding whether to pay extra for your own choice of seat. I would not recommend American Airlines based on our experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,We loved our American Airlines Vacations pkg to Universal Orlando!,"Has a wonderful trip to Universal Orlando with my seven grandchildren. Booked trip through American Airlines vacation and bundled the trip. Best deal, and best trip ever!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,GOOD RIDE,Good ride-Flight was delayed 2 hours - kept customers informed. Boarding was smooth and orderly - Flight Attendends did a good job
Date of travel: February 2020,40,On our way to Australia,"This was the domestic portion of our flight to Australia. (Qantas from LA to Melb). The check-in agent was one of the most polite, patient and helpful woman I have ever come across,  (kicking myself for not getting her name) Timely flight, flight attendants efficient, comfortable flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,nice upgrade to !st class because of COVID-19,probably thanks to covid-19 we were upgraded. Business folks are not flying.    we were #10 &#11 for upgrades on way out.    gate agent said no food but we were served a nice fruit cheese tray that even surprised the flight attendent
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Rocky Mountains Vacation,"We flew American Airlines from Myrtle Beach SC to Spokane,Washington. Had to change planes twice but each trip was great. Flight attendants were friendly,helpful and professional. They did everything possible to make our flight comfortable. Would definitely recommend American."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,On-Time,"American is not my preferred airline.  However, I was able to get to my destination on time and without incident.  I have 2 suggestions for American that would make me a more loyal customer:1.  The seats are too close together.   I felt I was sitting in my neighbor's lap and my legs were cramping by the time I reached my destination.      Give  your customers a WOW moment by providing more room at no extra charge.   No there is a selling point!2.  On board snacks are too expensive!   I paid $36 for fruit and cheese.   Seriously?!   If I wasn't really hungry, I wouldn't have done it.   Again, there is opportunity for a WOW experience.   Show your customers you care by charging street prices -- not sky prices!"
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Long trip little comfort,The flights were on time which is good. The airplane was full so it was not a very comfortable flight.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,SLO to Miami,"No delays, smooth flight, luggage made it, manageable layover in Dallas.What's there not to like!  Thanks American!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Satisfying,"Organized, security line was manageable, luggage arrived {surprisingly} quick.  As satisfying as air travel allows these days!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Failed  to reimburse for my delayed luggage,"On Saturday, February 22nd, 2020, my family of four flew directly from Indianapolis to Los Angeles to attend a wedding that evening. We flew with American Airlines. At the gate, the agent asked for volunteers to gate check our carry-ons because of limited overhead space. We volunteered- a big mistake!  When we arrived, our luggage did not arrive with us.  The wedding was six hours away!  We spoke to the agent, who said that our luggage is on route and will be delivered to us the following day. All of our wedding clothes, shoes, accessories including my custom-made shoes were in the suitcase.  We were so stressed that we won’t have anything to wear for the wedding!  The American Airline agent at Los Angeles then filed a claim with Central Baggage Resolution for us.  They agreed to reimburse us for the items that we need to purchase for the wedding with a limit of $3500/person. The agent also told us to mail in the receipts and paperwork right away to get the reimbursement. At this point we had three hours to go shopping for the wedding.  We went to the mall and quickly shopped for the four of us before the wedding. At the same time, I took pictures of all the receipts so I could email them for reimbursement as I was told. It was very stressful, but we tried our best to enjoy our cousin’s wedding that night. The next day, our suitcases were delivered, and I emailed all of my receipts and paperwork for the reimbursement. That day my husband decided to return the shoes that I bought for him because they hurt him.  We decided to return them because the shoes don’t fit right and because we thought that he won’t be reimbursed for them anyways because he had almost reached the limit for reimbursement from his outfit for the wedding.  Two weeks later an agent from the Central Baggage Resolution called me and said that our claims will not be honored because we returned the shoes, which again we thought will not be reimbursed anyways because of the limit.  I asked him to reimburse for the other items. He refused. I asked to speak to his supervisor. He said he had no supervisor.  Really?  I emailed him again to ask for the reimbursement of the other items. No answer.  Is this how American Airlines treat their customers?  Is this how they respond for their very own mistakes?  No reimbursement is enough to take away all the stress that we had to deal with before and after the event!  I expect American Airlines to do better than this!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,lost luggage; worst airline ever,They lost my luggage and lied multiple times. Absolutely the worst major airline! Do not fly with them.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Not if I can help it,"This was a code share flight with BA and not by choice. I have never in my life seen such sloppy stewards. They looked like they had just all escaped from the laundry room not having enough sleep. During the flight I saw some of them during service drop some items on the floor and just kick it under the nearest seat. The quality of the food was absolutely below standard, I think not even my dog would eat it. AA does not give a good name to it's code sharing partners.I tried to upgrade and pay for extra legroom but AA would not accept any South-African credit cards to do the transaction. I even phoned the AA office in South-Africa. Next time I will make sure that the code sharing partner is not AA - if my South-African money is good enough for BA why not for AA."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Doctors appointment,Flight was on time as always it was full do to airlines profit needs who knows what it will be during this world wide crisis
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Snow bird heading home,"I have to say it was an excellent flight, left Miami on time and I landed on time. When I got to the baggage claim my bag was the very first bag to come out. I guess all the other passengers traveling first class carried their own bags, heck no! The only thing still disappointing is the meal on the flight, but I knew exactly what I was getting because you can pre-order it online."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Flight ok but delay getting luggage,"Flight on time, crew very good, food iffy but typical airline food.  Difficulty was when we landed it was raining and there was some lightning so American Airlines would not unload the luggage - other airlines were unloading but not American Airlines.  We had a four hour delay waiting for our luggage which is not good.  In August in Florida it rains quite a lot so they should have had something in place to cover this."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,decent base price but watch for extras,"We recently flew AA from ABQ to PVR. We got a great  fare, less than SW. However, I don't like you have to pay $37 a person to be able to pick a seat and not even get a checked bag. While the overall price was lower than others, I found it annoying with the additional fees.Also, they gave us our custom forms about 5 min before we touched ground in PVR, seemed very unorganized."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Helpful and kind customer service,SOTHIA was very helpful and kind in waiving fees due to Coronavirus so that I could use my ticket at another time. Thank you!
Date of travel: March 2020,30,No Leg Room; No Dinner; No Frills,"The trip was the usual trip.  Check-in was a bit more tedious as we had to go through the kiosk process and then check-in.  This did not ease the process. A warning for folks flying/traveling internally in Panama -- do NOT carry nail clippers or small scissors.  Same for glass bottles or jars.Knees jammed in to the seat in front of me.  A long flight without any service other than pretzels and beverages -- glad I'm on a diet.  Although this was at the beginning of the COVID-19 scare, the rest rooms were wet on the floor and generally messy.Cabin crew were friendly and cheerful."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Added beverage and snack to route LSE-ORD,"WOW, totally unexpected to receive this service and the attendant was so nice.  I wasn't the only one surprised by this service.  Many of us use this route on a regular schedule."
Date of travel: April 2019,40,Very OK,"Worked out great for me. Surprisingly good service, crew gave me advice about the taxis and ride shares, recommended good restaurants.Quality vodka ""Tito's handmade"". Smooth check in and again very customer oriented crew."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,The Best Airline Customer Service I Have Ever Experienced,"My wife and I had a last minute situation arise where  we had an opportunity to help a friend by driving his car from Ft. Myers, FL to Connecticut.  However, I had already booked my return flight from Ft. Myers to Providence, RI.  I contacted AA Customer Service, explained the situation and asked if they would waive the $200/ticket change fee and credit my account for the return trip.  Within two days, they approved my request and provided a very courteous and understanding response, along with detailed instructions about how to claim my credit towards a future flight.  Very appreciative of their consideration."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Comfortable flight,"Our flights to and from Phoenix were terrific. Very comfortable seats, even though we were in economy and friendly, efficient service. Very pleased to have a wheelchair waiting for me in the jetway at each arrival. The packaed snack to buy en route were generous and delicious (cheese plates)."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"The Domestic flights are ok, the International flights are delightful.","Domestically speaking, there is nothing out of the ordinary for me on my flight from SMF to LAX - it's a short distance so the plane is small and the experience is mostly uneventful.Internationally, from LAX to LHR, I quite enjoy the Business and First class experience and being able to sleep flat on a bed is the best on these long flights.  The meals and entertainment are good, the attendants are nice.  Can't wait to use my points!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,American Airlines,"At Christmas time a friend and I took a flight to Philadelphia from Dublin!..I found the check in desk and the assistant  was very helpful with any queries I had...The service on the flight was very good, food was lovely, and plenty of wine if one so desired!..I was really happy with American Airlines and would recommend and fly with them again!.."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Bending over backwards,"People boarding with everything they own.  Not sure but was that a kitchen sink someone was carrying?  What happened to the regulations for carry-ons?Had just taken off, not even leveled out yet, the seatbelt sign still on and people are getting up and walking about the cabin.  No announcement from the crew to remain seated.  Definite safety issue.Crew did a good job with drinks and munchies as well as clleaning cabin prior to landing."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,It's Not The Best But it's Alright,I would say that it's fine and not that fun. You are just looking out a window flying in a metal tube with a lot of people. The food was not as good but at least you can watch movies or just play with your Matchbox cars if any adults is into playing with cars but I guess not.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great flight,"Great service comfortable seats,  food was just ok. Big problem was that the airline says leaving from gate C21, so I got dropped off there, but first class check in was way down by gate 10.  Not fun🤨"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,upgrade,"It was going to be a long flight home and we had just spent the last 3 weeks in a RV. My husband decided to upgrade our economy tickets so we could have larger seats to sleep since it was an 11 hour flight. Best decision he ever made ( next to marrying me, of course ). We had the first two seats and boy were they comfy. As soon as we boarded we were offered beverages and had a nice sized screen to watch movies on. We were offered dinner which was very good and even dessert! The crew was super friendly and the Captain even got us in a few minutes early. Thanks for the great flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very nice flight to Key West,"Our flights out of Providence to Charlotte and then to Key West were on time and the flight crew was courteous and very friendly.  There was a bit of turbulence as we passed storm systems along the southeast coast, but all in all the flights were quite comfortable."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"delay, delays, delays!","the plane from Miami arrived 2 hours late.  therefor, i landed in Miami 2 hours late.  i had a connecting flight to Newark.  i had to go thru immigration, baggage claim, then re-check my bag and get thru security!  My gate was 20 gates away from where i got into the terminal.  i couldn't even stop for a bottle of water!  i was very unhappy!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Trip to Germany,"The flight was excellent.  The service on board was really good and the flight was onetime.  The only issue was with the check-in process where one of the agents was not going to let our grandson onto the flight because his passport was worn.  It still scanned, but she actually removed him from the passenger list without telling anyone.   After making a stink about it, one supervisor did let him get on the flight, but it was such a hassle that did not need to take place."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,We had an excellent trip from LAS to ORD,We had an excellent flight. The flight departed on time and arrived in Chicago 25 minutes early. The bags also arrived very quickly. We were surprised that the flight was full in spite of the Coronavirus fears. The airport seemed empty in Las Vegas and  less busy then usual in Chicago. The flight attendants were charming and efficient.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Great flight, smooth as butter","Our flight from Austin Texas to Los Angeles,California was smooth as butter.  Pilot must have selected a flight path around all the rainy weather with a perfect landing at the end.  Flight departed and arrived on time.Plane had the entertainment center on seat backs, which was nice.  We don’t not like flight on newer planes where you need to provide your device to watch movies"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Not a bad experience,"Things went well on the first leg of our journey except for no coffee but I could live with that as it was a small plane. It was when we had to change planes in Philadelphia day didn’t go very well. A 45 minute layover extended to 4 hrs. Departure time kept changing with no explanation. As we were traveling for business we had places to be but we missed our times. Realizing things do happen still rate the actual flight a 4 due to flight attendant and pilot humor, friendliness and courteousness as well as the ticketing and boarding process."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Better experience,Boarded this flight after a not-so-happy flight on AA1545 from Kingston to Miami. This was a much better experience. Cabin staff were much more professional and attentive. (AA flight attendants are notorious for walking down the aisle without glancing left or right so if you want to get their attention you have to Hollander and flay your hands in the air).Being a longer flight than KGN-Mia they served a hot meal which I found to be quite good. It only shows that AA can offer much better experiences if it only bothered to try.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,AA is what AA is,"The one big advantage of American Airlines is that it flies to almost everywhere. Other than that it is a low-cost airline with a not-so-low-cost ticket price. Hence, I paid a lot extra for business class but that didn't give me access to its Admiral Club lounge to deal with a 5 hour layover.The facility to recharge my devices is cool.Being offered a pack of potato chips or pretzels in business class is not cool. What is also not cool is watching the male flight attendant standing at the top of the aisle waiting to illustrate the safety instructions with his mouth full of food chewing aggressively. Not cool at all!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Was told we would get rental car compensation after a missed connection, not followed through.","We were flying from Jacksonville, FL to Portland, ME. Our departing flight from JAX was delayed and when we asked gate attendants about our connection, they were extremely rude to us and told us that everyone would be making their connections. We did not, our connection left while we were still on the plane in CLT. We went straight to AA customer service when we got off the place in CLT and asked about our options for getting home to PWM. There were no other flights going there that night, so we were told we could either stay the night and fly out the next day or we could fly into Manchester, NH and our car rental from there to PWM would be covered. I asked the agent for her name and if I needed a claim number for the rental coverage and she told me to just go online and file the claim and that I didn't need anything else. After our rental I did just as she instructed me to and after going through four people at customer relations and customer service was told that our car rental would not be covered. Extremely disappointed, we are long time AA credit card holders and flyers. I will not be using AA anymore in the future for my frequent travels. Extremely disappointed and angry as I now have a $350 car rental bill."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great Flight,"Have flown this route a number of times and have never been delayed. On the most recent trip, arrived early both at Boston and on return to CLT. Very pleased."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,stepped up,American really stepped up their first class seating. The flight was perfect and the lie flat seating was much better than the old ones and I cant to wait to fly it again. The only thing I would say is the price is a little high
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Amazing crew,"I travel back and forth to Brazil at least two times a year. Some trips are bearable and some like this most recent flight are a true joy. Being in a seat on a plane for 10 hours is never easy. But when you are treated well with a crew that genuinely seems glad to see you and obviously enjoy what they are doing, it makes the trip a joy. This most recent flight was one of those."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"Would not be my first choice, or my second choice",The plane was tiny! Very cramped and dirty. The overhead bins were not even large enough to accommodate carry on so they valeted the carry on bags. The turbulence was awful for nearly two hours. The pilot did a good job of keeping us informed. The flight attendants tried to push the AA credit card. I attached some photos of the cleanliness. I was not impressed.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,So convenient,"The non-stop flight from LA to Belize City is the most convenient, relaxing flight I’ve taken in years.  Wish it was available year round, not just high season."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Pleasant Flight but Nickeled and Dimed,"Very pleasant flight, professional and efficient crew and of course some turbulence. My beef was having to pay for my seat when I checked in and a $30- fee for check-in luggage.  Flight was on time, and very quiet. Even the pitch between seats was very comfortable, maybe that's why I paid for the seats (don't know it was a last minute flight our cruise was cancelled)."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,An Airline to Avoid When Possible,"Some things don’t improve over time. American Airlines is one of them. Unfriendly service, uncomfortable seating and a  history of late arrivals and departures. Fly only if you have a passion for peanuts and pretzels."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Poor service!,This is the first I have been compelled to write a review for AA. While boarding for Philly to Phoenix I was told my carryon was “too big” and asked to place it in the device to test size. Despite it easily fitting I was told “too big” and it was literally taken from me. Now if it actually was too big or space was an issue I’d be ok with it — but here with are in the midst of coronavirus with 40 open seats and a 737 with overheads big enough to fit a lounge chair in. Totally unacceptable and not following their own policies! See below empty overhead. Get it together AA.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,787 Dreamliner,"Flight was long, but very comfortable. Seats were wider and reclined more than premium economy on say Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Friendly and efficient,"We don’t ask for luxury in basic economy, but we do like efficiency and courtesy, and there was plenty of that on all four legs of our trip. Everyone at the desks or on the plane was polite and helpful. Thank you, AA."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,a group of at about 30 teenagers travelling on the same plane were out of conrol,"A group of 30 teenagers on the plane, making a lot of noise and playing the music so loudly. I asked them gently to turn the volume down, they totally ignored me and played the music even louder and laughing at me, I tried again. Next thing I did I called the flight attendant to pass the message onto them and I had to threaten them by saying that as soon as I arrived at Miami airport I was going to report to the police for antisocial behaviour."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good Flight from CDG to DFW,"Good trip to Dallas, I register at the desk and asked for exit row, thay give it for free, as it is supposed to be charged if register online !otherwise, the flight was versy good, and the flight attendants so kind."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Good but not FABULOUS,Flight Attendants were friendly.  But seats were very tight.  self check @ PHX was ridiculous!!Fees are outrageous!!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth flight,Everything went well from check-in to landing.  AA was very professional and courteous.  It was a great way to start a cruise.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Ahead of time departure and arrival,Boarding on time and very courteous service.  Smooth flight and roomy.  I would have given 5 stars if the meal was a bit better.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,What you expect - nothing less,"This airline is obviously very experienced - nothing is free, and the prices are not especially cheap, but everything is as you would expect."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Can't afford this stuff,"$500 to fly to Alabama, F U G A D E B O U D I T, I'll rent a car and drive next time! I can fly to Atlanta for $79 almost any time."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great service on board,"We were on a flight from PHL to LAS.  Even when we requested for ""handicap"" seating arrangement, we didn't quite get the desired seating.  The staff on board was excellent in general.  They were polite, energetic & cheerful, and they served with a smile.  They even made several attempts to retrieve trash from passengers.  A hreat group of workers indeed."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Right on time, just the way it should be.","I flew AA to Honolulu, HI from Los Angeles on their first flight of the day.  It is a little brutal getting up so early to be at the airport before sunrise, but definitely worth the extra effort.  Checking in my prepaid luggage was a breeze at the check-in counter and boarding the plane was organized and also simple.  The flight attendants were so friendly and were quite attentive.  I'm glad I had a good experience with this flight as well as the return one on the same airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Friendly, on time","On time, friendly and very helpful.  Will definitely fly American Airlines in the future.  A little crowded but still comfortable."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,.,"American Airlines damaged my suitcase (destroying the zipper) and lost several items that had been packed inside.   I immediately - within minutes!  -  reported the loss to the AA baggage office st the Buffalo airport.    However, they apparently lost the paperwork.  They have discovered a foolproof way to deny claims:   Simply lose the paperwork!    Unethical but effective."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Try to fly when others aren't.,"I am 5'3"" and always feel like I am in a sardine can when I fly.  If I drop something on the floor I can't pick it up until leaving the plane, no room to bend over.  Outbound my section of the plane had about 100 seats and there were 24 passengers so I did feel comfortable on this flight.    Inbound it was about half full."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Last minute booking to Florida to watch aseball's Spring Training.,Overall good flight with this airline. Departures and arrivals were on time. Lack of entertainment was disappointing.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"Co-pilot late, sat on plane for hour waiting","After the entire plane was boarded and the flight attendants had started closing the overhead bins, the pilot came on and said the co-pilot was late.  So we waited for an hour, getting a headache from the fumes.  The guy in front of me had the nerve to recline his seat, and there was so little room I couldn't even reach down to my bag under the seat without making him sit back up.  Finally the co-pilot came on and said sorry, he had problems commuting to the airport.  You would think they would have known this before boarding everybody...would have been much more tolerable if we could have waited in the gate area until the entire crew was present.  Once we finally took off, it was a good flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Honeymoon!,It was great everybody super nice and because it was our honeymoon they gave us mimosas and beer ! Really recommend
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good service,Excellent flight with American airline direct flight to Guyana Service was very good in business class
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"On time, great staff, nice seats","We had basic economy tickets and our party of 3 got assigned seats in 3 different places.  The gate attendants helped us get 3 seats together in the back row of the plane.  We were very happy with that.The flight attendants were friendly and helpful.  The seats were comfortable and had screens for watching movies.  My screen didn't work.  They tried to restart it from up front, but when that didn't work, they offered another seat across the isle with a working screen and gave me 1,000 bonus flyer miles for the inconvenience.We were offered drink service twice during the flight as well as snack offering of pretzels or cookies.  Hot tea was readily available which pleased me.Flight was on time.  Our carry-on roller bags were checked free to our destination and they arrived as expected."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,AA VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,We have trouble walking distances. The assistance provided by AA  (wheel chair) was extremely wonderful. Attitudes and willingness to help on the part of ALL AA employees was outstanding. The comfort of the seats was horrible and needs to be addressed.The connecting airports was organised by some one not in sync with travelers and their  needs.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Practically empty flight,There were less than 18 people on this flight on a Saturday evening. The service was great and plenty of room to stretch out. I just regretting paying for the legroom and seat towards the front when there was no need for space.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Hawai’i,"Everything went smooth from getting boarding passes checking luggage and boarding the plane. We were fed a nice lunch. Chicken sandwich, chips, a cookie and a drink .Everyone was great."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Never fly unless you have no life,"American Airlines always sucks. Always sucks. Always sucks. Always sucks.Always breaks down. Always breaks down. Always breaks down.Always delayed for maintenance. Always delayed for maintenance. Always delayed for maintenance.Chepo aircrafts, old aircrafts, chepo aircrafts, old and ancient aircrafts, chepo aircrafts.ALWAYS BREAKS DOWNALWAYS BREAKS DOWNALWAYS BREAKS DOWNALWAYS BREAKS DOWNAA SUCKSAA SUCKSAA SUCKSAA SUCKS"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,ABQ to DCA to ABQ,"The trip to Dallas was delayed, and we made our connection to DCA.  By just a hair. The return trip was delayed out due to AF1 moving on the ground. We made our return connection to ABQ with a few minutes to spare.  The planes will obviously be replaced  when the MAX 8 planes are released. First class was good like always. Priority handling makes a difference for picking up luggage at Baggage Claim.  AA tries to please, and today's travels are as good as the class you fly.  Generally, you get what you pay for."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,13-Time Zones,"We left LAX at around 11 PM on Tuesday night and arrived in Sydney on Thursday morning around 9 AM.  I guess the flight was about 14-hours long, skipping a day. Thankfully, the ride was smooth, allowing one to walk around, if only to use the facilities. They served a nice Meal about 2-hours into the flight, then a snack a couple hours later. During the final 2 hours, we got a nice breakfast.  We flew in a 787 Dreamliner. Instead of using shades for the windows, they have some kind of shade control which darkens the window making it appear to be night, while allowing you to see outside. Seating is 3x3x3. Not too bad but business class would've been great for this long a ride. Next time!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"Flight was good, but retrieving baggage was a fiasco","We usually only use carry-on luggage to avoid the expense and hassle of checking luggage.  This flight was very full, and we were asked to check our luggage at the gate to provide more room for carry-on bags in the main cabin. We thought we would be nice, so we did as they asked.  When we arrived in Miami we had to wait for an hour and 20 minutes for our luggage to be available.  I understand that delays happen, so that isn't what frustrated me.  I was most angry because we were not given any information about the delay.  I would think that with an unusual delay like that that some information should have been shared.  I don't know if the fault lies with American Airlines or Miami International Airport, or maybe both.  It was very poor customer service, and I will avoid using that airport and that airline whenever possible."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,First class to Europe,"The long overnight flight from Miami to London Heathrow was fairly pleasant via first class.  It leaves fairly early East Cost time, so passengers have a hard time settling in to sleep.  It was a bit noisy but better than the last two times I flew transatlantic first class.  The beds are pretty comfortable but I'm not that large.  The tall, large fellow across from me was pretty uncomfortable"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Nice flight,"Was really good, the only situation was at Miami airport because I had to pick up my bags despite I was flying with the same airline"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Easy flight,We traveled AA to visit the coast and it was an easy flight. The flight was about 3/4 full so there was room to spread out. I would have rated the flight excellent but  the seats were very worn down: we moved seats to a spot with more leg room but the seat was still in bad shape. All the cushions should be replaced so customers don’t feel the metal through the seat. Staff was great and flight on time. We will travel this route again on AA.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,late late late,"Our flight expected to leave at 8 AM, didn't get off till nearly noon - problems with the original aircraft, had to wait for another to arrive and be prepped & then for the crew - at least they provided lunch for the waiting passengers - the lack of aircraft available due to the Max8 fiascos is really hurting the industry - am aware of United Airlines passengers with similar experiences."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Flight was 2 hours late with now apology due to the pilots timing out.,"The first pilots that showed up for our flight took 1 hour to set up the aircraft they made an announcement they had timed out and the original pilots had a mechanical and didn't make the flight! They also said they didn't know when anyone would show up to fly our flight. We were about a hour late and the flight attendant came on the PA and said the pilots that we were to fly our flight were inbound and they should be there in 30 mins. After 30 mins the second second set of pilots showed up and the flight attendants were unprofessional in that no real service during the time we waited on the airplane. We ended up 2 hrs 30 mins late with no real effort from the pilots, flight attendants, or American to make up for an obvious oversight in scheduling."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"Absolutely horrible flight from Miami, Fl to Montevideo, Uruguay",They have embedded seats with only half the leg room available since the rest of it has a metal plate across it. I have long legs and that was horrific conditions. I would never fly on another American flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nice all day flight.,I figure this was cheap enough i upgrade to ecomony plus. I had 3 hour layover in Atlanta.  It was about 30 minute walk between gates. It help make the time pass. I had a great burger and frys at nations Hamburger in the terminal.  All in all a good trip. followed by a great AACA National car show in Miami.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Incompetence of gate agents,"My flight was from St. Louis to JFK with a short connection in Charlotte, NC. I was flying on frequent flyer miles.  At the gate in STL the agent announced that anyone with a roller bag had to gate check their bag as the plane could not accomodate them in the overhead bins. (The  plane was smaller than usual).  The gate agent looked at my boarding passes and tagged my bag to JFK. I told her that I had a very short connection in Charlotte and wanted my bag gate checked so I could pick it up on arrival.  I also explained that I was only going to be in NYC for a few hours before catching a flight to Iceland on another airline. She assured me that if my bag did not make it  in Charlotte it would be on the next flight. I again insisted on it being gate checked (I never check bags) and she refused and walked off with my bag.  The flight to Charlotte was delayed and of course my bag did not make it. I barely made my connection as it was.  When I arrived at JFK  I filed the required  paper work for a missing bag and was told that there were no more flights that day and my bag would be delivered to my Iceland hotel  the next day. After MANY calls to track down my bag, it was finally delivered to the Reykjavik, Iceland 2 hours before I left for home after 6 DAYS of waiting. I got a check for the clothes that I was required to purchase, after much paperwork, and it was not for the complete amount I spent, ( It was short about $15). No other compensation for my inconvenience . My lost  bag had my winter boots, hat, scarf, medication,and chargers for my phone, camera and tablet. The weather in Iceland is cold and icey and I was wearing only  slacks, sweater, leather ankle boots. and a jacket.  I also filed a claim with my AA credit card, which was supposed to pay $ 100 per day for lost luggage.  The check I received was for an INSULTING $4.66. There was no explanation for how they arrived at this amount and no answer to my calls for explanation.  I am cancelling my credit card and will no longer use American Airlines, even giving up the miles I still have accumulated I am so disgusted with their customer dis service."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Trip to Montreal,Requested assistance to gate. Met at curb with wheelchair on both flights.  Boarded with early sectioins.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,First long haul AA flight,"I usually fly on airlines from Asia, because, in my mind, they offer better attendance. But I have to admit that the attendants on this flight did not let me down. They tried their best to make my flight a comfy one, with a genuine smile.The only downside on this flight is that there is no way for you to get a window or aisle seat for free; I tried to get mine during the 24 hrs check-in time, but I had to pay around $100 for it. I tried to do it while checking-in at the airport and the same, at around $100. Another reason, for me, to fly on Asian Airliners."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Difficult to arrange flight,I was not allowed to use my reward miles on most of the available flights which resulted a 5+ hour layover at LAX. Flight attendants were less than friendly.
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Nurse/Passenger,"In a day and age where the competition is fierce, customer service should make everyone feel like royalty. The hardest decision should be “They’re all so good, who should I choose”?My daughter and I booked our flight through Priceline, they are going to get a scathing review. We paid $186 for the upgrade to select our seats. They charged our flight in two parts. No problem. So we thought. Leaving Phoenix and Charlotte, the airlines were great. They informed us that the upgrades did not go through but they were compassionate and worked around the error by Priceline, and gave us even better seats to accommodate the baby.However, on our return, direct flight with American Airlines, we encountered the most unpleasant and rude attendant Pagda in Newark. Our seats were already second and last row. My daughter had no one in the last row with her. The attendant charged us an additional $12 each to sit one row behind that had only my daughter. We paid for an upgrade and we ended up in the last row, right outside the double latrines with everyone coughing, sneezing, and flushing, and then swinging those nasty germ infested doors open. Pagda knew exactly what she was doing. And yes, I’m going to go there with my next statement. We Americans are mostly warm and welcoming, we don’t care were you came from. Heck most of us don’t know where we really came from but we love lavishing others with our American hospitality. You Pagda,are from another country, welcomed and employed by what many would say is a great place to work for. You meet hundreds of people from all over the world. Your customer service skills should be on point. Hundreds if not thousands, would love to be in your position. There was no reason for her to be impolite and then charge us an additional cost when the seats where already empty, she isn’t making a commission, and the seats were in the worst place you could put a 5 month old. Whether American Airlines does anything about this, poor behavior should be reported. We were unjustly charged for accommodation that were not honored, recharged to sit in the back and then treated like second class citizens. The pilot did a great job and the one male, Latino flight attendant should be recognized for his professionalism, patience, and attention to all the nagging customers in the back"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Crowded...narrow seats..cattle..,Never again..older pilot from Charlotte to Boston was wonderful...New and clean with no in-flight entertainment
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The transatlantic flight was comfortable and they provided entertainment(movies) as well as plenty of food and beverage,"I would fly with them again. The flight departed on time. It was not a full flight so I did not have anyone seated next to me.They provided plenty of food including a dinner meal (chicken or pasta) salad, bread and dessert. They provided beverages including beer and wine and soda complimentary. After several hours they gave us ice cream and prior to landing a light meal. Our bags were at the carousel shortly after we arrived and in good condition."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Jamaica,"Signed up for the aviator elite card to get our flights free to Montego Bay.  Everything was perfect, on time, very clean, and polite stewardess.  Would recommend to my friends and family."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Another day with American, another delay","Flew from Belize to Dallas.  The final leg was to El Paso. There was a delay, again with no explanation as to the reason except for some vagueness about repairs.  When I suggested to the agents that customers do better when they are given information, the agent replied that they had no information.  I then suggested that he ask.  Customer service is simply horrible.Also on flight from Belize seat did not recline."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great!,"Our plane was changed to a 777 wide body plane. We upgraded to have more legroom, so the seats were so comfortable and it was a newer plane. We were able to lean back and also use foot rests. Very comfortable and on time, all good. We did not use the in flight entertainment."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good service on an American flight was more than I expected.,The check in process was easy. They took my luggage that was checked through to San Francisco and was an easy transfer in Dallas to the waiting baggage handlers in the customs area. And it arrived within minutes of arriving in San Francisco. They served dinner and breakfast with a smile. and the entertainment console provided plenty of free movies..
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Friendly. Delayed but made up some of the time.,"We were delayed over an hour. The staff suffered with us in the warm waiting area. The pilot said he would try and increase the speed to make up time which I definitely appreciated because I had a connection.The staff was generous with water, helpful when my display didn't work."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good flight and helpful staff,"Flight was completely booked.  Not a single sit was empty.  Airline staff worked fast and efficiently to get all on board and out of the gate on time.  Flight attendants were also very efficient to get all their drinks and such and with a full flight this is something difficult.  Seats were OK, nothing to write home about.  Each seat had screen and good movies, USB port and connector.  Will fly again AA for sure."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Aruba Airport,"Airline was ok.  The airport was HORRIBLE.First the taxi driver drops us off by a fence (in the rain) on the outer road. I had to get our bags over the fence, no easy task for a 75 year old. We got to the airport about 6:20 am for a 9:23 flight, No one at the ticket counter to check us in, waited about an hour. Then through security, TSA pre check means nothing. We get to the hall for the security check and the gate was locked. took over 1 hour to get through security . THE ARUBAN equivalent of TSA was VERY rude. Now we have to pickup our luggage and go through US Customs. Only 2 agents for a plane load of people near the end a 3rd agent showed up. Then we have to drag our luggage to a belt and go through another security check where the agents were even more rude than the first group.  We got to the plane about 9:10 am. THE WORST AIRPORT IN THE WORLD  I HAVE EVER BEEN IN AND IT GETS WORSE EVERY YEAR."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Strike 2/3,"-American Airlines lady rudely asked why I would come to the airport to purchase my flight(because you save money but clearly this cost me more). I waisted parking $$ and Gas for her to not even be willing to do her job.-I was then told to call on the phone because she didn’t know how to help me -I call on the phone, and waited TWO HOURS for it to hang up on me and say I needed to call back later.The only reason I’m flying with American Airlines again, is because I have leftover money on their gift card from when THEY messed up last time and missed the connecting flight window, so I had to wait 10 hours for the next flight while the family next to me had to wait until the next day. Leaving us stranded at an airport. Karen rant is over but seriously fix your process, American."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Miami to Grand Cayman,"Usual flight with American. Okay and safe. However we had to circle a long time before we landed due to no space on the ground to land. Made a bumpy and late arrival. However, the bad news was arrival and immigration and customs. It took 2.5 hours to clear. Hot lines outside, close crowded space inside. We were told that the airlines schedule too many flights in a short amount of time. Especially on Saturdays. It wasn’t exactly American Airlines fault but some staggering of arrival times would be good. But must admit we have never flown in on a Saturday before and never will again."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Average,The flight was okay. There was nothing special about it. The flight attendants were standoffish which is typical of American's flight attendants. They are snobby and rather old. They do not put forth an extra effort to make the flight enjoyable or comfortable. The flight was totally full. We had to check our carry on luggage at no charge which was okay since we had a piece of checked luggage.I will say the curb side service was excellent in Chicago and returning from Miami.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very nice flights,We were surprised at the nice amount of leg room. The service was very nice as was the sound quality (quiet) in the cabin.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Able to use miles to upgrade,"Upgraded using miles, great service in business class, much room, great cabin service, on time both ways. Checked bags came up quickly, clearing D.R. Customs very quick. Suggest grabbing a sky cab to handle luggage and to take you to transportation, worth the few dollars in tip money."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,1st class for the first time in many years,Good trip .  On time. traveling 1st class made trip more pleasant as Coach comfort gets less and less. I only went one way and made reservation at last minute so could afford 1st class.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Met expectations. Nothing special.,A few problems with entertainment systems . Good service by flight attendants. The usual strange meals. Overall good experience. Like the non-stop service as Dallas day is our home.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,American airlines,"American airlines is head and shoulders above United. The customer service and general pleasantness of the staff is superior. Bangor, me is a subcontractor operating under the American name and fall far short of the rest of the organization"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Flight from 3/7/20,Flight was ok except for the luggage fees. Not enough room under the seats for small carry on luggage
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"Air travel ok, but only average","We flew from Cancun to Chicago on a Saturday first downer was having a AA credit card that advertises a free checked bag when airfare is charged on the credit card and finding out that didn't apply to my Mexico flight.  And priority boarding is group 4 of 9, not much of a priority. The plane was delayed an hour due to an illness of a crew member.  While frustrating to airline handled well and got a replacement.  The aircraft was a newer 787 and for economy was very nice with in seat entertainment and wifi.  Crew was very good and all other parts of the experience was good."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Sardine city,"Talk about packing you in like sardines it was awful my husband is 6.1 and he could hardly breath,  at one time they took put a few seats well it seems like they put back more than they removed.  It was so un comfortable. I will never fly AA again"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Nothing Special,The flight crew was plesant. Flight time to Cancun isn't too long. Unfortunately American has added 12 seats to the plane. Needless to say you like a sardine. The executives  routinely  should fly economy so they  can  experience what we do.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Prague, 2019","The flight Indy to Philadelphia was short, and uneventful.  The flight Phil. to Prague was nice.  We had a tailwind, and cut almost 1 hour off the flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nice flight attendants,"Left from Greensboro to Charlotte than to Sarasota Fla.  The flights were close to being on time.  Returning to Charlotte to Greensboro there was delay because they were short a flight attendant.   Boarding the plane in Charlotte was confusing. There was one gate -2 flights. Ours to Greensboro and the other to Michigan. We had to walk outside to planes, and thank goodness there was a person there directing us to which plane.  They were basically one to left, one to right. Very confusing.  It was night time so very dark walking to plane.There was no leg room for my 6'2"" husband.  I have had the same under seat luggage for 10 years. It always fit under seat. Not anymore. Since these were 2 small planes, it didnt fit in overhead either.The flight attendants were very nice.  We always fly American.  Of course there was no time to clean planes in between.  All in all no big problems."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great!,"Both flights were direct and long but I was prepared.  I flew economy, so I can't complain about any lack of comfort since I didn't pay extra for them.  It was as comfortable as expected with a decent selection of on board entertainment."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Will alway fly America Airlines,"I alway fly America Airlines, and enjoy all my flights. I fly a lot and just think, after first class and any special group that gets on the plane first. Start loading the plane from back to front. Keeping the flow of people quicker and easier,  people will not be in anyone way when boarding and sitting."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Travel,Very nice and very helpful staff on the plane. I had my grandson with me for his first flight and they gave him a book and a pair of wings.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Terrible space!,This was the most terrible airplane with less space than RyanAir! Im 190cm but there was not space enough for me to sitt. I almost had to stay all the flight.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Flight of terror,Coming back home from a weekend in Miami ... went to bury my father-in-law and what a horrible experience. I have used AA in the past but this flight was terrible. Very uncomfortable seats and outdated plane. Before landing the plane was shaking sideways and you cannot blame turbulence as we were way below the clouds and was able to the homes. Was grateful once we landed but wondering if the pilot was sick or drunk or on drugs. Not feeling getting on a plane again
Date of travel: November 2019,50,American Airlines,"Our flight was painless for almost 10 hours, very comfortable & worth the money!  Will do a again.I was traveling with my brother who is disabled & there we no problems at all!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,faith restored???,"last few experiences with AA prior to this one were very disappointing: canceled flights, delayed luggage, late departures   however, this round-trip flight was letter perfect both out and back, so i am grudgingly having my faith restored in this historically troubled airline   keep it up AA!!!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Returning home, part 2","After connecting in Miami, we made our return home from a Road Scholar trip (Costa Rica-Panama) to Newark Airport.Because it was a late night flight, we skipped the snack service but did take part in cocktails.Premium economy seats made the flight memorable."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Returning home, part 1","Returning home from a Road Scholar trip (Costa Rica-Panama) we made connecting flights into Miami.Check in was easy and the flight was very good. We did have premium economy seats, steward service and meals were very good"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,American doesn't make the grade..,"We booked American airlines from Vancouver to meet a cruise in San Juan and then returning on a flight leaving a few hours after debarking the ship.  Our return flight was changed from late morning on the day we got off the cruise ship to 2:45am the next morning.  That left us with no choice but spend over 15 hours wandering around San Juan and then a long day flying home. We ended up paying $120 to store our suitcases and have access to the lobby and pool at the Marriott. To make things worse, an extremely overweight man sat next to me on the isle seat and took up 1/4 of my seat on the 4 1/2 hr. flight to Dallas.  We also lost a short flight we had booked separately because we couldn't connect with it, and had to spend even more money rebooking another flight. It was a horrible experience."
Date of travel: August 2019,20,Crammed ike a sardine.,"Took an Alaska cruise last August.  Cruise company made flight arrangements.  Flight up was on Alaskan, which was a very good, comfortable flight.  Flight home was on American with transfer in SFO.  The American Airlines was worst ever.  I am age 82, 6'0""  220 lbs.  The seats on American were so close that my knees were jammed against the seat in front, and didn't recline.  When I went to get out  to transfer i found being so jammed in triggered my osteoarthritis in hip and had to be transported to final leg by wheelchair.  Still undergoing treatment with orthopedic doctor."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,A winter get away,"In getting to a Road Scholar adventure (Costa Rica-Panama) we flew American Airlines. No problem getting to the airport or checking in. The flight was a bit late in taking off but we managed to make up the time and landed on time.Seats were roomy but surprised us by not having 5 star comfort. Steward service was very good, meals were first rate and cocktail service very good.We did fly premium economy which probably made the flight a bit better."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worst airline,"Travelled from UK to LA return on American Airlines. I have travelled on numerous airlines around the World and this airline is the worst I have travelled on. I know it was basic economy but I have travelled on this service before and have not suffered such discomfort. The seats are narrow, short and very uncomfortable. In fact a fellow passenger said after experiencing American Airlines if they offered him a free flight he would not take it. Tried to upgrade but they would not allow this. Would never travel by this airline again"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Premium Economy to Munich from Charlotte worth the extra cash,"Premium economy with American is great. The seats are wider, with more leg room and a slightly steeper recline. The food is better too and you can choose your entree in advance of flying. The service on board from Charlotte to Munich was excellent."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Limited service,Long flight with limitedservice.  Meal service provided as soon as feasible after take off. Once the trays were cleared there was no further intereaction until a mini breakfast was served about an hour before landing. No water offered during the night and no snacks available even if you walked back to the where the attendendts were located. The attendents were brusk and impatient.  I have been traveling for many years on long over night flights and merican is the only airline that did not people walking the aisles every 2-3 hours offering water to passengers.  Flying is very dehydrating and 9 hours is a long flight.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flights on time   great service.,Very pleasant..No  delays ..No hassles Flight crew was very attentive and made the flight quite enjoyable.  Boarding was smooth and orderly
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Good to Poor,Late departure but made up time and arrived on time.  Return was an time departure and arrived a bit early. All and all good service.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Start!,Great stewards! Very enteractive with people and accommodating! We love all there direct flights to European cities from Philly!
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Hopeless,On this trip I had 4 flights. The first leg was cancelled (airplane broken down). I was reticketed to another airline. Unfortunately my bags were not. After 4 days I finally got my luggage. The connecting flights offered on booking required a marathon run between gates. On the return flight we were delayed again as another American Airline plane was broken down in the gate that we were supposed to dock in (of course creating another marathon run to the connecting flight)All in all a nightmare travel experience. Never again
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Negative Experience,"The flight was delayed 3 times, eventually leaving 2 hours late and we knew  we would miss our connecting flight in Baltimore.  We waited over an hour to check in and try to book a later connection. They were going to put us up overnight in Charlotte but I told them I could go to any of the 3 airports in the DC area and I knew there were later flights to each.  The later Baltimore flight was full so I had them rebook us to Reagan.  All was good as I walked to the security line and looked at the boarding passes.  They had rebooked our connecting flight from Charlotte to Reagan on a flight leaving EARLIER than our original flight instead of the flight they told me that booked.  I barged through the massive crow to get back to the desk  and got them to rebook on the correct flight. Even though the new connection was over 2 hours later than the one we missed, we still only made it as they were about to close the doors.  While the airport is not yet back to where it was before the hurricane and is still under renovation, the airline still seemed overwhelmed in dealing with the crowd."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,American Airlines is my GO-TO airline,"Every single one of the American Airlines people with whom I interacted were very pleasant and helpful. I had text alerts on my phone regarding on-time status, location of my connecting flight and where to find my luggage. All of it in a timely manner and when I needed directions, I always received clear and willing help from each of the people with whom I spoke. I had traveled with a different airline 2 months previously and found their texts came belatedly and the information was inadequate. American has never let me down."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,BURLINGTON TO DCA,"The flight leaving Burlington was over booked and they needed 3 volunteers.  We were told that they had 1 volunteer and that we could not board until they had 2 more.   After boarding, it took 30 minutes to get the paper work correct so that the doors could be shut."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Fair at besr,Attendance weren’t very attentive. Food was poor. No headsets were given to first class flyers to watch the films.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Enjoyable Flight,"The flight was fine.  The attendants were nice and courteous, but the delays were just too much.  Otherwise, it was a regular pleasant flight."
Date of travel: May 2019,30,Trip to Tahiti,"Almost a disaster. It was peak flying season and though we allotted ourselves more than 2 hours to check in, the security check was insane.  I was precheck however my husband wasn't.  By the time I was through precheck, the flight was ready to close the doors and my husband was still no where to be found.  I was beyond crazy waiting at the gate for him.  The gate attendant said they would not hold the plane, and there were still about 20 other passengers tied up going through security.  This was our flight to LA to get on the plane to TAHITI, our bucket list trip.  I was so upset.  I couldn't get on the plane without him, but that would risk losing my ticket.  My husband, retired law enforcement, was able to get assistance and assistance for others, and showed up as the doors were closing.  And no I was NOT on the plane... i waited!!  But i was PISSED!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"On time, no problems","We have been using American for the past few years for most flights. This recent flight was on time both ways, no problems or troubles at all. The only glitch was at Philadelphia airport on the return trip. As usual Philadelphia had problems with luggage caurasel , had to wait and move to get our luggage"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,flew Palm Springs to El Paso Saturday evening,The plane took off on time and landed on time.  I was upgraded to first class and the accommodations were excellent. The service and friendliness of the stewardesses were first rate. All in all a good trip.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,An unexpected surprise,"The flight started off ok with a 20 minute delay after we boarded in Santa Fe due to heavy air traffic into Phoenix, but the arrival time was unchanged.  The airplane left the gate in Phoenix 10 minutes early and we were not on board.  We didn't receive a text saying that the plane was boarding nor did we hear an announcement saying the plane was boarding or hear our names called.  American said they would put us on a flight going out the next morning."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Mostly a good flight, except that one lady BEFORE we went through security on the way home","Good routine flight from Minneapolis to Dallas, then on to Los Angeles. Basic economy improved since the last time. We could only have one bag to put under the seat and couldn’t use the overhead compartment. Now we could use both the overhead and have a bag under the seat. The only problem was at LAX to come home. Before we even entered the security line, we encountered a lady who made us rearrange suitcases that fit in the template before rearranged them, called my jacket and hat a carry one(which made 3 carry ones?). When I put my carry one in the template again, said it still didn’t fit. I said it’s all they way to the bottom of the template. We grabbed our bag and went up the escalator to security. That incident made me stressed out, and I hadn’t even been through security. After that back through Dallas and home to Minneapolis it was a good flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"AA Does Okay, But Still Makes Me feel Like a Cattle Train","I live in Charlotte so AA is really the airline here as they chased off every competitor and made the city give in to all their demands or they would leave. (Ha!) I travel enough (business and Pleasure) to maintain gold status, but all that allows me to do is get on quicker and have overhead luggage space. They send me bonus miles that can be used for upgrades to first class, but their are so many Platinum and Executive Platinum members my bonuses mean nothing as I can never get an upgrade, even over the past 2 years. Their seats are tight and they seem to fly the older version planes out of Charlotte and the newer ones out of Dallas. I wish I had some better alternatives but like I said they chased all the reasonable or discounted airlines out. I really find it hard to believe the government allowed these mergers, as all it did was raise fares for all. AA stated they need increases in tickets due to fuel prices, I agreed at the time when gas prices were approaching $4.00 per gallon, now it's half that and the flights aren't coming down, they still charge baggage fees, and seat fees, all the while reporting huge profits. If your going to tie your excuses to fuel then start lowering the fares in accordance. They also make sure they fill every seat, and over book, which should be against the law, as with allowing no cancellations with refund, they don't lose money. Prior to them merging with US Air, my average flight was around $260.00, , after the merger it jumped to $525 and hasn't come down, no matter where I go. You asked i provided."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,2 short flight with insufficient time to make connection,"5 of us were flying from Vegas to Tahoe via LA.  I spent 350$ to upgrade us to assure a seat in the front of the plane to help assure we make the short connection (we were assured by AA ticketing we would make it). The 350$ upgrade was for a seat in the front of the main cabin, early boarding, and complimentary alcoholic drinks,, not much for 350$ but I had to assure we could get off the first plane quickly to make the connection.   at the gate they boarded everyone together after first class, ( no benefit here) the plane was half empty (no benefit here) and the attendants never offered us anything, much less alcoholic drinks (no benefit here).  What did I get for my 350$?????"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Ruined entire vacation,"Flight was two hours late leaving Cleveland. No reason was given for being late, the weather was not a factor. This means that all connecting flights were missed. I ended up in Miami and had to spend the night there. The next day I continued on the Dominican Republic. I missed my connection to the resort, because I was a day late and then after arriving at resort, I found out they gave my reservation to someone else because I was a day late. Thanks to American Airlines for nothing."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Woody's Flight to DC,Great flight to Washington DC. From check in to arrival everything and everybody was on point. Service aboard the craft was impeccable.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,New standard for worst first class accommodations,"The seats in the A321 first class have poor legroom, and the seat only goes back about 5 degrees, and are hard and uncomfortable."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Trip to Pittsburgh.....,"Was traveling to Pittsburgh  for a business trip close to the airport.  Due to my status I was given a First Class upgrade for my segments on the trip.  Service was exceptional, no flight delays and my luggage made it in one piece!  Very good trip and had excellent flight attendants on this trip."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Back to Akron--We Hope,"We were glad to find a reasonably priced flight home from San Diego. The trip from San Diego to Chicago went well, but the flight to Akron was delayed. At least we had time for dinner. When we got to the gate, the pilot was waiting and informed us we could not leave until more staff arrived. Poor planning on the part of AA. I fretted that they could cancel our fight, but it took off even though Akron airport was closed. The plane was pretty full, but I am always a bit concerned when flying to our neglected city."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very comfortable and great flight attendants,"had the chance to fly business class from London Heathrow to Miami approx. 10 hour flight.The flight was very uneventful and smooth which was perfect to relax with my glass of champagne and petite hors d'oeuvre.Enough already, American airlines is excellent in any class of service and if you fly this airline enough you will be rewarded with an upgrade. The flight attendants are excellent and very attentive."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Short very comfortable,Good short comfortable flight in newer aircraft.Would utilize again.Seats were very comfortable and I am over 6ft 1 inch.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,2 week ski trip,"American Airlines handled 40+ members of a ski club from Roanoke to CLT, then on to Denver.  Several of our bags in the group did not make it to Denver.  They advised us that we would get them delivered the same day, as another flight was coming in from CLT in 2 hours.  We waited up for our bags and they did not come.  After calling, they advised if we did not get them by 11:00pm, the delivery service could not deliver them.  No call was ever made saying our bags were not coming.  The did come by 7:30am the next day."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,American Airlines,"Although plane was comfortable enough, the customer service by their staff both in airport and on board was basically “couldn’t give a damn”. Checked in together for long haul flights 3 hours before departure and asked to be seated together, but no, they sat us apart even though there were seats available together. Asked for window seat coming back, told ok, but again once on board separated and put in middle section. So, it seemed if you asked for anything you were given the opposite. Also food was inedible, the worst I’ve eaten on any airline. NEVER AGAIN WILL I FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES 😨"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,business flight,the flight attendants where very friendly at very helpful for any of your needs. we loved the extra Wie seating what a great option.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,Wonderful experience; everyone from person pushing wheelchair to flight attendants were polite & helpful. Smooth trip all the way.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Worked with me,"My original flight was from Cleveland to Mobile, AL via Charlotte, NC.  Weather caused delays in Charlotte that would not allow me to connect to the flight to Mobile.  A very kind and understanding AA hostess rearranged our tickets to land at Pensacola.  We also had our return ticket changed so we could fly back from Mobile to Cleveland.  This worked out great and we experienced no delays.   Our vacation plans were saved."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Oh my....,I’m small for a guy.  5’7”. Weight: 145. I sat in economy.  I barely fit.  It was claustrophobic.  Even the idle was so narrow I could not walk up and down without bumping the seats. My goodness. Can they squeeze in another seat.  Oh yeah..  no entertainment!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent all the way..,All personnel was VERY helpful and courteous.  The wheelchair was always right at the plane when I arrived and left.  My seat was moved closer to the door instead of being further back .  The plane was always on time and even arrived early x2!  I always fly American.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Had to deplane,"After sitting on the plane for over a half an hour,the pilot said our “repairs” were not finished and anyone having a connection before 7 pm would not make it.....well, we needed to be in Syracuse that night..so we deplaned and received a refund...why was another plane not  brought in? Most everyone was scrambling for some sort of transportation...we ended up driving to Detroit and catching another airline to Syracuse, and arrived in time."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,International flight was just OK,"This flight was nothing special especially for the fact that our tickets were well over $2,000.00 Flying in First Class was very disappointing to say the least. Selection of a meal was very disappointing and snacks were minimal"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"Always the same, poor","American Airlines seems to just get by. The planes are old, the staff is rude and uncaring, and the food is almost non-existent. They don't give you your miles earned unless you practically beg for them. The flight attendants don't seem to care about the customers. I have an AA Advantage card, and asked about preferred boarding, and was rejected. I had to wait until Group 8 boarded. That's not what the paperwork states. I also didn't get my 25% off purchase of food. I only got 10% off."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Smooth flying at a difficult time,"We needed a quick flight back home as our son-in-law had died. We found American Airlines and were so relieved at how easy it was to board.  The attendants were cheerful, efficient and that made the start of a tough journey worry free.  We are very grateful"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always good,"Easy trip, short flight,  no problems. Per usual a full load but all went well. Food to purchase, free soft drinks."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,A pleasant surprise,I had chosen this flight based on price only and was expecting something very basic but was pleasantly surprised. The plane was clean and the staff were lovely.Two issues - the plane was four hours late departing owing to a technical issue (we could actually see a guy working on the tail of the plane) and initially communication at the gate was not that great. Also the on-board entertainment selection is limited.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Winter get away,"On time,very friendly and comfortable flight. Will choose American airlines again the next time I travel. It would be more convenient if they offered more flight times. I was quite limited. The same with other Airlines that fly that route."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Short flight for work,"We boarded about on time from Montreal but had to return for a technical problem, out of the airline’s hands and I would like to fly on fully functional aircraft. The way to Charlotte was a bumpy ride at times but safe. The staff were very friendly and helpful as a number of the passengers had connections. Overall a very good journey."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Comfortable flight,Recently flew on American. Great crew. Business lay flat seats were cozy and comfortable. Arrived on time with both flights.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,First long haul,Very comfortable flight well looked after flight on time both leaving and arrival. Would use American Airlines again if travelling to USA
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good flight,On this flight we actually arrived early. We also did not have to wail to deboard the plane. Attendents were helpful and courteous.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Come Fly Away,"I Reccommend flying with American Airline, because they provide efficient and courtesy service.  You can rely on them.  They will send alerts as soon as they know of a delay or cancellation and will provide an alternative plan.  Always there for you"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Gets the Job Done,The plane left a bit early. We had a routine flight to Florida and arrived slightly ahead of schedule. Wheelchair assistance was provided on both ends of the flight.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Good flight.  Terminals could use improvement.,AA Terminal at JFK could use a facelift.  Good departure experience.  AA terminal at DFW has poor wayfinding and is confusing.  Both terminals clean.  Aircraft was clean and service excellent.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,A good start for a vacation,"Love the extra leg and sit room for the premium economy with foot rest. Each sit have individual care package ( toiletries ) and set of pillow and throw. Food was appealing and great. They serve you with wine , soda , juices and coffee. The only suggestion maybe is the bathroom - shared with the economy. Also have individual packed headset for the movies etc. definitely have to travel this way if you can."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Tired,I always used to fly American Airlines and have always flown economy.  They have a very good network of routes.  Over the past few years I have been saddened to see how it has changed.  The attendants are not as smart as they once were.  The cabins are not too clean.  The food served is often stodgy and in economy often there is no choice left also plastic everything.  The seats have very little leg room.   Once travelled first and it was excellent - but expensive!
Date of travel: January 2020,10,American Airlines,"With little choice of Airlines from ICT to SJU we flew AA. We originally had a 3 hour layover at DFW which was great. The airline changed our flight 3 times. I understand this as the flight schedules change. The last flight change gave us 20 minutes to get to our connecting flight. When I called to ask if we could change our flight from ICT to DWF (because of the 20 minute layover), they said of course, for an exchange fee of $250.00 per ticket. Really? I would like to say that our experience went downhill from there."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Nickel and dimed,"Great flight and service on very clean aircraft, comfortable seating. The only gripe I have is that other airlines do not charge extra on premium for baggage and priority.I will avoid American Airlines in future as a result. I am 6ft 2 legroom was fine."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,American Airlines NY to Punta Cana and Back,"Great flight, both segments were on time and flight attendants, especially Holly from Alaska were very attentive and friendly.  American did move us to the ""more legroom"" section so we were able to get off the flights quicker.  I have always been well treated by American Airlines, occasionally I have run into a gate agent that is a little grumpy but I guess it is an occupational hazard and I don't take it personally."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Main Cabin Extra seats not as advertised,Supposedly the front rows plus exit rows are main cabin extra. More space and free beer/wine. However in most of the last dozen or so times I've flown this route in the late evening the attendant does nothing more than bring a tray of water. Even when I request a real soda or drink - it has been denied. I think this is false advertising on AMR's part.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"""Miami Girls""","Travel from Grand Cayman to Miami is a really quick flight, but what I love about American Airline is because of its all on time especially when I am catching another flight to my final destination."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,On time and comfortable,"Both flights were on time (even early). Food was good, seats were comfortable and service friendly. Couldn't have asked for better."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Business Class on frequent flyer miles,"I always wanted to try out the flat bed seats and since our flight left at 11:30 pm, this was a good opportunity. Since my favorite fish (pacha) was scheduled for dinner, I had to wait until it was served before crashing for a few hours. The bed, pillow, and light comforter made it quite cozy. Wish I could always fly this way."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"I was dreading this, but it was a great flight","My previous experience with AA had not been good, but this was excellent, the staff were really helpful, and I guess it made it easier that the plane was not full.  The food was good, the wine flowed and the flight landed on time.    Who could moan."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Would not fly with American again!,Missed connections and not very helpful. Flew with motorized  3-wheeled. Scooter and they lost a critical component of scooter that secures the steering column in place. Delayed departure and wound up on United. Poor service!
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Travel at your peril,"The legroom is restricted by a fitting under the seat in front. There is no in flight movies, the food is disgusting the cabin crew rude. Had to change from a BA flight to this flight due to the BA pilots strike. The hot meal was only Luke warm, cabin crew refused to reheat it. Will never travel AA again"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Mary Olivia,There was swift communication due to delays. The pilot was reassuring despite the turbulence. The cabin crew was fantastic and thanks for the free snacks.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight to phl,On time with no problems experience.  Would use this airline again.  Flights attendants were friendly and personable.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,American Airlines,The flight was comfortable. Staff polite. No crazy hysteria especially with the COVID 19 being so active.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Excellent Special Assistance,"My wife and I requested a wheelchair for each of us because she has two metals in her legs and I have heart problem and blood cancer.  The special assistance office was not open till 4:00am and waited till then to our early 5:27am flight.  The special assistance agents came at around 4:10 am and took us passed customs and to our gate.  They were very nice.  When we arrived in Miami, two agents were waiting for us at the gate to take us to our connecting flights.  We rode the elevators and the trains.  When we arrived in Cartagena, Colombia, two agents were waiting for us after we embarked from the plane.  They took us passed custom and got our luggages for us and took us to get our taxi to the hotel. coming back, our experience with the assistant agents were extraordinary especially passing customs, transferring luggages, and rechecking.  Thanks to these people, you made our vacation something to remember."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Not really ""premium""...","Tried ""premium economy"" as business class was full.  Other than a pretty good entertainment selection, I was not impressed.  The food was awful, the seating uncomfortable (narrow and limited leg room), restroom facilities were limited (shared with economy) and the attendants acted like you were an inconvenience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Wonderful Service,"Flying First Class was definitely worth the small amount of money to upgrade. The flight attendants were friendly and courteous. The pilot was great, very smooth takeoff and landing."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Fun in TX,"The people was helpful and friendly, they was accommodating to those with small children.  Also was more then willing to find headset so we could watch a show during our flight. They offered drinks and a snack. I will definitely use this air line again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,great flights,traveling with walker and somewhat impeded mobilitywas allowed priority boardingnot much legroom but was able to fitflight attendants very pleasant
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Professional, Efficient, Friendly, On Time","AA has it down, when they get it right, they get it right.  I flew to Austin, TX connecting through Phoenix, AZ.  Absolutely NOTHING went wrong.  Even with a 25 minute delay on one leg, we still arrived on time. The staff was professional, courteous and efficient.  Actually appreciated the attendant at gate walking the waiting area looking for oversize bags to check rather than wait and create confusion and upset.  Really, really a good job."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,excellent service,"From the gate agent to flight attendant, the service was excellent.  I was treated with respect and kindly."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Awesome one plane flight,"Traveled  to Key West via two planes for 25 yrs never again.This was a great trip. From curb side check in, seat location, awesome flight customer service and right on time to K W.  Its about time a one plane trip was available . What a pleasure."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Not worth the price we paid to fly Business Class!,"The Flight Attendant in Business Class had an attitude. Her smiles, when she smiled, were forced and we witnessed a lot of eye-rolling on her part. After the world series than usual breakfast (an omelet that was totally dried up around the edges) was served, she never offered additional beverages. I know it must be stressful flying  with the corona virus threat, but professionalIsm should still be maintained.  plane was not equipped with movie/slash TV Screens or music. The flight did leave on time and arrive early."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Routine. No issues,"Everything was well ordered. No delays No issues. What you might want when travelling. We took a red-eye flight leaving before dawn, but that was our choice so we could have more time at our destination. Glad it was available."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,American Airlines,"We have travelled American Airlines on 12 different flights over the past 10 months, some connections, and some direct flights. The flight personnel have been professional and helpful, making every trip an enjoyable experience. Passengers have demonstrated positive and pleasant attitudes. There is so much negative written, that I wanted to point out the every day excellent work ethic of American employees, and the every day kindness of most passengers."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Flying Home from the States,"Not the best experience. There was a mechanical problem, which obviously we would always prefer happens while the plane is on the ground and not once in flight.The ground staff at Tulsa were great, they booked our hotel and organised our flights for the next day as the delay meant we missed our 2nd of 3 flights. We really like flying with british airways and American and find them both friendly and well priced."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Poor ground crews,Very poor ground crew. Plane bound for DFW was delayed more than 2 hrs waiting for the ground crew. During this time all passengers were on board. Eventually the problem was by passed (not corrected). This resulted in my missing the connecting flight and had to leave the next morning. When leaving the next morning after boarding the plane we were informed that there a back up on the runway preventing us leaving. This again resulted in delaying our arrival in Fresno. On the return flight to Orlando we again had to wait to deplane due to the ground crew not being ready when we arrived. All in all a bad experience in flying that caused me to sit on a plane on the ground for more than 2 1/2 hours.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Cancelled flight,"Ready to go on February 14.  American airlines cancelled flight do to some virus. But ,retured all money.  Nice agent.  Will fly on American again.😃"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,There is a reason they are rated the best U.S. airline,"Leaving from Bradley Airport was a breezed compared to leaving from NYC.  We didn't feel jostled or stressed.  We zipped through the TSA checkpoint with our picture id driver's license.  Once on the plane, we disinfected our seats and trays etc. with wipes we had with us.  Seats appeared new and they said the overhead luggage storage units were new and larger. This made it a lot easier for all to get their carry-on loaded .  They provided on board snack and soft drink.  (If you are gluten free, they are not. So bring your own snack.) Staff were friendly and the trip was non-eventful except for a bit of turbulence as we approached our layover city of Charlotte.  Transfer of flights was smooth and we arrived on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Excellent flight and service,"I was a little apprehensive at booking this flight as I had received a bad experience a couple of years ago and had avoided booking with this airline again.  However, my fears were ungrounded.  Attention to detail was very obvious.  The food was enjoyable and service was excellent."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,NEGRIL JAMAICA,As usual everything was perfect. I always try to find another airline with a better price and route but I always come back to American
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Overall good flight,"American Airlines now has non stop service between JFK and San Jose Costa Rica.   Since I travel there quite often, I was happy to see this.  The flight was good, on time, friendly staff, no problems with luggage.  It was a pleasure to fly, I hope this service continues!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"It went smooth, love how they give priority to Military","In general smooth, they where both full flights.  Military has  priority which is a plus specially when you are transferring or coming from deployment.  Also the app is great to have you will have entertainment during your flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Good luck if you are a tall person,"The only good thing was that we arrived earlier and polite crew. Otherwise, unable to sleep, nowhere to put legs, full flight, TV not working even after reset."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Good and Bad News!,"My first flight from Indy to Philly was delayed several times after the airline moved my original flight time.  I  originally booked a 5:00 ish time to fly out then a few weeks later got an email stating they moved me to the 3:00 ish flight.  My flight didn't end up leaving Indy until a little after 6 and I thought I was going to miss my connection to Amsterdam.  I made it with little time to spare.  The next flight to Amsterdam was great!  It was the first flight on that aircraft.  Service was great and no issues.  My flight on the way home went out of Paris to Dallas then Dallas to Indy.  Again, the long flight was great but the second connection was TERRIBLE!!  That flight was about to board then they said we were delayed for some issue.  They keep delaying then finally tell us there's a mechanical issue and if they can fix it we'll be out in an hour or so, if not we'd get a new plane.  After about an hour of back and forth with minimal info they finally tell us to move gates and we'd be off soon.  We moved gates and were at that one for about 10 minutes before they tell us we're moving to another one.  We finally get to the third gate and are told we have a new plane and will board shortly.  About 5 minutes later we're told our pilot that was supposed to fly us to Indy hours were up and he could not fly anymore.  Guess what???  More waiting until they could find us a pilot to get us to Indy.  I was originally supposed to land in Indy at 7:25pm and didn't end up landing until around midnight!  Beyond frustrating coming off a long 10 hour flight from Paris and a very frustrating customs process in Dallas.  I will not fly American unless I absolutely have to again."
Date of travel: July 2019,10,Disaster,"Our adjoining flight also with American Airlines was delayed in taking off from Peru.  We had booked knowing the  connection in Miami was tight but doable.  Then while we were on vacation, American Airlines changed the departure time to Toronto by half hour earlier.  Miami airport was packed and getting through customs took over one hour.  Spoke to different staff that we would miss the connection and they said too bad.  Staff also gave us wrong information saying we had to pick up our luggage at American customs and then when our luggage wasn’t there, they advised us it had been forwarded for the connection.  So wasted valuable time wait for luggage. Needless to say we missed the connection and  American Airlines refused to pay the hotel costs as no other flights available until the next morning."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good Flight Schedule,We had one connection in Dallas. All the flights were right on time. There was not much space for legs but that is true for all airlines. Round trip price was reasonable for this time of year.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,great value,Our flights were on time and full. Great service and comfort. Short duration flight. I always try to fly American.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Same airline,"Whenever you fly, I suggest using the same  airline on each segment of the trip.  Usually an airline uses the same terminal so finding the gate for your connecting flight saves time is there is a delay.  We had a connecting flight both to and from our destination.  Each time our connecting gate was just a short distance from the arriving gate so we were able to make the connection with no problem.  American Airlines employees were very helpful as were some passengers who allowed us to go ahead of them as there was little time to catch the next flight.  An ""A"" to American.  Avoid this issue and fly non-stop if available."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,BGI to MIA,"On time, good inflight service , good WIFI, decent meal. Check in at BGI was brusk, but efficient. Boarding organized.  MIA, what can you say,  it’s MIA. Miles and miles and miles from gate to immigration .  Signage to get you to the sky train to immigration is horrible.  Homeland pushes the crowd thru very well, then you get dumped back to land side,  security then miles and miles to your connecting gate.   Sky train works BUT no signage to say “hey take the train it’s easier and quicker.  MIA is working on it but has a way to go"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Baggage Claim Needs Help,"Having been a victim of delayed baggage on American, I always look for improvement . On this flight American changed the baggage claim carousel twice. Once they got the right carousel, unloading was further delayed when bags bags got stuck twice."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Nice Flight to Paridise,"Excellent flight and service.We were leaving the day before for Italy but when the Coronaviris was diagnosed in Venice we quickly called and American  AirLines were very accommodating.  After checking back and forth a few times, I was able to get the exact reservations I wanted in the class I wanted thanks to some very helpful ticket agents."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Screaming babies,"After a week in Oaha, we boarded for an overnight flight back to the mainland.  We figured most people would be sleeping and we would have an uneventful flight.  Unfortunately there were 2 different families with babies who screamed from take off to landing.  It was torture for those of us around them.  Here's a suggestion:  our church has a cry room, why doesn't an airplane?  It will be a very long time before I can be talked into flying again.  I felt so sorry for the parents; but, I felt sorrier for my group!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Coming home from Orlando.,"After about a year and a half I took a trip to Orlando. I flew with Frontier to go to Orlando and it was not a good experience. Coming back to Albany was such a better flight for me. I boarded American Airlines From Orlando and flew to Charlotte, North Carolina. The flight was smooth and very fast. The entire staff was so nice and I even got a snack . My layover time was just over 2 hours and I had enough time to eat lunch. My flight from Charlotte was on time and again the experience was awesome. This flight made me realize how much I missed flying. Again I got a snack and a drink on a short flight. Staff was very friendly. I applaud American Airlines for doing so well.. I sure got my money's worth. I am looking forward to flying again with American Airlines."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight Departure Delayed,"While the flight departure was delayed 3 hours because of crew unavailability, American Airlines helped greatly to ease the pain by keeping us informed and providing a very enjoyable lunch to all the passengers."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Short Vacation,Flights were on time. Airline personnel were friendly and attentive. The flights were full!  Planes had been cleaned !
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great Service,Great airline. They go above and beyond to help their customers. They do all they can to bring satisfaction to the customer.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"Flight was ok, as you'd expect~updates were terrible","Flew American Airlines home from Buffalo New York. Had a layover in Chicago - American Airlines said gate K2 to fly out, which was wrong, we had to find G19. I signed in to Orbitz, they had the correct gate which was far away from the original one. I was surprised Orbitz was more current than the actual airline. The boarding pass does not include enough information. Gate # was not on it."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Overall a good flight,"Both flights were fairly good, a little late getting to Miami but not much, flight was early as we had a 25 min trek from arrival terminal to our departing terminal and we were last to board. Service on flight from Louisville to Miami was a little slow only asked one time if need anything to drink, upgrade included alcoholic beverages, then flight to Georgetown was slow and barely was able to finish drink. But overall quick flights no delays and stewards were friendly."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,What happened to the old American,The gate staff for AA did appear until 6:00 pm and were not open for business until  6:35. We all had to stand in line in temps approaching 85 degrees. Where the staff was hiding I do not know. Delta and United all open and staffed at 5:00 pm.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good Flight,"Very good flight down, getting back was a pain in the butt in Chicago.  Will avoid flying through Chicago in the future"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,I will never fly Spirit again,"American is one of the best airlines out there besides southwest. My only issue is the checked bag fee, which i paid and then several people got theirs checked for free due to limited storage with carry on. Southwest offers free checked bags. American still has great flight options and great staff."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,DFW--Burbank GREAT!,"So glad that American resumed flights from DFW to Burbank. I have a best friend in Burbank and this flight is so convenient. Burbank was an American Airlines airport for years. Then it changed and I had to fly in to LAX - didn't like the crowded airport, long security and long drive to Burbank. The only thing negative about Burbank - uncovered roll up ramps to load and unload the plane. Thanks you AA for going back to Burbank! The flight itself was fine - a full flight, but nice plane, movie in flight and standard service."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Wheels up,My flight was on time quick to load and unload the flight attendants were friendly.There was no turbulence. There was a variety of snacks.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Disappointed,"We flew from Narita to DFW with AA in premium economy on a 777 recently. After flying the same leG on a A350 from Delta, the experience left Much to be desired. The 777 is LOUD. The seats were wide enough, but very hard, especially the headrest. Food was average at best, and service was indifferent. AA, you have a long way to go to match your competitors."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,I love American Airlines except for when the OVERBOOK.,American does a great job taking care of its passengers.  There's some discrepancies from gate to gate but amicably handled.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,They had free movies which makes me happy,Everything was great. We traveled using airmiles. The only thing better is legroom. I have been on flights there was more. But we were in economy so you have to expect that
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Someone did not prepare so I was asked to give up my seat!,"There was a mom, dad and 2 children who wanted to sit together. I was asked to sit in the very back of the plane by the gate agent after I boarded the plane and was in my seat so the dad could have my seat.There was a big difference in the seats and I didn't want to move for this man to have my seat. I know it sounds like I am an awful person, but it is a long flight and the mom was with the children. I booked ahead and prechecked exactly 24 hrs in advance. If this family would have done this they would have been able to have seats together. The gate agent was rude to me. Don't like American!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,I can't complain,"I usually have bad experience with AA especially when it comes to PAP, they just don't show any respect to customers because it's a poor country, there's not so many competitors and customers are uneducated. But this time I really enjoyed the round trip, no bad surprise, registration booth worked very well, boarding was on time and no delay  at all during the round trip. Even the gates location for this trip weren't far. For this experience I really can complain rather I enjoyed it"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,On time with friendly Flight Attendants,"Everything was as expected.  Boarding wasn't chaotic, the Captain made a welcoming pre-departure announcement, we had a slightly early departure, arrived early, and miracle of miracles the gate was available.  No complaints."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Once The Best!,What has happened to this once Icon of an airline is sad...My travels have seen much better service on other airlines. Sorry to see this happen.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Airline experience,"Don’t fly basic economy, AS treats you like dirty even when the reason you missed the connecting flight was tha airlines fault. They will charge you for a new one way ticket . So be careful."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A 12-hour flight that ended too soon,"American Airlines really has its act together on its business class service between LAX and Auckland New Zealand. The lie-fiat beds on the 787 seemed to be longer, wider and generally more comfortable than those on its Airbus 321Ts and Boeing 777s.  Also, the meal and snack service was superior to that on the many American domestic transcontinental and European flights I’ve taken. In contrast to the usual long flight that after 3 or 4 hours aloft can’t end soon enough, this was one I would have happily prolonged."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,They do NOT wipe down and clean planes between flights dirty!,"Bad like always and now extra dirty and sick employees!!!! They do NOT wipe down and clean planes between flights dirty!  1550 for First class and out of champagne every flight! Look at photo attached, black finger prints all over First class cabin. Gross!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Internal flights within the U.S.A,Would highly recommend American Airlines British Airways would need to take a leaf out of there book staff absolutely professional in every manner
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Trade Show,Felt unimportant as usual on American Airlines. Like your on a very fast school bus. Had no other choice.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Pretty Good This Time,This flight we took was pretty good this time. Flight was on time which is huge in the travel world these days. It was a rough and bumpy ride but understand weather plays a factor in this.  Overall American Airlines is reputable.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,About as good as it gets these days,"Gone are the days of good looking, happy flight attendants.  American is about as good as it gets when it comes to flying though."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Bad special meal experience,"On my flight back from Buenos Aires to Oslo (with FInnair), via New York (with American) I had ordered a special vegan meal. Upon arrival of the dinner service in the flight Bs As- NY, the air personnel didn't know which one of the codes was a vegan meal, neither what kind of restrictions a vegan diet had. They ended up giving me a vegeterian meal.  Very unprofessional and surreal that air personnel in such a big airline doesn't know what a vegan meal is or what the corresponding code is! Upon arrival to NY, I tried to complain and make sure that my next flight would have my special meal, and the customer service staff acussed me of having forgotten to request my special meal, in spite of seeing that my request was in place. Terrible service!"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Be wary of connectors through Charlotte,"This makes the third time in two months that the connector flight from Charlotte, NC to Roanoke VA has been cancelled.  I had had to obtain a rental car and drive from Charlotte to Roanoke, at my own cost.  I have never had a problem flying out but the flight back is iffy.   Now I just avoid the Roanoke airport and drive to Charlotte, since i most likely will have to drive back anyway."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Did not clean trays amidst Corona Virus outbreak,"We just flew on an American Airlines flight in an midst of the coronavirus concerns I opened my tray and it was absolutely riddled with a ton of crumbs  that fell all over me when I opened up the tray. It was incredible they are absolutely not cleaning or disinfecting the planes like promised !!!!!!  And after my husband's medical conference,one of the largest medical conferences in the world, was canceled due to the virus concerns, American Airlines. would not let us cancel our flight or change it without a huge penalty."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Good Business Trip to Louisville from Chicago,"Have made this trip four times in 4 years.  Last year via United, this year with American.  This trip has always been with a smaller commuter jet with about 50 or so capacity.  As a result, both flights were full to capacity.  The airlines always post about 1 1/4 hours for the fiights, even though, once at takeoff, the pilot will say the 'airtime' is only 48 minutes or so.  They over-plan so they are never cited for being late.  While I find this a misleading statistic, they ARE on time!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Miscommunication of flight time (my error) was handled by AA in the best manor possible,"I book thru FlightHub 6 months earlier and used their latest flight info on my itinerary.   AA had notified me 3 months earlier of the change but thats not where I checked. We arrived at MCO @ 8AM for a 10AM flight. Unfortunately it was 2 hours late for our 8:11 new scheduled flight. The agent was awesome, tried to get us to Miami on time but the alternatives were booked. She rebooked us for the following day an provided us a highly discounted coupon for a local hotel. It was an awesome experience thats to AA. Lessons Learned. Always book direct with the airlines."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Horrible experience/ Round Trip PHL to SAN and return.,"I had made reservations in August of 2019 for roundtrip to San Diego and return for a February 2020 flight from Philadelphia,seat 13C. In january I received an email stating that my reservation had been changed & I would be on an Airbus,Flt.# 2671 and seat in row 35.I immediately called A.A.Reservations to inquire of this change and was told due to the problems with the ""Max""planes there was a shortage of aircraft.When I explained to the agent I was unable to walk to the back of the plane due to age & back disability she then moved me up to row 20.The rest of the trip went smoothly but very uncomfortable due to the narrow space between seats & rows.                                                .The return flt2671 was a disaster.Overcrowded,late in leaving SAN to PHX flt.& thenThe PHX to PHL.flt..To make matters worse I was charged a baggage fee of $30.each way even though my original ticket purchase said I was entitled to one free checked bag.."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Cross Pacific,"The last time we took these flights AA83 to and AA82 back from Auckland was 3 years ago and the best other than Business or First was Main Cabin Extra.  American now has 3 classes in the 787-9 running the route, but First is gone and there is main cabin then Premium economy and Business.  This time Premium economy which costs about $500 USD more RT than regular economy was to me certainly worth the extra money. Remember these are 12 hours +or- flights. First you are put in group 4 which is priority boarding. Also your checked luggage is tagged priority with a big orange tag. The seats are spaced 2-3-2 rather than 3-3-3 so they are wider, also have about 6 inches more legroom allowing for a better recline and a leg/foot rest that can be used like a lounge chair ( The same as 1st was years ago)  On your seat will be a plastic bag filled with a blanket, pillow, large over ear headphones, slippers, and a toiletry case with toothbrush, paste, lotions etc inside.  Also find a full size bottle of spring water. Just after takeoff the f/A’s come around asking what you want to drink. (Wine,beer,cocktails (Made yourself) soft drinks etc.. About 1.5 hours into the flight dinner is served from a choice of 3 entre’s you can choose ahead of time on the APP if you care to.  Mid flight is a snack (Stromboli or beef pie) and ice cream.  About 2 hours before arrival is a full breakfast.  All except the snacks are served on china, with metal flatware and real cloth napkins, cups are still plastic. There is PLENTY of food to eat, also the kitchenette is open all flight between service for snacks and water. Premium economy in the 787-9 is only 3 rows of 7 (21 seats) so select early. We chose 9A and 9C which are with a bulkhead so plenty of room.  Dedicated restroom though when service carts blocked the aisles some economy passengers passed thru into Premium sections for the restroom.     The flight attendants were ample and attentive. These two flights departed and arrived exactly on time in both directions."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Plane broke down but they made it better,"I had a 7 am flight out of CLT heading to Burbank, with a layover in Phoenix. We boarded the plane, pulled away from the gate and then stopped. The captain come on and said there was a mechanical issue with the plane we would have to return to the gate. Once there, we waiting on the plane about 30 minutes when he came back on and said they would not be able to fix whatever was broken. So we had to deplane. They stated there was an extra plane just like ours in the hanger and it would take about an hour - two hours to get the one towed away and to bring the new one over. Because I had a connecting flight I knew I had already missed it (only had a 30 min layover). However, while waiting in line to talk to an American Airline Customer Service, my app informed me I was already re-booked on a different flight out of Phoenix arriving in Burbank later in the day. The agents kept us well informed, we didn't have to change gates and when the new plane was brought over we re-boarded with no issues. They even brought out snacks and drinks for us to have. Even thought my entire day was shot since I ended up with a 2 hour layover with the newer flight, they handled it as well as they could."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,First Miami  to Belize and back,"Flew with Mexican as part of trip to Central America and back to LHRBusiness on BA meant First on the relatively short haul run to Belize from Miami, basically similar to CW on BA. comfortable seats, not lie back of course. Check in was easy but the Security and immigration was more clogged up even though a priority area.Excellent lounge, champagne brunch was perfect then an easy boarding process .Nice light meal of nuts and cold meats on the plane before a painless landing. shame the same could be aid about Belize immigration but that is another story!  Mind you Miami was not better on the return run so hey ho."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,American Airlines,This is thr best airline and the only airline that I will use for travel. I feel safe and secure with my handicap a wheelchair is aways waiting for me to board and unboard espically connecting to another flight. Janie
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight from Barcelona,"Seats comfortable. Foot/leg rest.  Comfort package included a soft blanket, a pouch with toothbrush and tooth paste, sleep mask, ear plugs lip balm and moisturizer.  Staff terrific, Spanish red wine with meals.  Decent selection of movies. Desert a very deep chocolate pudding."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good flight - American Airlines is 1000% better than United,"American lets Economy bring one carry on and one personal item and you can choose your seats. United is one personal item and you get the middle seat. United's one personal item - United will lie to you, tell you your personal item is not a personal item, it's a carry on and it will cost you $30 to check it, so if you don't check it, United will nab you at the gate and charge you $30 plus $25 to check your personal item. I really hate an airline like United whose mission statement says it that it threatens it's customers and rips them off by lying to them to increase their bottom line. American does not do that."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Trip to Rio,"Attention was good, most customer service was helpful they acommodated our needs. On time everytime. Our luggage had no issues. Happy with the flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"NEVER AGAIN 10 delays, 2 missed connections, and an overnight stay","My husband and I had a direct nonstop flight booked from BWI to MIA.  We booked this flight on September 25, 2019.  On November 19, 2019 I received an email that those flights were canceled and new ones booked with layovers and arriving the following day. I called to change those flights and was told there were no direct flights available.  We arrived at the Miami International Airport to get on our flight with a connection in Charlotte.  We boarded the plane, pulled away from the gate, and a few minutes later received a message from the pilot over the PA system that there was an update to the system that needed to be done.  He stated that mechanics were on their way to fix it. A few minutes later the pilot reported over the PA system that it could not be done there so we had to go back to the gate.I then received multiple text messages that the flight would be delayed. They were as follows:From 12:57 PM to 2:00 PM. From 2:00 PM to 2:30 PMAt this point, the text message said that we may miss our connecting flight.  I called the 800 number from the plane and changed our connecting flight.I then received more text messages delaying the flight further.  See below:From 2:30 PM to 2:50 PMThe pilot told us at this point that we could get off the plane and wait for the updates to be done if we wanted to.  From 2:50 PM to 3:20 PMWe were then told to get off the plane because the pilot and co-pilot had timed out and could not fly the plane. We would have to wait for a new pilot to board. From 3:20 PM to 4:10 PMI had to call the 800 number back to rebook ANOTHER flight because we were going to miss ANOTHER connection.  From 4:10 PM to 4:50 PMEveryone reboarded the plane and the new pilot said that the mechanic was coming on board to check a few things for safety.From 4:50 PM to 5:05 PMTwo mechanics walked into the cockpit at 5:06.  I then received another text message that it would be another delay from 5:05 PM to 5:20 PM5:40 the pilot came over the PA system to update us that the mechanics have deemed the plane safe but need to do paperwork before we can leave. 5:47 the flight attendant came over the PA system to say that we're finally ready for takeoff.  We sat on the tarmac for a total of 3.5 hours.  It was 6:00 PM when the plane finally pulled away from the gate and I prayed that whatever the mechanics did made this plane safe. It's a very uneasy feeling to be on a plane that had to be worked on for hours.It was after 9:00 PM when we arrived in Charlotte where we were supposed to board another plane to get home.  Since we (and the rest of the passengers) missed both connections when we arrived in Charlotte we had to stand in line at customer service.  We were given vouchers for a hotel and food vouchers.  There were no restaurants open that we had access to except Starbucks so we did not get to use the vouchers that night.  We also did not have access to our luggage so we could not change clothes or access any of our belongings.This was the worst travel experience of my entire life.  I will not fly American again and I would not advise anyone else to do so either."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best check in attanfance,"Outstanding service from the ground staff for check in. A very friendly lady made it all for us, luggages and tickets handling. Flight was full. Soft drink and snack service. Cheap flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth,"We actually arrived an hour early due to tail winds! Only problem was there was a fire in the control tower...no ones fault...so sat on tarmac for an hour.  Then when went to gate, the ramp was broken so another half hour of sitting.  None of these problems could have been foreseen and everyone was kind and helpful throughout the process."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,AA's Bait and Switch Game,"I reserved an in-flight meal when booking.  The choices presented on the web site did not match those on the plane.  The attendant offered no explanation.  One of the offerings I chose was flavorless, starchy, and unpalatable. I could not eat it.  Beware of the bait and switch strategy. It is no wonder that passengers give AA the lowest rating in the industry."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,In love again,"Haven’t travelled American for a long time but man kudos to them. Excellent can’t praise them high enough. Yes, on the international leg the FAs are still old but from boarding until arriving I cannot commend high enough."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,On time!,"The flights was on time, boarding was easy. had to check in my carry on due to little space on aircraft, but not a horrible thing to have happen. The only issue I had was that they ran out of food choices and since it is a long flight is was an inconvenience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,No complaints,We had no issues with this flight. Great price on tickets ($340.00 round trip for 2).Check in staff were helpful and greeted us with a smile as they tagged our luggage for us. We changed planes in Charlotte.The flight crew on both legs of the trip were great. I would fly American again without hesitation.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Tiny, very hard seats and absurd tray tables.","We can handle the tiny seats for a short flight (only basic economy class available), but the seats were very hard and didn't recline.  The tray tables were no wider than my hand.  Ridiculous!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Accommodating,Fight delays caused other fights to be rescheduled. Staff was welcoming and accommodating to passengers and searched for alternative flight options. Thanks to American Airlines I made it to my destination later that day.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Horrible travel day.,"I arrived for my flight 5780 at 10:15, checked in for my flight that was to depart at 12:32. At that time we had a report that the flight was on time all the way up until actual boarding we were told the flight was on time. As we were preparing to board they announced our flight was delayed and we would not board on time, another hour later the same thing happened again another change on the marquis that the flight would not leave for another hour. Still no explanation as to why.It was not until 2 1/2 hours after we were supposed to board that an announcement was made about the malfunction of the plane. At this point people were getting very frustrated as they were already starting to conclude that they would miss connections. Myconnection was in Dallas I was now notified on my Airline app that I would need to move my flight connection as it was conclusive I would not arrive in time to make my connection. My first thought was I had paid nearly $700 for a one way ticket because I needed to get home in daylight hours to be transported from city into the country area in which I live. I could have easily saved $300 or more by purchasing the late-night tickets but chose not to for transportation conflict. Not only was I told there would be no reimbursement, but also I would not arrive to my Mpls destination until well after midnight. When I asked the gate attendant who was changing my ticket if I could be compensated for the extra money I spent for the early day ticket he said no with a smirk and the only compensation is I'm sorry. His smirky attitude was not helpful to my dilemma. I also explained that I now had to spend well over $200 to get a private driver to take me to my home upon the late arrival. Not only the extra transportation money but the driver was inundated with other requests with other late arrivals on my flight, so after arriving in Minneapolis at 12 30 a.m. I had to wait another hour and a half for the driver to drop other people off.)  After over 5 hour delay in Mobile airport I arrived in Dallas to catch my connection to Minneapolis I found that my American  airlines flight was once again delayed twice. No explanations to why. At this point I had concluded that I would no longer fly on an American Airlines flight again."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Torture Seat,"American airlines assigns your seat, if you use basic economy.Of course you get the dreaded middle seat. I have a lower back problem, and the seat felt like a rock. There was no comfort, and I was in pain for 5 1/2 hours.I thought it was just me, but one of the airline stewards told me the seats are very uncomfortable. I had to take a pain killer to survive the flight.They did have free entertainment,  if you have a device with their app.In order to access the entertainment,  you have to be off airplane mode.However, once the movie starts, you can go back to airplane mode.Also American has no direct flights,  so I  left San Diego to the hub in Charlotte NC. There was a 4 hour layover with no chance of getting an earlier flight.The 2nd flight only takes an hour to Savannah Georgia. On my return trip I flew from Savannah Georgia to Charlotte NC. There was only 45 minutes to get to the next gate, which was in the other end of the airport  I had to RUN to get to the gate.The flight attendants were very friendly. Also I have TSA pre-screening,  but you have to get that on your profile of American airlines website. This was not a pleasant trip."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Kind of surprised at their First/Business class.,"Other than extra leg room, I'm surprised at the flight. I travel often and am usually asked on arrival if we want a mimosa,  water or OJ. We were offered OJ or water. When asking for something on the fist flight,  we were told once we were up on the air. It was a red eye, I was hopeful to have a small drink and pass out. So I just went to sleep. Then Charlotte to GC we asked for a mimosa and she said...Now?There were no chargers on either flight and no way to watch a movie unless you downloaded their app and watched it on your phone. I basically paid way too much money for some leg room because there was nothing special about that class of service otherwise. It was actually pretty disappointing as we splurged to do this for vacation."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Overcrowded flight from Maui and terrible food and service,"Free miles, but overcrowded and passenger across the aisle using a pumice stone on his feet.  Gross!!  Nobody does anything about it either.  So many hours on there, and basically nothing to eat except a stale sandwich, which you have to buy.  Not very pleasant.  Oh! and the bratty kid ordering his parents around, and crying and screaming to get his way.  Thank heaven he went to sit with Mom, somewhere in the back of the plane.  Seats assigned by the airline were right in front of the bathroom, and could not recline, and had to listen to that door slam 1,000+ times.  Never again."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Coach was better than I thought,"This was a bucket list trip to Greece.  I really, really wanted to use my frequent flier miles for business class.  I also really, really didn't want to travel 24 hours to get there.  We decided on the route that gave us the shortest travel time, which meant flying coach.  S/O and I had 200K of miles between us and it's not right that we were forced to fly coach to get on this particular flight.  Couldn't even get premium economy.  Anyway, we paid extra for bulkhead seats and that is the only reason I am recommending this flight.  It's 10 hours.  The seats are narrow but the extra leg room made the flight tolerable.  We were also able to sleep some so we weren't exhausted when we arrived in Athens.  The on time performance for this flight has been pretty bad since they started it.  Don't plan anything in Athens day of arrival.  You will probably be late."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,No issues what more could you want.,No issues on time two legs even early. The crew was nice as with any basic seat would be nice with more room.
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Will never fly American again,"They treated my luggage terribly! Broke a brand new expensive SEALED  perfumed powder and it got all over EVERYTHING in the suitcase. The container wasn't damaged so someone shoved the bottom of the powder up and broke it. They didn't care. No sorry, no compensation for this and the worst part along with it being expensive the mess it made was it is a discontinued item that I cannot replace. Then on the flight home they broke a glass jar I had purchased and wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap to protect it. I am very careful packing but EVERY time I fly American something gets broken."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,LAX to OGG,Outstanding comfort and crew both ways. Very good food and beverage service too. I am totally spoiled and American can take all the credit. I am lucky enough to have enough miles to book first class on most of my trips. I can also book coach and use miles or upgrades. The AAdvantage Program gives me plenty of flexibility.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flew from stateside to Sydney,"Airplane was very comfortable seat size wise.  Not crowded.  The food was satisfactory, the flight ran on time and our luggage was there waiting for us when we arrived.   Getting through customs took a while but not enough to be annoying.   Great flight crew and the aircraft was very clean and tidy when we boarded."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Cancelled early morning direct flight,"Our original direct booked flight was to leave Toronto for Miami at 1:00 p.m.  It was cancelled and put at 6:00 a.m.  That would have meant getting up at 3:30 a.m. to get to the airport on time.  The only option was to take a stop in Charlotte.  That way we could leave at a reasonable time in the morning.  However, that meant we did not get to Miami until 7:30 p.m.  With a stopover, it delayed our trip.  The walking from one gate to another took 14 minutes at each airport and we are seniors, nearly 80 years old.  It made for a tiring trip.  We will use another airline next time that hopefully will not cancel the direct flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Quick Trip,great connections both flights where on time & a better than usual travel experience  the first Flight had extra leg room for some reason
Date of travel: November 2019,10,"Pleasant journey to London, coming home was hell and American, frankly, was not willing to help.","Trip from RDU to LHR was smooth; the FAs very efficient, though not pleasant; overall, the trip was fine. Coming back was an entirely different story. We were routed LHR to AMS to PHL to RDU. Weather made everything change. We arrived in AMS fine (BA crew great); after sitting in AMS for a while, I receive an email that we have to be re-routed ... no explanation, but I assume it is because of snow hitting PHL and we won't make our RDU connection. No assistance, no ground representatives, sent to different desks, none of them American. Finally, had to get our luggage taken out and then find a hotel. No assistance with that either.The hotel we got, Citizen M Schipol was fantastic. They helped us out way more than American or Oneworld even considered. Because, of course, our re-booked flight on the next day was ... cancelled all together. Told to wait and would fly out the next day. Again, no assistance with hotel, meals, etc., ""act of nature"" etc. excuses. Instead, Citizen M let us stsy late and I got us rebooked to LHR that evening and LHR to RDU next day. Except the American agent gave me the wrong flight time for AMS to LHR, but fortunately found out about hour before the flight left, three hours earlier than agent told us.Citizen M was super helpful and got us to the check-in ... super customer service, can't compliment them enough.Finally got home three days late, rotten customer service from AA.Fly Delta for customer service or United for low price ... AA has neither."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,American Airlines,The plane is old.  Offered very little refreshment for a 3 hour flight.  The flight attendants were ok.  AA definitely is lagging comparing with other airlines.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,American hit the mark this time!,Plane was direct flight. On time and good service. Smooth all the way to Phoenix and bumpy on the return but pilot kept us informed and we arrived a bit early. Some sound issues on board due to turbulance but I'm not complaining. I got home safe. Didn't use the online available movies etc. but I did get the app working and can with my phone next time.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Recent trip,Overall OK. Connections were on time. Leg 2 of trip Was delayed into Charlotte. Connection gate was almost 1 mile from arrival gate we had 3 minutes to spare.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,booking a flight,"Booking a flight last minute to LaCrosse because of a death in family.  I could not find anything, so needed to call an airline for assistance.  Brooklyn from Boise was fantastic!  She found a direct to Chicago then a connection to LaCrosse.  Completely stress free!  So grateful to her   efficient, professional, pleasant!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Miami Vacation,My wife and I booked direct flights from Indianapolis to Miami and surprisingly our flight departed on time and arrived in Miami early. I strongly recommend the seat upgrade as you not only get more comfortable seats with more leg room but other amenities come with premium economy seats.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Fine flight,"The flight was fine. On time departure and early arrival.   No issues. Flight attendants were professional, pleasant and attentive."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,CLT to Paris via PHL,"Great flight out of Philadelphia toParis, with lucky strong tailwind getting us in well ahead of schedule. Crew were excellent, but the meals were a regression since prior flights. No longer serving a steak, and lower quality wines. The meal service was a real disappointment."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Time in air was fine - but ....,"We were delayed getting in the air because of a paperwork issue needed to be verified. Flight was further delayed by headwinds. Landed in CLT 20 minutes late. Had 50 minutes for connecting flight before delays. Had assistance needed indicated on reservation. Because I had upgraded our seats, we were the first off of plane needing wheelchair assistance. Had to walk down the plane steps to tarmac (gate E35B- the furthest away from building);  there was 1 wheelchair waiting on tarmac. Attendant was great getting me to the gate in the building, but said he would be back in a minute. I said I had a connecting flight to get to and it was already boarding. Again he said he'd be back and then abandoned.  To be fair, he was trying to get additional attendants to the plane for other passengers who needed assistance (could hear his walkie-talkie conversations) and I could see he was wrangling additional chairs toward the plane.  But he left me and my son on our own. We started to make our way to Gate C8. My progress was slow and I sent my 17-year old son running to the gate to let them know the situation and that I was on my way.  At the entrance to Concourse C, an airport employee saw how distressed I was and stopped another employee with an empty chair, that woman had me sit and pushed me to my gate. I was the last passenger to get on the plane as my son waited with the AA gate employee. I am sure that if my son did not run ahead, I would have missed my connection.Thought I had done everything right: talked to boarding agent & flight attendant about my need for assistance and short connection time but nothing seemed to help."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Aruba Yearly Trip,"Great on time flight. Connected through Charlotte and connection time was short.  In CLT had to de-plane down stairs in the rain.  No assistance from the crew.  Overall, flight was good.  Return flight from Aruba was fabulous!  So happy AA has added Aruba to their Dallas flights."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,FLIGHT TO TAMPA BAY FLORIDA,American Airlines were very acomidating. easy and fast check in.Flights were on time and not to long of lay overs. we are planning to fly with them again in may.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,4 Flights with only one hitch,"Took an early morning flight out of Tulsa to DFW then to Monterrey, MX.  Comfortable flights with good service and no disruptions.  In fact, the second leg of the trip was must less crowded than the first.  Whisked right through customs both going and returning.  The last leg of our journey was delayed at DFW as their computer system went down and they loaded the wrong luggage onto our flight.  Once that was corrected, our total setback was about 45 minutes, which perturbed my wife, as she had to wait with our two ansty pooches in the van.  I fly American quite often and have been pleased with their level of service most of the time.  But, after flying commerically for over 35 years, I realize that there is no reason to get your undies in a bundle when a bump in the road occurs.  You adjust and go on with  living a happy life."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Consistent, Reliable Flights to Belize!",We have flown American from DFW to BZE 4 times in the past 2 years and have had consistently good flights.  I highly recommend this airline!
Date of travel: November 2019,40,No where to hide,Standard process . No special occurrences ...... Timely flight and flight attendants were courteous . Seating a bit tight but convenient .
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flight!,Always happy to fly American Airlines! I just wish the seat size was a little bigger!Flight  attendants are always pleasant and I really appreciate when the pilot gently places the plane on the ground.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Never will fly with American Airlines again,We fly frequently and haven’t used American in a very long time and never will again. We paid extra for more leg room but the seats were like sitting on cement for 5 hours. In addition the width of the seats were for a teenager and I am not hippy.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Flying out of MHT is hassle-free,"Flying out of Manchester-Boston Regional Airport is so much easier than flying out of Boston Logan and landing at Reagan National is so much more convenient to business in Washington, DC than BWI or IAD (Dulles)."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Good flight,  good  crew",Overall a good  flight. The attendants  were very pleasant. I like the multiple choices of entertainment available via the AA app. I watched a movie and other content heading out and another movie on the way back. As with most airlines the seats don't offer much in  the way of room. (Why do  they even recline? You get an inch and just tick off the people  behind you).  I had to catch a bus to get to my final destination of Boulder. We were a bit late taking off but made up time in the air.
Date of travel: March 2020,20,FOUR hours of delays on departure and return,"Absolutely terrible experience on American Airlines on the way to NYC for my daughters 16th Birthday! I have not flown American in a few years, so thought I'd give them a try. Bad idea!  Got up early to take a 7:05 direct flight to JFK - did not end up departing Austin until 10:00. Meal vouchers were offered at 9:45 and the line was so long there was no way everyone was getting one. My daughter and I did not receive them, nor were we offered anything other than the complimentary beverage and cookies on the flight. My mother left Austin on United at 7:00; had a connection in Chicago and 2 hour layover and arrived in NYC just minutes after we arrived! We missed out on 1/2 a day in NYC b/c once we arrived we were in rush hour and it took us over an hour to get to our hotel. Had we arrived at 11 a.m. when we were supposed to, traffic would not have been as bad. On our way home the plane was completely boarded and they announced there was an issue with the oxygen tanks, we were given no updates by the pilot and then I received a text that our 7:05 departure was now 7:45 and we didn't end up departing til after 8 p.m. Overall terrible experience, do not plan on EVER flying American Airlines again!!!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Poorly informed,"At 9:00 am we were informed that our 4 pm flight wpuld be delayed by an hour.  We made arrangements to adjust to the delay.  Then we were told it would be a two hour delay.  When I called the airline direclty I was told that ABSOLUTELY the flight would be running.  The we were told it was a four hour delay.In the end the flight did NOT run and we were stranded at 9 pm in a very small airport.  Had they just been honest we could have grabbed an earlier flight and connected through Charlotte but they were not forthcoming with the information.Instead of arriving in Philadelphia at 6 pm, I had to miss work the next morning.  VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Delayed once again!,Our flight on American was delayed once again by a total of 6 hours.  The last 5 flights that we have booked on American were delayed and one was canceled totally.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,American Airlines,All times were good for catching the next flight and landing and takeoffs were good.  Service was good and airports were fairly clean and neat.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,New planes getting smaller,The staff was great and plane clean.   The problems are the seats keep getting smaller in all classes. Check it out and the food really needs improvement.  Bathrooms getting smaller and smaller as well.  What happened to comfortable flying especially at these prices for tickets.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Easy Flight and on time,Flights were on time but we were disappointed that there was a minimum amount of Champagne on board for 1st class/Business class. Should have been better prepared. Same issue returning home.Also no headphones available to watch movies
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great trip on American as always!,American Airlines was smooth as silk and right on time as usual.   It really couldn't have gone much better unless they could reduce the time it takes to about 4 hours and we all know that is not possible - yet!
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Broker/Owner,"This review would apply to nearly every airline these days. We were okay with our carryons but those in coach were not. People get on with much more luggage than supposedly allowed and hit everyone in the head with their backpacks in the way to their seats. Nothing is as clean as it should be. People from coach trudge through and are allowed to use the bathrooms in First Class.  As the seats shrink, so does the patience of both passengers and staff. The solution, in my opinion, is to enforce carryon rules including the size that fits into the suitcase holder as you board. Then carryons, etc. must be put only over YOUR seat. Then start boarding from the rear one-two rows coming forward until plane is full. Disembark in reverse. During that time, the plane can be cleaned a few rows at a time.Fir American Airlines, more flights should go through Charlotte, NC."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth Trip to Rio de Janeiro,"I haven't flown on American in some years but they offered the best direct flight options for my trip to Rio de Janeiro recently.  My connecting flights to and from Boston were flawless as an agent met each plane and handed out passes and directions to the next flight.  I have not experienced that extra touch before.  A baggage rep took my bag before I had to deal with customs on return. Flight attendants were solicitous, gracious and even witty. I was glad that I had requested more leg room, however, as the  economy section looked insufferable for a long journey, an arrangement--on the part of all airlines--that should be subject to greater regulation, I believe."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Easy flight between both airports,Check in online paid for luggage online.  In MKE all we had to do was drop our checked bag at the counter.  PHX even though we checked in online and paid for checked bag we still had to go thru the kiosk to get our checked bag label.  Not the worst.  In flight wifi worked well and free movie or tv show selections was extensive.  Enjoyed these flights
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Mrs Ann lightfoot,The crew were diabolical going one of the crew was okay better crew on return flight never fly again with them
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Always go back to the basic.,"You try options , look for a deal, unload an application .... bye a ticket .You have questions and do not get a concrete answer . The new application can not give you the answer ... you know why???The new application ends up being your agent . They can not answer escenario you might entertain. So it’s best to go to the source of information ... book it, and you will get answers from the source ."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,It was ok.,"We have never flown Basic Economy so we arrived at the airport not knowing where we would sit.  Amazingly we did have seats next to each other going and only on the Palm Spring to Phoenix leg did we have seats apart.  Seats were small, close together, the usual.  What really stood out was the fact that on a plus two hour trip from Indy to Phoenix we got no snack of any kind, no pretzels, no cookies, nothing. We did have coffee-if you can call it that.  In fact they could find another vendor for coffee-it's bad. Really, American?  Give me a break!  You can afford cookies.  We'll probably look for a different airline the next time we go to Palm Springs because it was just an ok experience.  Also we noticed that they announced full flights for each of the legs-and the flights were not full.  They were actually giving vouchers if you'd change-but only if your new flight was after the one originally scheduled.  They'd change you but give you nothing.  No thanks!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Lax Vegas and back,"Left on time, arrived on time.  Full flight.  Just a glorified bus with wings.  I'm platinum on American so I board early in the process and get to pick seats up front.  Regardless,  it's almost dehumanizing."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Good flight and service,It was my first time flying with American airlines and it was a good experience. Plane was small and staff were friendly.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Vegas Trip 2019 Flight,Great flight. No issues. Service on the flight was not as good as Delta but the in flight movies available through the American Airlines app is a cool feature.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Nice flight..,The flight was as pleasant as any flight can be. Food was reasonable and the wine was free.The in-flight entertainment system was excellent with w wide variety of movies to choose from.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Pleasant Experience on American,All of the American Airlines personnel were very friendly and helpful.     I had a sore arm from lifting a heavy suitcase from a high shelf and the flight attendants made  an ice pack for me using the air sickess bags.  The only negative comment I would have is the delay using wheelchair service in Chicago - they had a high demand and struggled to get people to their flights on time.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Attendants,"Personally I am not good at flying anxious, nausea and afraid all together of flying. On this flight I felt that attendants seemed robotic and standard. I feel when they are relaxed maybe even a smile or two makes for a more comfortable flight.the flight it's self was good as well as comfortable seating."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,On Time with Excellent Customer Service.,"I am still using a walker but when I fly,  I take a wheelchair to the gate and can walk onto the plane. Routinely I board first and get settled before the main boarding occurs. When we land, my wheelchair is on the flyway waiting for me. I always book long leg room for comfort when I fly."
Date of travel: August 2019,20,Delayed flight,"Notified flight delayed, then delayed again, then again, then placed on two stop British Airlines flight. Paid AA for business, placed in coach Venice to London. Then four hr BA delay in London. Horrible layout and service in business on BA. Delay in London caused missed connection in Chicago (original AA flight direct from Venice arrived before the BA we were moved to). Spent night in Chicago (no food), coach from Chicago to Phoenix (again and paid AA for business for entire flight). AA solution- refund $80 each. Had to fight to get reimbursed for multiple delays, missed connection, extra night away from home, etc. Still not reimbursed what it was worth. Second out of country trip in business class on AA flight that delays caused unexpected overnight stay with day late arrival. Attitude of AA is basically oh well, who cares."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Horrible service,Horrible service.  Plane on the way out was delayed 2 hours with a full plane due to brake issues. Very poor communication from staff. Flight on the way home also a disaster.  Plane again full but luggage cages broken.  Poor communication again. Sat on tarmac 2.5 hours. Everyone missed connecting flights.  AA reps in Dallas not helpful and told us to stop complaining.  Horrible experience.  Will never fly A.A. again
Date of travel: March 2020,30,They separate families,I have flown on AA in the past and have always been separated from my husband but I though it was just a fluke but this time  I feel it was deliberate. I think they do this so next time  you will pick a seat that they can charge for to be together. This time I noted at least 3 couples who were separated. Mind that there were also seats open and many single passengers  flying alone. Usually these folks will switch seats but why??! We booked together and checked in together and had the seats for 4 months!! Other airlines make the effort but not AA. This flight I asked a single passenger to switch which she did without hesitation. This seemed to anger the flight attendant who then offered to get the passenger anything she wanted to compensate her for switching. Again these seats were at the back of the plane no one paid extra for them. Why were we separated to begin with and when the flight attendant saw this why did she not arrange for us to sit together???? Not friendly
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Nothing Special,We fly American 3-4 times a year. First class is now business class.  Less room and comfort.  Flight team going were great coming home we were doing them a favor flying with them.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Great service, all smooth, flight crew friendly","We departed on time, the flight was pleasant, crew was friendly and efficient when serving breakfast and lunch as I took 2 flights to my destination. I am pleased with the service.  Boarding was efficient even if the airport does not have the best facilities in Mexico, but the Airline has a good procedure in a very little space."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Honeymoon flight to Antigua,"We had a great flight, our steward & stewardess were very nice. Can really say anything negative. Typical flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Pleasent visit to see my first Grandchild,"Flights were on time, with conneciton in O'hare between smaller airports.  I enjoyed visiting with other passengers and sharing my faith in Christ and the joy of seeing my first grandson.  Overall it was a fairly relaxing and pleasent experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Flight delayed . . . . pilot wasn't on time,"Our AA flight was delayed with the pilot wasn't to the aircraft on time.   The rest of the crew was present, but not the pilot.This was an early morning flight where the aircraft crew all arrived in Curacao the previous day and spent the night in a local hotel.   Someone, please buy the pilot an alarm clock."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Outstanding Customer Service,"The Agents and Ground Crew in Flagstaff do an absolutely outstanding and professional job.  They are friendly and know their job.  Any delay is always explained and efficiently handled.  It's about time Flagstaff had another option besides Phoenix to connect thru.  The DFW flight makes it so much quicker and easier to get to anywhere on the East Coast, Europe and South America."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"OK flight, competitive pricing","I took a flight with AA from Boston to Toronto (connecting at DCA). The first leg was using an Airbus A319, and the experience was normal (just like any flight you can expect between any major airports in US). The second leg was using a CRJ200, which is one of the most cramped airplane I have taken. The overhead bin could barely fit my mid-size backpack and the legroom was average at best. One of the few good news is there is no middle seat on this plane. The flight was smooth, on time. And the flight attendants was helpful. Also this was the cheapest flight I could found for my travel."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Old plane did not make the grade,"We flew on February 1st from PHL to MIA and then on to BON.  Unfortunately, the 767 out of PHL was 30 years old and a sensor went bad that turned out not to be a problem after all but it delayed us enough that we missed the flight out of MIA to BON. The AA people in MIA were very accommodating and helped us get a flight the next day on Delta out of Atlanta but we still missed a full day of our vacation.  And the hotel they set us up in in Atlanta did not take the voucher they provided.  They ultimately gave us vouchers to use in the future but the experience overall was less than satisfying."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,AA comes through!,"I swore I would NEVER fly AA again after being totally messed up on a prior trip.  but I had vouchers enough to pay for an otherwise expensive ticket and I thought it was worth a chance.  Every flight took of on time, the staff were friendly and helpful, the seats were terrible, but all economy seats on any US carrier are!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,still average,"No better, no worse.  Flying these days just isn't what it used to be.  After going through waits in security clearance, the flight was ""full""; same cramped leg room; pay for checked luggage.  The rest rooms needed more thorough cleaning.  Hardly any passengers expressed delight on the journey."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,excellent service,The service was excellent in first class. We flew first class to minimize exposure to the Corona virus. We wore masks and used hand sanitizer.  The flight attendants were not provided masks or hand sanitizer and there was no screening of sick passengers at boarding. This should be corrected in the future in view of the epidemic and the lack of appropriate testing of contacts of infected persons.  Seniors should avoid flying at this time.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Very disappointing,Flown often with AA always been excellent.  But altho cant be helped..technical problem held us in the plane for 3 hrs with just a small cup of water.  Then we were taken off.  Told to Collect our baggage but at last min text message said new flight waiting but ran around looking for luggage eventually being told it was transferred.   We were late for this flight. The food was atrocious. Landed on way I think Phoenix but again held up on runway when landed for 30 mins... this made us v late for next flight.  Couldnt get food no time.  Next flight to San Diego was 4 and half hrs...no food on flight just horrible cold sandwiches.  So we travelled 30 hrs with no food.  Horrendous.  Going virgin next time
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"American Airlines doesn't care about your food allergies, not a bit","After several flight delays, missing a connecting flight, finally getting on a plane to my destination I was fried. Also hungry. According to AA's website, I could buy food on the plane...that is, if there'd been food I could have eaten. The flight attendant, when I inquired about a wheat free option (I'm very allergic to wheat) handed me a double serving of biscotti! I pointed out they were made with wheat flour: she replied, ""I'm not a chef."" Doesn't take a chef to know the content of what's being served; surely American can do SOME education of their flight attendants? And be sure to offer something somewhat nutritious: a small can of overpriced Pringles doesn't solve the problem."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Somewhat comfortable non stop flight,Enjoyed flight except for lack of space for legs and feet.  Even worse if person in front reclines!  Flight very crowded.  Overheads became full and folks had to check carry on luggage.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Graduation in San Diego,On-time and friendly staff. I recommend choosing seats just after the First class for extra legroom.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Good flight to Nashville,"I've always had a good experience flying with American Airlines. The flight crew was friendly and accommodating, and the flight was problem-free."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Flights,We had RCL get our tickets and got a great price for business class non stop to Barcelonia. It was an awesome flight. The seats and service were fantastic  we will be flying to Amsterdam next year and flying home from Barcelona. Will let you know how it went
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Worse than a sardine can,I fly infrequently but still cannot believe how uncomfortable flights are now due to the overcrowding of seats.  I believe I was on a 737 with 3 seats on each side in each row.  It was just awful.  The seats were uncomfortable and cramped and this goes beyond what should be a mandatory minimum of space for each passenger.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"full flight, decent service",flight fully booked.  despite that  service was ok.  for some strange reason a line of 20+ formed for the rest rooms an hour before landing (Costa Rican coffee?).
Date of travel: January 2020,20,What a disappointment...shame on American Airlines,"Flight was just Ok from Fort Myers to Dallas which was the first stop of the flight. Then I got on the second flight from Dallas to Bakersfield. What a nightmare.No water working on the flight so they could not make coffeeGave the worst breakfast ever..they should be ashamed. A big stale croissant with slices of hard boiled egg with cream cheese and spinach, served cold microwave I think was also broken.Lavatory water in sink was not working so they had hand wipes to use which I think they had run out before the flight endedFlight was so cold could not get my feet warm so uncomfortable for 3hrs.One flight attendant had wild long hair that was was sure had to fly onto somebody."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Finally, American has purchased some wide-bodied planes.  This business class is comfortable and private","Window seat is separated from other seats.  Could be improved by use of mattress, but was private.  Surprisingly, the food was good.  I was able to order in advance too."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Miami Trip,On time flight.  No crying children even though there were three babies on the flight.  We had a little bump ride for a few minutes but the flight crew made us feel comfortable and relaxed.  Flight landed safe and a few minutes early in Miami.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Sunday Flight,"Excellent flight, on time great service.  I flew into Dallas then transfered to another flight and landed in Savannah.  The service was very good at the counter, probably because it was a Sunday, and fewer people travel that day at 8am."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Perfect flights,"On time, good service, good planes. Clean, just missed having coffee available on the flight. Flights arrived early."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Returning from Madrid,"The flight was late leaving Madrid, because the entertainment system had failed.Many passengers left. I prefer to not have the entertainment systems because the flickering lights and distraction from other peoples videos. Service was excellent. The flight was smooth. We missed my connection, but I was automatically rebooked, and supplied with a hotel and meal. We were informed of what was happening, and I accepted it."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,NC trip,Both flights were on time and service was excellent.  A little dicey making  connection on outbound flight but made up for it by having return connection across the hallway.  nice flight attendants and although bumpy flights - weather was to blame and pilots tried to smooth things out.  Good prices and time slots.
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Disappointing,"Title says it all - overall, a disappointment. We did have a layover, and the second plane/ flight was MUCH better than the first (comfier seats, personal screens, more legroom). However, with both flights, I got the feeling that the flight attendants didn't care about coach, only first class. While yeah they do pay an arm & a leg to sit up front but coach/ economy also deserve respect and attention. They threw the pretzels at us so I wasn't surprised they were all broken. Flying is a miserable experience to begin with, and this airline made it worse. Will avoid in the future."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,You  will love the Airbus 330,"We paid to upgrade our basic seats to premium and selected row 10, the one behind the bulk head seats.  This plane is configured 2-4-2 with overhead bins down each side and a double row down the center.  We were in the two seats and it felt like first class.  The seats were leather and there was an entertainment screen in the headrest in front of us (bulkhead seats do not get this item) and we were able to watch first run movies at no charge; the earphones were provided at no charge.The upgraded seats came with beverage service and I, fortunately because they ran out, ordered a snack when I booked the seats.  The flight attendants were friendly and accommodating.  We had plenty of legroom, plenty of storage and the center armrest folded up as well.  Ok, the seats were coach sized but plenty large and very comfortable.  I have flown business/first class with AA previously and this experience was as good as any of those flights for half the cost.Check your aircraft.  If you are on an AB 330, I encourage you to spend a little or at the very least, carefully select your seats and enjoy the flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,American airlines uses older aircraft without monitors on seats,"American Airlines has the most non-stop flights in and out of Miami. However, their aircraft are pretty old and not equipped with monitors on the back of each seat. They rely instead on an in-flight entertainment system for your own display. That would be OK except that it does not function well. I brought my iPad along and could not get the movies to play on it despite having loaded the latest version of the AA app. I had a similar problem with my iPhone 7."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love to travel on American,Staff very gracious and helpful.  Had delay upon leaving and staff encouraging and acommodating. Seats comfortable. Carry on bags for free.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Lackluster flight,"I might as well learn to moo, since they treat passengers like cows.  Nine groups, to load, no food or beverage, the terminal was in such poor shape warning signs that floor was damaged."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,6 AM flight delay?  Almost missed my connector...,"First flight of the day (6AM) and it was 20 minutes late getting to Phoenix.  Because of the delay, the arrival gate was also changed (after one was located).  I originally would have 45 minutes to get from one A gate arriving to a nearby A gate for departure.  Instead, my arrival gate was B and was literally the furthest gate from my departing A gate.  Thank god for the people mover escalators.  I did not run but rapid walking through the four skywalks and I was the last to board my group 7 to Des Moines. How can there be a delay on the first departure of the day from the airport?"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Great mileage value,"Flights were comfortable! Nothing special though. I like direct tv on the plane and not on personal devices.  But great mileage value rt 27,000 miles first class,"
Date of travel: November 2019,20,TOO MANY TIME CHANGES,Everytime we fly American Airlines we schedule our flights around convienent times for us to fly and everytime we do this American comes back with time changes.We have had them change our flight by as many as 2-3 hours and it made it very inconvienent for us.I believe they are switching the times so thay can assure themselves of full flights with disregard to their passengers.I now avoid taking American flights because of this.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worst flight ever,"I left Daytona beach for a salisbury Maryland I had a two hour layover in Charlotte North Carolina which I did not make due to American airlines boarding the plane in Daytona been sitting on the runway for two And a half hours  Where is cause me to miss my flight from Charlotte to Salisbury Maryland. American Airlines shuttled me to a roach motel and shadowed me back and gave me a big $12 voucher to use in the airport which only bought a pretzel and a bottled water. I have no clothes or anything because my bag was checked in with all my tools and clothes because I was there for business. As a result, I miss two days of work and Maryland. I tried to speak to agents in Charlotte and Maryland nobody wanted to do anything."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great flight,"Great flight.  No complaints.  Food and service were good.  Made all of my connections.  Did have a issue with the onboard entertainment this flight, but I just listened to my music instead."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very conscious of cleanliness,Corona Virus scares were everywhee.  Staff took extra steps to prevent disease spread.  All were courteous to passengers.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,We Called it the Starvation Flight,"Based on a comparison of a recent flight on Delta with the same destinations this flight rated very poorly.  Staff and service were not nearly as efficient or friendly.  We were given a meal relatively soon after takeoff, then there was a very long gap, maybe 8 hours until we got a pizza slice before landing.  It seemed like the crew disappeared, and people were grumbling all around us about the lack of food.  The flight was reasonable enough, but I will happily spend more to get better service.  I won’t take a chance on American again."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Dallas business Trip,"Flight from Pittsburgh to Dallas started off bad.Brand new plane upgrade.Changed from a A 319 to a A321 NEO.Delayed at gate for over an hour because of a temp control for cabin.After boarding the plane it was very noticeable that it was pretty new.Crew was very accommodating and apologetic about the delay.Drinks quickly before departure.NEO engines were unbelievable quiet,huge plus with that.Captain came on and explained that the plane was only 20Hrs old and had a little issue the day before. Meals was handed out and flight was just fantastic.Received a 2000 mile bonus on account because of delay.Thank you American for making it right!"
Date of travel: September 2019,20,Flying with American airlines,"Flight attendants seemed to not enjoy their jobs. 9 hour flight with no indivual movies had to watch , from sights on center aisle. Dinn er consisted of a hot pocket."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,"Last row, and next to the toilet. It stinks.","This was a newer plane. We were in the last row, and right behind me were the toilets. So along with hearing flushing, it smelled. I wish people would flush it all before opening up the door to get out. For one thing, its quite loud, and it was an overnight flight, and for another thing it lets the stink out into the cabin. I can't be sure, but I feel like our seats didnt recline much either. There is no way this seat should have been charged the same as other seats, if anything it should be discounted dramatically. To top it off, I had my cell phone on the back seat support to watch a movie, and the passenger in front of me abruptly reclined, knocking my cell phone off, knocking my drink off, right into my lap. I had a soaked down lap for the rest of the trip. Reclining seats cause more issues than they are worth, so I would not built them in! Flight attends were too busy to bother with me. I got up, went into the service area, and used reams of paper towels to dab it up. So my flight was memorable, annoying, and aggravating, and I couldn't wait to get off. I hope that true customer service returns to the airline industry before I pass away. The ongoing hassles are really just way too much."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Better Safe Than Sorry,"There was terrible weather in Belize, so our flight was delayed by at least 30 minutes. The pilot kept us fully and regularly informed. I was still able to catch my connecting flight. I will always prefer to be safe than sorry. Thanks, AA."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,SAN-MIA flight,"great flight, I always enjoy flying with AA, because of the great way they stay in touch with their customers, honest way of doing business and the clarity of their service"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight,Great flight. The food was good and the service came with a smile which was nice. I would fly American Airlines again without a problem.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,AA did a great job !,"I flew from CAE to CLT, JAX and returned home safely with no delays and luggage arrived at both destinations with no problems!🤗 AA rocked it!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Comfortable,"Upgraded from econnomy and veey happy to have made the change.   More space, quieter with friendlky service"
Date of travel: March 2020,20,American Eagle Flight,"Late getting started. Seating area at terminal was tighter than normal--more of an airport problem than an airline problem.  Late getting airborne but pilot picked up time enroute so was not too late.  As usual, flights on American Eagle puddle jumper is not at all comfortable for any reasonably sized male. Try to avois Eagle flights but sometimes it is not possible."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,It's an o.k. Airline sometimes?,"These two flights (a stop in Dallas) were o.k.  The connection time was short but thankfully the gates were close to each other, which is not always the case in a large airport.   Weather was good and the flights were on time."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Not impressed,We booked for a quick 5 nights for a family funeral - as we needed to only take 2 suit cases for the 4 passengers 2 of us booked econony and 2 booked basic economy (just hand luggage and I had to make two separate bookings.  On our outward journey the staff at Heathrow were very helpful and booked the two basic economy seats in the next row to the seats pre booked on economy -. No such help at LAX unless we paid an extra $100 - we were told to ask at the desk at the departure gate but they would still only book the seats With extra payment .  When we boarded the plane the seat next toMy one son was empty so my husband moved Would it have been that difficult to do this beforehand without demanding $100
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Fantastic flight,Flew down for a cruise and the flight left on time and we arrived even a bit early. The attendants were extreamly friendly. I can't say anything bad about the flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Nothing outstanding,"Yes, I know we (3 family members) purchased the cheap seats. Boarding took forever. We had carry on bags but were informed the overhead bins were full (turns out several were either empty or filled in with coats that could have been removed if attendants had requested) and so our carryons needed to be checked (no charge). On return trip a 300+ lb person overflowed his aisle seat making life miserable for the middle seat person (my adult son).  If you had a connecting flight and were in basic economy plan on a slow exit from the plane and hope you have time to make your connection. Lastly, we were twice directed to the wrong bag carousel to pick up our ""carryons""."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Issues with equipment,We were delayed for over 2 hours due to a system issue with our airplane.  The maintenance crew was unable to resolve the issue and a new plane was ordered.  We had to change gates for the arriving plane.  Ended up at our desired destination to late to enjoy the evening on the town.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Trip Cancelled,"Flight to connecting flight delayed 10+ hours, then cancelled with no explanation. Weather was not involved, had to cancel entire trip."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,trip to Mexico,"space between seats is so minimal now that if person in front of you puts seat back, you can't move in your seat.  Other than the space issue, all else was good."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Terrible flight attendent,"On the final leg of my trip, the plane was less than 1/2 full.  In front of me was an empty exit row.  After takeoff while the attendents were serving complimentary drinks, I sat in the empty row.  The attendent who had already passed me by several rows, turned around to bring a drink to a passenges and noticed me in the seat.  She immediately came back and told me I was not allowed to sit there and when I suggested the row was empty and gave me room to stretch my legs she very rudely stated go back to your seat.  I complied.  About 5 minutes later, a robed, christian brother got up from his seat and sat in the row I had.  After about 20 min. the same attendent came back and spoke for a minute or two with him.  Then left and he stayed in the emergency row.  When she came past me several minutes later, I shrugged my hands and pointed to the monk.  She just gave me a dirty look and moved on.  First, if seats are empty in the same class and a customer would be more comfortable in one of them, I would think that the airline would be happy to accomodate as an effort to please a customer.  I assumed that the attendent did not have the ability to allow that to occur and so I did not complain.  However, when an attendent discriminates against one passenger and accomodates another that is simply not acceptable.  Finally, the rudeness exhibited by this attendent is never acceptable."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,American Airlines,"Good flight; relatively timely; typical Airbus seating comfort. As usual, very cordial flight crew. Captain communicated well."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Deep into the Amazon,"Lax to Miami was fine. Miami to Manaus was better. Good movies. Good service.  Not sure why, but the flights arrive after midnight.  And the return trip was at 2am. Which was very inconvenient."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,NY to Rome Round trip with stopover,the flight was very good both ways. Stopover in Madrid on the way to Rome and London on the way back. Premium Economy on the way over and First Class on the way back. Always have a great experience on AA.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Over TWO hours to speak to a live person! DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!,Checked in for my flight tomorrow. American Airlines gave my wife and I seats far apart from each other. WHY?  I checked in at the earliest possible time and you mean to tell me there are no other available seats next to each other? They have known about this reservation for months now and you would think they could set us together...BUT NOOOOOOO!I find it VERY hard to believe this is possible! Does American do this on purpose?DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Date of travel: January 2020,40,No complaints,"Great price ticket, although it was Basic Economy. Was sat towards the back of the plane, but the plane wasn't full, so did not have anyone on one side of me. Nothing significant about the flight good or bad. Would recommend for someone trying to save some money."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Average service,"The flight was on-time and service was average. My only issue is a general one. First class nowadays is about what coach use to be. Yes, you can have alcohol without charge and the seats are move comfortable. Otherwise, there is no extra courtesies extended and certainly no meal service. We were offered a drink and a bag of potato chips as a snack. I travel weekly on AA so get routinely upgraded but would never pay for a first class seat. Its just not worth it."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Terrible seating policy,"When booking basic economy there are certain rules, no checked luggage, no choosing seats. But, AA takes this one step further, seating people who are traveling together apart.  If you ask to be seated with your husband, they suggest you upgrade to paid seats. My recent flight illustrated this most egregiously.  My husband and I were in the same row, different sides of the aisle.  I was at the window, next to a couple.  He was actually seated between a couple on the other side of the aisle.  None of these people would move, and the crew was rushing to take off, so no assistance there. On the flight going down a nice attendant found us seats together and moved us."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Customer Service,American Airlines seems to have deteriorated in its customer service over the past few years.  The older planes on which I have traveled are often not carefully cleaned.  The rewards program has  been less and less worthwhile.  The business plan seems to be pile as many as you can into this metal tube.
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Flight from Miami,"My return flight on American was better than the fight to Miami (couldn't have gotten worse).  The flight was late taking off due to traffic, not the airlines fault.  The plane was much nicer than the one we flew down on.  BUT...the flight was ICE cold, everyone was freezing!!  But we got to Columbus almost on time..."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Mixed feelings,"We booked tickets with American for a vacation planned months in advance. Within a month of booking we received notification that the time of our original flight from an airport only an hour from us was being pushed out. Thus, we would miss our connecting flight at the next airport. Americans solution? Have us sit at the next airport for 20 hours waiting for the next flight. Being that we had already paid for accommodations at our vacation destination, this did not make us happy. After a lengthy phone call, it was determined that we could drive FOUR hours to a different airport to get a flight that would make it so we could catch our connecting flight. Additionally, as we did not pay extra to be able to choose our seats, we ended up sitting in the very last row up against the lavatory for three out of our four flights. The only upside to our experience with American is that all of the flight attendants were exceptionally friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Review of American Airines,We normally fly American Airlines on our return flight from Florida to Oklahoma after our cruises from Florida cities.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Just ok!,The airplane itself going to Miami was very spacious and nice! But flying back from Miami was a different story! Our flight was delayed on the way home for 5 hours for an issue with the plane. Very scary. And the plane was old and not nice with no room. Dfw parking was very confusing and the workers weren’t very helpful and the airport itself is huge and confusing. . It was a 1 time thing we definitely won’t be flying out of DFW again.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,So So flight,The AA flight we were on had NO screens either behind the seat nor in the cabin. You had to have a smart device w/WIFI to connect to their app. Seats were not so comfortable because they are narrow and they try to squeeze as many seats as they can into the plane. Our plane was a 3-3 configuration. Three rows of seats on each side of the aisle.Ground crew and Flight crew was amiable and effective.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good experience,Everything went smooth on this flight. The seats were kinda small but service was good. Staff was friendly.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Love American,"Everything went well until my last connection. Staff was attentive, friendly and had no issues. However on my last connection coming home there was a delay. I wasn't upset since it happens no matter what airline you take. This was my first delay with American airlines. There was a staff member at my connection in Charlotte when I did my return trip. She was beyond cranky . She was downright rude. I only had one question (was I at the right gate?) She acted like I had attacked her. Everything else was excellent!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Early Morning Flight,"Left hotel at 4 AM to get to airport for 6:30 AM flight.  Traffic was light for one hour drive.  Very few people at airport for check-in.  Had to use automated system before we could check baggage.  I had some trouble, but with help, got it figured out.  Security reasonable and efficient.  Had an hour before flight.  Boarding organized and there was bin space even though we were at end of line.  Equipment was Boeing 737 with 3X3 seating.  Cramped quarters, multi-language announcements, basic cabin service.  Flight uneventful.  Surprise landing as we were in cloud bank and suddenly on runway.  Took a long time to unload passengers through jetway.  After collecting bags, we had to go through security again.  Immigration slow but without hassle."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,A320 Business Class,"I have been on several AA business class flights on their A320 plane. Each business cabin was dated, worn and dirty. Maybe AA needs to invest some of their profits in refreshing these planes."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Worst customer service,This is the worst airline I hv ever used. The staff at airport seem to hate their job they are rude as can be. Flight are not on time and they act like they dont care about anything u have to say.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,American Flight from Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix,6:20 pm flight - Less than half full.  Plenty of room.  This plane is relatively new and still has decent room in the seats.  Quick and easy - A lot less crowded than earlier flights.  Be aware that the PVR airport is not the most comfortable place to wait for a flight.  2 1/2 hour flight but we arrived 20 minutes early.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Mexico flight,"Nothing wrong with the flight. Flight was so short that it didn't matter what seat you were in. Only negative is on the flight back did not get any drinks or snacks because the staff started to serve late, they dropped the ball on that one."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Not a dream flight,"We spent considerable extra money to fly business class only to find the service never came close to what was reasonably expected.  There was no greeting or offer for coffee or tea prior to flight and after take-off, the attendant spent the first 30 minutes on her cell phone, perhaps updating a social media account.  Finally, when specifically asked, a drink was forthcoming.  Realize and appreciate how nice it was to fly “up front” but after paying all the extra $, it be nice if American had upheld their end of the agreement!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nonstop reagan to Augusta,"AMAZING FLIGHT TIME.. no delays and on time!We left on time, and arrived earlyin both directionsThe staff were the best. and everyone was happy to be there."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,If you have to fly...,"This one stop flight was as good as it gets. Both flights took off on time, a minor miracle. The flight was pretty typical, unhealthy snacks and fairly uncomfortable seats, but that is the norm to which we have become accustomed.Flying has become a chore, there is nothing enjoyable about it, but American makes it much less onerous than, day, Frontier."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,On time and great in flight entertainment,"I was pleasantly surprised with how clean the airplane was, how nice an polite the flight attendants were and the availability of in flight entertainment - FREE! The Airlines App needs to be downloaded prior to the flight then you can watch relatively current movies and tv shows. These same movies cost $6 to $7 each to watch on Prime! and are free here."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Unexcusable delays,"When we left from Chicago, the departure gate was changed with very short notice. The time of departure was changed several times. Then once we boarded, we had to wait on the tarmac until a stewardess showed up for the flight. Because of that delay, we had to be de-iced again. When we landed in Grand Rapids, we were held on the tarmac almost a half hour before someone could wave the plane to the arrival gate. Then we needed to wait for the rampway to be hand-shoveled out so that we could attach to the plane. Both are operational issues caused by lack of personnel and lack of organization."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flights to Patagonia,"On our round trip flights to Patagonia - DCA to Buenos Aires; Santiago to DCA; all flights were on time, luggage handles correctly and fairle swiftly.  Service on board was very good.  Food - ok.  Coming back to USA after a long trip to Patagonia and leaving Santiago where recent riots had taken place - it was nive to be welcomed by American Airlines"
Date of travel: April 2019,10,Worst Customer Service Ever,"My mother passed away Oct 18th, 2018 and I needed to change my flight scheduled in November to be home for the funeral.  American agent on phone told me I would have to pay $1300 for my wife and I to travel one way and just give up my November ticket.  When I asked him if American had a bereavement program he said people die everyday and they are in the business to make a profit.  I escalated his statement all the way to the President of American Airlines as I was appalled by his comments.  I received a email saying that he would undergo further training.  In the end I received nothing and will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,New Year's Eve in Miami,Very convenient. All on time. On the way back I missed my flight because I totally forgot that I needed to be at the airport earlier for checked in luggage. Entirely my fault. My son and husband flew as scheduled. I stayed behind in Miami to catch the next flight with my luggage! AA was polite and helpful. It was entirely a stupid mistake on my side but they were kind about it! Thank you.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Premium Economy not much better,"AA advertises the benefits of Premium Economy on their web-site. We flew first from DFW to HNL on a 787 in P/E. We got headphones, a comfort bag and a snack-type meal,  and a very nice experience. From OGG to DFW, we got nothing but a blanket and pillow. We got the same snack meal as coach. Overall, was not worth the extra price.  Not sure why class of service is different on various Hawaii flights. However, flight was early, so shorter. Also, wasn’t canceled like the one 2 hours before us. I fly AA a lot internationally. P/E is Much better on those flights."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Normal,"Cramped, as usual. They should make people that weigh over300 lbs sit in 1st class! I hate their flab oozing over the armrest into my space."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,As Expected,"This was round trip to Spring Training. We also flew back on AA from Tampa to Philadelphia. The flight down was sold out, the flight back had a few empty seats. Both flights left on time and were as expected. No problems with times, in fact because of storms in the south we were delayed by ATC departing and the pilots made up most of the time."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Timeliness makes a difference,Having the confidence of a timely flight is one of my greatest concerns; recently I have experienced on time flights while using American Airlines.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Cramped, old, uncomfortable seats","Seats were more narrow and closer together than I am accustomed to. I mostly fly another airline but my preferred airline  doesn’t fly to Augusta. The time for flight change with major terminal changes in Dallas was extremely short and tight and I had to come from the back of the plane and wait for the everyone else to deplane. I ran very hard and barely made it. I was nervous and upset and the flight attendant had the gall to a tell me I had other options. No, I did not. I went online and picked what was shown to me. Besides I was upset. I did NOT need her smart mouth."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Super comfort,"The choice of premium economy was the best I’ve made, especially given that the cost was not much greater than that of economy. The large seats were exceptionally comfortable with plenty of legroom. Comfort was enhanced by the provision of a substantial pillow and blanket together with a complimentary pouch containing travel toothbrush and toothpaste, long socks, eye mask, ear plugs, lip balm and moisturiser. The food was also excellent and plentiful. Flight attendants were attentive, polite and courteous. Will definitely travel this class again."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Flight to Miami,The flight was scheduled on time.  After deicing the pilot announced they would be going back to the terminal as something was wrong with the instruments.  We sat there and then deplaned.  After almost three hours we re-boarded.  The plane needed attention badly as the interior was in need of repair.  Into the flight the attendant closed the one toilet as it would not work.  The flight was full.  We got to Miami but it was the WORST flight I have veer been on and I fly a lot.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Lucky this time,With American Airlines you never know. It can be an OK flight or a disaster. RARELY you get an overall good flight. I was lucky this time.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Always enjoy our flight from New Orleans to Cancun,Always enjoy our flight from New Orleans to Cancun.  There are a number of options as to what time you can depart / arrive in both destinations.  The first class fare is reasonable and allows for (2) free checked bags
Date of travel: February 2020,10,1st and LAST TIME for American Airlines,"Worst flight EVER. Plane was delayed 2 1/2 Hours for some problem with oxygen mask in the cockpit! I can understand why it had to be checked on, but why did it take so long!! We were in the exit row (which we paid extra for), seated on the plane while the repair was taking place. Then, they had to take all the luggage out to fix the problem in the cargo hold. Next, they put all the luggage back BEFORE RECHECKING the problem. Then they ended up Switching planes (again more of a wait)! We ended up losing an entire day of our vacation by the time the flight arrived and we got to our hotel!! If they would have checked the plane and been more proactive and if they rechecked after the original repair, the flight would have arrived on time!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great service,Flying first class is a trip in itself!  Flights were on time amazingly and service was great. Part of our party was back in economy and they had a good trip too.  One of the few airlines to fly to STT from the Midwest so not much choice but usually uneventful
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flew south out of cold,I had the pleasure of flying on American to get to my cruise vacation. The crew was friendly and attentive. And having free WiFi allowed me to check emails and stay entertained. Time flew so to speak!
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Asked to change to an over booked flight,There was bad weather predicted and I received notification that I was able to change my flight due to this. I changed it to leave earlier than originally booked. When I arrived at the airport I was informed that there were now weight restrictions and that I may not be able to fly. I waited and waited and at the end they did have room for everyone. I was then concerned about the validity of the weight restriction.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very Good as expected,The flight left on time and arrived on time.  The service was very good and the flight attendants were professions and kind.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Our winter vacation,"It's not easy flying from a small town,but that's not American's problem. We met all of our connections with ease. Everyone of American's employees were very helpful. I was in a wheelchair."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,New York Weekend,I was fortunate to be upgraded to First Class on my flight back home.  I found the service to be excellent.  I was so relaxed when I got home.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Don’t buy !!,"if I could give this 0 stars I would , do yourself a favor and use your money on another airline the last time I booked they cancled the flight and had me stranded for more than 8 hours I’m militsry in the army I got into alot of trouble and they only offered me 100 dollars I tried to tell them what happen to me and the bs they put me through and they was still stuck on only offering 100 towards the next flight we can only take leave when they tell us so I’m just now today able to go on leave again I came 2 hours before my flight I was waiting in line I’m not sure if these people are new or what but by the time I talked to them they said I was 2 mins late and couldn’t check me in until later and mostly because of my fire arm I’m like I been here 2 hours before you guys been playing around converting all day to god no matter what this airline is not worth it!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Better this trip,"I was somewhat forced to fly American for this business trip due to which airlines fly into Charlotte. It is not in my top choices for airlines. However, this flight was very good. The plane was very clean, the seat comfortable, the flight team seemed happier than other flights and everything went smoothly from gate to gate. Pleased I can give them a good review."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Worst airline ever,I will NEVER fly AA ever again. At the Tampa airport the agent charged my card three times when I was paying to change seats and when all was said and done she told me the seat wasnt available anymore. When I was waiting by the gate I checked my friends online app and was able to get the seat the agent told me was not available. Delta and Sun Country is the way to go from now on!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent customer service,A huge thank you to staff who rearranged our flight after our cruise was cancelled after the poor treatment the day before it was great how they helped and got us on a flight straight away.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Planes Lack Video Screens. NOT PLANNING TO FLY AA AGAIN,"My flight was OK. The thing that I was VERY DISAPPOINTED was that none of my flights had seat back video monitor...NONE. I was quite shocked to see that compared to most Delta Airlines planes. I did not like the 9 LOADING ZONES used for load their planes. That is the most that I have ever seen. MY RATING: 5/10I have not flown American Air for some years due the loyalty perks with Delta I've earned. My cruise company booked this flight for me. My first impression was both my flights were A321 Airbus aircraft rather than a USA made Boeing aircraft. AA was a long term buyer of USA Made McDonald Douglas jets (now Boeing), sadly they are like many other airlines who do not support American aircraft manufacturing anymore. Very sad to see."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Flight attendant makes the difference,"I flew many times with American Airline and majority of the time I flew Business or First Class.  So I sort of knew what kind of service I will get.  I also had flown other major airlines and American Airline Business Class in general is about average performance I don't recall any unfavorable experiences.  What I experienced with AA Flight 700 from SFO-PHL on March 7th 2020 absolutely deserved recognition, my  Flight attendant Suzy made the difference.She showed warmth, customer service with focus on solution.  After entering I first switched seat with a fellow passenger in order to be seated in the center aisle with my husband.  A while later Suzy came to take the food choice and she apologized for only one choice left , which is oatmeal.  Suzy saw my hesitation, quickly said she will try to see what she can do, she eventually found a ham and egg tray with a lot of fruits.  After I finished the meal I decided to lay flat for a while and realized the seat would not move or  recline.  She came to apologize and offered me some miles compensation without me asking for it.  My experience with Suzy was a good direct  comparison with my husband's flight attendant who serve the other side of aisle.  The difference was night and day.  My husband was also offered an oatmeal breakfast, but it was coldly announced to him without much of explanation.  Besides serving the breakfast not much of other interaction during the 5 hours flight.  In contrast Suzy walked the aisle  to fill my hot water many times, very attentive.  Suzy say thank you to all her passengers 10 minutes before landing and appreciated us flying AA.  Suzy needs to be recognized for her great service."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Quick Flight & Great Price,"We finally committed to a family trip to London, and first time across the Atlantic. Booking back in October for a March flight we were able to get 4 round trip tickets with seat assignments for under $1,700. 1 checked bag each is included for Trans Atlantic travel. We left JFK on Friday morning and Terminal 8 was very empty, check in was a breeze, no line at security. There wasn't even a line at STARBUCKS!!!! we arrived about 2 hours early but could have easily done an hour prior with how quick it was. We got some breakfast at McDonald's. It would gave been nice to grace a Priority Pass Lounge option in Terminal 8. They started boarding at 9:30am for our 10:20 flight which was probably 90% full in economy. We had seats 33A-D which seemed about the same as every other economy seat. Pillow and blanket at every seat, seat back entertainment, and standard economy leg room. Seats felt a little more comfortable than a domestic seat. Winds were in our favor so flight time was only 5:45. Within the first hour of flight they were already out serving the first drink and meal. Beer and wine is complimentary in economy. Meal choice was a chicken, couscous, and veggie entree, or a vegetarian noodle dish. Either served with a cup of salad, roll with butter, cracker with cheese, packaged brownie and small bottle of water. I would have preferred the meal come closer to mid flight as we just had breakfast in the terminal. Meal and cleanup was done by probably 1:30 into the flight. Free entertainment helped the short flight go even quicker. Another drink service came by, and about an hour before landing another small pre made pizza wrap in a box came by. This felt fairly processed and cheap but it's an option if you need to eat before the flight is over. Honestly to me it felt like too much on a 5:45 flight. That's the same length as many Transcons where you only get a snack and 2 drinks. I thin one meal mid flight would have been enough. We got in early to Heathrow, border control was empty. I wasn't able to use the e-gates with small children but we went straight to an agent with no wait. Bags were already on the carousel when we got to it."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,On time,Flights were on time despite some hiccups; check-in and boarding was smooth and fast; service was ok;
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Service was sub-par, especially for First Class","Flight Attendants were not any more attentive than in Coach!  Two-plus hour flight, purchased First Class Tickets and the Flight Attendants can't even ask if you need anything else.    American Customer Service continues it's downward spiral."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Flight was on-time going both ways to and from Chicago to Ft. Meyers, FL","Flight was on-time going both ways to and from Chicago to Ft. Meyers, FL.  Staff was friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Reasonable service, food, waiting times",Acceptable service in counter and during the flight. Food has good taste and conservation.Entertainment is not convenient compared with other companies (screen on the seat and not using the customer device with limited free wifi)
Date of travel: January 2020,10,"RUDE gate agents!! Extremely POOR customer service. Poor value for money spent. 
Avoid this airline!!","RUDE gate agents!! Extremely POOR customer service. Poor value for money spent. Will avoid this airline at any cost.Compared to Delta, this is absolutely the pits. I fly Delta all the time and was quite appalled at American airlines. I wonder if they do not want to stay in business at all. I highly recommend Delta Airlines. Yes while it may be a tad bit more pricey,the experience is completely WORTH it."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Better then expected,"I was happily surprised by the cleanliness, comfort, room and entertainment options on this flight. This was the first of 2 flights. Although the flight was full we were comfortable."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,West coast trip,Flight was on time and flight attendants were very friendly. The pilot was very attendant to keeping us informed on the air bumps we experienced.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Average - Nothing Extraordinary,"I had no major issues with my American Airlines flight, so I guess it was okay. The flight was on time, check-in was fast and easy, and no problems with checked luggage. Boarding could have been better, but it is still faster than Delta. There was nothing special or extraordinary with American. The plane looked old and there was no entertainment device on the seats. Even the service was just average. They also need better food options on their menu. There are not a lot of options for purchase, especially if you have dietary restrictions. Leg rooms is basically non-existent even if you upgrade to premium economy."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great airline,I like this airline. The seats are comfortable with enough leg room. The flight was on time with no delays. The flight attendants were helpful and the pilot did a great job of keeping passengers informed. I barely felt the landing when arriving.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,A great normal flight,This was a great normal flight from Orlando to Chicago.  Sunday is a busy day in Orlando.  The airline check in was less time than expected even with two bags to check.  The TSA Precheck line was quick and efficient.  Flight was exactly on time and very good with no wait on the tarmac in Chicago.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Will never Fly American Airlines again,"If I had known that basic economy meant you are still living in slavery times I would not have booked it ,was the worst trip I’ve ever had (other than the nice lady at the front counter who was fantastic)seats are jammed together,could not even find space to put my small dufflebag in a compartment,because all the people that board before you with like 3 carry on that are the size of my checked bag(that they charged an xtra 40 dollars for,ITS  MIRACLE or (AMERICAN)this company is still in business,,JET BLUE from her on in"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Service,"Traveling with an anxious flyer is not very difficult,  American Airlines made the trip even easier.  On our return trip, the plane was switched, thus changing our prepaid seats.  the Gate attendant fixed the seating as soon as she was aware of two points.  1- we paid for specific seats and 2 - I had real concerns about my partners ability to relax on the flight.  american came thru for us."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Bad treatment at check in,"Treated very bad at checkin: wanted 30$ extra, because they did not accept two small bags tightly bundled together despite being clearly below size and weight limits. Then made an issue with a 2 pound overweight bag and ask us to reshuffle unto 30 pound underweight bag."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Cancun trip,"Our flight was an hour late, then we had a longer trip than usual because of the plane. Having to do with flying over water. Also, we upgraded, and we paid with our AA card, but we didnt get to board early. We were group 5. We asked about it, and a gut that worked at the airport said group 5 is now actually group 1. But we still had to wait for almost everyone to board. The attendants were very nice. But just expected a little better service. Think I will stick with spirit from now on"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,in flight entertainment!!!!!,Awesome flight!  Really enjoyed the Pilot that said the announcements in different voices! it made the announcements worth listening too.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"On schedule, clean, newer aircraft","As an AAdvantage member, upgrades were awarded for both of us on both return flights. Orderly boarding process on all four flights, very comfortable seating, professional/courteous service (regardless of class), and on-time departures!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Great Planes - Poor Service,"We were on a very new plane. Business Class is very comfortable with everyone having an aisle seat. This was the first of 4 flights with AA over the three weeks. Their short haul service was not really any better.Service is pretty mediocre. Pre-flight drinks consisted of a tray of plastic cups with water or juice. Given that the flight was at lunchtime a glass of fizz would have been nice.A speedy drinks round was swiftly followed by the lunch service. The appetiser of a roasted tomato tart was frankly inedible, the single cherry tomato on the top had been nowhere near an oven, the pastry and cheese base was cold and unappetising.  When I asked if it should have been heated was told that it came with no instructions and ours was not the first complaint. Entree fared no better with a lump of chewy inedible steak. For dessert selected the cheese course, the well intentioned crew member doubled up think she was doing me a favour, as I’d eaten virtually nothing at this stage. As you can see from the picture this was not exactly appealing in either presentation or taste. Cheese should have been allowed to breathe and acclimatise instead it was served straight from the chiller rock hard and the underripe. Coffee no options, no cappuccino or espresso just a huge mug of filter. The snacks were not put out for a couple more hours as I assumed they were worried they would run out given the length of the flight. A few plates of sandwiches under cling film, crisps and chocolates. By comparison BA’s Club Kitchen wins hands down. The second meal service fared no better with a lack lustre pasta dish.The crew hardly showed their faces throughout the flight, food was pitiful so all in from the initial impression when you board American airlines needs to invest in some new crew to match their new fleet."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Connecting flight left early,My connecting flight from Charlotte NC to Flint MI left 5 minutes early causing me to miss my flight! They were a huge back up in customs as well as check in and I literally ran from Concourse a to Concourse E to get there in time! My flight left at 8:05 PM and they said boarding would end 10 minutes before that at 7:55 PM. I got there at 7:54 PM by my cell phone and if it was closed and they would not let me board! My American Airlines app updated minutes later to say the flight scheduled for 8:05 PM left at 8 PM! They agreed to pay for my flight the next day but would not pay for a hotel. If they had left on time I would have made this flight and I believe they should pay for it. For this I am missing work for a day and having to get a hotel and just not getting home when I should have! So aggravating.  Stuff happens but when they make a mistake they should be responsible and pay for my out-of-pocket expenses. I’m not asking for them to pay for missed wages. Just the hotel and flight.  Why leave early anyway??? Ridiculous!
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service,I would not recommend flying with American. Their customer service is horrible. I cant explain the whole situation here but I felt so mistreated I had to write a review somewhere. Save your money and fly with someone like Southwest who actually care about their customers.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great experience,"Excellent service! My flight attendant 's name was Lucy Fang. She loves her job, and her smile was infectious after a long day."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Not the days of yesteryear,"I've definitely had better experiences.The small bag of peanuts were expired and the soda was non-existent.legroom was nil, and the flight attendants and staff were very rude."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,American Airlines did a great job,"The people that worked the flight were awesome, made our girls at ease and pilot did a great job!  Wonderful flight and service."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Funeral,"I’ve been wanting to get this off my chest for a while. I hate American Airlines, and here’s why. My grandmother recently passed away unexpectedly. I needed to book a flight last minute, and as you can imagine...a last minute flight was outrageously expensive. I decided instead to use air miles with a $75 copay each way. The day my flight was to depart...there were icing conditions. American canceled flights for two days. Sadly, I missed my grandmothers funeral. A couple days later I saw charges on my credit card for the mileage copay. I thought...surely this is an oversight. I called American and was informed that weather conditions were considered an “act of God” and therefore nonrefundable. I just about lost it. Still reeling from my grandmother passing, I pleaded with the agent...hoping for compassion and understanding. What I received was typical jargon. After a lengthy “debate” the agent agreed to refund the charges if I could provide a death certificate and proof of relation. UNBELIEVABLE! I was not going to burden my mother with obtaining a death certificate. I offered to provide an obituary and funeral program. Begrudgingly, the agent agreed. I was not refunded until AA received the “proof”. I will never forget nor forgive American’s lack of professionalism and propriety."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Easy trip to Havana from Miami,Excellent flight and AA helped us secure visa at Miami international airport. Also the flight was short and pleasant plus I was impressed with the crew. They were particularly helpful for many senior passengers returning to Cuba for the first time.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Not able to cancel my flight,"I had a job interview come up that would have interfered with my travel plans and was unable to take a flight. There's no way to cancel a flight online, I called and was unable to cancel the flight over the phone. They told me to contact the flight insurance company, submit an appeal, and then call back. Even then it's not a guarantee that I'll get my money back. This was after 2 hours of being on hold. You'd think it would be easier to cancel flights during a GLOBAL PANDEMIC, but no."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Phoenix help,"My husband needs wheelchair assistance when traveling. The staff at Phoenix when we checked in were excellent. When I mentioned that my husband needed a wheelchair to the agent helping us at the check-in, in no time the wheelchair was there and continued with us thru check-In and security."

Date of travel: February 2020,50,A great trip to Paris,We had a great flight both directions.  Food was good and an ok selection of movies.  Lie flat seats are worth the upgrade points--you hit the ground running.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Never on Schedule,"We travel to Lynchburg on a very regular basis because our daughter attends college there.  We have  flown there around 12 times, and have probably only arrived on time twice.  The flight out of Charlotte is always late, rescheduled or cancelled.  Sometimes weather but usually mechanical. Wish there were other airline options."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Nice job, AA!","Despite the fact that this was a jam-packed flight, the ground crew did a nice job of boarding it quickly, we departed on time and arrived early. The flight attendants were  very friendly and seemed to enjoy their jobs."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great flight,"First AA trip, it was good, very relaxed, great service from the crew, good seats which we had booked and paid extra for.  Best airline food we have had in years and w3 have had plenty, or refused  plenty.  Good beverage service too, inflight entertainment was ok, but I personally just watch the map!."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"Airport chaos, airline useless","Grand Cayman has recently finished enlarging Owen Roberts Airport. Instead of using this new facility appropriately, they allow airlines to way, way overbook flights. On our way into the airport two weeks ago, our plane had to circle a half hour, then wait on the tarmac another half hour, we then spent 1 1/2 hours getting through immigration, and another hour to pick up our rental car.Our American Airlines flight out, however, was a complete nightmare. The airport again having way too many flights booked for it to physically handle, our 4 pm departure, which we had been told was out of gate 6, then gate 9, and finally gate 8, was delayed to 6 pm. This meant we, and everyone else on the flight, would miss our connections in Charlotte. I joined the queue of passengers asking for assistance in rebooking, and although I began as the 6th in line, other passengers were brought over and integrated into our queue, which resulted in my standing in the line for 2 hours. The couple in line ahead of me were given some different flight possibilities and were promised a voucher for an overnight stay. When it was my turn, I received about 1/3 of the American Airlines employee’s attention as she also spoke on the phone and to a passenger who had been helped several passengers before me, but returned with more questions. I was brushed off with, this is still your flight to Charlotte, you will get a different connecting flight tomorrow, no, you will NOT get meal or overnight vouchers.Shortly after this, the departure time on the board changed to 8:45 pm. Then at 6pm, it was announced that the flight was boarding, but would be stopping in Miami to change the crew and then fly  to Charlotte.Once we departed at 6:30, we were told that when our aircraft was arriving at Owen Roberts, there was too much air traffic so the pilot was instructed to circle, which he did for two hours and then flew to Jamaica because he needed to refuel. We were stopping in Miami to go through customs and immigration because we could not get to Charlotte before they closed for the night. Our trip through Miami was very confusing and poorly organized. We went though immigration and customs, picked up our checked luggage, pushed it down the hall and dropped it onto conveyor belts then went through TSA again. Once we were back onboard, we were told we would have to wait for refueling before we could depart. Then we had to wait for some “missing” passengers who were not on the flight because they had arranged for different connectors from Miami.We finally arrived at Charlotte at 11:30 pm. We found the baggage carousel but not our luggage. We were told by an airport worker to “just wait”. When I inquired at the American Airlines luggage counter, I was told to wait another 15 minutes and then check back; at which time there was a long queue. This time, my baggage number was actually checked to the computer and I was told the luggage was in Miami, scheduled to fly to DC and then Portland and that I should file a lost baggage claim when I arrived at Portland Maine. By the time we got to a hotel, it was 2am.We received an email with a flight for 7:49 am Sunday.  We got 3 hours sleep and headed back to the airport.Once we got to Portland, we did file a bag claim, and were told that one bag had somehow gotten onto our flight that morning so had arrived with us but the other one had just left Miami. This employee made arrangements to deliver the luggage to our home and also asked if we needed any toiletries. That would have been very welcomed that night before, but no one offered that kind of help in Charlotte.We had a lovely vacation, but now have returned home exhausted and feeling like herded cattle.Enough of my nightmare: my advise, do not fly into or out of Grand Cayman on a Saturday. Do not expect to be treated well by American Airlines. You might do better flying midweek with Cayman Air, because the Caymanians take care of their own.You might do best with another airline and another island."

Date of travel: March 2020,10,This is a handicapped with service dog review,"I had purchased two tickets from Jax- MLM 6 months prior to trip.  Other party traveling had to cancel.   Even tho not required to let airlines know, I advised them of having a service dog because I am deaf and requested a bulkhead seat.  I have travelled previously to Mexico, Honduras and Nicaragua without incident. This was different as my 53# lab was so cramped that my feet had to rest against the bulkhead wall or ON TOP of his body.  I objected and asked for a CRO.  Her solution was to get another flight but she had no idea what day or when that could be accomplished.  Oh  yes that sounds like a wonderful idea!  The man sitting next to me did not want my dog to lay his head on his feet and CRO told me I would have to leave and get another flight.  I asked to upgrade to first class but was told there were no seats.  Finally the passenger in aisle seat agreed to sit in middle seat and the guy who didn’t want my dog to rest in his space moved to the aisle seat. I really wasn’t upset with him...he has a right to have his space.  I was humiliated and so upset with this handling of a situation.  The airlines suggested that I should book 2 seats next time.   Wonderful idea for someone with limited assets....hey why not leave a seat empty when a elderly disabled passenger who has advised you that she requires the use of a “real” service dog, (and has utilized your airlines with this same animal on previous trips without incident) plans this trip 6 months in advance?  Duh?  Shame on American Airlines!!!  And the CRO...hope no one in her family ever develops a disability and needs her “help”."

Date of travel: March 2020,10,Horrible customer service,"I just spoke to an American Airlines representative regarding an existing flight. I explained my concern with the corona virus outbreak and was hoping to change my flight from Phoenix to Newark, instead of Phoenix to JFK in an effort to avoid public transportation. We live in New Jersey. I was informed that American Airlines is still charging a $200 flight change fee per passenger and that because there are no corona advisories in the area, American is not accommodating  related changes. The customer service representative also hung up on me. 10/10 will not fly American ever again."

After being on hold for half an hour the representative still deducted $200 instead of giving me a full refund. Very poor customer service and irresponsible people.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Comfortable flight arrived early,"Scheduled for just under 3hrs but landed 50mins early.  Comfortable flight,  cabin attendants served free drinks,  and a second drink was no problem.  Plane a little dated by was comfortable for this short flight.   Online check in easy.  Only worrying part was not able to prepay bags in the hold until you check in."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,wedding weekend,"Left Columbus to take connecting flight to Destin, Florida, Had delay for over a hour , no working defibulator on plane, pilot 1st advised us it would only be a short delay, in fact after boarding we had to get off plane & re-board later. Leaving Destin, took flight to Dallas & again had a delay this time t he overhead mask were not labeled properly?? Worst experience we ever had!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Good flight, but it was late","Flight was good.  When we checked in, I asked to be moved up if possible, and the staff member did so which was good since the flight was late getting into DFW.  Flight attendents were pleasant and accommodating.  A light meal was served with wine."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Crew doesn’t care,"When leaving Chattanooga American forces you to take a connecting flight through Charlotte. We arrived at 7:15 on the runway to be told we were waiting for our gate. For the next 40 minutes the crew did nothing to communicate or try to help customers with connecting flights, ignoring questions and comments from customers. Our connecting flight was boarding at 7:30 and leaving at 8. At 7:55 as customers got frustrated because we still had not moved, the crew informed us we would not be making our connecting flight and our problem to figure out with customer service later. They offered nothing to compensate or help. Mistakes happen, but employees not caring about their customers is not an accident. Pathetic attempt and I encourage customers to look elsewhere."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Seats are smaller, traveler's are more demanding, and can't understand how flight attendents can remain friendly","We fly every January to a warm location for our anniversary. We have done this for over 20 years and have found American to be the easiest to book, average room, and friendlier flight attendents. We fly other times of the year that are not international flights and the same holds true.Husband is 6'5"" and prefers not having the seat in front of him in his lap when they recline. If we have a short flight (MDT to PHL) we both get a seat in the aisle. On flights to Jamaica or longer flights we book exit seats that share space with the flight attendent. They cost a bit more, not as much as First Class, and give us the leg room he needs. We've had some wonderful conversations with the flight attendents when they sit for the end of the trip. Our theory is, we prefer AA because they fly where we want to go, the seats are no smaller than other airlines, and we know where we will be sitting not having to behave like cattle. We put a little more away these days for our trips to insure we get the extra leg room. It's worth it to us as leisure travelers and understand business travelers may not have this option.Overall, those flying are considerate and mind their own business. It's unfortunate the few that have had too much to drink, feel they are entitled, or are just jerks make flight miserable. I do believe this is not common and appreciate the flight attendents handling situations professionally."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great!!!  Thanks to Shema!!!,"My flight from O’hare to Columbus was First Class.  The flight number was 4059.  Our First Class flight attendant was GREAT!!  Her name was Shema.   She had an omnipresent smile and was really nice!!!  She really seems to enjoy her job and she made the flight super-nice!!!  Thanks Shema for a great experience!!!!   The flight has gone great, nice drinks and pretty soon Shema will be bringing around some snacks!!!   Shema is one great reason I continue to remain an “EP” with American Airlines!!!!  Again, her smile is infectious and that means so much to constant travelers to experience that beacon of “Niceness”!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Nice Coach flight,My flight from Lansing to O’hare was not First Class.  The flight went fine!!  I had the exit row seat by myself which I consider the best seat on a non-First Class flight.  Our attendant was OK and things went just fine.  I wish they had more First Class flights to Lansing from O’hare!!!
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Economy equals economy,Have had much better long haul flights with AA. This was nothing special. Luckily I can just about sleep on these flights . Food was ok. Hospitality ok.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Family return trip,Our flight attendant was fantastic!  She was very attentive to our young daughters and a pleasure to be around.  The flight was smooth and we arrived early.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Where’d All the Room Go?,"On our trip to Antigua, my husband and I noticed how small the seats and leg room are. Thank god our trip was a bit less than 4 hours because we have never been so uncomfortable on a plane. The service was great and being able to sign up online to watch all the entertainment was cool. Other than being cramped the experience was ok."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight,"Last minute booking at the Havana airport, first leg to Miami and at the airport AA staff changed my ticket to get me into Toronto the fastest route possible."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Second American Delay This Week,"Literally flew with American Airlines a week ago, and they were delayed to the point that I missed my connecting flight, and now here I sit again on a delayed american flight with a good chance at missing my connecting flight. One time I can be forgiving and say ""it happens"" but twice in the same week going to different places I sit on a delayed american flight, I can say with utmost certainty I will not be flying American again. This is ridiculous. Not blaming the pilots or stewardess' they are fantastic, but american needs to get its plane maintenance together or hire more maintainers. Ridiculous."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Emergency flight home for severe family member,Last minute choice for emergency due to severe illness of a family member. Booking reservations went very well. Plane was clean and flight was quite nice Staff was very professional and very helpful. Will definitely do again.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good flights,"Had a great flight from Omaha to LAX. however after landing in LAX spent an HOUR on the tarmac waiting for a vacant gate.  Was not pleased. Shouldve been given some  sort of compensation for this time.  The flight next AM to Lihue uneventful.  We did want a mimosa on the flight to start our vacation, and no champagne on board (a very small disappointment)! Otherwise, a decent experience with American!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Never Again,If I could give this airline zero stars I would. I have traveled a great deal and never had such a poor experience with an airline service. I cannot explain in words how disappointing it is to spend any amount of money on the service received.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Poor Customer Service,American Airlines has the worst customer service. This was readily apparent through our interactions with multiple employees. I will not be flying with them again.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight!,This flight was great! It was smooth and we got there fast. The stewardesses were fast and efficient with snacks and drinks.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Rough,"This flight was my worst flight I have had. It was rough and there was constant dropping and shaking. I have a strong stomach but was super nauseated once we touched down in Charlotte. There was winter weather in Charlotte so this is not the airlines fault, by any means."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Not my best flight,"American Airlines is supposed to be one of the higher class airlines. We payed extra to fly with them to Haiti because the other option was spirit and no!!! Honestly we should have saved our money. We travel a lot, and I’ve never been on an international flight that does not feed you. They give you a complimentary drink. There are no TVs and the seats are just as cramped as any other cheaper airline. On the plus side we did get to check our carry on for free."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Last Minute Gate Change ...,"Flights full, and I always pay extra to secure an aisle seat.  I purchased ticket two weeks in advance and I'm still in the very back of the airplane.  Flight was uneventful, and that's a good thing!  A last minute gate change from DFW, which I learned from family who travel from that airport often, is a regular occurrence."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent service,Excellent and personal service. With only 8 people in this class the food and attendants were super.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,nice trip,My flight from O’Hare to Lansing was # 3534.  I flew coach due to the fact there was NO first class on this plane.  Our attendant did a great job and I had a nice seat (A exit row)!!!  Plenty of room for a coach flight.  The flight was slow getting off but we ended up in Lansing early!!!!  Great job!!!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,another good flight,My flight from Columbus to O’Hare was # 3409.  I flew First Class and the flight went very well.  Our attendant was very good and the coffee and snacks just hit the spot.  We got into O’Hare early but had to wait about 15 minutes for our gate to clear out.  Good flight again!!!
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"Schedule Change, Long Layover, Good Flight","We booked our Indianapolis to Buenos Aires flight well in advance with a 3-hr layover in Miami; however, the Miami departure for Buenos Aires was shifted giving us an almost 5-hour layover in Miami.The Indy flight for Miami was on time.  We were fed twice on the overnight flight from Miami to Buenos Aires.  We were in the exit row for both flights, which offered welcomed extra leg room for my 6’4” body.  It also put us across from the flight attendant’s jump seat.  She was a delight and gave us some great suggestions for our time in Buenos Aires.   I do not like flying American because of the way they treated their employees during past financial difficulties; however, despite the long layover, everything went as planned."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,This was a great flight. It was on time which is not always the case. The time before I was texted 10 times with time and gate changes
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Short and sweet,"Great, short flight...so short no service but did the trick.  Found out we could have taken a fast ferry for about half the price of airfare.  Return from Freeport was not without issue...not really an airline problem but there were no sanitary facilities in the airport and the makeshift portajohns, which were functional when we arrived at the airport were out of commission an hour before our flight.  It was sure to become worse as the day wore on.  The airport had just opened to flights a few days before we arrived...it seemed that they may not have really been ready."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Ms,"In Puerto Platte I was asked to have my bags checked by security.  Before security came to show me where I needed to be they called boarding for my flight. Needless to say I was worried but the young lady who was escorting me down told me it would be ok. The men in security was very nice and quick. I ran most of the way back and the flight attendants check passengers in were awesome.  They said they would not close the doors without me. I almost cried, they deserve a standing ovation.  Great costumer service!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Lax to Sydney,"Flew American flight non stop from Lax to Sydney, Australia. Very nice flight, albeit long due to distance. We upgraded from basic economy due to the length of the flight and my spouse needs extra leg room. The Premium economy was fantastic. The service was wonderful. Food was especially good! Thank you American Airlines crew for a great trip to and from LAX to Sydney!"
Date of travel: July 2019,40,American Airlines - My Airline of Choice,"I fly American Airlines pretty exclusively and I am pleased with their airline for the most part. Of course, we can get frustrated with delays in travel, but I feel like they have done a good job for the passengers. I fly AA exclusively out of convenience because they fly out of MHK (Manhattan, KS) and because of it such a small regional airport, it is SO EASY (aka hit the EASY button!) to get out of and back home quickly. I love getting back HOME TO MY FAMILY asap!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Horrible Customer service,"Basically for all of us who travel more than 50 times a year, this is for you.   All US based airlines lack true customer retention services.  2 hour delay - severe lack of updates, now just sitting next to gate for last 35 with 0 updates from captain.   Hey- same thing happens at delta and United. Just a snapshot at the horrible state of flying in USABTW- I am a premium platinum member. And this is flight 4714 on the 6th of March"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always a good flight,We like American Airlines. Everything is included in the price and we usually get a package deal with hotel and rental car. Never any issues and always pleasant service.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Declining,"We've flown four times on American since the beginning of this year. I thought it was just my perception that the planes seemed to have less maintenance. When traveling on other airlines I realized this is reality for American Airlines. Additionally, my flight from Miami to Washington DC was okay, but the gate agent in Miami was terse and frankly, not personable. I find the staff to be less accommodating than before. While I didn't need anything in particular, the service was simply poor."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Reliable on time flights,"Easy travel on time and no surprises , everything according to plan. this was an emergency travel and was please knowing that things were smooth trhoghout."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,American Airlines Business Class,"First time flying business class to a Caribbean destination...travel time from Montreal to Aruba with connecting flight in Miami was 12hrs, so it was well worth it. Booked a year in advance and got an amazing deal (seat sale), with American Airlines. All flights were on time, and the service was excellent! If you are able to to find a great deal in business class, it’s worth every penny!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Rude flight attendants,The fight itself was no worse than usual. However the flight attendants left much to be desired. I was with my daughter and granddaughter. A few days after we arrived I mentioned how rude the flight attendants and they both said I thought it was just me.  The flight attendants were borderline hostile. I wish I could tell you the name of the only one who was entirely pleasant. My husband requested wheel chair service for me. Someone ahead of me took mine and I had my walker. I asked if it was a long walk to baggage and was told it was not. (It Was) Had I known how long it was I would have insisted someone get me a wheel chair. Too bad I'm so easy to get along with.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great smooth flight,Excellent smooth flight with friendly attendants. Check in and baggage claim went smoothly.  We liked the on time arrival in Fort Myers.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"Take your money and no service.
They must be government owned.
They run as efficiently as the post office,. No pun inten","We paid for first class and never got first class seats.  You try to talk to someone at the counter and they ""can't help you"".  Ridiculous.  Go Southwest.  Should have flown Southwest Airlines!!!!!Oh, I will be sharing on FB too and any  media I can.  Btw, I don't normally complain."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Enjoyable Flight With Enjoyable Service,"Three and one half hour flight was enjoyable. We had an empty seat between us which allowed us just enough extra room to avoid cramping.  Seats seemed to be more substantial in construction and therefore more comfortable. A vivacious lady flight attendant emoted friendliness and appreciation..  Equipment was a Boeing 737 with a 3X3 seating configuration.  Announcements were in Spanish and English.  The flight was uneventful.  Had to traverse Dallas Fort Worth Airport to find correct gate, but not too difficult."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very Tight Seating - Especially on a Full Flight.,Flying out of Indianapolis was very easy and no problems [especially when you have a flight that departs at 5:30 am.  Not much congestion and easy access through Security Checkpoint]. Flight was on time and my connecting flight in Philadelphia was easily accessible and just a short distance from my arrival gate.  It's nice to leave 7 degree weather at 5:30 am in Indy and arrive in 80 degree weather at 1:05 pm in St. Thomas.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Complaint,"I do not fly with American Airlines often, but when I do, I have noticed a pattern-their customer service is terrible. At the out set, I have worked in customer service before; I know what it is like to be abused by customers, so I consider myself a pretty patient person and try to be kind. However, when people have a nasty attitude and are blatantly rude to a customer, I have an issue with that. I missed my flight despite checking the gate change on the monitor when I arrived at Charlotte Douglas International Airport. If you, American Airlines, are going to send me a text telling me when my flight arrives, departs, etc, I trust that I will be getting ALL notifications about my flight, including gate changes. I wasn’t allowed to board the plane fifteen minutes before departure because my “seat was given away.” On top of that, I was given an attitude by two Americans Airlines’ employees, a Mrs. Valerie Gregory and Jessica. Mrs. Gregory, I assumed, put me on the next flight. She was unable to print a boarding pass for me. Jessica, dressed to the nines, with false lashes and all, gave me a dirty look and did not assist me, despite that I was standing there waiting patiently for assistance before Mrs. Gregory finally acknowledged my presence. After speaking with Mrs. Gregory, I discovered through another American Airlines employee that I could take this next flight only to find out I wasn’t put on the the flight. Oh, and the gate  for this other flight changed AGAIN without notification. P.S. - I’m still on standby."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,It was ok,We recently flew AA to Mexico with stopovers in Phoenix and Dallas.  The flight down was extremely cold and I ended up having a cold for a few days.  Many women were freezing and there are no blankets.  The flights were on time and the service was ok.On the way back I asked the supervising flight attendant if they could keep the air conditioning no so cold and he immediately said yes of course. He was very kind and kept to his word.  In general the flight attendants were more attentive than on the way down. There were flight delays but not American's fault.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Wait, wait, wait","Terrible. The arriving flight was delayed. First 45 minute wait. We boarded and were informed there was a strap broken in cargo compartment but it would be fixed. Waited another 45 minutes.  They couldn't fix it. We deplaned and waited another 45 minutes for a different inbound flight. We boarded again and waited another 45 minutes, never found out why.  We ultimately arrived in SLC 4 hours late.  The whole disaster was bungled by American"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good round trip flight,"Curb side check in at Logan is a plus. Convenient and a time saver. Flight attendants were courteous and attentive to our needs. No long waits at the baggage claim. The only issue we had was the leg room. Better than some airlines but not as good as others. Overall, this flight was a good experience. We visit Scottsdale every year, this is the airline we are most comfortable flying on."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Horrible Treatment of  Loyal Customers,"I've flown AA for over 40 years and am a lifetime Gold member which means nothing anymore.  Their miles program is a joke.  Good luck finding a non-stop flight where you can actually use your miles.  If you book a flight and designate you're paying there are multiple options and many seats to choose from but if you change the booking over to use miles all those flights disappear and your options are usually reduced to multi-layover options only or flights with unfriendly departure/arrival times.  Their seats are cramped with very little leg room.  Even if the person in front of you does not recline, forget about trying to open a laptop to get any work done.  These experiences have frustrated me for years.  However, now AA has now raised it to a new level disgust for me.  I had a flight booked with miles and decided to cancel due to not wanting to travel at a time with coronavirus infections popping up across the country.   They charged me $200 to reinstate the miles back into my account.  That's my reward for being a loyal customer for over 40 years.   Unfortunately, I cannot give this airline zero stars."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Uneventful But Cramped,"Took this early morning (6:30 AM) flight as first leg on our vacation.  We were lucky enough to have seats in the emergency wing exits which gave us more foot room. Unfortunately, the seats are too narrow and very uncomfortable.  Sat next to a fidgeter making the 2 1/2 hour flight very long.  This was a smaller plane with 1X2 seating in first class and 2X2 seating in economy.  Served an in flight beverage and cookie.  Plane ride was smooth with an unusually hard landing.  Arrived at destination early."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"Personal where very helpful. Seating accommodations where horrible, as there was hardly any room.",People good. Seats horrible. Seriously doubt if I will fly again.  As close as the seats are I believe this causes a real safety problem.
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Nothing but stress flying American,"On this trip we had a weather delay getting into Dallas for a transfer.  1 hour and 15 minutes.  My flight was for 7:45 am that morning.  I received a text from American that i would miss my connection so they booked me on a 8:45 PM flight that night!  8:45 PM when I had a 7:45 am flight that morning!!!!!  I got to Dallas at 11:00am, my connection was also delayed till 11:30am, so with running like a lot of American airlines passengers do (no kidding watch the gates) I could have made it, but the flight left early at 11:03am!! This should not have happened their were more then myself that missed this flight.  In Dallas the wLady at the counter was like O well! American airlines only cares about filling seats, not about customer satisfaction! ! Watch the news for people involved with American!!"

Date of travel: March 2020,10,Bad customer service.,"Booked our 27th vacation trip to aruba thru our travel agent 4 months in advance. Apple Tours was the provider for the travel agent. We had confirmed seating for the flight so we thought. American said that the agent nor the tour group had the ability to confirm seating. And the rep at the gate could not have cared less. She was indifferent, rude, and the model for what a CSR should not be. Never American Airlines again. Thank goodness, I have other options and I intend to use them. I will not put AA out of business, however I intend to dent them where I am able to do so."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Horribly long trip!,"I let several attendants know that TV wasn't working. I had the longest international flight without any TV access. A few hours would be doable but come on, do not expect a passenger to sit for 12 hours with out able to watch anything on the monitor not even flight status."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Viva Las Vegas,The flight was great. The crew was wonderful.  Being able to watch a movie makes the time go by a lot faster.  Very good selection of movies.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,A very enjoyable trip,Started our journey in Dublin. On to Charlotte is London Heathrow a short stopover in London before continuing on Avery enjoyable flight  both ways and a great week in the USA celebrating a family wedding
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Airline,This Airline is one of the best I have flown. From the ticket agents to the flight attendants. They were very curious and friendly helpful. I don’t have one thing to say that is bad about this airline. If I can I will always fly American Airline and tell everyone I know about how wonderful it is to fly with this Airline.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"I like American, but this was a tough flight","So flying to the US it was my first flight on a 787 with American Airlines.The Good:While still loud, it was slightly quieter than a 777Inflight entertainment and GPS was one of the best I’ve ever used.Overhead Bins are hugeThe BadCattle Class (Main Cabin) seating is the tiniest I have ever had the miss fortune to sit in. I was lucky insomuch as the two seats next to me were empty and the seats so flat that there was no ridge between them if wishing to spread out.Even with that space – it was by far the single most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken and would have happily taken the same trip in the cargo hold of a C130 if offered or embraced Ryanair.Food and Food Service – meh…. By this I mean if you snooze – they walk right by. If they want to check your seat belt – they will wake you. Trust me - we want to wake for food!!!After nearly missing food, I got the attention of the steward who told me there was only one meal type left - which I thought odd considering the rows of empty seats. Only later to see the same guy sit down with not one meal but two different ones and tuck in..The Windows... They’re very clever that you can dim them at the touch of a button – with the exception that most had a mind of their own and would brighten and dim all on their own.Once at altitude, they dim them all giving a very surreal view of the outside world.Also, you know how on ordinary plane windows there is that near-perfect recess in the panelling to the window itself where you prop your cushion to sleep – it doesn’t exist on these trendy ones at all.Toilets were tiny.The flight was not the experience I'd ever had with American and have since checked that my return flight is NOT on a 787 - or I would have bought a new fight with UnitedAll in all, the flight was slow torture, uncomfortable and not one I ever wish to repeat. The 787 was not nice at all really in Main Cabin class."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Michael S,"My wife and I took my sister, son, daughter and grandson.  The pilots took their time to sign a small passbook for my grandson as we got on the plane.  The Airline Stewards were great in paying attention to our grandson also.  The Stewards offered great service through out the flight.    I would recommend American Airlines to fly on.Michael S."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Only Fly American,"Whenever I travel by air, I always choose American Airlines. I have always found the service provided from the gate to the hostess to be second to none. The piglets always have informed the passengers of any weather conditions that might affect the flight as well as any other events that might affect the flight.  As with all airlines, the seating in the main cabin leaves much to be desired but I don’t see that changing. Whether it has been my many trips around the United States and Canada or our trips to England and Scotland, only American Airlines has been able to meet our needs."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Just keep us in the terminal!,"It's a long trip from Phoenix to Lihue, Hi, so I made sure to stay up and moving, get to the bathroom at the last minute and settle in for the long trip. Once on board, the doors  didn't close and we had to wait for the food service to bring more food. That made us have to sit an additional hour. Sitting for 7 hours is not healthy. On the return, at the same airport, there was no time to grab breakfast before boarding our 5 hour flight home, but the weather was clear and should be an on time flight, until all of a sudden there was a fuel pump problem and the plane had to be checked by the maintenance crew. Very conveniently, our flight picked up more passengers at the same time... I would have rather waited in the terminal and been able to move around rather than sit for 1 hour while the fuel pump was being ""checked out"" and conveniently taking on more passengers."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best client care ,"My husband and I were scheduled to leave for Hong Kong on March 13th, returning from Tokyo April 5th.  Sadly, his 70th birthday present has evaporated but we are so thankful for American Airlines.  When we made a request, they immediately agreed to cancel and fully refund our business class airfare. True to their word, the funds were credited back to our credit card in a few weeks.  No pain.  No anxiety.We fly most frequently with American and there have been annoying changes here and there, but at this point, who cares? They put our health above the dollar, unlike the cruise line that caused us great anxiety for 3 weeks and we continue to hope that they will keep their word and refund our very expensive fare. So far, we have a credit for 5% although the cruise is cancelled.Thank you, American Airlines.  I look forward to flying American to Europe in May!"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,The flight attendants were so unfriendly and rude.,"I asked for a cup of tea, during the second beverage service, adding, “when you have time”.  Received eye rolls from the attendant.  Later the other attendant, who was quite wide, came down the aisle as I was returning to my seat. Due to his size I stepped into a row, and never received even a thank you."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Terrific,Not much to say except the flight was perfect. Thanks AA! Love the single flat seats available on some flights.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,every flight was late,"We were flying first class from Indianapolis Las Vegas, connecting in Dallas. The  flight arriving in Indianapolis was delayed by over two hours causing us to miss our connecting flight. The airline re-routed us, but we were not able to fly in first class. The rerouted flight was also late causing us to have to sprint across the airport to meet out final flight to Las Vegas.On the way home our connecting flight from Phoenix to Indianapolis was delayed again by two hours. We were very disappointing with the service and will most likely fly with someone else on our next trip."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Seats were roomy and reclining , but horribly uncomfortable cushions","Fight attendants were awesome! Were flying on a red-eye - departed at 11:40 p.m.- some slept , some were awake, attendants did amazing job trying to fill needs and still disturb no one. One wired thing was the started a movie, and didn't hand out headphones, so you were watching a movie, but had no sound- very unusual for first class!Everything went great , service was awesome, food/snacks good . Seat cushions were terrible. Flew coach on the way out, and seats were far more comfortable that first class on the return flight, they felt worn out!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,American Airlines,Great service as usual.  I had a Smooth flight arrival and departure.  The staff was very friendly and I had  No problems.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Just OK mostly, in some areas a lot less.","If you fly premium economy on foreign airlines and American, you can see the difference in everything from the flight attendants to the food, to the little extras that you're paying big bucks for. American's flight attendants do the minimum. They give you a bottle of water, give you an ok meal and that's all. Foreign airline attendants come around every so often and offer drinks, water and snacks. They are visible - even on the overnight flights. During my last flight, just as the airplane was loading, American announced they were photographing everyone that got on board - even though we all had checked passports and boarding passes. I believe they were being used as a dupe for some agency that was collecting photographs in a nebulous data bank. It took forever to load the flight, the equipment was slow and didn't work and you were forced to allow your photo to be used for an unstated purpose. I try not to fly this airline."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,A great seat partner helped me on my flight,"I noted that we never heard the captain of the flight welcome us, or give us any idea of whether the flight was expected to be smooth or bumpy (it was low level bumpy most of the way).  Captains often give you an idea of when it might be smooth for a bit, so you can get up and use the facilities.  The only time I heard the pilot was when he told the attendants to get ready for landing.  I wish he had provided some information -- hard enough to sit like a sardine for so many hours.  I had some relief, though, from the delightful woman sitting next to me, who was on her way to the Mideast.  She didn't speak a lot of English (and I only knew about 3 words in her language), but she knew enough so we could communicate, and even work on a crossword puzzle together.  May God bless her!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great airlines,"We had great service in business class, I wouldn't travel overseas any other way.  Roomy and pleasant"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,I am not planning on flying American Airlines again.,"When we left Mexico to head back to Milwaukee it was a mess.  We were late leaving Mexico and arrived in Phoenix with 1 1/2 hours till our next flight to Milwaukee (which was the original amount of time shown for our lay over).  By the time we got through customs and RAN to our next gate we missed our flight by 4 minutes.  Others on our flight missed it by 1 minute.  We were in the customer service line for 20 minutes before the plane we missed even backed out.  They refused to let any of us get on the flight (there were 12 to 15 of us that missed the flight)  but we could sit there and watch our luggage be loaded on the plane.  They claimed it was not American Airlines fault because the plane released the break on time in Mexico.  Their tickets do say they close the door 10 minutes before the flight, and that you need to plan 2 hours in that airport to make it through customs and make your plane on time.  But, our lay over was only 1 1/2 hours.  They should not have booked our flight then unless we had the full 2 hours to make it to our next plane. They knew our plane came in and, in my opinion, that was ridiculous for them to not allow that many people on the plane.  Well, we made it home 9 hours later then was planned."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Emergency Trip,American Airlines customer service was very understanding of my personal situation and helped me to move my flights around as needed for a such minimum charge
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Drink poured on head deliberately,"On way back from Cancun to UK they did not bring me Vegan and saved it under my nose Infront of other people my partner said that’s not we asked for so we didn’t eat they brought back again waved under my nose I refused to eat .They called us liars then I still remained polite I asked for drink he opened a fizzy bottle over my head soaked my expensive dress and head made me cry said it’s only water ,my partner looked at him he said “he’s not happy is he and laughed , we reported him Tom answer was so what , we travel quiet a lot and never experienced this , never fly again with them again , plane was over the place up and down had bad time felt uncomfortable never again ."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Good value for money!,"American Airlines provided a great onboard experience - Entertainment, Food and Drinks 🍷 to customers delight. Highly recommended"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,A miserable experience!,"Our flight was an hour late leaving Los Angeles because of a competence problem with the airline.  We were told that the pilot had not been provided paperwork to show the proper amount of fuel was aboard.  Our connection in Texas was going to be tight for the second leg to Quito which was to arrive there at about midnight.  Inquiries about whether we would arrive in time to make the connection were not answered.  When we inquired whether the connecting flight would wait for us we received no information.  Upon arrival in Texas our request that there be an announcement to allow us to exit first to help make the connection was first ignored and then an announcement was made once the aisle was already jammed with people.  Upon exiting the plane, my wife was able to run from gate where we landed to the gate for the connection flight and arrived there in time to get then to reopen the doors and allow us to board.  American did close to nothing to assist us in this situation which was the result of their paperwork error in Los Angeles.Had we missed this connection there was no flight from Texas to Quito the following day.  We would have had to go to Florida and then on to Quito.  I have no recollection of ever having been treated so poorly.  American’s attitude throughout was that there was nothing that they could do.  They could have made an effort."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,NEVER AGAIN,"I bought my daughter's ticket a little over a month ago and had to pay around $560. To day I see the flight is only a 137 round trip. I called and they will not budge with price matching or anything! They won't cancel, they won't help, all they do is tell you that that's not their problem. I think they have horrible customer service and I will never use this airline again! What a waste of money how can a flight drop over $420 you're not willing to budge at all!  I now understand the bad ratings and horrible customer service I see in the other reviews!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Airlines tone-deaf to current pandemic?,"I live in California, and frequently drive to Los Angeles, where the Covid-19 virus has now taken hold.   I had booked a flight with American Airlines for this Saturday 3/7, from Santa Barbara to Phoenix for a weekend getaway.   This morning I woke with a chest and head cold....coughing and fever.   While I know I could suppress these symptoms for the duration of a short flight, but I wanted to be conscientious about not exposing a planeload of passengers to whatever I have, so I called AA to cancel my flight.   I was on hold for an hour and a half.  When I got a “customer service” agent, I explained my issue, and asked if AA was offering any special waiver of the cancellation policy due to the current Covid-19 viral pandemic.   The agent told me that Santa Barbara was not on their “flight alert” list, so no refunds or credits would apply.    I politely commented that this was too bad, since it seems to encourage people who may be sick to board a plane anyway, for fear of losing the money they paid for their flight.  The agent said (ver batum) “We’re not forcing you to go on this flight!  You don’t HAVE to go!” This was said in such a rude and sarcastic way, it took me aback.   I’ve had one other experience with AA recently, which was equally mind-boggling and negative.   I’d left my iPad on a flight last summer, and when I followed up with “lost and found” (which is a joke)  the airlines kept telling me my lost iPad was not in the Lost and Found, but they were “searching for it!  And yet the flight attendant who took my iPad to the LAX lost and found, and my “Find my  iPhone/iPad” app located it at the lost and found office at LAX.  It took me 2 weeks to get it back, and I had to drive to the airport and argue with the lost and found agent until she found it.  Right where I knew it was, but AA kept saying it wasn’t. I have only booked with AA twice in the last couple years, and these two times have left such a sour taste for me.  I will never book with them again.Why would an airline want to encourage passengers to board when they are sick, or fighting a cold, in the middle of a coronavirus outbreak that is worldwide!!!?   And why, if they choose not to offer any special waivers at this time, would they go out of their way to be rude and dismissive about it?   I guess AA doesn’t care about its customer PR, or the public’s health.Because of the current pandemic awareness of the Covid-19 coronavirus, I am shocked that American Airlines has not issued any customer statement about flying while sick or changing their cancellation policy for this time period.  I have gotten emails from AlaskaAirlines with generous waivers in place due to this pandemic.  Get with the program American."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Smooth Flight,Flight attendants were able to quickly dispense beverages/snacks even with a full plane. They were very helpful explaining the layout of the airport destination.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,I love American Airlines,"Great trip, great flight. The food was excellent. They waited on me hand to foot. I always fly American"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Vegetarians in Business Class are treated like second-class travelers.,"I booked round-trip Business Class from Dallas to Leon, México.  The itinerary showed that we would be served a meal on each flight but wouldn’t allow me to choose a meal.  I called American and the representative said they had recently changed meal options and no choices for vegetarians were available on her screen, but I should check at the gate.  The gate agent told me no meals would be served on our flight because the flight wasn’t long enough.  So, we boarded and shortly after we reached altitude a flight attendant asked me what meal I preferred—turkey or chicken.  Surprised, I said I was told at the gate that there wasn’t meal service on the flight, but I’d appreciate a vegetarian option.  “There isn’t one,” she said.  “There’s a turkey wrap or a grilled chicken salad.”  I asked her what exactly vegetarians were offered for paying a Business Class fare.  She said the chicken was served separately so I could just eat the salad by itself.  When the meal came, it was a large portion of chicken on a plate and a tiny dish of slightly wilted chopped salad.  I emailed American’s customer service center, and they responded by depositing 1500 miles into my AA frequent flyer account. Not enough of an apology for their incompetence and lack of customer service, or much incentive to fly American in the future.  In addition, on both flights the seat area was filthy, with food residue/sticky stuff on the tray tables and crumbs and dirt lodged in the center console crevices.  Ick."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Not Great,"When the passenger in front of me put his seat back, he was in my lap - the seats are way too close together.  I was also not seated next to the other traveler on my reservation and we checked in about 22 hours in advance and purchased our tickets 6 months before the flight.  There is no excuse for this."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Perfect but......,On time pleasant attentive crew. Warm chocolate chip cookies for dessert. I do not understand how a couple with a 3 months old was allowed to bring 2 back packs plus 3 carry on suitcases. Obviously the rules do not apply to everyone.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Comfortable ride,"I’ve had great luck on this Tuesday night flight. I’ve now flown it twice and both times the plane was only about half full. I paid extra to get and I’ll seat near the front. And both times ended up with the row to myself.On my most recent flight the plane was delayed coming in from Charlotte and we were anticipated to leave 40 minutes late. However the flight team was very efficient at getting us all loaded on board and seated and we ended up gaining 10 minutes back. And then the pilot gained us another 10 minutes in flight. So we ended up just coming in 20 minutes late to Phoenix. Service was efficient. Seats were comfortable.On a sidenote, I am a plus size female. I appreciate that I do not have to ask for a seatbelt extender when flying on these planes. The two hour flight means no meals, and only one beverage service, but nothing unexpected."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,AA to Costa Rica. TERRIBLE,"AA planes are so old that it is scary. They don't even have screens or movies in an international flight to Costa Rica and they charge extra for bags which is unusual in international flights. I don't recommend, terrible service, terrible plane, unfriendly flight attendants."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"BUR to DFW--regular flight, but exceptional service.","Burbank, best lil airport in America, to Dallas, best BIG airport in America on a little CRJ regional.  Captain came back to the wing area, pointed out that there was still some surface ice on the wings and told us that was holding up our departure.  That simple, kind act of explaining to passengers what was going on.  If only others took that time, that simple little explanation, they'd go a long way to eliminating the conflicts we see in air travel, today."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Late flight from Chile to Dallas,"We had a late dinner with wine. Great meal with desert and finished with a glass of port.  Reclined the seat to a flat bed and slept until breakfast.  I prefer to fly business  on long flights, especially over night flights. Nothing is worse than being cramped in coach next to a snorer.  I have paid my dues and now I can lay down and enjoy the trip."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,As Expected,"There were actually 4 flights involved getting to Jamaica.  All legs were Ok and on Time.  The return flights had some issues with the 3rd plane breakdown and reschedule of flights to get home. Overall it was not ""Bad"" but frustrating at times."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Missed flight,I know that mechanical problem happens but we should have been more informed of the situation and solutions then we were.  We missed our connecting flight and lost a day of vacation.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Computers Down,The entire team at BJX did an incredible job of getting a full flight processed and onboard for an on time departure with the computer system down. Every boarding pass and luggage tag was generated manually. The passengers got boarded and our checked bags got to DFW. VERY IMPRESSIVE!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Vegas 2020,"Everything with the flight was good.  Departure time, arrival time, service, food, drinks, etc, etc.  My only complaint is the lack of first class amenities. Other airlines now have video screens, charging ports, and other modern technology. AA is severely lacking in this department. For the amount of money they charge to fly first class, you would think you'd get a little more for your money. I was told to download two different apps in order to watch ""in flight entertainment"" on my tiny phone screen. With no way to charge my phone, and extra battery being used, my phone was dead before we landed and I didn't even get to finish watching the movie. All in all the flight was fine, and seats comfortable, but just not up to par with what other airlines are providing these days in first class."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Overall good flight,"Plesant flight crew. Comfortable seat. Check in lines in Paris on Sunday morning were extremely long, however, the area seemed to be fully staffed and they were doing the best they could to keep things moving. I paid for a seat with the extra legroom but the tv was mounted on a wall that was so far away it made the screen almost unwatchable due to its size."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Recent trip from Indiana via Chicago and Puerto Vallarta and back via Houston,"Friendly staff at gate and onboard. Airplanes both ways were clean and service was good.  Inflight Wifi on flight to PV was not working and unfortunately, no T.V. monitors in seatbacks - just every few rows attached to bulkhead."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Direct AA flight JFK-SJO,"We took an AA flight from JFK to SJO. It was a direct flight both ways. The return flight was a red eye. There were no issues and the flight was on time both ways with excellent customer service.  We traveled with two elementary school aged children. The only complaint was the food.   The sandwiches on one flight were  a bit spicy, so kids couldn’t eat them. However, the staff gave our kids extra snacks.  I also had my own food/snacks just in case.  I would definitely repeat this flight again if going to Costa Rica."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Clean and comfortable in Coach.,"I’m not always pleased with the cleanliness and comfort in coach. ( maybe it’s “post Coronavirus” precautions), but this trip, the aircraft appeared to be well-cleaned. TIP- don’t leave your health to others; I wiped down everything I anticipated handling, and wore a hospital mask because apparently some travers still like to hack, sneeze, and cough open-mouthed or into their hands. Don’t ask me to SHAKE YOUR HAND, dodo."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Mixed review,"We flew out early Tuesday morning from LAX, check in was quick and friendly, surprisingly so was security so we used the Admirals Lounge as Qantas passengers. The lounge is very very basic, plus the bathrooms weren’t exactly what we’ve come to expect in the USA. The flight was full, it was noticeable that no one seemed to recline their seats especially as most passengers were dozing off! Coffee & biscuit yeah! Not. First time to Dallas Fort Worth airport, used the train to change terminals. Only had 25 minutes to get something to eat. Which was a joke as we were so late in leaving. Boarding was a breeze plane half empty so like everyone else we had three seats for the two of us! I’m not sure who cleans the planes but when we looked around us, we were very unhappy that the holding area where the magazines etc are held it had not been cleaned out - flight 1507 x row 20 - not sure if they were serviettes or tissues!!!!But it was gross to say the least, that when there’s so much going on about the Corona virus that the cleaning had not been checked. We wiped everything down, like many other passengers were doing. When we pointed out the mess to the crew they were oh well, that’s when we realized that they were not going to remove whatever it was, they need disposable gloves now.We sat waiting for pilots to arrive, then do their safety check which made us about 40 mins late leaving, no one was really concerned obviously it happens a lot with AA.Flight was ok, pretzels & a Diet Coke oh my how spoilt we felt, easy job working on that flight for the crew.Shout out to the people on the ground at the Cancun airport they were very friendly, helpful and being a small number of passengers we went through quickly."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Nashville 2020,Flew out of New Haven for the first time; was able to drive close to terminal bldg. & the TSA line was quick. Flew on a small jet with very smooth takeoff & landing.Arrived in  PHL  in 45-50   minutes for connecting flight. In air flight time was pleasantand smooth.  No complaints will definitely fly American out of New Haven again.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Getting reimbursed,After flight was delayed and booked onto a flight without any seats that were paid for tried to contact the 1-800 number to get reimbursed. Customer service rep said wasn’t American Airlines fault it was the pilots. WHAT???? Who do the pilots work for!!?? Who hires these customer service reps?? Who trains these people what CUSTOMER SERVICE is?????AMERICAN AIRLINES you need an overhaul providing customer service in ALL areas!!  Oh yeah you really don’t want customers do you? That is how we felt flying with you! Choose another airlines!!!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Florida Flight,This flight was on time. All staff were friendly and helpful.  Having to ride the shuttle bus from the plan to the terminal at DCA was the only negative.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Gramma TT,"We purchased six round trip tickets 2/26/20-3/2/20. We typically fly Delta but decided to fly American since tickets were 200.00 less for each ticket with a savings of $1200.00. Our flight left DSM in an American Eagle plane so small my 5’8 son-in law could not fit in the seat nor walk upright. We were diverted to Knoxville due to fog in Charlotte. After sitting in a cramped plane for an extra hour we took off for Charlotte arriving one minute after, our  only  flight to Grand Cayman took off on time no delays since the fog was gone while we sat in Knoxville. The lines yo connect to other flights were wrapped around the airport. After waiting over an hour we were told the only flight was to Miami at 4:30 since all earlier flights were booked! Tried to call via the website got some customer service from the Philippines who basically said she was unable to assist us!!The flight to Miami was full and the only seats available were not next to our spouses and not the Premium Economy were paid for! We booked rooms at the Hilton since we arrived in Miami at 7:30 and had been up since 3:30 am for our 7 am departure in DSM. We should have been in the Caymans at 2:30. We got to Miami and an American Airlines Mechanic, no customer service people at the desks, directed us to a separate customer service area in the D area. We originally wanted seats together for the next day flight to the Caymans, which they booked us on the later in the day flight rather than the first flight out. Great service! Ha! A kind woman at the service desk gave us free food since we were exhausted. She was the FIRST one that even tried to help us other than the mechanic! She mentioned we could be on standby for the 8:30 flight to the Caymans that night rather than staying in Miami. We immediately tried to cancel our reserved rooms but Hampton Inn Miami Airport East refused and said they would charge us $606.00 whether we stayed there or not!!! What?? Again customer service. I am sure those rooms were booked by other delayed American Airline flights that night! So we got on the 8:30 pm flight with NO luggage. We were guaranteed all suitcases would be on the 10:30 next day flight. After spending all day at the airport (more taxi fees to/from airport and wearing the same clothes) only two suitcases arrived. Stayed at the airport another two hours waiting for the American Airlines 2:30 flight and luggage. Another day lost in Grand Cayman. Only one suitcase arrived. The last suitcase came at 10:30 at night and by the Grace of God it somehow got delivered to our condo door. Coming home was another horrific experience. While arriving in Charlotte we gave our passports to a worker constantly blowing his nose with the same tissue, never using hand gel after wiping his nose and then touching everyone’s tickets and passports. Where is coronavirus protection standards if workers don’t understand common sense cleanliness!!?? Beware of The great HUB of American Airlines!Please please think twice before traveling with American Airlines. Everything about them is simply AWFUL. No regard AT ALL for the customer. Pay extra or YOU WILL pay extra in fees, extra cab fares, extra hotel fees due to delayed flights and extra costs for personal hygiene and clothes due to delayed luggage. Fly AMERICAN if you want the most awful traumatic experience in travel!!!Christyuhlenhopp@gmail.com"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,American doesn’t care about passengers ,"Over two hours late on a return flight from Lima due to “maintenance.”  Delays are very common with American, and all they say is “we are sorry for the inconvenience.”The airplanes are old and provide none of the amenities that other companies offer as standard on economy.  Food is mediocre at best.  Will avoid flying American, especially on international flights."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,American Airlines A-OK!,"I recently had 4 separate flights on American Airlines.  The Airlines has received a lot of negatives in recent polls about favorite airlines.  But, American really got the job done for my spouse and I on a recently trip from Palm Springs, CA to Lexington, KY.  Three of the planes we were on were new or newer, and very clean.  The fourth plane was a little older and worn, but in good condition.  The flight crews on all the flights were courteous, clear and attentive.  I truly appreciated their professionalism.  Let’s face it, air travel isn’t what it was back in the early 70s, and that’s simply true.  I don’t love to fly, I don’t enjoy airport experiences, I think the modern world is quite ridiculous, so I appreciated even more the care and thought with which we were treated on each leg of our journey.  I’m giving a shout out to American, and letting you know that I’d select your airlines again.  Thank you for working to improve your image, my spouse and I had a direct benefit from your efforts."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Landed early, good entertainment","We were decently comfortable for what you’d expect in economy and it being a long flight. The flight attendants were good about letting us move around the cabin. The food was pretty decent (I had a chicken salad sandwich and snack) and they brought plenty of drinks around. The movie choices were good, a mix of older and somewhat new but no real hits that I was looking forward to seeing, so  that could’ve been better... but then again it’s free entertainment?! I admit after a few boring hours I did like playing Tetris with the seat back joystick, also free! We landed just a few minutes early so that’s always a bonus."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Business/First Class Flight,The flight to Cancun was great (meal and service).   Coming back it was just okay.  The selection for the meal was very limited.  My wife doesn't eat either of the 2 choices.  She just asked for additional mixed nuts.  The flight attendant was very accommodating.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Another nice flight,"My flight from Charlotte to Columbus was First Class.  The flight number was (5203). A couple of things:  When there is a delay in flight why not POST it for all of us to see.  When the chart says we board in 2 minutes and the plane is NOT even at the gate, why not change it to the correct time?????  I don’t get it????  It seems so easy with computers??????  American fails at this and we as customers don’t like it.  Enough complaining…. I’ll probably keep flying American!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great!!,My flight from Newark to Charlotte was First Class.  The flight number was (1891). I did not get the name of our flight attendant but she was good!!  The flight went off without a hitch!!!!  I spent time in the Admiral’s Club and it was a short walk to my flight.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,A nice flight,"My flight from Charlotte to Newark was very good.  It got off on time and was an uneventful flight.  The flight number was 1216 and I flew first class.  Our attendant was excellent and she did a great job!!!  I love flying with American except for the delays, the marshalls not being ready when the plane comes in, the lack of people ready to move the unloading platform to the plane…….. sometimes I wonder why I stick with American and not go to Delta.  All of the aforementioned happened today on this flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great!!!,"My flight from Columbus to Charlotte (#4493) was First Class.  The flight was delayed.  It seems like a lot of my flights with American get delayed!!!  However, our First Class attendant was Jerry and he was superb!!!  One of the best ever!!!  Great personality and such a joy to work with!!!  Jerry is a main reason I remain an “EP” with American.  We got there on time after the delay!!!  That was a good thing.  American – give Jerry a raise!!!  He was the best!!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Problems with unprofessional crew and broken equipment,"The flight left on time, even though it was difficult to get all the passengers to get seated.  Our entertainment equipment was not working, so I notified flight attendant.  They told us to reset it.  Since it didn't work during the safety instructions, they had to rerun the video but our equipment never worked during the flight, so no movies or music.  Other rows had nonfunctional equipment as well.The crew was not very professional.  They were giggling  and bumbling instructions, and in spite of it being a flight originating in Colombia, nobody spoke Spanish.  They came around with food at 2:00 AM which seemed kind of dumb since everyone was trying to sleep.  I was in the middle seat and the wings on the seat were broken, so it was impossible to really get any sleep.  I like the direct flight, but equipment should work and attendants should be able to communicate with passengers."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nice flight,"It was a pleasant flight, no issues, Attendants were very nice.  The movies or TV shows were an added bonus."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Do NOT book on American,"I booked a round trip with American and had to change flight for the day before. Found a better/cheaper flight and booked with another airline. I called American to cancel the departing flight, but to keep the return flight, and was told if I didn’t show up for the first flight, they would cancel my return flight and I lost all my money - no credit. The customer service person was gleeful about the situation."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Terrible service,"This is BY FAR the slowest and the most unplanned staff and crew. Nothing is in order, nothings on time, nothing is planned. This is the worst experience on a plane I’ve ever had. I’ll definitely not be recommending again. We’ve had to turn around multiple times and the pilots blamed it on the flight attendants when it was really the pilots not having an extra seat. I would not recommend this air line."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Changed Flight after we had already paid.   Long Layovers!,I was not happy with this Airline at all!  They changed the flight after we had already booked and paid for it.   Not very customer service orientated company.Staff seemed rude.   Sat in Miami airport all day!
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Red - Eye From Ecuador,"I recently took a red-eye at 1:00 AM to return home from Quito, Ecuador.  Our flight left at 1:00 AM.  I was exhausted and thought I could sleep for 5 hours.  No.  At 2:10 AM there was food service, with sandwiches being served.  Everyone was awake and noisey.  Who needs a sandwich at 2:00 AM?  Then off course, at 4:00AM the final drink accommodations were being served.  Why can't they give people a snack in a sack so everyone else can sleep?"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Winter getaway,The flight was great and it was wonderful going direct and was in expensive didnt know American Air flew direct
Date of travel: December 2019,50,I'm now a loyal customer,They bent the rules to help me get to my destination.  They helped me find my dropped earring at a time they were very rushed.  I will repay the kindness.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Premium economy AA to Amsterdam,"Premium Economy is the same seat as AA’s domestic first class, so super roomy and comfy. Good entertainment offerings and a really nice Casper branded pillow and blanket that were actually very impressive. Food definitely not up to par when compared to some other carriers premium services, but certainly a step up from AA’s coach offering. We got stuck on the ground for almost two hours due to a load balancing issue. They basically had to unload all of the cargo and reload it while we sat in the plane. Minor inconvenience but they made up all of the time due to an insane jet stream that day. Thanks AA! We will definitely be using you again!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Scam Reservations,"Beware, American Airlines is letting travel agencies like Atlantis Paradise Island bookings make reservations that they claim on a recorded call are ""refundable within 15 days of travel"" then take your money followed by a confirmation that states ""non refundable"".  American has my money and I'm not traveling.  I can only assume it's a scam to get your money then force you to travel or lose the money.  Oh and all this happened within 72 hours of initial reservation and 2 months prior to travel date.  Don't Fly American Airlines."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,On time,"This was a websaver award purchase tickets that so bare ecom=nomy class for 10,000 each plus $35 can't beat that. The flight was fine. I like the entertainment selection better than on United. Attendants were pleasant."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Regan, DC to Phoenix","Left on time landed on time, friendly staff that served a a beverage and snack.Only problem was that the plane was antiquated. There were sealed ashtrays in the seat arms, no screens at the seats, just very old ones over head. There was no WiFi and it was a long flight. You would think that they could use this plane for short flights if it is needed for service. Still, all went well!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Providence to DC,"This was the first leg of a flight. Flight was full no extra seats. They were paying for people to take other flights. Flight was on time and had friendly staff that served a beverage. Wished that the WiFi worked, but no major issues.Would recommend."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Worst Ever Flight Experience,"Boarding delayed for no apparent reason. Then, after 45 minutes, told that there were mechanical issues in the cockpit, boarding would begin soon. After another 30 minutes, boarded aircraft with interior lights blinking on and off. Remained on tarmac after completing boarding (full flight). Interior lights failed completely. Passengers began requesting to exit aircraft. Cockpit crew announced that mechanics were working again and hoped for takeoff soon. After another 15-20 minutes, announced that repairs were ineffective and all passengers must exit aircraft. Transferred to another aircraft 6 gates away and entire boarding process repeated with all luggage transferred. Departed 3+ hours late for ATL. Arrived almost midnight and still had a 3+hour drive home. Arrived home at 3:15 AM after expecting to be home before midnight.  AA exhibited extremely poor concern and customer service, no offer of any overnight lodging or concessions for an awful experience.Worst experience ever, but 4th consecutive AA flight with similar problems, some weather related. May never use AA again!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Average flight,"Another average flight with American Airlines...average service, average seat comfort, average entertainment,  below average food.  Since I'm stuck with frequent flyer status, I endure the barely acceptable level of service just about every step of the way."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,fly me to the moon,"this was a great flight from la to tokyo and then i changed airlines...  good food, took on extra water, i was in the middle and it was good."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love the 787,"THe 787 is the most comfortable plane I have been on. Seats are comfortable and the ambient lighting is amazing. Easy to either get work done, relax or get some rest. Service was great, the flight attendants were there when needed and did not bother you when resting, food very good too."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Surprisingly Good Flight,"I had a bit of anxiety about spending 12 hours on an American Airlines flight.  I had seen reviews and reports suggesting it is one of the worst performing airlines in the USA.  First off, the plane was brand new, clean, and more comfortable than many other international flights I have been on.  I was impressed with the personal audiovisual accommodation and even the dinner meal.  I was a little disappointed there was not even coffee service in the morning, however, we got in early and decided it was just fine."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,What a wonderful Experience ,Such great staff!  Pleasant/Responsive. Great leg room. Great entertainment system. Wonderful food.  I’m flying American Airlines from here on out!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,New York to Dallas - Second Leg,"This was the second leg of a trip in first class from New York to Dallas. As with the first leg the flight was on time, and both the crew and the plane were very good."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,New York To Dallas - First Leg,"The first leg of a first class trip to Dallas. The aeroplane and crew were both good, and the flight was on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Terrible Flight Attendant from Phoenix to San Diego,"Not only was this flight delayed, the flight attendant was extremely rude and unprofessional. I have never been so disappointed in a crew member. I had an N95 mask on because I was going to visit children in my family. The person sitting next to me wanted one, as well. The flight attendant made several rude comments including, ""it's unnerving"" and threw many dirty looks. There was more, but suffice it to say that I am not happy with her conduct and I'm shocked she is employed by American. I have to say, we were not the only passengers wearing masks. I didn't notice how she reacted to anyone else. It added anxiety and frustration to an already frustrating delay. She also made me feel unsafe - it seemed she wouldn't help in the event of an emergency because she hesitated for a long time even collecting our garbage (she made comments at that time, as well). I have another flight with them, but will change airlines once all of my trips are completed with American. Too bad because I had been flying with them since the age of 5."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Wonderful,"I flew from Sacramento to Dallas first class the Dallas to Fargo first class. Seats are wonderful and staff is great! Very attentive! Food was wonderful as well! Also, everything was on time!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Great flight crews.  Horrible flights.  Flight changes.  Gate changes.  Even crew were unaware of gate changes!,"Round trip Feb 13-16, so I'm talking about all 4 flights involved.We were literally with a stewardess at the supposedly correct gate...and the gate got changed without word to ANY of us.  It was the guy pushing me in a wheelchair who was notified by *his* office that saved us but literally running back to pick me up to get to the correct gate at the other end of the terminal!  The flight was almost ready to leave!!  Now, I can understand a mistake on our part.  But the stewardess ALSO having the wrong information???EVERY flight got changed...one by hours.  Plus 3 out of 4 gates were changed...and weren't close gates. By the way, I couldn't get the chair arm lifted on my seat on one plane, so couldn't sit down.  So ""our"" stewardess actually got down on her knees to fix it!  Seriously, the flight crews were ALL wonderful, as was the guy(s) they got to push me."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Flight out of Charlotte to St Martian delayed 3 hours due to lack of planning,"Scheduled for a 9:30 AM departure, i received an email notice of flight delay of 30 minutes. At 10:15 I received a second notice of another 30 minute delay. This continued until we finally boarded at 12:10. For some reason AA had to tow an aircraft to the gate from storage. We waited another 30 minutes on the ramp while the fuel crew balanced the fuel. We did not depart until 12:48. The aircraft was not adequately provisioned so the only snack option? Purchase beef jerky!! The beverage service was poor due to lack of provisions. As a result of the 2 1/2 hour delay, I missed the last ferry to Anguilla and had to overnight. I will take Delta or Jet Blu next time no doubt. No communication from gate personell in CLT just exacerbated the frustration"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"No Frills, Comfortable and Good Service",Lucked out with seats behind the bulkhead giving us lots of room. Air hostess were very nice. Was able to get up and walk around without being hassled as this was a really really long flight. Walked all the way to the back and they had snacks and drinks anytime.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worse than Spirit,"First of all, American Airline's customer service is absolute trash. They canceled my flight and when I spoke to someone they assured me I would be issued a refund. I fought with them for a month and did not get a refund. I will never fly with this airline ever again. Save yourself the time and headache and fly with ANYONE else."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Much Better Than Spirit or Southwest,"I have flown the discount carriers in the past but won’t in the future.  My experience on American Airlines was far superior to the cramped quarters, no frills of these airlines.  With free entertainment, headsets and comfortable seats I would have to be crazy to ever fly Spirit again.  The only reason to fly Southwest is if I was going on a long trip with two bags."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,American Airlines Flight from London to New York ,"A great service on the flight from London Heathrow to JFK Airport in New York. The cabin staff were wonderful, friendly, helpful and attentive. The meal service was excellent - a choice of chicken or mushroom pasta served with salad, bread and a dessert and then just before landing a small snack - a pizza.  Drinks were free and the cabin crew came with additional water - really considerate. I watched three recently released movies that I had not had chance to see at the cinema - ideal for me. I have done internal flights within the US with AA so hope they match this standard."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Longest Day Ever!!!,"Let's say that I will not fly with this airline again. Although I am rating my trip from Cancun I have to say that the flight from Manchester, NH to Washington, D.C. was not pleasant. The flight attendant was so rude, no matter what I did he found fault. My jacket over lapped the arm rest, I was holding my wristlet (purse) and was told to put it in my backpack, but yet I could hold my phone. Then he made me lift my jacket off my lap to see if I was buckled. I'm 60....not 6.Now moving on to the next flight home. Our flight was out of Cancun at 7 AM, I arranged for shuttle service for 4AM. Well, we got notification at 1AM telling us our flight was canceled and moved to 3PM. We were traveling with friends and they put us on different flights to Charlotte, NC. We did end up at the same place but we spent 14+ hours in airports. They partially comped us a meal and when I wrote to them asking for baggage fees to be reimbursed they refused but did offer us a 100.00 voucher to fly with them again.  NO WAY."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Easy trip from DFW to COS,Short trip from Dallas to Colorado Springs.  The seats were not particlarly comfortable.  Service was pretty good.  It got us home.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Left Stranded in a Foreign Country,"I got to the airport in Belize only to be told that my reservation for my return flight was cancelled. AA did not alert me that my reservation had been cancelled and refused to help me get back to the US. I had to buy a separate flight on United. When I complained I was told that they would not reimburse me for my AA flight or the additional flight I had to purchase. Their excuse was that I missed my outgoing flight to BZE. I called customer service 20 minutes after missing my flight to determine what my options were and I was told I would need to buy a separate flight to get to BZE, but was never informed that they would cancel my return flight. Apparently it's their policy to cancel the entire reservation, without telling you, even if you call in to say you still need the flight (which I did.) I will not be flying with AA again."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nice,"Had a total of 4 flights on this trip. Harrisburg to Dallas, Dallas to Los Cabos Mx, and return. All flights were on time. Crew was nice and helpful. Aircraft were clean. My only complaint was that one of our party was not issued a ticket with the TSA PRECHECK on it. All 8 of us have GLOBAL ENTRY. She had it on the way down there but for some reason not on the way back. Staff at check in were of no help."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"American is usually fine, this one was disappointing","Usually AA has good business class service, we just caught a snotty flight attendant on this one.   Too bad, because it was a  four hour flight and the passengers were in a good mood.   The food was good too, but the flight attendant just didn't want to provide any service.   Everybody kept ringing the call button.   I told her that her service was poor, very quietly, as I deplaned.   Her response was, ""And you're the worst passenger ever!    HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"""
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed about the service me and my partner was given from my flight attendant. She was rude, prejudice and very discriminatory to me and my partner, we asked to be seated together because I had “c”and he had “d”. She said we would have to wait to move until the last person got on but, It would probably not be a problem. I said okay thanks just let me know if we can. A couple minutes later she let a gentleman move seats and went up a couple more row and let another gentleman move. Me and my parter waited patiently for her to come back with the verdict. She went to the front and loudly announced that if we wanted to move “it was now or never” in a rude manor as if she was annoyed we were moving. We moved and let the incident go because we were already embarrassed about the situation. Than the flight attendant passed out food and I heard her being so nice and polite to other passengers calling them sir, mam but, then we she got to us she said, “ what y’all want” no sir no smile nothing. That’s when I began to believe she had a agenda against us. I never make reviews because I understand working in customer service but this was unacceptable. I am disgusted how she treated me and my partner I hope no one has to EVER feel the way we did."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Typical American Flight,Best part of the flight was timeliness of flight. Food was typical airline fare and service. Seats were not overly comfortable and recline was limited. Staff was friendly.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,No other way to fly,"We hate to fly - it's no longer fun.  If we have to we book Economy Plus/Premium.  Seats are wider, better service and comfy.  On ur flight there were only three rows of Premium economy.  Book the bulkhead.  There isn't anyone ahead of you and you have he extra leg room.  DON'T book the last row, the sets don't seem to recline."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Would fly again!,"I waited until our trip was complete to write this review. We flew two AA planes to get to Hawaii and two AA flights to get home. Out of the 4 flights only one had the individual entertainment screens and mine had a broken Jack for the headphones, so that was disappointing. That being said, all of our flights were on time (some evening ahead of schedule), smooth and attendants and snack service appreciated. The only problem I’ve encountered with AA was their inability to use multiple forms of payment when booking and then the inability to link my husbands flight to my account after booking separately. This was only a mild inconvenience and not something that would keep me from flying with them in the future.Oh! Attendants also gave my kids their “wings” (plastic pin) as it was their first flight. That was fun!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Cheeseburger in Paradise,Well when your going to Paradise you are already in the mood and nothing will get in your way. Little delay of 2 hour house. Everyone was very nice and bags arrived on time both ways. Thanks American.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Everything went off w/o a hitch,"Very uneventfully flight both ways. Plane rides were smooth and on time, I mean really, unless something went wrong they're all basically the same, amiright?"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,out of the cold,"Several legs to get home but it all starts with this one. Scheduled to leave Buf at 3 but the plane would not land and diverted to Pittsburg. Re-scheduled to 5 and can still make my connections.Thank you Terrance for your GREAT support. Although you were very busy your calm and understanding demeanor is a great asset to AA. Well sooner than I sat down, my flight would now be late and I would not make my connections.  Terrance to the rescue, all window seats.Rebooked for the next morning. Thank you Terrance.Now the next morning. Great flight to Chicago, great crew smooth flight. Now Chicago to DFW.Boarding was a breeze and great crew again. Smooth flight. Now for the home stretch, DFW to BRO. Window seat and by myself, Thank you Terrance. Smooth flight and crew was friendly again."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flights were cramped and crowded but on time,"Like most people I am always a but surprised at how tight the seats are.  Most ""normal sized"" American males - like the 2 men I was sitting next to - do not fit in the seat and poach some of my space.  They advertise food for purchase, but the flight attendant said they don't actually bring much of it on board so it is best to reserve food if you want it. So overall an uncomfortable experience, but not unexpected.However, the thing I value the most are the flights being on time.  All 4 of our flights going to Bonaire and returning, were on time, so we made our connections without a problem, and our bags got there when we did."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,EVV-HOU on AA,"Recently flew from EVV-HOU through DFW.  I really enjoy the American Eagle / Mesa Airlines  Service on their CRJ 9 aircraft.  The Evansville airport if recently remodeled and is hassle-free.  The only downside to AA through DFW is there are only 2 outbound and inbound flights daily, so in the event of a cancellation, you're stuck getting home unless you reroute through ORD or CLT.   I usually fly Delta through ATL but the first-class option and ease of DFW  make this route a great option."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Thumbs down for American Airlines,"Two years prior my family flew to Hawaii using American Airlines. We vowed to never use them again. Flying to Hautulco Mexico we had little choice and had to use them again. We were left at the airport because the connecting flight left 15 minutes early. The ticket said that boarding would stop ten minutes before flight time. The employees insisted that international flights left 15 and not 10 minutes before flight time even after showing the boarding passes the plainly stated this was not the case. A bad story gets worse when we boarded the “replacement” flight and sat an the runway an hour and a half because there were no pilots available. It seems like American Airlines can’t seem to get it right, at least for my family. Avoid this airline at all costs."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,TRIP TO CHIHUAHUA,"Trip was un eventful and smooth sailing.Arrived on time, roomy coach clas seats. Good cabin Service. Immigration was not crowded and orderly"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Charlotte to Provinciales,"Flight was 2 hours late leaving. Problems with plane caused them to miss their allocated spot. Even though fix was made fairly quickly, so they said, we then had to wait for a takeoff time to be allocated. They knew this was going to take a long time because they allowed passengers to leave the aircraft."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Good flight and service.,Our outbound and return flights were both excellent. the boarding process went smoothly. the cabin service was good. The inflight entertainment system and offerings (video/audio) were outstanding.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"WORST CS EVER, stole my money. Going to corporate and BBB","why can't I get a hold of someone over my refund? Worst CS EVER from an airline co. told by employee that we had to make room for ppl who paid more for their flight tickets so we must check our bags even though I paid for EL seats with reserved bins? Rest were EMPTY. Flight attendant acted like we were poor because we were on section 9. I paid for us to sit together in extra leg room seats which have a RESERVED spot for our carry on. They said we must make room incase people in other sections need it. It ended up being completely empty but they still forced us. Contacting BBB and corporate. They said they emailed me March 2 with why I didn't get the refund. Never got it. Had to call. Got a robot. Couldn't even tell me WHY. At the airport I called was told by CS at call center I we pull most likely be refunded. Apparently not. Will never use again, customer service was Atrocious."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Easy Travel,This was our second time to fly to Las Vegas this year and both times everything went good. The staff on the plane and in the airport were friendly.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Courteous, helpful, on-time.","Very pleased.  Flight loaded, departed, landed on-time.  There was some mild turbulence which the pilot warned about then apparently flew to a different altitude so it did not last long."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Great flight, fabulous attendents, despite equipment delay","We were all boarded, but due to an equipment malfunction, needed to wait, meanwhile as that was fixed, we missed our arrival position, so we were delayed by about 90 minutes for take-off. We were taken care of while waiting for take-off and given the option of returning to the terminal.  Once in flight all was very smooth and the crew was great!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,The business cabin service depends on who is serving,"In this occasion we had an excellent experience in this flight. The lady that was servicing us was from England and she was not only very courteous, but very attentive to even the smallest details. This is not normal in AA flights. I lost the paper where I wrote her name."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Mediocre business class experience on 757,"The 757 does not offer American Airlines best business class experience.  It is a single aisle plane with 2-2 seating in business class.  When configured for an international flight, the seats are relatively narrow but they do lie completely flat.  Toe space is tight, but the seats were reasonably comfortable for a thin passenger to sleep.  However, the passenger in the aisle seat will have no privacy or separation from the aisle, and climbing over the aisle passenger is very difficult.  In flight entertainment is limited to tablets which when mounted on the seat back seem to be facing your seatmate or people in the aisle rather than at you.  Storage is very limited, although there is a space peculiarly located behind your shoulder.The breakfast was very good.  In Lima, we were given access to a non-American lounge which was excellent.The Lima/Miami based cabin crew were the most indifferent and unhelpful that I've ever experienced in business class.  It wasn't until the end of the flight that a member of the crew offered any warmth.  An hour into the flight, the captain put on the seat belt sign for turbulence.  Even though the vast majority of the flight was smooth, the seat belt light remained on for the remainder of the flight.  The forward lavatory for business class passengers is near the kitchen, under the watchful eye of the flight attendants who demanded that I return to my seat when I violated the seat belt light during a period of prolonged calmness.  As a result, this was the most uncomfortable business class flight I've ever experienced.  I'm mindful of the need to maintain hydration during long flights but never dared to open the bottle of water that I had been given, let alone accept anything to drink during the second beverage service.In Miami, the first bag was delivered 45 minutes after landing.  In light of this, I'd recommend at least 2.5 hours to make an international connection in Miami if arriving on an American flight.American Airlines can do well in business class.  Our outbound itinerary included a very good experience on a 767 and an excellent experience on a 777.   The American Airlines 757 cabin is inferior to both."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Poor first class experience on 737,"I never pay for a domestic first class ticket, but was booked on this flight as part of an international business class itinerary.  Problems began during the boarding process.  Passengers in the main cabin immediately noticed a stench that nearly reached the first class cabin.  Turns out: even though the plane had spent the previous day in the maintenance hanger, neither aft lavatory was operational--or had even been cleaned.  Maintenance was summoned, and after a 50 minute delay we were able to depart--but I am amazed that this plane was returned to service with such an obvious unresolved problem.  How could the crew not notice the smell?So it was not a good start for anyone on the flight, but what struck me was how little American Airlines did to differentiate the experience for the first class passengers.  The seats were surely wider and had more legroom than in coach, but the recline was probably no more than 10 degrees.  In flight entertainment was entirely do-it-yourself; there was no video screens or even tablets for first class passengers.  Separation of the first class cabin from the main cabin was negligible.  There was a curtain that could be pulled across the aisle but it remained open throughout the flight, which invited main cabin passengers to use the forward lavatory--which they did throughout the flight, without a single challenge from the crew.  Not that the forward lavatory was anything special: it was the same tiny lavatory one might expect in the main cabin.  Not even bin space was protected.  Arriving main cabin passengers filled up the first class bin space (again without any intervention from the crew) so that a late arriving first class passenger had to struggle to rearrange bags to find space for his own carry on (again without any assistance from the crew which passively watched him struggle.)However, the dinner (short ribs) was excellent.American Airlines can do well with business class travel.  Our outbound itinerary included a very good experience on a 767 and an excellent experience on a 777.  However, this experience on a 737 was poor rather than first class.  If I again encountered an itinerary that included a transcontinental segment on an American Airlines 737, I'd instead book a different routing or different airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Business class is always better!,"AA took the points required to upgrade the entire trip (2 legs, 2 people = 4 segments), but only upgraded this portion of the trip.  Of course, Business class is always better than premium, but they ripped us off for the points.  Nonetheless, the service and food in Business was good."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Took all the points to upgrade all legs but only upgraded half trip!,"We upgraded our seats using points.  We had to fly coach in the US and Business in Mexico.  Business class portion of the trip was fine but they did not upgrade the domestic side, despite taking points for all.  Will never do it that way again! Would have been better to buy those legs and save the points for an overseas flight!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Okay,The seats are so close together there is no leg room. I am only 5’4 and my knees were touching the back of the seat in front of me. The man sitting in the aisle seat was very uncomfortable. He was a football player build and couldn’t help but hang over the seat on me. It was uncomfortable to say the least. It was a 9 hour flight and felt like being packed in a sardine can. Our flight was delayed from Pensacola due to weather so we were on a different flight than our luggage. That was a cause for concern when we got there but it showed up eventually. I think I may try a different airline next time.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Lovely staff,Very happy flight going. Returning home not so good turbulence to blame. Lovely staff couldn't do enough for you.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Italy travel with coronavirus,"I am So upset with this airlines!  Our family is scheduled for a vacation that we have saved for the last 10 years. We are very upset about the coronavirus in Italy and understood that we could change our dates of travel. After calling customer service, we found out that we could reschedule for free if we scheduled our new trip by June!  I am Not sure how many ordinary customers can just take off for 14 days with that short of notice, but we are not those people . They are telling me that we if want to reschedule anytime after June we would have to pay an additional change fee of $200 for each ticket!Pretty ridiculous! Italy is currently at a Level 4 for the virus, the President of the United States has said not to travel there and American Airlines is setting these fees and travel deadlines.Do not use this airlines. Horrible customer service!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"Shame on you, American...money shaming!","Extremely rude ticketing attendance complaining that I hadn't gotten a more expensive ticket!!!! You have no idea what anyone's circumstances are. How dare you! Is this what American stands for now? Management, you stink."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flights,"The Harrisburg airport is delightfully small and a pleasure to fly from, but for the over-zealous TSA agent on scanner. My American flights were full but pleasant.  Although the seats in rear of the aircraft do lack adequate spacing between seats.  My return flights from Bozeman via Chicago O'Hare were shocking in how few passengers were on board.  Hence, I got the easy upgrades to First Class.  The Bozeman airport is likewise pleasantly small and far more enjoyable than the large airports.  I am always happy with service on board American, but do not like how frequently American changes my reservations after I have booked flights."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,vacation 2020,easy check in at O'Hare & Cancun.  Helpful and friendly staff at both airports. the seats were comfortable and each seat had a screen. the flight attendants were attentive.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Everything great but seat comfort.,"A couple of months ago I flew in the exit row of the frontier plane. It was more comfortable than the first class seat I had in the Boeing 767 that we flew on in February. They only comfortable with the position was sitting up with a slight decline in the seat back. You can’t lift the leg rest up high enough, so it feels like your body wants to slide diagonally down to the floor. Lying flat was very uncomfortable as the seat was very narrow and my feet didn’t fit in the compartment. I had to keep them in the same position the whole time.I would much rather have the old-fashioned wide first class seats. I will try to avoid flying in this plane in the future. The armrest was also very narrow and the tray tables were awkward to take out and put away. It was like a puzzle. I don’t know who designed this, but it was not thought through. They only played children’s movies at a time which wasn’t even during school break. The screen was too far away to say so I just ended up reading my book."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Last leg of vacation,Apart from the delay in departure everything was well communicated to passengers and the flight was good.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Overall the flight experiance was fine.,"The flight was from El Paso, TX to Naha, Okinawa, Japan. Our major issue was coming and going through Toyoko, Japan. The language barrior was vary hard to deal with. No one could assist us with where we needed to go to get to our connecting flights. The personnel that we came into contact with from the exit of the plane, through the customs and even the bus driver gave us false information concerning where we needed to go. We were taken to a different terminal and got off at the wrong bldg. Almost missed our flights going over and coming back. Terrible experiance dealing with flight and information attendees."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great departure  path directly over the Golden Gate Bridge,Had a great departure path directly over the Golden Gate Bridge. This unusual departure from SFO allowed for some awesome views of my former home.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Overall a good flight,Enjoyed the aeroplane and thought the tv seat to seat chat was great as it meant I could talk to my friends and there was a big range of films to watch. I haven’t been on that many planes but it was lovely. The only fault that i would have was that there wasn’t that much leg room especially as we had to put our bags under seats instead of in the hold.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent flight,"Recent flight from El Paso, TX to NYC/LaGuardia airport with a change at DFW.  Flight was pleasant, great crew.  Transfer at DFW was easy.  Flight from DFW to LGA was great, again, crew was excellent, professional and friendly.  My checked bag arrived quickly."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great uneventful flight,Wonderful service by our flight attendants. They were accommodating and attentive. Departure and arrival was on time.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Comfortable seat and great entertainment choices,"Comfortable seat, good crew, tasty sandwich mini lunch, and great entertainment choices ( new and classic movies, music,TV )"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Marginal service,On a recent AA flight from Cozumel. I checked in with baggage 3 hours in advance and found out my bags never made flight.  Was emailed at Newark and spoke to AA representatives who were less than helpful in my situation.  The spoke in a demeaning manner to me and condescending.  The next day the bags arrived and they had been “inspected” and all my possessions were strewn about in bag.  Again represetives stayted in effect so what.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"Early, But Loud","My flight going was decent. We were early, I was seated near the wings, and the flight was smooth. All went well despite the crying toddlers that pushed and kicked my seat the entire flight. Coming back I was seated in the last room near the rest rooms. That was the worst flight I have ever had. The entire plane congregated next to me for their turn to the bathroom, the flight attendants hit me twice with the snack cart, and getting back in to NYC felt as if I were on the rollercoasters at Six Flags."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good airline with decent flights,"American Airlines usually has good planes (good condition - not the best, but not the worst.  Service is pretty good.  Drink/snack choices are good.  Free Wi-Fi is one of their best perks.  However, their airline prices have been quite high.  I never see them go down and are not lower during low peak times.  Other airlines seemed to adjust their fares accordingly.  I do like able to earn free miles, but it's taking awhile.  Maybe look at the rewards program and offer more points per flight, that we don't have to pay extra for.   I like opportunities to upgrade, also."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Overnight flight,"Like this trip, especially innFirst Class, for sleeping on the 7 hr flight back to the mainland! First class is plush with lots of service, a nice meal and liquor! But the best is being able to recline for sleeping! I was able to wake and function the next day! Just wish the price was cheaper! 💲💲💲💲💲"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very good...,Our flight from Grand Cayman to Charlotte was very good. Nothing fancy but you cannot beat the convenience and price.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Less seat width, less comfort, less service; no food, no seatback screen","American has reached a new low in comfort.  The seats are VERY narrow and seem a bit firmer than before.  They have removed the seat back screens for entertainment so be sure to download their app before yuou fly.  then, if you can get it to work, you can watch a large number of films on your phone.  No food was offered on our flight to Mexico.  The staff tried to be pleasant, but had to struggle up and down the very narrow aisle.  The bathroom was the smallest that I have ever seen anywhere.  The passengers seated in the back rows near the bathroom had to endure the constant crush of people waiting in line for the bathroom."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Economy premium on a number of domestic flights in the US,"I have flown AA a lot, in first and economy, but my wife and I, when travelling around the US this winter, chose economy premium for all flights.I am a lifetime gold member in one of the One World Alliance European airlines, and perks valid on that airline are also valid on American (lots of baggage for free, the use of lounges with a guest, priority boarding, free selection of seats and probably more).Thus only difference between our situatition and thos ein first, are the seats, the catering and quality of wine on the flight.American Airlines have a modern and spicandspan fleet, smooth handling of priority check in etc., and if they could upgrade their lounges to that of O'Hare domestic, they would be way ahead in my opinion."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good experience today ,I used to use America Airlines all the time and haven’t for a few years. This was an American Eagle service and have to say it was flawless! Crew well turned out and friendly. Plane clean. On time and no problems. Well done AA!
Date of travel: March 2020,20,American Airlines - Avoid at All Costs,"Typically we love flying, and spend a lot of time and money traveling. We won't be spending that with American Airlines anymore, and will be diverting our future travel plans from them for both business and leisure.The flight home to Detroit from PHX (an easy flight for most airlines) was a nightmare. The air was off upon entering the plane, turning the inside of the cabin into an oven. Everyone was incredibly uncomfortable.  After sitting on the tarmac for 45 minutes after departure time, we had to rock at the terminal again for maintenance issues (their planes look and feel VERY old - see their ashtrays still on the seat arms). After sitting another 30-40mins (and the AC being turned off again), we were forced to deboard. They eventually ushered us to another plane saying it'd only be a few minutes. That time changed again and again, becoming further delayed. As we we're boarding the second plane, the agents forced my wife to check her bag. When asked why we had to check it this time when her carry-on had fit previously, we were told very bluntly and without apology that the plane was a different design and we'd have to get it at baggage claim. We had really been trying to avoid this since we needed to get home early so we wouldn't have to pay the sitter for overtime and have full-time jobs to get to early in the morning. We get on the plane, and there are many bags that are much bigger than my wife's tiny carry-on - some of which was large photography equipment.We were told we'd be leaving at 3:30pm, yet I am writing this review from the terminal docking area and it is almost 4:30pm. Still waiting, and hoping to leave.In closing, American Airlines is an out of date and discourteous airline. This is not the first time we've been burned by them, but it will be the last. I will not have my sales teams take their sub-par planes anymore, and I will not travel through them for my personal trips either. If you're a traveler or own a business, I highly recommend you stay away from American Airlines."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Economy Class and got economy service.,Little service but I paid a low fare.  No complaints just be advised you get what you pay for on this flight.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Smaller and smaller seats,"The seats keep getting smaller and smaller. I don’t know how much more they can squeeze us. We pay for extra leg room, but the seats are still narrow.  Soon, they’ll charge for extra hip room. Traveling isn’t fun anymore."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Will not fly American Airlines again,We have a flight from Grenada to detroit with a stopover in Miami. We had a two hour layover plenty of time to get through customs but not with American Airlines. Delayed one hour on the take off and another 15 minutes on the runway. Luggage took over 50 minutes to pick up. By the time we got to re-checking our bags they put us in the canceled flight line they did not even try to get us to our plane. When we were in the rechecking area three of the agents were making fun of the passengers and making really crude rude remarks about them. Unprofessional all the way around
Date of travel: January 2020,50,A great start and end to our vacation.,We travel to Aruba every winter and always choose American Airlines. The attendants are cheerful and attentive. The meals are excellent.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,If I could give them zero stars I would.,Worst airline ever. They have a huge monopoly and take advantage of people by purposefully bumping them and re-selling seats for more money then putting the people they bumped on cheaper flights. I have heard from multiple who work for American Airlines that this is what they do. They pay a fee at local hotels monthly so the room at these hotels are already paid for so they have no problem delaying you and putting you in a hotel that they would have payed for anyways. Our incoming flight was delayed by almost 2 hours. We ran from our airport terminal to where we had just landed to our connecting flights airport terminal where we and 13 other people on the same flight were told they had just closed the gate and there was no way we could get on the plane and that they had tried to delay it 10 mins for us to make it. We then spoke to an AA employee and they told us that the company had decided at 7pm that they were going to make sure we weren’t going to make our flight and cause “fake delays” to make it look like it wasn’t their fault so they could re-sell our seats to make a profit. I cannot day enough bad things about this airline. Avoid at all costs!!!!
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Mr,"American air totally sucks! If I could give zero stars I would.  Daughter got sick, couldn't fly as scheduled.  American simply took our money.  No help whatsoever. Wouldn't help reschedule and also cancelled our return trip. Simply took the money. Never ever fly American.  They definitely don't deserve the name American. I'd love for an attorney to sue the __+- out of them."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Not great as expected,Service overall is not hoto the mark. Food and beverages had limitations.particular  Beer was finished halfway and customers asked to switch. There can be better way to manage this.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Beats walking or driving,A 9 hour non stop flight which is around the corner by international standards. Enough room so that economy passengers could move around to unoccupied seats. Round trip to SCL only. Mid week flights which were about 80% to 85% full.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Smooth,"I’m not sure why one boards first as I find it awkward avoiding the myriad looks given consciously or not at those already seated. The attendant trying to take drink orders and then deliver them with the entire rest of the plane trying to get by and seated. Doesn’t make sense.The service was good, food hot, cookies perfect."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,American Airlines Chicago check in crew K20 T3 9:55am 3/1/20,My wife and I had a 9:55am flight out of Chicago to Cabo that I made us late for. They boarded at 9:30am and we arrived running at 9:45am. The woman at the counter who checked us in was terribly rude to the point of crossing the line by making a comment to us ( You have to be more of an adult and pay attention to your time). Then another crew member at the bottom of the ramp also was very rude to us. We sat down and the plane still didn’t leave for another 10 minutes. Their attitude was completely unnecessary. At the price we pay for first class tickets I expect a much higher level of service. There are several other airlines we can fly and after this experience we quite possibly will change. I don’t care so much if someone is rude to me but to be rude to my wife who isn’t a child (64) is completely unacceptable. I will not stop with just writing this review I will tell everyone I know how we were treated. I will end this review with a personal note. If they would have taken just a moment to find out why we were late my wife would have told them that I was in the bathroom for 30 minutes vomiting up my breakfast from my previous American Airline flight. I felt better immediately but I certainly didn’t expect the unkind reception we received at the Gate. And the Captain just announce that we will be landing early. So all that nastiness for what.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,no problems with flights,"All flights were on time, both leaving and arriving. If I had one thing to say it would be that as passengers, we are able to take 1 carry on and 1 small bag. There should be room enough for everyone's. yet on all flights, the staff of the airlines were asking for people to voluntarily check in their carry-on or if there were not enough volunteers, people from late boarding customers would be made to check their carry-on's. This should not happen. I only had 1 small bag and my husband had his carry on that would not have been able to be checked, so it didn't affect us. But I think it is poor preparation on part of the airline."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent Service and a Smooth Flight,This was the first time I’ve used the American direct flight from Indy to Miami. The Indy Airport is well organized so parking and baggage checkin was a breeze.   Once we arrived at the gate all went well.   They said the flight was full and offered to check any carryon bags we had.   We opted to do that and within seconds we were set.  Flight attendants were efficient and got us ready to takeoff.  Flight was smooth and when we hit some turbulence they hit seatbelt light and must have made some attitude adjustments as it quickly settled down.  Landing was great as well.   Nice experience and loved having the direct flight.   Would definitely pay extra for that again.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"On time, friendly skies","Great flight. On time, friendly and helpful flight attendants. The flight crew was great, especially for flying on economy."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,American Flight - Second Leg,This is the second leg of our AA trip from Tampa to New York. As with the first leg of the trip both the flight itself and the crew were very good.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,US Airline of Choice,"This is the first of a two leg trip from Tampa to New York. We always fly AA within the US, and both the flight and crew were very good."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worst airline I have ever seen.,Terrible experience. They didn't bother to change my luggage from their own airline on connecting flights. I have to stay on the chair in night at airport. They take extra 30+40 dollars charge for my second bag which is not that big to carry as carry bag. Overall worst experience ever.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,The worst airline,"American Airlines is probably the worst airline out there these days. Ever since merging with USAir, they have tried to tell people that fares are cheaper and flights are better, but the opposite is true.  They don’t care about passengers at all and fares have only gone up; unfortunately, they have a lock on certain airports like Charlotte, and people don’t have a choice, but one day hopefully they’ll feel the wrath of the fact that everybody hates American Airlines."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Flight to St Maartin from Charlotte,"Flight was delayed by 3 hours because a switch cover in the cockpit was broken and they could get a replacement. It was a cover, the switch was fine. The pilot said he wanted to make sure it wasn't accidentally turned on. Why couldn't they just put some duck tape over it. No food on the plane, no drinks served. Just sitting on the plane at the gate. After 2 hours they said if you want to get off and get some food, you can but you have to bring all your belonging and luggage with you. Crazy."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Poor organization, staff does not care","Worst experience I've ever had on an airline. We landed on time in Chicago; however, our gate was occupied, and we sat on the tarmac for over an hour. This delay caused us to miss our next flight to Calgary. Unfortunately, this was my honeymoon, and we will now miss a whole night in Banff National Park. We lost $250 on our hotel for the night. I was so looking forward to this trip as a way to celebrate our love, and arriving under these circumstances was incredibly stressful. Additionally, by the time we arrive today, our car rental company will have closed. We lost all the money on this car and had to rent another one from the airport at a higher price. I am extremely disappointed in American Airlines. I understand that not all circumstances are in the control of the airline, but this situation was. The airline was not able to find a new gate for us, which lead us to sitting on the tarmac for over an hour.  When we did get assigned a new gate, this gate was also not available. Not only is this wasteful and a poor use of resources, it is extremely disrespectful for the patrons of American Airlines. We also asked about American Airlines holding our next flight for 10 minutes, which would have allowed us to make this flight.  Unfortunately, this was also not permitted.  We ended up in gate L10a and our Calgary flight departed from L8.  Once we got to the door, there was no one at the counter. The jetway was still attached to the plane, and we could see luggage being loaded into the cargo hold. Once someone arrived, he would not reopen the door. The flight to Calgary was delayed by 10 minutes. If American Airlines had just held the plane or reopened the door, we would have made the flight.  We literally watched our plane takeoff because the door could not be re-opened. While we were standing at the desk, we could overheat a flight attendant requesting that a door be re-opened for two other passengers, and the request was granted. When we later went to speak with the customer service representative, she was even surprised they would not reopen the door for us, especially since it was an international flight.  I immediately called the phone number given on the flight (due to more than just us missing our flight), and there was 28-32 minute delay.  I will not be flying American Airlines again in the future. I am incredibly disappointed and upset about this experience.  The entire experience was absolutely unacceptable. The customer service was despicable; there is no individuality for customers on this airline. Everyone continually pushed us off to other departments or staff members. Although we got on a United flight for later that day, it was not direct from Chicago to Calgary. We had to add significant time to our travel day by flying through Denver. Additionally, when we arrive tonight, the road conditions will be more treacherous and dark because of this delay; because of this, we may have to stay in Calgary overnight. We specially booked the originally flight landing around 1pm to prevent having to drive at night. American Airlines used to be my favorite airline to travel; my recent experiences have now made this my least favorite airline. I have traveled to over 12 countries, and I have never had an experience like this before."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Not bad flight,"The flight wasn't bad at all.  The setting was like most US flight, way to crowded but doable.  The pilot got us in early and that was great."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First class that did not feel like it,"Upgraded to First Class so I could sleep on this redeye.  The seat did not recline much.  Worse, the legroom was minimal.  That also meant I had to wake up my neighbor to go to the toilet.  Did not seem to be any improvement (compared to the exit row seat I have previously been on). Most disappointing, especially since for comparable length flights (to Europe) business class  is SO much better."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Booked with BA and ended up with American Airlines,"The flight out was on time and the seating very good after boarding at 09.30 we were served a poor quality meal, one hour later and with the exception of an ice cream the second meal was served 90mins before landing.The return trip was delayed by over 5 hours and the replacement crew gave the impression that everything was to much trouble and could not even answer basic questions from passengers  by just walking away and leaving  other passengers to help them with simple tasks like plugging in the earphones or altering the seat controls."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Lost Bag,"Prior to boarding, gate attendant ask for volunteers to check carry on due to full flight. I accepted, Flight connected in Dallas with a 2 hour layover. Baggage Claim discovered my bag made a earlier departure from Dallas and arrive Tucson 2 hours prior to me. After a day I was authorized to buy some  clothes. Phyllis at Tucson Baggage claim called twice to up date me for steps. My bag had been picked up by another passenger and returned to me  six days. Clothing claim was approved."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,A.A. - NOT my first choice when I need to establish flights,Our recent travel A.A. flights to/from Key West A.A. were uneventful and on-time except for the CLT-BNA flight - over 1hr. delayed.  A.A. offers basic economy - their cheapest type of service - NO early selection of seats (A.A. assigns at check-in) and traveler pays $30/checked bag.  Will only fly A.A. when no other airline service is available.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A Nice Flight.,"Our flight was pleasant and uneventful. We left and arrived close to on-time. We sat in the 2nd of 2 emergency exit rows which gave us extra leg room, reclining seats and priority boarding. The in-flight crew was pleasant"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nice flight. Nice Crew,"We had a nice flight. It left about 20-30 minuntes late due to the late arrival of the inbound flight. But, the ground crew prepared and boarded us quite soon after the arrival of that flight. Otherwise, the flight was uneventful and flew without additional delay.We sat in the 2nd of 2 Emergency Exit rows. The gave us extra leg room, reclining seats and priority group boarding.I used my laptop to connect to and watch the on-board entertainment. There were no seat-back monitors on this flight to watch entertainment."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Service has gone downhill and seats are WAY TOO SMALL (no legroom),"I have been flying for decades, but must admit that airlines are reaching the bottom of the barrel these days.  Legroom is almost non-existent and given somebody ahead of you reclining, you have NO space to yourself.  There is also NO way they can evacuate a flight in 90 seconds given the current setup.  My last flight on Icelandic Air was much nicer and I'm flying them again this year.   I will avoid American whenever possible.  PS....they also removed seatback entertainment and their advertised streaming service didn't work either."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Keys,Flight was nice going to the Keys...nice to have the extra leg room of the premium economy.   Movies in the seat back was great too.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Used air miles,"All good on this flight. On time, good service, nice plane. Not much else to say. Lean back and get ready to ski!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Cancelled flights happen. How do you respond?,"Upon landing on the  most cramped airplane ever from San Antonio, I get the text that our connecting flight was cancelled. By the time we could deplane, the earliest AA could get us to Cancun was 2 DAYS LATER.  We had friends on the ground in Cancun waiting for us since we had the van and house keys where we were staying for the week. There were over 60 people in line trying to figure out what to do,  the kiosks wouldn't help,  so I found a flight leaving 3 hours later out of Ft Lauderdale on Southwest. After failing to locate our luggage, we Ubered the 45 minutes to FLL and made the SW flight. Our luggage arrived 1 1/2 days later - but only the Customer Assistance person in the Cancun airport seemed genuinely sympathetic, and I credit her with getting our luggage to us. Once we got back to the states (after a delayed flight from CUN to DFW & scrambling to find another flight to get back to SA), AA refunded the price of our cancelled flight - a fraction of the cost of our SW flight. They did also give me 2 vouchers for $150 - but of course, that will mean we'll have to fly on them again.  Right now, that's the last thing I want to do!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,MDA trip,Everything was fine until you get to St Louis and you have to wait 30-40 min to get luggage. Either American or Lambert airport need toHave more staff on hand to transfer luggage.  When we fly Southwest it takes 5-10 min at most.  Plus you get two bags FREE pp and don’t have to pay $30 per bag.   SW even takes golf clubs for free
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Awful Airline Experience,There was mechanical failure on a plane at the gate causing me to miss my connector. I was put on stand by on the next two flights out. Both flights were booked and I had to speak to a manager to get a hotel to get on the next flight out. If I didnt talk to a manager I wouldve spent the night sleeping in the airport.  Save your money dont fly American Airlines.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Brilliant!,Had an excellent trip! American Airlines’ staff were incredible. The plane from Miami to San Antonio and from San Antonio to Dallas were fantastic! So impressed with this airline!
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Awful international trip LAX to Aukland, NZ","My friend and I planned a dream trip with cruise of New Zealand and Australia. We booked business class and had two adjoining seats  on all flights.  As we were ready to board our flight from LAX to AKL, my friend was called to the desk and was informed that she was being bumped from business class (which she had paid for) to economy plus and could only give her a $600 voucher (the most they said they were allowed to offer).  The alternate seat they provided was next to the bathroom.  Her flight was miserable and we both were furious!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Extra customer service,"Our flight leaving NO was dleayed taking off by 45 minutes.  That cut the transfer time in Miami to about 15 minutes.  We were sure we'd miss the connecting flight to Cozumel.  Arriving at Miami, a airline rep stood with a sign looking for Cozumel passengers.  We were the only 2.  She escorted us through the busy airport, to the tram, boarded with us, and took us right to the gate, insuring we did not miss the flight.  And our luggage made it our final destination with us!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,poor service,Fly about every 7-10 days. Credit card with them and most flights to my destination. Over 50% always a problem. My compensation has been terrible with no good resolve.I have had them cancel break down... had to buy tickets on other airlines with customer service doing little to nothing but a few points that equate to Nothing after I spent money to get to where I needed to go !!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Amazing service from Los Cabos to O'hare airport,We traveled from Los Cabos to Chicago O'hare airport.  Our service was awesome!!!    The whole flight crew was wonderful.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Confused customer service,"American airlines has a confused bunch of poor agents! Rebooking due to weather was ok however nothing worked everything was oversold and a 3 hour journey took over 12 hours? 'perhaps come back tommorow"" not possible was attending a funeral. Truly nobody cares from American. I am s frequent business travler ."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,SOME POOR DESIGN FEATURES,"Newer 787 with lay flat BC seats.  Amazing how many things jut out to poke you.  Don't understand all the angled sharp corners.  Seats should be designed for sleeping.Good cabin crew, Boeing design needs work on comfort."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Christmas present to myself,"Decided to spend Christmas with my sister in Texas so when booking my flight I was able to get first class tickets for just $200 more than I was already going to spend so I said why not.  Going to Dallas was quite the let down. They did not have the seat back tv's so if you wanted to watch something you had to do it on your own device BUT they did not have anywhere to plug in your device so if you did watch something it could be charged. The breakfast served was mediocre at best. It was not all bad - Free drinks in actual glassware, the food was served on plates and you got real silverware. The seats were a good size and there was plenty of leg room and as someone who has long legs that was a definite plus. Also the first on the plane and the first off the plane!!  Coming back was much better as there was the inseat tv so I was able to watch movies from quite a large selection. Their food however is rather mediocre at best.  As long as it is not more than $800 round trip to fly in first class I don't see the it being worth the cost."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Quiet ride,Boarding and ride was a pleasant one. Everyone on board was cordial and attendants were very helpful.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Got me there in time!,"After a weather delay which caused my fight to be delayed, I experienced another 45 minute wait at the gate in Milwaukee. The plane needed to be deiced twice. I had a connection in Philly to go to Baltimore. I kept thinking I was going to miss my connection. Somehow the pilot made up the time in the air. We landed, got off the plane...walked straight across to my connecting flight that was boarding across the aisle! Hooray!! Thank you American you made my day!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Pretty average trans Atlantic flight in business,"This 8 hour overnight flight was not the most comfortable trans Atlantic we have done. Despite being on an Boeing 777 and having fully reclining bed-seats, there is not much room for anyone over 6ft tall.  Furthermore, the footwell tapers down to a narrow point, so your feet get squashed together.In flight entertainment was acceptable and the catering was adequate, but in-flight service was at best average, with the cabin crew being almost put out of their way to be of service.  As with many flights now, the cabin crew disappeared quite early into the flight. One of the most frustrating aspects was that we were in transit, but had to be processed by US Immigration; this took virtually a hour to get through, as most of the gates were not manned."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Wonderful flight .,On time friendly staff Great movies to watch Service with a smile   great business seats .Wow  Mife had short ribs as her dinner .She said it was delicious  American is our # 1 airline
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Hobsons Choice and not as higher standard as expected,"Flew form Belize City to Miami on our way back to London. Overall, this leg did not impress us and we had to get through US Immigration...Despite being business class, the seats did not have much leg room.  Fortunately there was some reasonable in flight entertainment and refreshments. Check in was frustrating as the desk was more concerned about sorting out upgrades and stand-bys than getting passengers on board, but this is probably ""the American way""."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Beware Miami Airport,"There being little real choice, we flew once again with American Airlines to Miami, although I have written earlier that along with BA they must be one of the world’s worst airlines. However, whilst our flight was no worse than expected, I want to warn other travelers of the fate that awaits you in Miami Airport after your 10 hour journey Having paid and obtained our ESTA visas before leaving home, we still had first to queue for half an hour before reaching one of the machines that issues you with a form to present to an Immigration Officer. Next we had to join another queue for 2. and a half hours before we were cleared to proceed through Customs. My husband suffers with acute pain in his back and legs if he has to stand too long. Others in the queue had connecting flights: no provision was made to expedite their cases. There were fretful, little children in the queue- nobody cared at all. Despite what they could see before their eyes, the Immigration Officers seemed to make no attempt at all to work a little faster or more efficiently. We observed one who appeared to ‘flirt’ and chat with 3 pretty girls at his station.  Only one third of the Immigration officials booths were manned. When we complained we were told nothing would be done. My husband and I leave the UK behind each Feb/March as we are in the fortunate position of being able to go wherever we feel like for some warm and sunnier weather. This experience at the airport - which we learnt happens regularly - plus the expensive and unpleasant flights to America has put us off Miami and we will not return here. We may only be one couple amongst hundreds of thousands but I think unless the problems are addressed, others will eventually draw the same conclusion. Whilst all this cannot directly be laid at the door of AA, it seems to be symptomatic of passenger treatment. No AA representatives were on hand. So beware and if you can go somewhere else and avoid Miami ‘International’ Airport, do so, as we do now."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,American Airline big lie,"On flight 791 on Friday 2/28/20 we were scheduled to leave at 7am for a arrivial at 7.09am in Vegas. The plane had been sitting out probaly the whole night and no one bothered to check if was good so when they went to check it they said maintience could have it fix in ten and that there was going to be any delay. Then they said okay there is going to 30 minute delay and I asked one of American lousy flight personnel and said that they had the part and it would only be 10 more minute and they 1 hour and the 2 hours and they said they were going to get another plane and after an 1 hour they said it woud cost too much and that they would get a part from another city and it would be there shortly.now they said it will be 2 more hours. so now my flight that was supposes to leave at 7 am is now going to leave at 2pm maybe. American airline isn't going broke because of the corona virus, they are going broke because they are the worst airline out there."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"On time, clean and a safe flight.",Our lights to and from our desitnation were on time and the crews were friendly and professional.Our luggae was not lost which is always a good thing.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,No Beverage Service on Either of Our Connecting Flights,"This flight from Ontario to Los Cabos connected through Phoenix.  We weren't served any beverages on the first leg, and then, we weren't served any beverages on the second leg.  I was parched!  The pilot said the flight was too rough to have a 200 lb cart in the aisle. and it was, for about 2 minutes.  The rest of the flight was fine.  I think they just didn't want to serve beverages.  I've been on other airlines where the flight attendants take order by hand and bring the drinks to each passenger.  There is an American employee at Ontario named Valerie who was fabulous.  She did everything from disinfecting the kiosk touch screens to checking our carryons."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Like all airlines, they nickel and dime you for everything.","The flight over all was good in both directions.Flew to JAX and flew home from PBI.Both flights departed on time except for the usual tarmac delays in PHL.I think the average of the flight attendants on the flight to JAX had to be 60 or so and that was because the special people in first class had a much younger women catering to to them.I use the AA credit card for flying only since the annual fee covers baggage cost.But you still stand in the pion line after they move the magical divider from the preferred class.So you board in group 5, which is better then nothing.Will I fly AA again? Only when I have to.Get this. I am flying out to LAX and the round trip was 600+ at the time you want to travel. Coming back to PHL on a flight suitable to me? The price jumped to over 1000+. So I will fly SW and the bags fly free (for now)."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,It got me there,The flight got me there on time and with checked baggage.  It was a bumpy flight due to a cold front.  Pilot and crew handled it well.Seatbelt buckle has something sticky on it so had to clean it with a paper towel as soon as I could get to a restroom.  Too many passengers brought in carry ons that had to be checked before we could leave.  This flight was after having to cancel a flight at the last minute around Christmas due to illness at the other end.  Lost most of the fare on the flight so am now planning to switch to Southwest as much as possible.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,A pleasant direct flight,"My husband and I flew from Chicago O'Hare to St. Lucia. As always AA's flight was on time, the flight attendants are very polite and they do actually have the latest movies to play. This was the only direct flight to St. Lucia from Chicago O'Hare. We stopped flying other airlines, because of their constant delays and old aircrafts. Plus, AA allow a carry on and a personal item at no extra charge on all of their flights"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,On-time service with good in-cabin attention.,"Flew American Airlines up to NYC for Valentine's day weekend. No issues with any of the process. Boarding was timely and the flight attendants (particularly Tony who attended to the first class cabin) were all very professional, courteous, and attentive. The American terminal in LGA is still a mess (due to on-going construction) but is navigable out to the limo pick-up point."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great staff and amenities,Great service and very friendly flight attendants on our flight! We felt welcomed and really appreciated their help. Comfy seats and good selection in entertaintment.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,nothing special,"This review starts with National Airport, which was a mess when we were there. The place to check your bags was weird. We got in a long line and waited and waited. Finally get to the front and the lady tells us we needed to print something out at a machine nearby. NOWHERE was that written so anyone could see it. Get out of line, print thing (that she could have easily printed on her terminal), get back in line, finally check bags. She hands them to a lady who is sitting off to the side....I have no confidence at this point that I will ever see my bag again as there is no conveyor belt or anything nearby. Go through TSA, no issues. The American Airlines terminal at National is overcrowded and just plain dirty. Bathrooms are disgusting. No place to sit at the gates. I think I will fly out of Dulles from now on. Boarding was chaotic. People backed up all the way down the gate. Flight was okay. Nothing special. Plane didn't feel especially clean. We wiped down everything before we even took our seats. American needs to up its game on overall experience, service and cleanliness."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Poor service,"Did not enjoy, poor service and long wait times. With the current virus situation the prices are jacked up."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Horrible,"Extremely bad had to be tested for corona, was not allowed to leave for 7 days. Will never take again."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Cruddy old USAirways plane,"You know it's not a good day on American Airlines when the flight attendant is apologizing for the plane.We flew from one hub (DFW) to another hub (ORD) on a Saturday evening departure.  The flight was on an old USAirways A321.  First class seats were low to the ground and uncomfortable, and plugs for electronic devices were nowhere to be found.  As passengers kept asking about outlets, the FA had to keep apologizing for the aircraft.In-flight service was odd.  The flight attendant was nice, but took forever to hand out drinks to the first class passengers.  Nuts were distributed, but were lukewarm by the time they reached each row.  We then got chocolate chip cookies that were so underbaked they could not be eaten; they just felt back into the dish in a gooey mess."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Why is QC on equipment so lax,"Paid for upgraded seats, more leg room. The flight from CTL to GSO had an equipment change from a A320 to an A319, row 7 does not exist on the A319. Reassigned seats in the back of the plane in the same row.This was a Valentine's Day get away arriving in Greenboro a day before and traveling to DC on the 14th.  The departure from GSO to DC did not materialize due to the plane was returned to the hangar twice and no update on a departure time.We had to re-book back to CLT to fly out to DCA with a 6 hour loss of time on 2/14.I spoke with a passenger on the flight to DC who had to spend the night in Charlotte due to equipment failure on his flight that did not leave the gate.Heres an idea - use the added 5.00 for baggage fees to the equipment fund."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,JAX_CLT,"Departing from the Jacksonville, FL international airport terminal is an excellent experience no matter what airline you wind up on.The place is like leaving from your living room. But enough about the JAX terminal.This was an American Eagle flight connecting to BA in Charlotte, NC. Granted, the airplane was a tinker-toy commuter but the crew did a very good job of taking care of all of us on this short flight. They really can't do very much. You could tell the Captain was making up for a bit of lost time but the flight was smooth all the way. First class here in America, not just American Airlines, is a joke. It really doesn't compare to Business Class internationally and it's a shame we've lost that level of cabin service. But when you compare also-rans to also-rans American Airlines offers a reasonable Business Class service unsold as First Class."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,AA carries animals in passenger cabin,"We flew on AA on a US internal flight and found ourselves seated next to a lady with a small, noisy, aggressive dog. The flight was full. Such carriage is prohibited in the UK except for guide dogs and then only under strict conditions. AA response is that passengers with animals have priority over the vast majority of passengers like us with no animals and it is us who would have to alter our flights if we object to animals. They have not responded to questions about flight safety."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Customer service in the dumps,"Flight cancelled due to weather, however, late flight arrival from non weather delays caused our flight to get stuck in weather and AA was not flexible at all in helping you get out on a different flight. Never have I had an airline be so uncaring."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Better service on budget airlines,"I travelled with 2 other adults & 3 children to Orlando via Philadelphia & returned back to Manchester the same way. I expected this airline to give the same great service of other long haul airlines I’ve travelled with, but I was wrong. The cabin crew were mainly miserable on all flights & looked like they didn’t want to be there. On other airlines kids have been given activity packs & the staff interacted with them. On American Airlines they got nothing & no kids meals were available either. I pre ordered a halal meal & vegetarian, both were horrible. The halal meals were all vegetarian, no meat at all. Halal is not vegetarian, it is no pork!! On the flight back to Manchester the inflight entertainment system was not working for the first 2 hours, it finally started working. I flew to Jamaica with holiday firm TUI a few months before this & the service & quality of the flight was much more superior to American Airlines. Even budget airlines such as Ryanair have better staff & service. We won’t be using American again. One positive was the communication. I got regular flight updates via email letting me know our flights were on time, so no delays either. But service onboard really needs to improve."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Recent trip to Cancun, Mexico","I recently traveled to Cancun for a wedding booking connecting flights from Orange County to Dallas then on to Cancun and then back a week later. All the flights on time with well managed boarding. Entertainment, food and service were all excellent. The reason I am writing this review is for one particular flight attendant on my final flight home from Dallas to Orange County who was truly exceptional. I only know her by her first name as Cindy; this lady was so welcoming, attentive and friendly. Always having a beautiful smile on her face and so sincere in making sure I had everything you could possibly need to make my trip comfortable. Cindy is truly an amazing representative of your company and the service you should to want to provide to all of your customers."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Mid-morning flight from Charlotte, NC to Los Angeles, CA","The boarding went well. The aircraft had 6 across seating in economy with comfortable seats and adequate legroom for my 6'2"" frame. The only entertainment provided was on your own device using the airline's app. There was soft drink/snack service for free with the option to get alcohol/meal service for a price. There was substantial turbulence (not the crew's fault). However, we were jostling about for about a minute before the ""fasten seat belt"" sign came on (that is the crew's fault). The flight arrived on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,American is the bottom of the barrel,"This airline is so awful. They has the absolute worst customer service in the business hands down. I fly very often and have only had a couple of decent experiences with them, so I know it is not just a couple of outliers and exceptions. I know stuff happens and flights get delayed, get missed, get cancelled, etc, but it really doesnt matter the circumstance, you will be treated with rudeness and unprofessionalism on a consistent basis if you deal with them. I spent 10 min standing at a counter after I missed my flight (my fault) by 30 seconds. Wasnt asking them to reopen the door, but really wasnt expecting a ""oh you missed that *laugh*"" when I interrupted her conversation with her friend at the desk to see if there was another flight to get on, he glared and told me it was my fault I missed my flight, so I'd just have to wait....wait til what? Until your done laughing with your friend to help me? The other attendant booked me on the next flight and as she was handing me the ticket, the first girl said ""hold up it was his fault, nah he gotta pay"" just like that. Even though there was plenty pf seats available, she went out of her way to show me who was in charge. I'll make sure to avoid American like the plague going forward. What an terrible low class airline"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,November 2016,"It has been 4 years (2016) and I am still angry.   Although I arrived two hours before my flight, it took me 75 minutes to clear the luggage check in line where I was informed they would not let me board the flight because I needed to arrive one hour before.   Sure, the long lines would not have been a problem if the ten check in counters had more than two people working?????    They knew how many flights and how many people were checking in.   INSTEAD, I spent 40 hours in hell.   Did I get an apology?   NO I got an F/U from AA.I have been on 22 flights since then, none of them AA.    Rick Malec"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Awesome,Recently took a trip to Colombia and use American and what a pleasure it was.  Very professional  staff flight on time no charges on luggage perfect.  Thank You so much
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Breakdowns and Delays,Think before you book with American. I traveled from Nashville to Nassau. There were several delayed flights due to maintenance issues. We had to switch gates twice due to broken down planes. Every leg of our flight has been delayed or late. This is concerning. I can’t wait to get home to get away from this airline. Now we are waiting and delayed because the flight crew decides to show up late. REALLY? The entire flight crew is no where to be seen and we were supposed to take off 5 minutes ago. Never again. I would give a zero but that isn’t an option. Sitting at the gate with no crew. What a shame.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Very dirty bathroom with no toilet seat cover for the entire flight.,"The seats were very small, which I expected and was fine with. However, the bathroom on this flight was the dirtiest I have ever experienced. On top of that, there was no toilet seat covers provided for the entire flight, which made the bathroom experience even worse. After this flight, I never want to fly with American Airline again."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight review,"Very good service, on time smooth flight no problems. Plane was clean and flight attendentd were pofessional."

Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Good flight, long wait for baggage","Check in at PHL was good, flight smooth, everything as usual.  Then we go to baggage claim.  It takes 45 minutes for the suitcases to start coming out.  Not a good experience upon arrival in Las Vegas.  Is that the airline or the airport???"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Experience,"We took the Red Eye home.  It was on time, flight attendants attentive and baggage at baggabe claim just a few minutes after we got there.  Very impressive!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First Class treatment in First Class,"I don’t fly for business anymore, and I generally dislike air travel these days. With early check ins, security lines, etc., it’s more of an ordeal that has to be dealt with, than a pleasure. This particular trip, probably because of the flight attendants attention, was a pleasure. It wasn’t a direct flight, but we made our connection easily enough, and had no problems. Thank you American."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Are they ever ontime?,"This is kind of odd since we left about 15 minutes late but arrived 30 minutes early. However we just sat out on the runway for all of that time.  The flight attendants did fine with the drinks service, BUT kept talking about immigration forms but never handed them out leading to MUCH confusion at passport control. I know they are using electronic checks more but it was a bit of a mad house and the flight crew could have help defuse that by a better explanation of what was going to happen."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,American airlines are liers the first time dealing with them and the last time,I was specifically asking before I got tickets if the price includes 1 free checked bag they said yes. As soon I paid it I got an email stating that there is 0 free checked bags. I called them back they said if you want it you need to pay more and I told them if you can't do it you need to refond my money. They said it would take up to 7 days. I told them no I want my money back right away so I can get my ticket somewhere else they said we can't do that I asked to talk to the manager they said the same thing and I asked to talk to the manager's manager they said we can't do anything about it and that they already start the process of refunding the money so now I can't get my ticket anywhere else until then on top of being lied on and they didn't do anything about it even if it was a mistake from their side. I'm never dealing with this company again.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight attendants and pilots were very friendly,"The weather caused the flight to be bumpy, but that was expected.  Attendants were accommodating and friendly."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Mplybon,"American is the way to fly,always friendly people and most of the time as scheduled.If changes that will notify you"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Relaxing flight,The red eye from Honolulu was relaxing and enjoyable as there was no meal service and only a drink service after take off. The extra leg room in economy was worth the extra money! We brought our own food to fill the stomach prior to the drink service so had a relaxing sleep all the way to Los Angeles.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Could have been much better!,"Well, this was not a comfortable flight!  Flight attendants were grumpy, we had meal service and 1 extra pass through the cabin with water.  That was it!  13 plus hours and they served drinks with the food service, but just one extra pass with a cup of water.  Definitely was not the experience we had on United Airlines coming back.  United offered bottles of water and gave us the whole can of soda when you wanted it.  Absolutely look for the United flights!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flight,"I was traveling with my mother who needed wheel chair assistance, comfortable and accessible seating. Miraculously the check in process went smoothly, our seats were comfortable. Accessibility to the bathroom was not as convenient as the closest bathroom was in first class. However, they did have a Handicap bathroom which was surprisingly super roomy! This was one of the few no hassle experiences. I think I rather have the comfort and customer service with American and pay the extra money than with the no frills airlines. The seat was so comfortable compared to my flight back with another airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worst flight experience,"On Feb 12, 2020 I was returning from a trip to Seattle with my son. We were flying from Seattle to Dallas. Our flight got delayed twice for no reason. I've looked at the weather app radar and there were no storms nor any weather inconveniences on the way. When we were supposed to board according to the second delayed scheduled time, there was no actual airplane at the gate, but 45 minutes later an airplane arrives.It was disembarked and it took another 30 minutes to clean it. After we finally boarded around 7:18 PM, we were told every 15 minutes that we were leaving. However, four announcements later and actually 1 hour something after, the pilot finnaly acknowledged that they were fixing the reverse thruster. Long story short we departed 5 hours after the scheduled departing time and landed 4 hours after the scheduled time.Being in the airport for so many hours till 7:18 PM when we physically boarded, we have encountered additional expenses such as; drinks, snacks and an unplanned early dinner. I also had to cancel the initial SUV scheduled to pick us up in Dallas at 9:45PM and schedule another for 11:30PM, then cancel it again and schedule another for 12:45AM which resulted in two additional charges. Then, I had to pay a pet sitting service 2 extra trips to my house to walk my dogs. This was a total nightmare. Not to mention that my son panicked really bad and wanted out of the airplane after realising that they were repairing the airplane and the pilot kept lying to us. He was extremely scared during the whole flight that actually something bad might happen and we should have not accepted flying in an airplane fixed on the tarmac. We did file a complaint with AA for compensation, but were told that if the flight occurred they don't compensate. Was a great learning lesson, in the future will fly Southwest where no one nickel and dime you for baggage and whatnot. AA charges extra for sports equipment on domestic flights. We were told the skis fly free, but for the ski boots we have to pay, even though on the web site it says skis and ski boots are considered one bag and there no fee chart. Couldn't argue with untrained AA personnel in the airport so we paid extra baggage fees. Like I've said, we will avoid American Airlines in the future."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Not the Friendliest Skies,"The staff on the ground was super friendly- they oversold the plane so I volunteered my seat. Just didn’t get that same friendly personality from the flight attendants. 4 flights with layovers and they were all kind of the same- ground crew friendly, flight crew- not so much. I just felt like a bother."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,What a mess,"Nightmare flight. I was tripled booked due to a screw up with ParkatWork and Priceline.  Agents in PDX   checked me in the WRONG flight. Canceling all my reserved seats.  Agents in Charlotte were ZERO help, Priceline and PerksatWork were equally unhelpful.  PDX agent canceling my correct flight screwed up return reservations as I was listed as a no show.  Raleigh Durham Helpdesk at American was awesome .eveeryone else was pathetic  NO USB charging station on a cross country flight.  I will only fly American if I HAVE to."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Flights were great.  No issues, no delays.",No problems with any of the flights. Connections went well.  Service was outstanding coming back from Cancun. I wish I had the name of the crew member that took care of us in First Class on the leg from Dallas to Colorado Springs.  She was great.  She was based out of Miami and this was her first time to Colorado Springs.  I got lucky and she was on the crew the next day when I flew out to Dallas to make connections to Houston for work.  She should be commended for her outstanding service.  Maybe you can look her up.  I was on Flight 2788 to Dallas from COS on Mon 2/17.  I don't remember the flight number from Dallas to COS on 2/16.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,American Airlines saves the day,"When we arrived at the gate for flight 1517 we discovered my passport was missing. The staff got on right away having people search last flight. When an announcement was heard that the passport was found they sent a cart to retrieve it. With in minutes we had it back. American save our holiday. Great staff.Short flight to Miami was good, flight attendants were congenial and service was ok for a short flight. Miami/Roatan economy flight, seats were not too uncomfortable, plane was fairly clean and flight attendants were excellant."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Delayed starts for both flights,I typically fly American Airlines as much as I can.  This trip we flew from Philadelphia to Tampa and four days later flew from Tampa to Philadelphia.  Both flights were delayed for almost an hour.  The flight down we have no idea why we were delayed.  We boarded ontime and then sat and sat.  The flight home we were boarded taken out to the runway and then brought back because of a mechanical problem.  After the rough starts both flights were fine.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Lots of opportunity,AA needs to become competitive with domestic airlines and especially top foreign airlines. Senior management has made seating uncomfortable in economy and slightly better in first. Cost to upgrade to MCE is excessive.  Meal choices are fair.  The website is mediocre.  The bathrooms are unacceptable.  AA is rapidly becoming a second rate airline and surpassed by Delta and an improving United.  Sadly in Charlotte we have only one choice and that is AA.  I hope they can get out of the cellar and return to being a leader in customer focus.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Better Leg Room than United,"American had good things and bad.  First off, the leg room is more, so my husband's and my legs didn't fall asleep on the long flight. We had a family with two small children on the row in front of us, who screamed the whole way from Phoenix to Kauai. While the flight attendants said they had ear buds, they never offered them to those of us sitting around this family and having to listen to hours of screaming.  We didn't even get a decent snack on the long flight and only one glass of something to drink. The days of decent service on an airline are gone. Also, the pilot didn't seem concerned with smooth air, and the flight was bumpy most of the way, but he got us there an hour early.  Had to wait several hours in the cold and rain in Kauai for American Airlines to show up and open their booths."
Date of travel: July 2019,20,AA Advantage Miles Program a Mess,"No problem with direct use of miles for AA flights; however, use of the leftover ""change"" in miles account in response to offer from AA for a Wall Street Journal subscription is no different than tossing them in the trash - actually, it IS different - there is no stress or hassel in tossing them. Since my routes have changes to ""United friendly"" I spent remaining AA Advantage miles for a WSJ one-year subscription last November - result: no contact, no word, no newspaper. In January, called Advantage service, who gave me a different number for the entity that handles its miles for magazines operation. This resulted in leaving a message with them, followed by an email from a ""do not reply"" address telling me the subscription period had been reset, and my first edition would arrive in two weeks. ONE paper did arrive on the predicted date, followed by nothing. Another call produced another email in which an apology was made, and a new date specified. The new date arrived with delivery of that day's WSJ. The following three days saw no newspaper delivered. By this time I had acquired an email for the miles for mags AA operation, and sent a summary of this disappointing experience. The next day, I received an email saying the delivery would resume the next day - however, it also gave me a phone number for the publisher's delivery organization, and advised me to call that number if I experienced any further delivery problems. It came as no surprise that I received a paper the next day, and nothing the following day. My phone call to this new organization included delay from them having difficulty finding any record of my subscription; then an advisement that I had been ""credited"" one day for the missed delivery.  One might opine that, at this point, why complain about American Airlines - the action has moved through other ""players"" - My response is that AA solicited my miles for the WSJ subscription, and then dumped me into a rabbit hole wherein AA's end of the agreement isn't being delivered. It isn't right (especially if you multiply this experience by tens of thousands of others) and I will spend my travel dollar elsewhere in future airline travel (even where an AA route is most convenient.)"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Off to a terrible start,"Flight 996 February 20, 2020. Boarded the 777 aircraft on time, but mechanical difficulties delayed push back by 25 minutes. On push back Flight attendant announced that there would be no inflight entertainment. I expect more from AA. I now feel stupid paying $5,500.00 for my overpriced business class seat. American Airline will offer me some BS miles for my inconvenience that you will never use unless you use double miles. How about a reduction in my airfare, let’s say 10% for my inconvenience. A 10 hour 45 minute flight with no entertainment. AA you can do better. Where’s the back up tablets the use to use? I have been an Executive Platinum for 10 plus years and wish there were other realistic options flying out of DFW. AA just doesn’t CARE!!!!!  Just to add insult to injury I was just informed that they are unable to dim/turn off the cabin lights due to an electrical problem. Over night flight an unable to turn off the lights???? What kind of airline is this?"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great customer service by flight attendant Casey,Our flight was delayed 3 hours. We boarded the plane but ended up staying on plane over 1.5 hrs as we could not take off due to bad weather I'm Toronto.   Casey the FA was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND FRIENDLY AND REALLY MADE THE INCONVENIENCE MORE TOLERABLE.  Great job Casey.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Sputum hacking and spitting flight attendant,"We could hardly believe it ourselves.... who does this, especially when in their professional capacity and as a AA company representative. Whilst in flight , We were in seats 1C & 1D business class. The crew member on 5 or 6 occasions hacked, cleared his throat then spat the sputum at the cabin exit door. When I asked him to stop doing this, he apologised said he had some phlegm...when in disbelief I asked where he was spitting it ... he said “ it’s okay it’s at the door” . I received a apology from AA and offer of $150 if used within 12 mths ( not helpful to us). I just feel this is not satisfactory.... particularly with all the health concerns around the Coronavirus currently."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,good service,"Good service, long flight but the entertainment was great! recommend to everyone, they are very kind!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"Early morning flight from Mobile, AL to Charlotte, NC","When I arrived at the airport the ""departures"" monitor had the wrong gate number. I went to the gate and, after a while, it became clear that there was no flight going out of that gate. Fortunately, Mobile is a small airport and I found the correct gate. There had been no announcement about a gate change and the gate staff member had a ""we are not responsible for the monitors"" attitude. This did not please me. They should have made an announcement. This is not the first time I have encountered this situation with American Airlines. The boarding went well. It was a small plane with 3 across seating throughout. The headroom in the aircraft is inadequate for anyone over 6 feet tall. I had to crouch over and I still hit my head a couple of times. The seats were comfortable with adequate legroom. The only entertainment provided was to use the airline's app on your own device. There was free soft drink/snack service. The flight did arrive on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Old aircraft, tight seats, bored crew",Booked this airfare through a cruise line and ended up with two American legs to get back home. Old aircraft and some of the least legroom I've experienced in years.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,American continue to under deliver ,I don’t get it. For years AA continue to treat the passengers as second class. Awful boarding protocol. Poor onboard service. Others just get it. We pay their salary. I continue to choose just about any other airline unless I don’t have a choice. For the quality of care and service they just don’t match up
Date of travel: December 2019,10,What's best for the company,"There was a weather prediction of an impending snow storm from the first leg from Flagstaff to Phoenix on Christmas Day 2019. The flight was cancelled many hours before it was scheduled to depart. I had to change my flight and drive to Phoenix to catch the Phoenix to Orlando leg as I was going to see my 82 year old father. Cancelling was not an option. The storm did not come and I left Flagstaff with clear skies. These clear skies were all the way down to Phoenix which happened to be the path the flight would have taken. Initially the customer service representative was helpful and told me that my I would get reimbursed for gas and parking for my unexpected driving trip. You can not ask for anything in the form of compensation until your whole trip is over. They refused any compensation and stated the storm was too bad. Lies!!! The kicker is that Flagstaff is very small and I know people who work for the airline here and they stated that the airlines did not want to send that flight because it was not full. I booked this trip 5 months in advance. It ended up costing me double the cost of if I would have driven the 2.5 hours to phoenix and caught the flight. I have flown with them hundreds of times over the years and lately cancellations are happening more often. We have no way  of questioning their cancellations and they can use the ""we don't pay when weather is bad"" excuse any time they want. Hopefully, those who read this will choose another airline as this one is only interested in the company's bottom line. What happened to quality and customer service?"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,A typical trip - no issues other than an hour delay on one flight,Round trip - no isssue other than an hour delay in Charolette for transfer on return flight.  Staff were friendly on all 4 flights.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worst Airline EVER,"This was the third time we have flown American Airlines in the last 4 months and will not EVER fly them again.Flights delayed to the extreme.  This one was so delayed leaving Cabo that about 80% of our flight missed their connections and had to spend the night in Dallas.We flew American due to it being cheaper than the other carrier but for now on, we will pay the additional cost"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Excellent fare,"I was very happy with the fare and the service was as expected, no freebies. The flight was on time on the round trip. The WiFi was very good and recommend that you come prepared with cable for your tablet or Phone and most important bring ear connections"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,If it weren't for our advantage points,This doesn't just apply to this flight but in general. I make a reservation then AA changes the arrangements and I have no say.  This time they changed our return flights and I wound up with a three hour layover but no reduction in fare. The leg room gets smaller each time and the flight home from Miami the crew must have had a bad time of it because they didn't even attempt at being cordial. Oh and one of the bathrooms broke and they gave passengers a hard time for using the bathroom that wasn't according to their ticket but the line was so long that finally the pilot made an announcement that it would be ok to do so🤨
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight to Germany,Everything on time. Flight attendants have been very nice and friendly. Food and beverages offered are great and plenty.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Frequent Flyer Happy!,Consistent service. On time flights. Courteous flight attendants. Clean plane. These are the elements that help a frequent flyer make their lives easier. I appreciate a consistent delivery.

Date of travel: November 2019,40,Pittsburgh to LGA,This is a no frills jet very small; good news it is quick boarding and deplaning.  You barely have time for a service.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,LGA to Pittsburgh on a barbie jet,They do the best they can with the short amount of flying time.  Small jet that you can feel the bumps easier on.  American is one of my favorite airlines to fly.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight attendants,"I had a middle seat in the back of the plain, and after the door closed, I moved to an aisle in the emergency exit row. The flight attendant said I couldn’t switch there, and instead of sending me back to my seat, let me sit in an aisle seat right behind first class. Further, when the drinks and snacks came around, I could not have the snack(dietary reasons). Normally I just say no thank you to the snack, but this time the flight attendant went and gave me the kosher snacks(which are normally sold) for free. 10/10, would recommend. Why can’t all flights be like this one?"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"No announcements, just delays","Sitting here at Gate 3 in Little Rock sleepy eyed having awakened at the crack of dawn to catch a 7am flight to Chicago. I’ve received six or seven texts regarding the flight status, two stating on time departure and the remainder stating delays. You can here the crickets chirping from the gate agent as we have had NO status update announcements. BTW- United Airlines just announced that their flight to Chicago is boarding. AA flight is still delayed with no announcements. Thank you AA for helping me to remember why I should avoid your carrier at all costs. Smh"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Terrible customer service,"I'm not sure if everyone hates their job at AA or they just hire A-holes, but the staff are unfriendly and sometimes flat out rude. They don't smile, they aren't happy to see you and I always feel very unwelcomed when flying with AA. I will only fly with them when I have to (for work), but when I do, I dread having to fly with them. Flying for work sucks anyway, their awful customer service just makes it that much more of a terrible experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Very unprofessional,"I fly all the time— usually Southwest or JetBlue.  American had the only direct to Savannah, so I took it (never again). The flight was delayed 7 times, so when the arrival time was bumped past 1 a.m., I asked to change my ticket. The so-called customer service person was cavalier, did not apologize, & rebooked me on a 5 a.m. flight, with a connection. Grrrreat. When I asked about changing my return flight, she said “ that’s your problem,” even though it was on their airline.  She said it would be $200 to change. This is not how you treat your customers.  Next time I will drive or get a connecting flight with another airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Kid size seats,Narrow seats that put three people shoulder to shoulder with no space between. I am not a large person but find these arrangements uncomfortable for any flights over 2 hrs.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,The worst airline I’ve ever flown on,Our flight got moved 4 times in the course of half an hour. Flight was delayed. Flight boarded off the delayed take off time. Then we sat on the tarmac for an hour waiting to be de iced. Sat on the tarmac for an additional hour and a half waiting for our turn to take off. Large airliners appeared to have no problem with passing us. Currently still sitting livid on the tarmac. If there are no updates you can assume that’s the end of this terrible excursion
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Late morning flight from Dallas/Fort Worth, TX to Mobile, AL",The boarding process went well. The aircraft had 4 across seating in coach with a comfortable seat but poor legroom. The flight was only about 90 minutes. The only entertainment provided was on the airline's app using your own device. The cabin service was good and included a free snack and soft drink. Alcohol and meals are available for a fee. The flight arrived early.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Once great, gone downhill; rude flight attendants","Generally speaking, flight attendants are either ok or rude from my experience. Likewise, there is ineffective customer service. Lags way behind other US-based airlines in most key metrics and has lousy IFE options. Even low low-cost carriers are a better option. Other airlines have free texting and better entertainment. I will not be taking American if I have a choice in my future travels."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Very happy,"The only reason I’ve not awarded 5 out of 5 is simply because I felt the aircraft we were on a 777-200 was in need of a little tlc to the interior. Overall though the flight was on time, smooth trip, nice food and we were well looked after. I would certainly fly American Airlines again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent value for money,"Excellent. Staff were attentive and calm. Great food and efficient service.Flight took off on time and we were kept informed all the way. Films were decent and seats, pillow and blankets were comfy."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,terrible,"in my trips from montego bay to nyc connecting in charlotte ,nc after 1  1/2 hrs delete, with hungry I ask the flight attendant for one more little pretzel and she denied  ""is only one per passenger"" she said. how is that possible when i just spend about 300.00? and i just for extra pretzel. I was very embarrassed, the seat very small , no tv . never ever again; now i know why is so cheap airline"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight was good after 35 min delay,The flight was good once we got the required maintenance done.  It resulted in a delay of about 35 min.   When we got to Grand Cayman we had to circle the airport for a while.  Once we did land they didn’t have a gate for us so we waited another 30 min.  The worst part was going through customs.  Don’t know if it was because planes were late or if it’s normal for a Saturday but it took about 1.5 hrs to get through customs.  They had us walking back and forth like a ride line at Disney world.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good flight with some delays,"While our flight was delayed, everyone from the airlines was good about rebooking.  Our original tickets were in first class, but they insisted on putting us in coach.  My husband was able to ask another representative to put us in first class.  Other than that issue, we had smooth flights."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,we left 30 min. early but ended up landing 2 hrs. late,"not the airlines fault, but the weather kept us from landing in Dallas.  Had to fly to Tulsa to refuel, then fly into DFW after weather cleared."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,messy bathroom,As usual very little leg room for a person 6 ft or taller.  Food on plane pricy  and I had difficulty getting WiFi to keep running
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Why do I put myself through this.,"You are going on vacation, you're excited.  Head to the airport for 6am flight to dallas.  Weather a little rainy and 49 no problem should be good to go but no wait a minute.  Apparently this plane can't fly with the amount of people on it if the weather is wet and under 50 degrees.  After an hour on the plane waiting for temp to rise.  Offers were made to 6 passengers to get off so the rest could continue on apparently that lowered the weight enough to be able to fly. What should have been 3 hours on the plane ended up 5 hours.  Arrive Dallas (two in my party had a tight connection which they missed and rebooked to my flight to Maui) go to gate no plane.  30 minutes from takeoff still no plane announcement made that they were looking for a replacement airplane due to delays with original plane that would have taken us.  Good news you will get to Maui today just don't know when.  We are going to bring you some snacks but feel free to run eat while we find a replacement its probably going to be while.  We popped into a restaurant ordered and just as the food was put in front of us we get the text boarding in 20 minutes lol.  Choked it down and headed back to gate hurry up and wait.  Finally on board prediction for arrival moved out 1 1/2 from original time plane should have got in.  Quick text to friends who were meeting us at airport car rental on different flight to let them know they would have to wait on us or uber to hotel.  Once on board things were fine but in a seating issue my husband and I were not together amazingly enough we were able to fix that with some switching.  Families all over the plane were complaining about seating being changed from their initial choices of being spread all over.   Arrived in Maui thanks.  So surely my return flights will go well.  It's American so that would be a no.  Delays again coming home. Plane on long flight with complimentary entertainment oops its unavailable for who knows what reason.   This is my second trip in 6 months with American and both trips were a pain due to this airline.  My trip in Sept. they just decided not to fly on the day I was to return home so I had to cut a day off my trip to accommodate them or add one which would have added hundreds of dollars to my trip.  They really don't care at all about their customers they know we don't have options especially in small markets.  Oh and before I forget my daughter and 2 year old grandson were seated across aisle from each other American's choice not theirs thankfully day of flight people switched around.  God help them if they even needed to identify who was in what seat since they break your party up and you and other customers make it work. If I had another choice and could afford it I would never fly american again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Early again.,Flight was on time and flew through some bad weather but the pilot kept us informed and there were no issues. Flight attendants were great.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Don’t use,Worst Airline ever. On trip to Florida they didn’t have seats already assigned for Charlotte transfer . Attendant was RUDE ! Acted like we were a bother to assign us seats . We had purchased tickets months prior. Then was snotty and said the “aren’t together. On the trip back was delayed and had to run clear across airport terminal in Charlotte. Will not travel American again
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"No problems, good flight","I have to fly often for work. When I can get to my destination with no delays, no problems, or luggage arrival problem, that's a good flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,1st time on and not the last,"I liked them.  I felt safe and comfortable.  At 6'4"" and large frame that some might call fat, I felt like I had a fair amount of room to stretch.  I mean I know I am on a plane so its all relative, but I felt good."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Terrible Airline - American Airlines.,"We were trying to return from St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands to Toronto with a connection through Charlotte.  Our flight out of St. Thomas was delayed but we still landed with plenty of time to make our connection.  We were held on the plane at the gate because, eligibly, the jetway wasn’t working.  We sprinted to our connecting gate, the plane was still there but they wouldn’t let us on.  Clearly, our seats had been sold.  This was a Saturday night.  We were told the next flight they could book us on was Monday night.  We ended up being placed in a rundown hotel and being sent to Buffalo early the next morning.  We will never fly American Airlines again."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Way to go if flying over 6 hours,"Because this was a business trip and my husband had his airfare paid for; we opted to buy myself (spouse) business/first class ticket but we purchased 9 months ahead of time for cost savings.  FA were attentive & it was wonderful to get rest but mostly on the return red-eye flight which makes a big difference if you have to go to work the next day.  However, be cautious if ordering low calorie meals if you want something substantial.  I opted for the ice cream sundae with hot fudge sauce in the end!"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,"WORST EVERYTHING - SEATS, PERSONNEL, AIRPORT","This airline is only useful because they have the most non stop flights out of Dallas.  Other than that - they are completely heartless, inefficient and immoral.  Their seats are so tight they should only sell them to amputees.  Attitude up the wazoo.  Have to fly through Atlanta?  DON'T!  Unless you would like to feel what prisons are like in North Korea.  Atlanta is the worst airport in the world. Combined with the worst airline in the world - you'll wish you took the bus.  Employees yaking while they overcharge you for baggage.  Employees hanging out near the gate on break laughing like this was a 7/11 store.  Totally unprofessional.  Joke airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Curt Staff, Forced Baggage Check When Significant Overhead Space Available","This is the second flight I've taken recently where I was forced to check my carry on bag. In both instances my bag was within the size limit and there was significant bin space available to accept carry on bags. For anyone whose zone for boarding is later in the process, forced bag check was routine on both of these flights. When I questioned whether I could carry on, because I had tight time frames upon landing, I was told that my bag was oversized. Even with American's very tight bag width limit of 9"" my bag qualified, although I was not given the option to to utilize the measuring device on the most recent flight. In both instances many the bags that had been allowed to board and were stored in the overhead bins were larger than mine. Upon contacting American regarding this inconvenience and also sharing that my brand new, high quality suitcase was broken, obviously due to rough handling, I was given a standard scripted response. I did not feel that the response I received was a sincere concern based apology, nor did it acknowledge Americans reason for this practice. Based on my recent experience, it is obvious to me that for whatever reason American has forced bag check for certain boarding zones, despite significant bin space availability. This causes inconvenience for those of us who wish to carry on our bags. The strict 9"" width limit for bags is not customary when compared to other airlines and certainly does not correspond to the actual size of the overhead bin space that is actually available to store bags. Furthermore, the staff is not friendly and does not convey customer appreciation. As a frequent traveler I will avoid American at all costs. With competitors like JetBlue and Southwest, who make me feel appreciated as a customer and who have never forced me to check my small carry on, there should be little need for me to fly American in the future."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Never again.  Key West TSA worst!!!,"Never again. Search at airport was humiliating and invasive. As a 70+ senior was subjected to bra, purse and bag search. TSA was unhelpful and aggressive. Storms created delays on both legs of trip resulting in packed airports, no seats in waiting room. Final leg DC to LGA was worst. A passenger sat two seats ahead and coughed the entire time, luggage was misdirected and must take a bus to taxis. Do Not use LGA for any reason. This trip cost me a week in bed with a terrible cold. My objections to flying have joined my husband Never Again!!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,A great flight to Australia.,This is the way to fly to Australia. We were able to lay flat and sleep. This is a long flight and I have difficulty sleeping sitting up. The service was great and food was good.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Early morning flight from Los Angeles, CA to Dallas/Fort Worth, TX","The boarding process went well. The aircraft had 6 across seating in economy. The seats were comfortable with adequate legroom for my 6'2"" frame. The only entertainment provided was through the airline's app on your own device. The cabin service was good with free soft drinks and snacks. Alcohol and meals were available for a price. The flight arrived slightly early."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,great flight,"We flew from Charlotte to San Jose, Costa Rica in Jan. this year.  Very nice flight.  ON-time.  FA very attentive.  In-Flight entertainment available with movie screen in seat.  No complaints."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Normally my 1st choice but they dropped the ball this time,"Sunday our MBJ to CLT flight landed on time but we were stuck on the tarmac for about 20 minutes. Then when we got to the gate it was blocked by some equipment according to the captan So we were late. BUT it takes more time than normal to get your bags after a flight from Jamaica. Did not get our bags till 11 minutes AFTER our connecting flight had started boarding. We still had to exit through Customs, turn our bags in for connecting flight, go upstairs, go through TSA and get to the end of concourse C. Boarding had closed before we could get there.This delay was not due to weather but due to poor scheduling on AA part. Customer service ""seemed"" to be helpful and got us on a flight to Akron/Canton (50 miles from CLE. That flight was also late because there was no crew available. Eventually, we got to Akron but our car was in CLE. I decided to get a cab to our home (25 mi from Akron airport and drove to CLE the next morning to get our car. Our bags did not all arrive till Tuesday.  Tried turning our expenses per instructions from Customer Service in CLT but were told that since we accepted a flight to Akron all the costs were on us.   I am Gold for life as a ""Million Miler"" customer. If this is how I am treated I feel sorry for the average person."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Terrible customer service,"Flight leaving SDF was delayed because parked planes were blocking us from leaving gate, total delay of over 1 hour. Several of us then missed connecting flight to Antigua, and none were scheduled for rest of day so we were stuck overnight n Miami. AA customer service agents were terribly rude, unempathetic, and un helpful. The delay was coded in system as weather, and they would not listen to any passengers that they was not the cause. We were not given any vouchers for hotel or food. When asked for suggestions for hotels, was told to leave terminal and google local hotels. Really rude and unprofessional. The agent at AA Eagle was even worse.  Contacting AA via web hasn’t been helpful. AA needs to focus on customer service. Until they make it a priority, find another airline!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Stepping it up,"I was impressed by this last trip on American - it seems they're trying to improve their service, and they don't charge fees to check surfboards (it's a normal checked bag fee) - which goes a long way. The only thing I didn't like is the number of boarding groups seems excessive, and it took quite a while to board."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,AA doesn’t take responsibility for their mistakes,"I had a connecting flight from Milwaukee to Chicago and then on to DCA. My flight was supposed to arrive at the gate on time in Milwaukee, but the plane that was supposed to leave before ours had a mechanical problem and was delayed leaving about 1.5 hours before my flight. Instead of quickly moving my flight to the vacant gate next to ours when American realized the problem, they waited until over an hour AFTER my flight was supposed to leave to move the flight to the gate that was vacant the whole time. Once in the air, things went smoothly until we tried to land in Chicago and had a near-miss collision with another plane. The captain told us we were making our final decent and then suddenly the plane launched up. A few minutes later the captain came on with a not-so-assuring message that we almost collided with another plane but not to worry *long pause* it was safe. Not a great way to feel as we tried to make our second approach at landing. By the time we landed, I had just missed my connecting flight by 20 minutes and there were no more flights until the next day. The attendant at the gate made us wander through the airport to another terminal to find customer service where there was a 50 person line of people waiting to change their reservations due to my entire plane needing new connecting flights since no one was actually going from Milwaukee to Chicago (a relatively short drive). The customer service staff was extremely unapologetic. They didn’t care that we were now stranded for the night, almost died on the plane, or had to wait for over an hour on their line. When I finally got to the customer service agent, they told me here’s a new flight tomorrow and there’s nothing we can do about your 12 hours until the flight. Here’s a discount hotel website you can go to at your own expense. No “sorry” about this, no offer to pay for the hotel due to their mistake with changing the gates, not even a bottle of water. American couldn’t care less. For comparison, when I was delayed just 2 hours on a Delta flight, they at least were super apologetic and gave out free snacks, water, and playing cards at the gate for us, and that was not even a bad situation like this American debacle was. I tried reaching out to customer service twice after the trip and they refused to pay for the hotel, provide any sort of credit, or do anything about the situation. They blamed it on the weather (which really wouldn’t have been an issue if they had just moved my flight when the mechanical problems on the other plane started) and didn’t even offer any sort of apology compensation. The flight was delayed 115 minutes, and only 45 were due to weather (de-icing on the tarmac). The hotel I stayed in that night even cared more about the situation than American did and was apologetic. At the end of the day, if they had just treated me like a human being and taken responsibility by acknowledging the crappy situation they caused, it wouldn’t have been as big of a deal to have to get a hotel at my own expense. You’re just another number to American. And their pilots with their unsafe flying practices think that too. Not flying with them again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Finally a direct flight to Dallas from Sarasota,Could not have been happier with our flight from Sarasota to Dallas. Grandparents day at our grandkids school made this a trip we could not miss.  Had what seemed to be a new E 175. Used points on a holiday weekend which were high but was not disappointed for what we got. Sarasota is usually a piece of cake to fly out of and this time it was no different. What made it even better was how fast we were checked in and got through security in Dallas on the way back. Plane was on time coming and going. We usually drive when we have time to Dallas so we can have our car but this flight was so convenient it may become our new mode of transportation to see our family!
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Direct Flight & On Time,"The flight was standard. No movie screen or headphones offered for music in first class. Considering it is an international flight I thought this should have be a given. If you bring your I pad then you can watch a movie. Otherwise standard flight, some turbulence handled with out issue. Used American because they had a direct flight from PHL."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Pretty non-eventful,"Pretty uneventful - everything on time... they actually moved us from the very back of the plane to the very front (not first class, tho) without us even asking, that was nice. On the first leg, however, they wouldn't move us to sit by each other (anniversary trip) even though the seat next to me was empty (just across the aisle and behind my husband) for the whole flight - that was frustrating..."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,3/4 Great Flight - Last 1/4 Not Quite,"Round Trip: New Orleans - Miami - Roatan, Honduras was good.  Return Roatan - Miama was good.  However, Miami - New Orleans (flight 337) was uncomfortable.  Long time in taxi lane waiting for takeoff (30+ minutes) and pilot had the cabin like a freezer.  The stewardess (flight attendant?) was GLUED to her cell phone during the wait and couldn't be bothered with the passengers at all; she might have seen almost every passenger digging for something warmer to wear or responded to my request to have the pilot turn the A/C off/warmer - but cell phone took precedence over all.  I kept watching her to see if she would occasionally look up - didn't happen.  Once airborne, the cabin gradually warmed up to a reasonable level. With the basic economy, the seats were tight - but 2 fairly short time flights each way, so not too uncomfortable.  AA is pretty generous with carry on and ""personal item"" baggage and that helps.  Really excellent ticket price, too."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,14 hour flight with no food for my husband,"We were actually in the class above regular economy - still in that economy section but with extra legroom (but not Premium Economy). Unfortunately, the economy seats on this aircraft do not recline more than a half inch, if that, and was very uncomfortable on such a long flight and me caused neck issues when trying to sleep. (We were NOT in a row where this reclining issue would normally occur, like right in front of an exit, or the back row.)  But the main issue was that in spite of a detailed phone call with an agent several days before, and an assurance that all would be handled, my husband's special vegan meal did not make it to the ""list"" on the plane, and they had no food for him for the flight other than a regular meal he would not eat. We were informed of this by a rather harried and not very helpful flight attendant, who basically said to take it up with Corporate, which is of course no help on the actual flight. Another flight attendant managed to scrounge up some potato chips and fruit for him later on, but otherwise there was nothing for him to eat except some nuts he'd brought along. To me, this is terrible customer service. To be fair, my gluten free meal was just fine, and the regular meals of our traveling companions were quite good, according to them. I had also spoken, in that same conversation, about possibly using my CPAP on board. I was assured that someone from Special Assistance would call me before the flight. That never happened, and since we were traveling the few days before, I wasn't able to call them again. So again, their customer service is really problematic. I did contact Corporate with these issues, and they apologized and offered us miles to compensate. I really can't complain about their response time or their response but of course this did nothing to help us during the flight. They really need to improve whatever system they have for taking information from passengers pre-flight and following through with what they've been told."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy Breezy,"Great flight attendants, very attentive to passengers. Smooth flight, no delays. Food is mediocre but not really on flight for food, although warm cookies are great!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Trip to Sin City,"All in all an average flight experience. Bags were not lost, flight not too bumpy, flight attendants courteous. We always try to get priority seating just for the bag situation. Fellow passengers a bit grumpy but that's per usual. The prices were ridiculously high but coming out of Corpus it's expected. Not a lot of choices. Always enjoy the luxury of having entertainment available on the flight from DFW to Vegas. Makes the flight go so much quicker & enjoyable. Watched The Joker, Charlie's Angels & a bit of Rocketman."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Tight,The flight is a bit long for the for the seats comfort the food has become what I called airplane food poor selection and quality for the price myself I bring my own the stewards were excellent very attentive at all times I still like the flight but American Airlines and some other airlines pouring profits over comfort.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Boulder,"Cross winds caused us to miss our connecting flights, but we were able to rebook a direct flight that same day. American Airlines was very helpful in retrieving our bags so they could be on the same plane we ended up on. This was very helpful and something we were not sure would happen. The return flight was seamless and very comfortable."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Average Flight,"Pretty good average flight on commuter jet from Phoenix to Fresno for business in February. Sat in aisle seat, in a 2x2 jet.It's the only direct flight from Phoenix. Very costly flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,"Dude, where's my seat?","My husband had an errand in Montego Bay so we opted to pay extra for seats up front in row 8 to deplane faster. When we got to the airport we were in separate rows in the back of the plane. The reason? Equipment change and row 8 was now first class. We were not given the courtesy of being notified until we saw the row numbers on our boarding passes.Customer service was very unhelpful and said we'd get our money back. And we did: after we returned from our trip and I got online to file a refund request.American being the only choice for a non-stop flight to Montego Bay from Philly for most of the season (Frontier starts up their flights in mid-February for some crazy reason) they don't care, they're the only game in town."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Nothing Special,"First part of trip was fine from Manchester. In direct flight via Philadelpia, Passengers had started to board plane when it was announced that there was a problem and gate change to a different terminal. OK it happens got to gate to be told we had to go across the airport to another gate next to the original and obviously this caused a delay.On return we had upgraded to premium economy, when checking in at a kiosk we were allocated seats in different Isles. Twice we asked if this could be changed and was told no. We were also told we were sitting in extra leg room seats. When we got on the plane this was not true the American airline staff had actually lied! Again the flight was indirect and atleast in the 2nd leg we were together but I wouldn't pay for premium with American again. Staff were rude,lied it was nothing special at all."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,No Personal Space - No Legroom - No Surprise,"We usually pay to upgrade for extra legroom (or exit row), or business class when possible. This is simply because the space and legroom in American Economy class is so go egregiously inadequate. Sadly, we were not able to upgrade on our initial segment from BOS to MIA, and the flight was close to full. The seating was so tight, it was difficult to sufficiently move to use the AC plugs located near the floor. This is not an exaggeration, it is the reality, and I'm just an average height and weight. Their entertainment system wasn't working correctly on my laptop (flash issues?) and I gave up. Free WiFi? Get serious.Ironically, I received a survey from American after my flight. They provided a box for comments at the end of the survey. My comment was as follows: If American wants to understand the service they provide, have their executives fly economy! I can't say American is much worse than some of the other airlines we use. JetBlue used to be better, but they are now comparable to American. We recently flow Aer Lingus, an equally mediocre airline. The best we've used recently was Alaska Air, which seems to be a notch above those mentioned.Our second segment from MIA to Curacao we upgraded to Business. It's much better in business, though certainly not impressive. There is adequate space and legroom. A hot meal is served, and it's a quieter and more relaxing environment. It's fine. I just wish the airlines didn't treat economy as ""3rd class steerage"". The airlines are making record profits at the expense of treating most of their passengers poorly!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Returning home to Spain from NYC after Xmas,2nd time we've flown this route with American Airlines. First class service from the time we entered the lounge at JFK.

We were surprised with the legroom space and was very comfortable on the long flight.  We will fly American again soon."

Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Flight cancelled and no reasonable expanation given other than ""Weather"", which was fine","For reasons they would not disclose, American Airlines cancelled the final leg of our flight home.  Though they said it was due to weather, there were no weather issues at our destination, and any weather in Chicago would have cleared long before we were to arrive there.  They actually told us that it looks like the weather will be bad at our destination 12 hours in the future!  No other flights from any other carrier was cancelled to our destination.  Of course they will tell you its weather related so they do not have to pay for your overnight stay.  At least be honest with your customers!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Carry-on bags,"Just because the airline over booked the flight is not a reason to force me to check a bag that I flew with 5 days ago with no problem. Very unhappy with this current service from Miami. I am a doctor and do not have time to waste with checking bag and picking them up again. Also there were passengers with 3 bags allowed on board but not my single bag, really? Just bad service."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,The worst first,"For our 25th wedding, we wanted to fly first class to new Mexico. I had read that AA had great first class (but only if you get an Airbus 320). I should read more details.The upcharge to go first class over regular was $1,000 or 500 per seat; so what did we get for our money?Well, the flights to New Mexico were ok. The planes were old 737's, so nothing special. We had priority check-in in Tampa, but then had a gate and terminal change in Dallas. The meal was ok, and while not plush, the seats were comfortable.Returning from New Mexico was a disaster. There was no first class check in, but that's more of the airport's fault. The plane was another old 737, but at least it was clean. We landed in Dallas with a 3 hour layover. Of course there was another AA terminal and gate change, so we transferred and found a good restaurant to wait. After 30 minutes, there was another gate change. Then another with terminal change. So after we ate, we moved to the appropriate gate.Something was odd at the gate, as we were delayed getting on the plane. After 15 extra minutes they finally started loading. We were first on, then waited as the plane filled. No drinks were offered while we sat, so I knew something was up. One of the pilots kept coming out of the cockpit, playing with his mustache, then looking at the back of the plane. It was making me nervous. After half an hour, they announced the plane had a hydraulic leak and needed further inspection. After another half hour, they told us to get off the plane. When we looked outside, we could see a huge puddle under the plane. I'm surprised it took that long to figure out it was unsafe.We waited another half an hour and they announced a new plane, but it was at  another terminal. The same terminal where we arrived from New Mexico! So off we went, going back to where we started. Upon arrival, we waited for the new plane and old crew to catch up. Another 30 minutes went by, and we saw the pilots go into the plane walkway. Then 5 minutes later they were back. Again the nervous pilot played with his mustache, looked at the crowd, then both pilots left the area. Apparently, they had exceeded their flying hours for the day. On the ground. Without ever taking off, they were going home. How nice.So, they boarded us anyway. This time, they did serve a few drinks while we waited on a new crew. After another wait, the crew arrived and informed us that it would take yet another 30 minutes to prep the plane. Finally, after a 3 hour delay, we took off. By now, we had spent 6 hours in Dallas.The flight home was uneventful, although AA did a baggage belt change in Tampa. One last poke, I suppose.As of today - 2 weeks later, I have heard nothing from AA. Apparently a broken plane, numerous gate changes and delays is normal for them. While other airlines would have sent some apologies, AA is silent in the guilt.This is my last trip with this broken down airline. You can keep the skymiles, I won't be back."

She helpful and sweet.  Such a blessing when you are traveling.  I think people do not fully understand what kind of impact that smile has on your trip. Its confusing, intimidating and frustrating going to the Airport Reading the signs and where do I go,  do I have everything, Yikes!

Date of travel: February 2020,20,flying used to be fun,"CEO's of airlines should be ashamed of themselves. Flying is truly like being in a boxcar with wings. When it is impossible to cross your legs, you can't become comfortable. The move to make leg room smaller is ridiculous, while all the promotions talk of how important customer service is. This is clearly hollow and basically cynical. Movie theaters everywhere have moved to larger, more comfortable seats, while airlines continue to reduce the seating space. I'm waiting for an airlines that is truly intrested in customer comfort."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Dissapointing old plane for international flight,The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful but the plane was very old for an international flight.  They had free wifi movies and TV but no screens in the seat backs. Had I known that I would have brought my tablet instead of just my cell phone. They made my husband check his carry-on at the gate and said it was not in compliance with their carry on rules.  We had just flown an American flight from Detroit to Miami to connect to Barbados and he carried it on for the first leg of our trip.  He has taken that suit case all over the world as a carry on.  We were very disappointed that they would not let him take it as a carry on.

Date of travel: February 2020,30,There are some great people with a flawed overall system,"We had baggage waiver requests from the Wounded Warrior Project for this trip, and they were refused in Pittsburgh, but honored in Salt Lake City on the return. The supervior in Pittsburgh was awesome; trying several things to get us accomodated and eventually processing a payment over the phone at 1 AM MST. Internet is free but not good in any sense of the word and seats were very cramped. We were allowed to baord first due to physical impairment, and make to feel quite welcome."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Going to a memorial ,"We had a short notice trip for a memorial for our father.

Date of travel: February 2020,10,Beware of overbooking!,"I flew AA roundtrip and haven't been more disappointed with any airline in a long time. I fly with many airlines, dependent on who has the best price, so I fly ""cheap"" airlines regularly, but AA has been my worst experience so far. First, I found at boarding that my seat had been changed from the one I choose, changing me from window to middle (I have multiple back injuries, middle does NOT work for me at all, ever). No one at their desk could even tell me who was responsible for changing my seat, they all just looked at each other when I asked. On my return flight, after already traveling a solid 20 hours, I was appalled to find out that my small flight had been overbooked by about 15 people! I did get comped a hotel room by AA, but learned they had sent my luggage on without me?! I didn't even know that was practice! I ended up at a hotel with no clothes or personal toiletries, or even a wall charger for my phone (I only had a USB in my carry-on, as my universal was in my checked bag). I also didn't get any documentation about my new flight despite all the paperwork I was given and had to search their available flights online with only what I thought I remembered the departure time being- no emails, boarding pass, text, nothing with the flight number at all. And then icing on the cake- they again made me sit in the middle, after I specifically told them when they were re-booking me that I needed a window or at least aisle to sit comfortably for 6 hours, and despite upgrading several other passengers who did not have to spend the night without basic necessities. Even though I usually am content to fly with whoever has the best fare, I will avoid AA from now on because of this trip."

It was 70 degrees with sunshine.  We were told the only way to get to Dallas for our connection was to rent a car.   Texarkana staff said Dallas staff would reimburse us for the car.  Drove to Dallas and DFW staff told us we had no seats for our next flight.  Dallas blamed Texarkana.  Check in desk would not assist with connecting flight.  Told us to call customer service!

Date of travel: February 2020,20,Too close for comfort!,"The plane we flew from Maui to Phoenix was too small. It was a new plane & passengers were packed in like sardines. They are trying to fit too many people on these newer flights, not thinking of the comfort of their passengers. My husband is 6 feet tall and his legs were so cramped that is was not an enjoyable trip. I am small built and I was cramped also. Could not recline my seat more than a few inches, so uncomfortable. American Airlines think of your passengers comfort, not just the $$$$."

Flight itself was smooth, USB was available. Business class seats were comfortable."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Upsetting,"We were delayed in Buffalo due to mechanical issues with the airplane.  The flight to our stop in Charlotte was, thankfully, uneventful; however, we had a short layover in Charlotte we were again delayed because of mechanical problems.  They finally boarded us and, again, we were delayed due to an oil leak.  At this point we were told that no gaskets were available to repair the problem so they were ""taping it"".  I have to tell you this is not what you want to hear when you are heading for open waters in an airplane.  Even though there was slight turbulence over the ocean, the flight was uneventful and we were able to arrive in Nassau without further incident.On the return flight from Nassau to Charlotte we were delayed from departing while on the runway and almost missed our connection in Charlotte; however, the airplanes on the return were much newer than those where we experienced so much mechanical issues.With the amount of money that is being charged per passenger per flight, there is no excuse for the airlines having these ""old"" planes in the air especially if they are not going to put much needed resources into updating/repairing them."

Left without a hitch and the flight is even getting in early to Columbus!!!  This flight has been a great experience, mostly thanks to our First Class attendant, Olivia!!  Olivia has exhibited some of the best traits an attendant could!!  She greeted everyone with a smile as they boarded, was exemplary in her duties, and really seems to enjoy her job!!!  That part of her is so palpable!!  She made all of us happy and took the time to make sure all of us were experiencing the upmost comfort!!!  Olivia is a big reason I have remained an “EP” so long with American….Let’s face it…a plane is a plane, no matter the owner, but it’s attendants like Olivia that make the difference and that’s a big plus for American.  Still after years of complaining, the red wines are served WAY TOO COLD!!!!!  I have written for years about this but to no avail!!!!!  I am adding another chapter to my complaints!!!!!  The cheese plate was exceptional and they actually changed one or two of the cheeses….for the better!!!!!  The seat has plenty of room, nice electrical outlets on this 737.  Also I love to track my flight and their system is great!!!!....The gate people in Dallas were super and this has been a great flight!!  Thanks to all the American workers who are doing great!!!

Then the flight is delayed for mechanical problems. The plane was outside all night so the incoming flight crew didn’t notice a problem then? The morning flight crew didn’t test anything until 10 minutes before boarding?Bow here’s the hilarious and frustrating part. The mechanic needs to come from Charlotte and he’s being driven with the part. American is an airline why isn’t the mechanic flying? Totally ridiculous. And we are still sitting here because flights to DC are far between in Sunday. Why? no one travels on Sunday...It’s a weekend American!The agent Paul was helpful and sympathetic of my plight, but the best he could do was add me to standby. I may not get home today. UNACCEPTABLE!Again, American is a huge airline, they don’t have an extra plane?So, it’s back to Jet Blue even if I have to take connections."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Ticket Agent and Customer Service Dept Sub Par,"On a very busy morning in Austin I needed assistance checking a bag. I waited 20 minutes in line. Got to the ticket desk 36 minutes before our flight. Cutting it close, I know, but the Austin isn’t that big and I have TSA Precheck. The ticket agent told me I was past the bag cut off for my flight. Well, fine. Guess my bags will go on a different. Flight. No, she says. We cannot separate you from your bags. She removed me from my flight. Told me I was on standby for a 10am flight, but I probably wouldn’t make it. I was booked on a 1pm flight that was already delayed until 2:30. Oh...and my bags would go on the 10 o’clock flight whether we were on the plane or not thus...Separating. Me. From. My. Bags. Which is precisely what happened. She offered no solutions to book a different route. No offer to “hey, you better hurry. I’ll let the gate know you’re coming but they may not be able to wait.” Fine. I’ll Usain Bolt it to the gate and if I can’t make it, well that’s on me.Made it through security and had I hustled I would have made it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare. Unfortunately I didn’t make the 400 hard dash since I had already been removed from the flight.This one desk agent’s decision and lack of help cost me 8 hours. EIGHT HOURS. I didn’t get out of Austin until 2:30. Other American Airline employees were lovely. Then I emailed customer service. I received polite correspondence that explained their policy and a 45 minute bag cut off. I had to ask for some compensation. They gave me 7500 miles. I didn’t miss my flight! Their employee removed me from my flight with 36 minutes to go!Terrible. Absolutely terrible.  Through my correspondence with customer service they seem to reinforce the policy of ordinary. “It isn’t that simple.” “Our policy is.” “We recommend.” Look, just one that your agent had a chance to be a hero and hurry up and get me on my flight and instead just opted not to. I’ll forever remember that agent and the time and money she cost me, as well as American’s “we aren’t required to compensate you” response. Terrible. Did I mention that?"

Besides flying around the US, I'm glad they've restored service to Haiti, and this time specifically to Cap Haitien.One leg was particularly cool in the cabin, but one must be prepared for it to be a little warm or a little cool. Of course beverage service was basic, but that's travel today.I was satisfied."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Another bad experience,"Terrible experience.  SJO-DFW was flown on an old 737 with visible stains and dents in the interior walls and seats that needed replacements, with sagging cushions.  No seatback TVs despite stage length being nearly 4 hours.  Flight attendant service was rude and also illogical.  Although the fasten seatbelt sign came off relatively early, flight attendants waited until almost 2 hours into the flight to begin the initial beverage service--they spent these two hours gabbing in the back galley while eating Pringles.  Once service began, it was disorganized and rude--for instance, shoving 3 bags of pretzels at the person in the aisle seat and ordering that person to pass them down the row.  The flight had a provided snack--a piece of ham on a buttered role and some chips.  Chaotically, instead of just handing these out after the first beverage service, they were handed out simultaneously in a disorganized flurry of activity in the aisle.  Weirdly, flight attendants then almost immediately began a second beverage service, without even clearing trash from the first.  This despite there being nearly 2 hours of the flight left. And, instead of doing a full second beverage service, they lazily offered ""water, coffee, or juice"" because they were too lazy to open some cans.  We then sat without beverages for the final 1.5 hours since the two services were done back-to-back.The first class FA screeched several times about not using the front lavatory (despite no one trying to do so) unless you were in first and, instead of just politely stating the rule, went on and on abou ""international regulations"" and it was evident the only thing she really cared about was the annoying in-flight credit card offer.Chaotic, illogical, and rude service on an old plane.  This is when Delta flies this route with nice interiors, in-flight entertainment, and much better service.  Next time, I advise you avoid AA and fly Delta."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,American Airlines you definitely disappoint.,"I planned a trip from Canada to Costa Rica leaving on the 21st of January and back on the 7th of February. From the beginning even before my journey started I had issues. American Airlines changed my flight schedule without informing me. The departure time was the same but all the connections where different as well as the arrival time. I didn’t let that bother me since they were small changes. Once I left Canada I landed in Philadelphia at 730am. I had a 7h layover at the Philadelphia airport. 3 hours into the layover, I heard an announcement saying that the flight was delayed do to maintenance. At that point, I proceeded to the American airlaine customer service desk. A gentleman greeted me asking what the problem was. I started explaining that my flight was delayed and it might have an impact on my connecting flights. In addition, I was meeting a friend in Costa Rica and it was important I arrive on January 21st. He looked at my itinerary and informed me that I will need to stay the night in Philadelphia and leave for Costa Rica in the morning, since I would not be able to make my connection flight from Miami To Costa Rica. I was floored! He barley typed anything on his computer and had no empathy for my situation. At that point, I started talking to one of his coworkers and she started digging into additional solutions. She managed to book me a flight with two connections but it was going to be a close call. I took what she gave me and THANKED her! Running to my connections was not easy but I was able to make all the flights and arrive at my destination on time. Looking back at this, I can’t believe one of the American Airline employees tried to take the easy way out and keep me overnight. Upon my arrival I see no bags... I had to wait in San Jose for a day for my bags. No apologies or compensation were provided by the airline. I would like to say that the journey stops here but it does not... When I checked into American Airlines to leave from Costa Rica, I see that the flight changed again without any notice. Clearly this is American Airlines M.O. This time, my flight was arriving at my final destination in more then 8h later then previously planned and I had an airport change that was more then 100miles away from JFK. In addition to that, I had to absorb the extras charges for my transportation from one airport to another. I called American Airline right away to change my flights and understand what had happened. They informed me it was an operational change. I stay on the phone with the America Airline agent trying to find a solution. She says that there is nothing she can do other then look at different airlines. She then persisted to put me on hold for 20 minutes and never came back to the phone. I decide that I will try to talk to an agent once I got to the airport. At the airport in Costa Rica, I spoke to one of the agents about my situation, she was really nice and tried to help the most she could. She found a different flight that required an airport change but only about 15miles away from JFK. I take that offer since it was better then my previous one. I was still not happy since I, “the customer” had to stress, argue and spend more money on a flight plan that was already scheduled and arranged. When I arrive in New York, I got a US phone plan to call the American airline customer service. At that point they inform me that the flight was canceled due to weather. I found that very odd since that’s not what the first or the second agents told me... I continue talking to the representative to see what they could do. They insist that they couldn’t do ANYTHING... No standby, no discount, no meal voucher, no first class, no nothing. I could not believe that everything that happened along my flight was because of American Airlines and barely anyone from the company would apologizes or cared about my situation. Being in a foreign country with little to no help was scary and I could only imagine the scare and panic a solo, new to travelling individual would be experiencing. All in all I would give American Airline two thumbs down, a 0/10. This airline does not take customer service seriously and when you need help they will do the bare minimum to help. This is a sad reality but my lesson is learned American Airline is no longer an option for me."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flyinghappy,"I recently flew American Airlines and it was a worry free trip.  Trip from Philadelphia to Sarasota, FL and back, non-stop.  I had a credit so I made my reservation with a friendly and very competent AA agent.   Since I was first class, priority check-in was so easy and I was through security and at my gate in record time.  Attendants on board were very friendly and made the flight a very pleasant experience.  Same for both parts of the trip.  I have flown AA several times, will recommend them, and continue to fly with them."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Just slightly better then Spirit,"The only thing that I have to say good about this airlines is the leg room. There's not much choice of food and snacks on the plane. The worst is when I had a connecting flight in CLT to LGA. I was traveling from MBJ. The staff in CLT were not on the same page at all. The flight from MBJ was actually early arriving to CLT but by the time we arrived at the gate we were a half an hour past the original arrival time. Since I was coming from Jamaica they had us take our luggage off of the plane which it took 25 mins for luggage to start arriving on the carousel. I was instructed by 3 staff members that I would have to take all of my luggage through customs and then I would have to check in on my connecting flight as if I was staying in Charlotte. I get through customs and then on the kiosk which said that I was passed the open window to check my bags in. I was livid. So I spoke to one staff member which said that there was nothing that could be done. I get to another staff member who told me I was instructed with the wrong information. So now I had to go through the garbage and get the tags for my bag that I just threw away because I was instructed to. The lady then stapled my Tag on my bag and told me to go and catch my plane. After running through the airport like home alone 1 I was barely able to catch my plane because they haven't pulled off because of technical difficulties. SMH. So if the plane never had technical difficulties I would have had to wait  hours for the next flight. SMFH, never again."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,OK,"The gate attendant must have had a bad day, grumpy and unhelpful.  Flight was only half full.Far from exceptional but at least the flight wasn’t late."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Crew Was Amazing,The Miami based cabin crew were very friendly and accommodating for this segment of our travels. Would recommend American for travel into Cozumel exclusively.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,GETTING THE MOST,"We took a round trip flight form San Juan to Miami for Christmas.  We are in the aadvantage program with American Airlines.  We exchanged miles for the tripat a very reasonable rate and then we paid a reasonable amount for  main cabin extra.  This section has more space, more comfortable seats and free beer and wine.  The seats are in the front section so you board among the firsts and also deplane very quickly.For short flights, less than  3 hours this is an excellent choice and can save you money with a very enjoyable trip.,"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Service and flights on time,"Had a great experience recently with American Airlines. Great check in service and plane crew, friendly staff and comfortable in flight entertainment. Compared to a flight I took with AA a couple of years back, it was so much improved and therefore deserves some really positive feedback. Will definitely not hesitate to fly with AA again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Good one again,Had another good flight to LV.  Left early from the gate and arrived early.  I don't  review by the smoothness or roughness of the flight.  Most of the time the pilot can only do so much but we did have a smooth flight.  We only sit in First Class and the service can vary as most service can on flights.  This time coming and going was good.  Food was good also.  Nothing to write home about but just good.  We seem to always fly American because out of DFW it's about the best option.  And most of the time they do a good job.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Poorly scheduled air bus with no amenities. ,"Flew from LGA to MIA, flight was rescheduled from and afternoon flight to a early evening flight. First flight was boarded and the. canceled due to equipment failure. Fun!  Another plane was sent from Miami and we later boarded only to be stopped on the tarmac with a different equipment issue. We had to return to the terminal. Yikes!  They addresses the problem and we pushed off again, ably to have a third problem. Went back to the terminal, corrected the problem and we took off over 5 1/2 hours later than scheduled and arrived around 3:30 am in Miami to catch a cruise that morning. On our return, we checked all our luggage, paying an additional fee because of weight exceeding 50lbs. We get to the gate and there is no room for carry inside and people will get free baggage checked as a result. Tired of this horrible airline, that offers nothing in the way of entertainment and treat passengers like cattle.  NEVER WILL I FLY AMERICAN AGAIN. EVER!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Uncomfortable and unpleasant,"I had not flown with them for over a decade. The planes on both legs were small, people were crammed in like sardines and the flight attendants were not very friendly"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Crammed-in but on time,"Typical for an airline flight these days. Too little legroom, $30 for luggage but it was on time. Basic economy means you sit where they tell you to sit."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,No problems on my flights with American,"On the way to NYC from Chicago, I had movie capability which makes the flight go by so much quicker. Nice perk. Did not have it on the way home.I have Celiacs Disease and am always given pretzels or cookies which I cannot eat. If they have GF alternatives they do not let you know."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Potential problem when flying to San Francisco,"Fog is always a concern when trying to fly into San Francisco.  This flight was delayed by over 3 hours, but American was good about keeping passengers posted.  After boarding, we were delayed another hour on the ground, but the pilot personally appeared and sincerely apologized for the delays.  The pilot seemed as frustrated as the passengers. While giving American a very good rating, I must give the San Francisco Airport a ""very poor"" rating - it's a comedy of errors for way-finding and service."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Yankz123,The flight down to Aruba w/ a stop in Miami was fine - the flight home had 2 delays - the 𝙁𝙞𝙧𝙨𝙩 was a 40 minute delay in Aruba on our way to Charlotte - the 2nd was by far the worse of the 2 - we were supposed to leave Charlotte @ 8:30 pm - we left @ 10 pm getting in to Bradley @ 11:30 an hour and a half late - to make matters worse there were 2 other flights arriving and guess who got there luggage last - We were in the airport in Aruba @ 10am Saturday morning & I got home @ 12:45 Sunday am - I’m going to look at doing something different next year - there’s no direct flight from Bradley so I’ll have to do some homework - maybe a limo to New York for a direct flight ???
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Do not fly American airlines,"So my fiancé and I booked a flight for our honeymoon in June. We purchased first class and business class tickets (there was a layover) and also purchased insurance. 4 months before the flight we were told not to fly secondary to travel warning for Zika virus as we are undergoing fertility treatment. i applied for a refund through American Airlines as well as the insurance and was denied by both. The kept all of our money saying we bought a basic economy ticket when I have proof that we in fact purchased the upgraded tickets. We also provided documentation from our doctor. This has proved repeatedly that they are not customer driven but rather money driven but I guess like most people I thought it was isolated incidents of overbooking and or over charging or being rude to customers. I thought they were actions of an individual. Well today I learned it is the true mission statement of the company as a whole. I will NEVER fly this company again. I urge others not to as well, hopefully you do not do as I did and purchase anyway and have to learn for myself."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Connection flight times,"American Airlines, who basically own concourse C and D in the Dallas/Fort Worth airport had us scheduled to change planes in Dallas but did not allow enough time to meet the connection.It was late in the day and there were no flights out until morning.  American Airlines refused to pay for hotel stay.  There must have been a number of missed flights because all hotels were full anywhere near the airport.I filed a claim, first with the airline and then with federal agency and American denied the claim both times.All the events that caused this should have been in the control of American Airlines and yet they deny any responsibility.They definitely do not represent the American way."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,On time and smooth flight.,"We had a routine early morning flight with a change in Charlotte,NC.  Pleasant attendants and calm weather.  American Airlines has an efficient operation every time we fly with them."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Employees make a better trip,"Traveling with a wheel chair makes traveling a little more challenging so it is very important that when extra help is needed, great employees are an asset.One a recent trip from Miami to Salt Lake with a stop at Dallas/Ft Worth, our flight from Miami only left us 30 minutes to get to the SLC flight.  In Dallas, that meant a transfer from our arrival gate to a departure gate across the airport.  American provided a young man who said ""we can make it"" and off we went.  We got on the train and went four stops arriving at the departure gate as the plane was boarding.  They moved my wife to the head of the line and we got to our seats, near the back of the plane, with minutes to spare before the plane door was closed.  We had been about 4 hours since leaving Miami and mother nature called.  I asked a flight attendant if the lav could be used and she said yes.  We got buckled in as the plane was leaving the gate.  I wasn't sure that with the limited time we had between flights that our baggage would make the SLC flight.  But upon arrival at SLC, we were met by a wheel chair and as we got to the baggage carousel our bags were there.Very impressed with American.  We were treated well and the employees went out of their way to make our trip a success."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Perfect Trip,My flight from Brownsville to Dallas (#3558) was First Class and a very enjoyable flight.  Our attendant was actually very good but I do not know her name.  She delivered drinks and food and always was smiling.  American is a great choice for an Airline!!
Date of travel: February 2020,10,DO NOT RECOMMEND,"I had two flights with American Airlines booked, and both times I missed my connection flight because the first plane was delayed. They wouldn’t work with me on finding a reasonable flight to switch to, but instead made me miss two days total with very important people. I will NEVER fly with them again."
Date of travel: May 2019,20,Much worse than competitors,"If choosing an airline; Delta and Southwest are much better options.The main reason- loyalty points with AA expire; but not with Delta/SouthwestI used to use AA to fly between BWI & BUF, but they dropped this flight.   I haven't been able to AA miles; as they no longer have this flight.  I was told purchasing a gift card would extend these miles, and it did not....as a result, I lost a large number of miles.Neither Delta Nor Southwests miles ever expire.........wish I would have never done business with AA.In terms of actual flying experience, all 3 airlines were similar; and prices were similar also.The 1 perk I did like with AA; was they tended to have more flights (multiple flights in a day rather just a few).   but this has changed on my routes.Delta wins in the customer service category (although availability of flights is most limited amongst the airline).     Delta has also provided the best customer service, in general....when there are issues, they have almost always provided the best alternatives.Southwest is also similar.   I do like their free bags (although AA/Delta have free bags with credit card); and boarding process."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,LATE LATE LATE!!!!,"Flight to Cancun was OK however I never get a round trip good experience.  The return plane was delayed in Mexico over 2 hours ""waiting for the Crew at the Hotel""???  We need to end our vacation, leave our beautiful Hotels 3 hours before our flights & then to have to hang out an additional 2 hours waiting for the Crew, it is ridiculous.  Once boarding and on the plane, no explanation, free beverage, meal Friendly or a staff to put up with tired, frustrated people that have been waiting for your Crew. All missing their connecting flights!  So sad, give back AA, we paid enough for our flights!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Only getting worse,Third flight in 3 months where fuel miscalculations held up flight. Crew members and desk attendants show no interest in customer concerns. They know they have a captive audience I suppose. Flying has become a miserable experience in the US.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Long Flight, but Newer, Comfortable Airplane Made it Easier",Boarding the AA aircraft was extremely welcome after sitting for a few hours at the very loud LAX. The plane was ewer and the seats were a little more comfortable. The service by the aircrew was good throughout the flight to Chicago.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Disgusted,I fly almost every week and there is a problem every. week. Customer service is equivalent to garbage. They should actually pay me for how much of my life I cant get back flying with them.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Don’t expect so sit next to your spouse.,"Worst airline. We bought our tickets together but, they would not let us sit together. I called customer service and they told me if I wanted to chose my seat I had to pay extra. I let them know, I did not want a specific seat, I just wanted to sit next to my wife. They said I couldn’t unless I paid more. Back to Delta I guess."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Worse airline choice you can make,"Very ignorant and rude staff, they treat you bad and lie constantly, they’re even rude to each other, planes stink and little leg room for better profit, has 0 care about the confort of the client. DO NOT BOOK A FLIGHT!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Very nice Flight Attendants,All the flight attendants were positive and fun as well as accommodating. Had a great conversation on the last leg of the flight about the local food too.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Airline Status Really Pays,"Since i started flying more for work, I have found that using the same airline pays huge dividends down the line.  I used to shop each flight for best price, times, etc. and had various experiences that were generally not the best.  Rough seating, hidden costs, no overhead bin space, delays etc.Since I have gained status on American - my bags are always free and i get upgraded for free more often than I would have expected.  I get premium seating for me and all my travel companions that includes free alcohol (at least 1).  Priority boarding which ensures bin space.  Overall it makes traveling sooooooo much better.In addition, my family reaps the same benefits and more!  We get to fly for free for our vacations.  They also get free bags, bin space, etc etc.  Lesson - sign up for all mileage programs and figure out which airline you use the most and stick with them. It really pays off in the end."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Disgusting,"Worst experience ever! The ground service at the airport is pathetic, a little bit of customer service will be good, all these women doing a job they hate, because the way they served customer is obvious, get an other job if you can be nice. Also they made me check in my carry on bag at the entrance of the plain to allow all the americans put their massive suitcase inside, ridiculous and just to finish I asked the flight attendant for a earphones and Im still waiting to get them.AA1130 Bog to Mia 21/02/20  Never again, to many options out there; even those new airlines half price, will give you better service"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delayed,"We left Las Vegas, landing in Phoenix.  Boarded our connecting flight, waited quite awhile because the pilot needed the log book.  Kept waiting, found out they fixed the engine with a piece of tape😱  Kept waiting on the log book, by now we missed our flight so they rebooked us to arrive later, so we just waited with everyone getting upset.  We finally took off and landed in San Antonio about 1:00 am exhausted."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Flight was smooth and easy,"It was an early flight, but getting through the terminal and TSA went very easy.  The crew was nice and efficient.  The plane was a Boeing 737-800 (twin-jet) (B738), so it had a bit more room than the sometimes commuter-jets.  The flight was turbulence free.  We left on time and we arrived 12 minutes early to really sunny skies!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,not bad,"American is one of the few going to St Croix, but seems best option. At the time I looked JetBlue was going but with a very long layover. Is you travel in business or 1st you can book meals, which is nice"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delayed,Every time I fly American Airlines I experience delay after delay. My company likes to fly with them because the flights are cheap but would never be my first choice if I had the option!! Be prepared to spend most of your day in the airport. I travel a lot for work and I never make it home at my original scheduled time when I fly with them. Do not recommend.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Rudest security ever,"I am flying American airlines out of miami and I'm not sure if the security is part of a.a. or just the miami airport but they were the rudest group of people to my two young children.  I understand that people want to keep the lines moving but they must know not everyone flies on a regular basis and when quote ""today is different"" maybe that should be explained before we reach the body/bag check line.  Not yelling at them for removing a hat or liquids or shoes.  We thought that was a standard. So rude almost had my children in tears."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Tight seats, tight leg room, tight food","Flight left late due to storm. Seats were quite tight. Service was slow - very late flight. Leg room is not the best. AND AA makes you make extra if you want to board early! What a mess. Food was barely edible. Give me a foreign airline. All screens in front of bulkhead were on all night, tough to sleep. Stupid."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Was attacked by baggage claim worker because my luggage was 5 lbs over. Explained that my small bag broke on the way to the airport and I had to put my daughters Xmas gifts in my luggage. Explained that I wasn't feeling well and traveling alone with my 4 yr old and didn't know what to do about it. She was rude and replied that it wasn't her problem. When I asked for a supervisor or manager she told me no. Security was finally called and they asked her to phone a supervisor because she was being unreasonable and the supervisor wouldn't come down to address the issue. We have written a complain letter, finally someone returned our 2nd complain. However, it basically said we apologise that you were disappointed that you were asked to pay an additional fee. Thank you and we look forward to serving you on your next flight! What in the world!!!Please keep in mind, we are American Airline Members and have a Credit Card for conveniently traveling to visit family in Arkansas, California, New York, Kansas and Chicago. This seems highly unexceptable and RUDE!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,All good,"All was good , no complaints Billy& Pegie were fantastic had a full plane ... All was good for Basic economy"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"American Airlines, huge hubs, lots of walking, seats tight on several legs of trip","From SLC to Dallas - went well, tight seats, polite flight attendantsAt Dallas - we were not directed to gate, the person could not tell us which gate, only the D hub - the place is so huge, there is tons of walking up/down stairs before you get to either a  person or display of flights.  I had had recent surgery so it was extremely difficult.Once on the plane and to Cozumel - went well, tight seats, polite flight attendants"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Postponed flight out of Aspen,"We had our flight cancelled after a ski trip to Aspen/Snowmass in February.  This was due to weather and the plan circled but could not land due to visibility.   Since there are so few flights out and this was the second day of cancellations, we had to go to Grand Junction to get out before Monday (flight cancelled Friday).  This is a real issue at the small ski area airports in Colorado. Next time we may just drive in."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,There is not a worse airline ever,"Late, disappearing staff, pilot MIA lied to, lied to again, pushed back 3xs, put in a hotel, came for fixed flight... flight canceled. Left late again, missed daughter's volleyball game and two appointments I was then told by a snotty ticket agent it would not be the end of the world for her. Oo and put on standby. (little does he know I had cancer and she rarely gets to see me and this was a big deal for her) finally got a flight, ticket agent fought with me about my bags that passed on every other flight, told her my cancer meds were inside, she slapped a red tag on it and said I am not debating with you if it doesn't fit you know what to do..  late loading, was still on standby even though they told me I was on the flight, had to de-ice, took off late, missed rescheduled appt., ex rescheduled for us again... finally got to destination LATE in the evening and was not able to get off plane due to the bridge being broke and the door not opening. stuck on plane 45 minutes while they tried to fix instead of moving to open gate next to us. Finally decided to move to open the gate and unload us. Most Miserable 2-day flight, of my life. Customer service could care less. Here is $145 voucher for your missed days of work, husbands missed days of work, wasted vacation, missed game, missed appt. and one broken hearted child. #americanairlinessucks"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Long Flight,A somewhat long flight at 13 hours on the 787-900 Dreamliner. Seems like the seats just keep getting smaller. Food was actually ok and the flight attendants were also very pleasant and of course I survived !
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Trip to Super Bowl,My trip was paid for but wonderful experience except when tow are broke leaving from Miami and had to go back to gate but kept us informed throughout event.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Never on time and rude to boot,I wiill avoid using American Airlines no matter what. All 4 flights in my progress of going and returning were late and caused us to miss our flight from Lima to Cusco. Then they had the nerve to tell me they were not responsible for rebooking my missed flight. I had to call my travel agent and he had to straighten this out to catch another flight to Cusco. I can't say one good thing about the flying experience. Then on the return we were late leaving Cusco to return and had to be rebooked to return to Atlanta. All in all it was a nightmare. Avoid American Airlines if at all possible.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,delays and rescheduling,"to summarize, flight reschedules resulting in long layovers,delays leaving resulting in more rescheduling and seating issues.having to followup multiple times on refunds due to the above problems that were committed to the forgotten.great hawaii holiday, miserable transport to and from."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very friendly and free upgrades,"The flight got delayed because of weather in Chicago, but the entire AA staff was friendly and upgraded us! So we're obviously very pleased."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Cabin Fever Relief,"I generally do not like regional jets for longer flights, but the newness of the plane and Premium Class seating helped with the Embraer experience.  Even though power connections were available, they were inoperable...so make sure your electronic devices are fully charged prior to wheels up."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Overall, very good--which is saying a lot these days!","All flights were on time.  Stewards were nice and gave us a FULL can of soda!Seats were cramped and areas did not look exceedingly clean and we were packed in like sardines--but that's how it goes these days.  Could not get into the Amer App and there were no TVs in the seats.  Snacks are pretty gross, particularly the pretzels.  I could not upgrade my seat because I was with a group."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,First time on American in a while,"Normally I am a Delta flyer, This trip was booked with a group though and I went where I was told. The flight was nice and smooth. The pilot and crew were good. My biggest disappointment was that American Air lines dosent provide screens to watch  whatever you would like on the flights like Delta does. Our Flight from Dallas To Reno was on a 737( larger plane) and it also did not have screens in the seats. There was wi fi on both flights but who wants to hold their phone up in front t of your face for 3 hours to watch a movie?"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,You get what you pay for,"The flight is what you would expect for a red-eye from Hawaii to Phoenix.  It was rather uneventful.  The return trip was really disappointing.  For a 6 hour flight, you were given 2 drinks (soda, water, etc) and a cookie or pretzels.Airlines have really started to scrimp on amenities since I would have to purchase a meal rather than being given one."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Can't even abide by their own carry-on dimensions,"Flight from Salt Lake City, Utah, to South Bend, Indiana to see an old Army friend. Through Dallas, Fort Worth. Flight to DFW was uneventful. Flight from Dallas to S. Bend was delayed every 15-20 minutes for 2 hours. I have a carry on as this is a basic economy fare. I carry life giving medication within. I am older and have medical issues that have naught to do with anyone except me and my Doctor. My carry-on contained many such medication, and fit within the weight and dimension requirements of American Airlines own carry-on restrictions.I was very rudely told to take the medication out of my carry-on and check my carry-on. I explained calmly and quietly (it's my medical issue and nobody else needs to know!) my carry-on fit within their own restrictions, and contained life giving medication inside. I was made, in front of other passengers, to remove all of my medication (putting what I could in my pockets and hand carrying the remaining, dropping there are enough) so that they could check my bag.Every overhead bin was empty when I boarded, and there would have been plenty of room for my bag facing front to back. This was proven on my return leg from S.Bend to DFW as they allowed me to take my carry-on... on the very same plane. And it fit. Poor customer service is a trademark of the shareholders? I have removed my shares and have invested in a alternate business. As others I have vowed to never fly AA again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Trip to Maui,Leaving at 6.30am we had no problem at TSA straight through and the airline left a few minutes early. We arrived in Dallas on time and had a connecting flight at a different terminal all well signposted and staff very helpful. The flight from Dallas  was good the attendants very friendly and welcoming and we arrived a few minutes early disembarking and baggage collect was a breeze and very quick.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Hassle Free Flight,Great evening flight into New Jersey International Airport! Flight took off on time and landed 15 minutesearlier than expected. Flight attendants were attentive and smiling. My seat was very comfortable with an extra 6 inches of leg room! Definitely will travel this way again!
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Flight to Vegas,"Flight was ok. You do get what you pay for especially if you fly Basic Economy, but it was cheap and allowed for more spending money on my trip."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,It was a good flight,This is a great flight as it gets you to your final destination direct.  It is to bad that they are going to cancel this flight
Date of travel: September 2019,50,American Airlines,"We’ve flown several times over the past few years.  I must say...American has always been on time, attendants have been wonderful and flights hassle free.  It’s the only way to go!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight,Good on-time schedule. Best seat possible flying basic Economy.  Representatives were all nice and cordial.  Luggage was intact and accessed quickly and easily.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Quiet Flight - glad we changed sides of the plane for more space,"Flight TO Ireland we were on the 'left' side of the plane, very tight for our long legs (although we did have only 2 seats for us by the window, which was great).  Food was fine, we certainly didn't starve!  Flying back (this review), we changed our seating to the 'right' side of the plane (as you face forward), had a bit more room and was much easier to get up/down during this long flight.  Good thing since we both were super tired! Airline Hostesses were super nice and we enjoyed the flight.  Bit bumpy a couple of times, but that was the weather, not the airplane! We changed to come home early, cost an additional $800, but we would have spent that in Ireland on hotels and food, so it probably evened out.  Still, have seen other flight much less costly."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Turks and Caicos to Philadelphia,"We were flying from Turks and Caicos to Philadelphia on 2/15 and I do have to say it was a wonderful flight.  A lot of it had to do with a flight attendent named Cora B.  I’ve flown quite a bit over the years on both business and pleasure trips on various airlines and have come across friendly and entertaining, stern, disconnected and down-right mean flight attendants, which is understandable.  Fortunately, all the flight attendants I came across on our trip to Turks and back on the American flights were friendly, but I do have to say Cora was a breath of fresh air over the 4 hour returning flight to Philadelphia from Turks.  She was very personable and smiled a lot but most of all she was open for a little “chit-chat” when she came down the aisle which made the flight so much more enjoyable.  I would like to thank-you Cora for the fun-filled “chit-chat” and hope that I run into you again when flying on American!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Extremely long delay,"American Airlines is awful... delays are ridiculous and zero accommodations, would never recommend to anyone"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Things happen, and they definitely happened","It was alarming!  About 15 min after take off, we heard a loud noise, followed by a crashing sound and until the pilot announced, an hour later, we were turning back, I think we all thought that some insignificant item fell or someone in the restroom dropped something.  Rumors flowed quickly as to what it was.  The entire length of the tarmac was completely covered with emergency vehicles, the pilot made a relatively smooth landing, we were disembarked expeditiously, rather than waiting for word from a ground crew as to the ability of our plane, As we were told to leave the plane, the pilot announced that judging on the condition of the plane, we won't be going to PHX today.  Please go to the AA counter to schedule a new flight.  The fire department was using heat sensing devices near one wing's engine and landing gear with extinguishers strapped to their backs...  and only one of the two motors spinning as we pulled away.   You can imagine we were all led to believe it was something more than a check engine light 😉 (Which is all AA will tell us)."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Christmas trip,"Flying during the holidays always makes me a bit nervous, but this trip caused no stress at all.  Our flights were on time with no weather or mechanical delays. We were comfortable and treated well."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,American airlines,We flew as a couple with the same last name. Booked flights in aug 2019 for Feb 2020. On both flights we were not sitting together but coincidentally the seat beside one of use was available but at a cost. $11.00 for the flight there and $84.00 for the return so we could sit together. I totally believe it was planned that way. Also they had very limited food available. At the cancun airport we used the kiosk to get our boarding passes and luggage tags and then had to stand in a very long line to drop the bag. Other airlines did not have hardly any lineups.We will not be flying with American again unless absolutely necessary
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Delayed flight caused overnight delay in Dallas.,"Outbound flight delay so connection could not be made, so we had to hotel in Dallas and miss one day of our vacation."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,American delivered,Flight from Philadelphia to Amsterdam was on time and comfortable. A little extra leg room is really nice. Service on the flight was a+ w/pretty decent food.  I’d fly them again.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,On time,The Flight was on an A321.  I had never flown Airbus and was truly startled at the noise level on the plane. My husband and I have flown a lot. He has flown all over  the world for a period of twenty years  for business and never had such a noisy flight.   We flew through lots of bad weather but the pilots kept this flight nice and steady.  Food was a good value and the flight attendants were nice. Seats are like rocks and small.   I feel sorry for anyone who is even slightly overweight.  The flight arrived early
Date of travel: December 2019,50,It was almost like sleeping in my own bed,"Because I was flying across the ocean, I decided to pay the extra for Business Class.  It was well worth the price.  The sections for First and Business Classes had seats that easily turn into beds.  The airline provided slippers, pajamas in your size, noise cancelling headphones, a pillow to put directly on the seat, sheets, pillows, blankets, and a kit with a toothbrush, soap, comb, toothpaste, and  hand cream.  We had two meals on the plane and both dinner and breakfast were excellent.  I was given the opportunity to select my meal several days before boarding.  You can order special meals for any reason --- low cholesterol, low salt, low fat, specific meals for specific nationalities, and more.  The flight was smooth.  The window shades closed to make my area dark, even when dawn came.  The flight attendants were wonderful.  The flight crew thanked us for flying with them and didn't wake us up unnecessarily.  Each seat also had a television with multiple programs to watch, including television programs, news, and movies."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Manager,"Had a problem I wanted help with and the lady at the desk, Arianna, was unable to help.  When I asked to speak to someone who could help, expecting her to page a supervisor, she said ""I don't have to deal with this"" or (something to that effect) and walked away.  Very rude.  Would not recommend."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Sorta first class,"This flight is on American's new Airbus that is replacing its fleet of Boeing 757s. It was, well, sort of first class. The seats are a little larger than coach and the service was fine worthy of business/first class. Other than that — these planes have no video. You have to use your own phones, pads, whatever, to access to the Wifi. Which is free. The food was good, and drinks were fine. The lone flight attendant taking care of first class was magnificent. I'd never seen a flight attendant work harder or more efficiently and I told her and her colleagues that when we deplaned. I don't think she sat down once during the 6-hour flight. Overall, not a great trip but that's because of the plane, not the people. We'll probably take AA 432 again because it's our most convenient way to get to Hawaii — assuming we take American again. But American didn't do its highest paying passengers any favor providing this plane."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Much better than last flight,Everything went smoothly.  No delays and each leg arrived on time.  Timing was very important to us from the Miami to Cancun leg as we had a shuttle bus waiting to drive us 2 hours to a ferry that would take us to our final destination--Isla Holbox.  No problems with the return flights.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Once a 2 1/2 Star. Now a 1. More Dirty. More Aged!,"Well, after my last flight with AA 2 years ago and mechanical delays that kept us in the airport 4 hours and to cause my cousins bags to arrive later in the day (luckily we were spending the night or the bags wouldn't have made the cruise ship) I had high hopes that disappointment wouldn't strike twice. The flights down were okay but this wanting to charge my wife and I another $44 ($22 ea.) just to sit next to each other for a 1hr. connecting flight was crazy. That would have been on top of the additional $44 for the 2hr flight making a total of $88 one way just to sit together. We didn't play the reindeer games. But the worst was the flight back up from Dallas/Ft.Worth. They board you on the plane earlier than expected which sounds good as you think you may take off a bit early just to find out that now you are on the plane an extra 45 minutes sealed up and hot. There was no air running or coming out of the vent to the rear seats the entire flight. My wife said it was reasonable in Row 4. Plus as you get to the rear of the plane, it is like it narrows. The guy next to me at the window seat was not even a big guy and we were almost on top of each other. My arm on my seat is suppose to go up and it didn't. It suppose to recline back maybe 2 inches. It didn't. I thought my seat was bad but when I got up to get off the plane, the lady in front of me, her entire arm on her seat was broke. I wanted to take a picture but my battery was dead on my phone. Grrrr. When I was sitting in the back few rows looking at others reactions and observing the plane. It was just showing age and signs of being poorly maintained. I even feel that the cabin pressure was not right. My ears pop from time to time on a plane but the pain was terrible on this flight. It literally felt like someone pushed a Q-Tip too far in my ear and they still ached for a week after the flight. The pilot spoke about maybe 25 minutes to land or something but the sound system is so poor, no one could even make out what he was truly saying. Speaking of pilot. I will give credit that take off and landing were the best part of the trip but as a plane. I felt the most unsafe ever. I have taken many flights over the year and this was the worst by far as a plane to be on.Overall after the last 4-5 planes I have been on with American Airlines and this last flight by far. I feel more unsafe than ever and have decided I will look at other airlines even if it means paying a bit more. If Allegiant flew to Texas, I probably wouldn't have to look at any other airlines."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Mrs,"Booked flight to and fro early, although a month later the price of the flight dropped more than $100/- per person and AA wouldn’t budge trying to give any credit. For short flights use Southwest Airlines as there are no change fees and you can cancel and use the credit for a later flight"
Date of travel: March 2019,40,"Tight quarters, status quo.","I was aware that I needed to take my own snacks to tide me through the hours of the process.  Leg space was cramped and I am only 5 '3"".   Being disabled, I was afforded early boarding which made things much easier for me.  This trip was more than five years ago."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Delayed Eagle,"Flight was on late, incoming plane was delayed.The service was limited.  We arrived safely but later."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Eagle flight,Flight was on time and serve was good into Charlotte. Gate was a distance from my connecting flight. We arrive as scheduled without delay.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent service,"From check in to landing, this was an excellent flight.  Courteous check in Honolulu.  Attendant introduced herself, several attendants helping passengers settle in.  Excellent amenities.  Overnight flight, comfortable seating and good entertainment.  Boeing 780 series with flat sleeping.  Two meals, both excellent.  Head flight attendant was superb.  She thanked each passenger for flying American.  Flight deck crew informative and friendly.  Flight ahead of schedule.  Please departure and goodbyes."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Vegas,I fly all the time. AA is never on time. Would rather put you in the plane and sit you on the tarmac for an hour than delay the flight. SAVE YOUR MONEY and pay for another airline especially to Vegas.  Southwest has excellent service! American should be out of business.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Missed my connection by 5 minutes?!*$%,"I almost exclusively fly AA. I'll review now and then - sometimes they are favorable and sometimes not so much. This past Wed I was flying out of ORD to DFW with a connection 50 minutes later in another terminal. We left ORD on-time. In flight, the pilot explained he had to circle because of weather in Dallas. Needless to say (but I will), all those going to COS missed the flight by 10 minutes -- you know they have to close the door 10 minutes prior. We were assured by the crew on the flight that ""the gate knows this is just a little late, go straight to your gate, you should be okay. Nope - everyone had to stay an extra 5 hrs on a Friday when we just wanted to get home to our families. I could not see any type of weather pattern based on the Departure/Arrival screens. Disappointed."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Could they make the planes any smaller?!,"The airlines have done it again. They pack a third seat into a space barely big enough for two, then they repeat the process on both sides of a small plane. The result is that the poor traveler sits with her (or his) knees in her face and arms in front-handcuff position for three hours. I am tall, but by no means overweight, and this was the single most uncomfortable flight I have ever had in my life. I can't imagine how it feels to the average man, who has longer legs than I do, or anyone packing even a few extra pounds. Reclining one's seat isn't even thinkable--your head would be two inches from the face of the person behind you, and you would knock their drink into their lap.Solution: pay extra for an upgrade for a few precious inches (that used to be standard). Get an airline membership so the upgrade to first-class is at least somewhat affordable.In other words, ""We don't care because we will get enough business anyway."" Oh, and the ever-present ""The flight is full today, so we will run out of overhead room. This is your fault, so we will make you check your bags and wait at the front of the plane for them to be unloaded. Good luck making your connecting flight.""Don't bother switching to Southwest for a better deal--their planes are about the same size, and my husband and I couldn't sit together because everyone who boarded ahead of us (which was almost everyone) took the aisle or window seat, leaving nothing but middles throughout the plane."
Date of travel: March 2019,10,American Flight from CA to Hartford,"Basic Economy on American Airlines is a joke. I was traveling with my family of four and we each had a properly sized carry-on. I booked the tickets online and I was not aware that Basic Economy customers on American were banned from using the overhead bin for carry-on items. I was told (in a very unfriendly way) that I needed to pay to check in all four carry-ons at the gate at a cost. It gets worse. Not only did I need to pay to check in four carry-ons but it cost me double for each piece of luggage because I was checking it in at the gate. It cost me an extra $200. Incredible!It was the worst customer service experience of my life related to travel, and I travel every week on Southwest Airlines for work. My advice to you.... think twice about flying on American. There are better flying options.Please note that this trip was in 2019. I've heard that American may have changed their policies with regard to Basic Economy? I hope so!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,American Airlines - Overnight Layover - International,American Airlines layover flight was a fine flight no problems once they stopped changing our flight times.  This flight into Charlotte is an overnight layover.  What wasn't relayed to us until boarding the flight is if you have an overnight layover more than 12 hours you must pick up your checked bag.  Recheck it the next day with no additional charge.  We had intended on checking out the airport and eating there prior to going to our hotel.  Since we had to pick up our bag we were unable to stay and shop or eat.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great service,I wish there were better food options on my flight but flight was good and service was great price was the best! Thank you!
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worst service ever,Service was poor like they were doing us a favor letting us fly on their plane.  Also the food was not edible.  Had to ask 3 flight attendants for a pillow.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delayed but Enjoyable,"My flight from Dallas to Brownsville (#3976) was First Class.  The flight was slightly delayed from Dallas due to the late arrival of the plane.  However, once on board the flight was a little over an hour and our flight attendant was just great!!!  Lots of room in First Class and I had an electrical outlet at my solo seat in aisle A.  The plane was a 175.  Everything went great and I’ll continue to be an EP with American Airlines"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Great Flight, thanks to Tonya!!",My flight from Columbus to Dallas (# 3310) was First Class.  Our attendant was named Tonya and she was just super!!!  She had a great personality and it really stood out among the passengers!!  She kept our drinks and food coming and always had a smile.  Tonya is one reason I choose to remain an EP with American…..
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Trip to see Mt Rushmore,"Had a great trip through Louisville, Ky, The gate agents at each stop were Fantastic. On the return, the Gate agents there were very informative of a little delay. American had their act together that day and made the Airline proud"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Eddie Jackson,MS","I flew American Airlines to Sacramento, CA. on a business trip. The flight attendants were very professional and accommodating. The flights were pleasant and on time. Everyone was courteous and helpful from check in to arrival. I would highly recommend American to anyone."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Disaster,"On Feb. 5 we flew from Madrid (AA 37) to Albuquerque with a stop in Dallas before continuing on AA 2698. In Dallas we realized that AA hadn't pout TSA approved on my wife;'s ticket - Sheryl Gaylene Patten.  The TSA official told us to go to the AA desk and they would fix it. The woman there tried and was unable to but she did was trigger some sort of alarm which caused a grueling and very time search of Sheryl's luggage. To me,  this was the height of incompetence on AA's part. Then they couldn't even give us seats together on that flight. In the future, we will do everything possible to avoid using AA."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Very Comfortable,"Premium economy on this flight is nearly equivalent to domestic first class. Seats are very comfy. Kit provided includes a blanket, headphones, and a good sized pillow. The Dreamliner is a super good aircraft, with larger restrooms. Movie selection was decent, not abundant."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,good experience,"No issues.  The flight was a round trip flight. The flight going out to San Francisco was on time.  We boarded on time and the first leg was to Phoenix.  The actual gate to fly on to San Francisco was not far away, which I thought probably would be, but it wasn't to bad.  The gate was changed, but I was notified by a text where the new gate was and in plenty of time, so it wasn't a hassle. Flight coming back to Kansas City was great as well. I would fly this way again."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,0 would be better,Is it legal to fit so many people on a plane? The seats are getting narrower and the space between seat next to nothing. At 5’ tall my wife can hardly fit the return flight was delayed by two hours. Because of this the plane lost its slot for take off from Newark and it ended up being 19 for take off. Another delay. Since American Airlines flies Boeing jets and the Max is grounded they have ended up flying 20-30 year old 737 that are the pits. I stopped flying AA for Delta which has new planes and much better service. What I can’t understand is that AA charges the same for such inferior service. Shame on them.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,"Delays, sleeping on floors... good times",Flight from STL to DFW was delayed several hours.  Got to DFW and had to sleep on the floor of the airport.  Good stuff.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,On time.,"1st is not what it is on other airlines but it was good.  Its a great way to get to the far north non-stop during the summer but winter is not an option from DFW, unless you want to stop in Salt lake or Seattle."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,They get you any way they can,"As is typical with American, they get you every way they can.  Everytime you fly, they try and get you to sign up for one of their cards, which I have.  I try to use it for flying to Belize to get a companion bag for free, but I'm told, Belize is considered a domestic for baggage.  This time, when I traveled Business Class to get a free bag, I was told, that is only for Domestic and Belize is International."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Business trip flight from MEM to CLT,"Older A320, in need of a refresh. First class flight attendant was attentive and professional. Snack basket on a two hour plus flight in first is less than what I would expect. At least give us warm nuts or something more than a basic snack basket."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,IF YOU LIKE TO FEEL LIKE CATLE,I truly feel that they cannot make the seats any smaller or tighter. Catle have more room. Service was terrible.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight to Maui - Surprisingly Great and Comfortable,"Premium Economy was definitely worth the extra money we paid for it.  The Flight attendants were absolutely gracious and accommodating.  Especially on our flight out.  The seats are larger and you have a good amount of space for an over 6 hour flight.  Great choice of music, movies and entertainment."
Date of travel: July 2019,30,Mayhem in Charlotte,"The flight from Orlando to St. Martin, connecting in Miami was smooth and on time. It was the return flight that turned into a disaster. The departure from St. Maarten was on time and the arrival in Charlotte was also on time. This is where the mayhem begins. After clearing immigration and customs, we proceeded to the gate with time to grab something to eat at a restuarant in the same concourse. We arrived at the gate to find that the aircarft was there but the crew was going to be arriving soon. After about an hour they announced we could board then we sat there for another hour waiting for the crew that never appeared. They then announced that a new crew was being called in. After another 45 minutes we saw a new crew arrive that finally, after about a 3 1/2 hour delay, we took off for Orlando. The new crew announced that somehow a crew was never assigned  for this flight putting the blame on operations and scheduling. Needless to say, we finally arrived in Orlando about 4 hours later than scheduled in the wee hours of the morning"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delayed for Mechanical Reasons but Kept Informed,"The flight was delayed for mechanical reasons, but we were kept informed. American employees were friendly and efficient. As is the case on most airlines, the seats are far too close together, especially for tall people."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Short Post Cruise Flight,"Having just finished a cruise and looking forward to returning home we had a 4 hour Sunday afternoon flight to mainland USA towards the end of January. As we checked in fairly late we ended up at the rear of the aircraft and in different rows, however we were able to sit together after take off when there was a spare seat alongside mine. Cabin staff provided very good customer service throughout no matter what they were doing for passengers and what was particularly impressive was the interest and care they provided to 3 minors all travelling unaccompanied - the staff, without intruding just engaged briefly almost every time they passed to make sure they were comfortable and not in need of anything and behaving well, not getting bored with each other - very well done American team."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Thoroughly unimpressed,"I paid for a flight that allows a carryon bag. I bring a carryon only when I fly so I don't have to deal with checked baggage and possibility of baggage loss/damage/delay. While boarding the plane, an American Airlines staff member told us they ran out of room for carryons in overhead compartments (not ""we are running out"", she said we ""ran out"") and that they will need people to check their carryons in. I got lucky and wasn't forced to check my bag but I saw many people who were not so lucky. When I got on the plane, it appeared that only about 2/3 of overhead luggage space was occupied. WE WERE LIED TO!!! That American Airlines staff member LIED to us. Outright LIED to customers. I observed several people being forced to check in carryons without them being measured. I could see the look of distress on the customer's faces. Travel is a highly stressful time for people while trying to reach destinations and to be treated like this is unethical and unacceptable. What are they trying to gain by treating their customers like this?!?!? Definitely not my service!I am telling everyone I can about this as much as I can. I never want to see anyone be treated like this by service they rely on for travelThe flight information for this flight was:Chicago O'hare to Miami InternationalFlight 1308 BGroup 9Boarding time 2:35pm"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,American Airlines is the pits,"I had booked a 6:20 AM flight to Dallas so that I could make it to Roswell NM by 1 pm to spend Christmas with my son. At 4AM I discovered a message that American had rebooked me to an afternoon flight to Dallas and a 10 pm flight to Roswell. No reason. No weather delay. Just cancelled. Maybe the flight wasn't full enough. After protesting, they transferred me to Alaska Air for the first leg but I still missed the connection by 1 minute, and literally watched my American connecting flight pull away from the gate. No one cared to ask them to hold the flight for a minute since it was their fault. So I spent 9 hours on Christmas at DFW airport. I have repeatedly been disappointed with American. Their online booking system has predatory pricing that increases prices while you are  checking them. Their connecting flight to Roswell is late more often than not. Some of their flight attendants are downright unfriendly.One Christmas I even had to clean my own seat as there was a candy cane stuck to it and Doritos all over the floor. AA has a government contract to be the only carrier to Roswell and so they have no incentive to offer decent service or fair prices. They are so bad that when I had to go to Roswell again this February I decided to drive the nearly 2000 miles rather than take that pathetic flight again. They are that bad. I wish Delta or Alaska would get the bid for that region."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Smooth flight,"Gate attendants spoke clearly and were helpful with everyone I observed.  Take off and landing were smooth.  Clear skies and little to no turbulence.  Flight attendants were professional,friendly, and efficient throughout the flight.  I did hear the flight attendant say that if you want Bailey's Cream forcoffee, then request Coffee with Bailey's Cream so that will come from the First Class attendant already mixed in,ready to drink.  I noticed the depth of the seat rows were adequate to get up without doing Yoga type moves.There were 3 seats per side.  The bathroom was in the tail section and was clean. Passengers were thanked for their business and for choosing to fly American.  Hope to see you again, soon!The captain came out to wish his passengers a nice weekend as we departed.  Nice customer service gestures!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Canceled flight, John S hung up on me .","Our flight was cancelled due to weather and representative John S called my husband and I after Several hours of waiting. American Airlines cancelled due to weather and the alternative flights they offered did not offer us the same convinces of one stop. John s solution was to just refund our money and put it on us to find a new flight. I was upset as I explained to John S. That would cost us twice as much and he had a responsibility to help us find a new flight. He hung up on us.  I begged John S please don’t hang up ! My husband and I Fly a decent amount and we have never, I mean never ever been treated with so much disrespect. With all my power I will try never to fly American Airlines again, and will do all I can to discourage anyone else to fly them as well."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Non-stop American Eagle (PSA operated) now daily PHL/SRQ,"Getting to our condo in Sarasota from Philly had been a choice between two less-than-delightful options.  The first was landing in Sarasota with a regional flight connecting in Charlotte.  The second was flying a regular jet into Tampa and then driving a rental car an hour and 15 minutes to Sarasota.  Then AA began 3 x weekly non-stops on  a small regional jet with no first class cabin. This has now expanded to daily on a CRJ with 9 seat first class section.The CRJ is really nice.  Even the 2x2 coach is comfortable, although rollaboards need to be valet checked which means you leave and pick up your bags on the jet bridge at the front of the plane.  I've flown this service 6 times over the past year always with good crews and service."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Nasty flight attendants and bad policies,Empty rows of seats and the flight attendants would not let us sit in them. They said it would not be fair to the empty seats and the 2 passengers who paid extra. Power trip flight attendants. Avoid this airline only airline in the biz to do this!!!!
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Dirty, Aged and Poorly Maintained","Just as the title suggests, in a business trip out of IAD to LAS and back, I sit in CLT on an extended layover after my afternoon flight was canceled. So. You could say I'm annoyed.I understand that things happen but after flying on three different birds and seeing the obvious wear of hard use, poor upkeep and age, I'm not surprised that the last leg got canceled. I overheard the desk agents talking with ramp rats about the fact that ""our"" aircraft has been in a hanger since the night before nfor maintenance, which didn't happen, and the decision had been made, somewhere up the food chain, to not even attempt to find another bird...basically a serious f-you to all the passengers.I won't even go into dealing with utterly...and I do mean utterly indifferent staff.American Airlines is the airline equivalent of a Trailways bus in the late 70s. Never Again."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,American Airlines sucks,"Full disclosure.  I'm currently Delta platinum and used to be United platinum. I quit flying AA about 5 years ago. But because AA had a non stop that made sense to me, I had to buy it. Your APP is really crappy Your email receipts suckAnnoying as heck credit card sign up announcementAnnoying gate people What a junk airline. No, this review has no substance to back up my bullet points, but my comments are 100% true.  In conclusion, AA is the worst airline in North America. You suck worse than Southwest, Spirit, Allegiant, and Frontier.I know you all agree with me, especially the regular business travelers like myself.  But come on, the APP is insanely horrible!!! Cheers"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very nice flight,"We used our points to fly for the price of the security fee. The only problem is that there are NO direct flights to most or all destinations. Their main hub in in Charlotte, NC. so it takes about 2 hours longer that a direct flight. Other than that everything was fine."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,On business to Laredo Texas,"The staff was Great, the plane was clean. The flight to Laredo was on time there and returning. I enjoyed the complimentary drink and pretzels hit the spot just right. Highly Recommend American Airlines."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,The flight,"It didn’t crash! I made it to Orlando, and then back again, all in all the flight was a success. I also did not contract the corona virus, so that’s a plus."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great!,"The flight was smooth as ever. I get very bad vertigo and I didn’t on this flight, both there and back!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Couldn’t be any tighter,"We flew AA and I have to say that the seats are getting smaller and smaller. We were so tight for the flight that my husband who sat in the middle seat has to sit with his arms crossed the entire flight because we were just jammed in. Additionally, not like Jet Blue, you get a package of cookies and a cup of soda. Not even the can. I would much rather fly Het Blue. The flight attendants weren’t the friendliest either."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Not a Fan of Flying but This Was as Good as it Gets,"Sat in front row, plenty of legroom, flight staff were personable and extraordinarily helpful (I had some special needs as a kidney transplant recipient), seating was roomy, seemingly new, and very comfortable.  The flight itself was smooth, the pilot was informative and his easy style put one at ease.  All in all, a very positive experience."
Date of travel: March 2019,10,Horrible staff allows assault and battery of disabled passenger,"I will never fly AA again after witnessing a flight attendant allowing a passenger to bang and punch the seat of a disabled woman, who has multi-level cervical fusions, who needed to recline her seat for relief from her pain, and preventing further progression. I hope this man gets charged with assault and battery, and flight attendant gets charged for mis-using her authority to allow the man to continue to assault and batter the disabled woman."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Bad Service. Cancel my flight without my notice!,"I bought roundtrip tickets from Boston to LA. I didn't take the flight from Boston to LA because I had another plan and bought another ticket for that. It turns out American Airlines was ""smart"" enough to cancel my return flight from LA to Boston, and on the day I flew back, they said that my ticket was canceled because I didn't take the first flight. Seriously, if you canceled my flight, please at least let me know through emails or something and I bought my ticket directly using my AA account (aka I'm their customer)! As a result, I was asked to buy another ticket that cost a lot of money $$$ and I had to pay out of pocket. This service sucks."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Inclement weather and related delays causing layover,"In this day and age of sometimes not so great airline experiences, it is worth it to mention an experience that was awesome!We were in Barbados on vacation and scheduled to fly back from there to Northwest Arkansas via Charlotte NC, leaving at 4:42 PM on a Friday. Our connecting flight on to Arkansas would have departed Charlotte about 1-1/2 hours after arriving.Due to inclement weather along the eastern USA, our flight from Barbados was slipped 3-4 times, eventually departing Barbados at almost 8 PM, getting us into Charlotte around midnight. Of course, our scheduled connecting flight was long gone and there were no other flights available until about 7 AM Saturday morning.We were discussing how much fun it would (NOT) be to try to sleep in airport chairs for 4-5 hours before getting luggage checked back in and going through security. Well, American Airlines came through for the entire flight big time. They had a special group at the counter right after we got our luggage who got everyone checked into, and boarding passes for flights, to get them on to their next destination. And then they provided taxi, hotel and meal vouchers for everyone on the flight! A terrific surprise and one that will stand out for us for a long time!We got loaded into a taxi, got to a nice hotel, and managed about 4-1/2 hours sleep in a good bed. AA staff had apparently given the hotels a heads up, because when we arrived, the desk clerk already had our key card ready and sent us directly up to our room. Then a taxi ride with the same driver (Adam, who had offered to come back and pick us up, even tho his cut of voucher fares was far less than a cash fare) back to the airport for check in, and a breakfast on AA prior to departure.Our deep gratitude to AA for stepping up for all of us on that flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Live up to expectations,"AA once again lived up to my expectations. Every flight leg was delayed. I’m not sure why AA can’t get their planes in the air on time. I’ve never flown with them and actually left the airport on time. This time I was mentally prepared. The crew is always pleasant. Congenial. Laid back. No urgency. Really??? Shouldn’t there be a little urgency since you are always late?When we got to Columbus late, we also had to wait an hour before we could get our bags. No explanation. Just had to wait for the carousel. Mandatory checking of carry on luggage in Dallas. Then wait. After a delay in Dallas. I haven’t flown AA for years because of similar problems last time. I’d hoped with beautiful new planes and time to fix these issues things had looked up for them. Nope. Still pleasant crews. But, really? Every flight?"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Again to Maui and the Airbus has the best seats,"Flew out from ABQ on Jan 17th and got in midday at Kahului.  The Airbus 321 series at least has comfortable seats.  None of the seats recline much anymore to squeeze in more rows, but sleep was possible.  Ordinary service in all other aspects, just a means to a happy end."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Safe Flight,"It was a smooth safe flight; AA now has newer airplanes with great selection of movies; in fact I was watching this great movie that I did not want the flight to end.  Great Job American, keep it up."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Pleasant staff and flight,"We booked and paid for ‘Main cabin extras ‘ for this international flight which gave us extra leg room , priority access to overhead lockers and complimentary beers , wines and spirits . The extra leg room was great and seats were comfy. Lovely meal served with drinks , then asked for another and they said we have to charge you and I said we’ve paid for main cabin extras and attendant apologised and said oh yes of course  and we did get a few extra drinks .( Quite a limited selection - no cognac!)   We then had a shorter internal flight and same scenario - staff seemed to forget the rows of seats allocated to main cabin extras and needed reminding  and after that it wasn’t  a problem . Definitely worth paying the extra for MCE for international flights , but on short ones I wouldn’t bother again.Good selection of in flight entertainment."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent,"We flew American through our British airways booking,my wife loves business but for days in New York did not warrant the cost so premium economic was the choice ,and we were not disappointed,big seats ,plenty of room ,nearly a full recline ,good entertainment system and friendly staff ,would recommend American without doubt"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Surprisingly pleasant,"I was surprise at the service that I received on American. Previous flights were very disappointing from city to city. Very rude counter people.  However the staff of local people at the Auckland airport were informative and wonderful to deal with. Also, got a free dinner, snacks, and drinks (including alcohol and wine. The stewardesses were based out of Los Angeles and were wonderful."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Terrible communication during LONG delay,We were deboarded 10 minutes after we were supposed to have taken off for a maintenance issue.  Told it would be about a 30 minute delay.  Not an issue as I'd certainly prefer that all the maintenance has been completed properly.  However - we ended up caught in a 2 1/2 hour wait until they finally decided to give us a new plane.  So we didn't leave Miami until about the time we should have arrived in Pittsburgh.  My biggest issue was the lack of information during that time.  No announcements were made as to the delay being extended.  The restaurants were quite some distance from the gate - heard lots of people grumbling about being hungry but no one felt comfortable leaving the gate as we thought we would be reboarding at any moment.  Just a little honest communication would have gone a long way.....
Date of travel: February 2020,20,ORD-DFW--very very early...and mostly terrible,"5a service to DFW on Saturday morning.  Mostly unpleasant.First, lousy check-in experience.  4a at ORD and a long line at the ""premium"" check-in as only 2 agents worked.  Another 3 agents stood in a cluster a few counters down, helping no one.  But they couldn't come over and help the line because they were ""on the baggage desk.""  Second, on this hub-to-hub route we flew a (relatively small) A319, with a first class cabin of only 8.  Very limited upgrade opportunities for a large number of elites on the route, even at this early hour.Third, it was a tired old USAirways A319, with small overhead bins and a worn cabin.  No in-flight entertainment.  The interior difference compared to a Delta A319 was night-and-day.Fourth, chaotic boarding.  A lack of coordination between flight attendants and the gate agent meant we stood for a long time on an unheated jet bridge...on a day where the temperature in Chicago was 8 degrees F.Fifth, quite average service.  As an elite flyer, American offers me a free snack in coach.  Instead of a flight attendant asking me ""would you like a snack today?,"" a snack box was shoved in my face from behind as the FA shouted, ""SNACK?""  One beverage was served and we landed shortly thereafter.Sixth, mediocre service extended into the airport.  Despite having a fancy international terminal (D) with a fancy international lounge (Flagship) at DFW, our international connecting flight left from terminal A--requiring taking a train to use the international lounge.  Quite annoying as we saw domestic flights (e.g., to Tulsa) leaving from the international gates.  The ""Flagship"" lounge was also average:  at 7:30a, they had no coffee brewed, and a staff member said it would be 10 minutes.  It was more like 20 and then the coffee was brewed incorrectly and tasted burnt, despite being freshly brewed.  Food displays made little sense:  lots of cheese, but no crackers; smoked salmon, but nothing to put it on, etc.So yeah, mostly terrible."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,DFW-SJO--Mediocre,"AA once again demonstrated its inconsistency.  In the roulette of ""what kind of 737 will I get today?,"" for this relatively long segment from Dallas to San Jose, Costa Rica we were on an old 737 with faded walls, small overhead bins, and no TVs for in-flight entertainment.  Legroom in main cabin extra was fine, but the flight felt very chaotic:  flight attendants took a long time to get the service started, and then the carts were constantly in the aisle right at the time everyone needed to use the restroom, leading to a constant presence of people in the aisle.  Two of the four flight attendants on-board were grumpy and unhelpful.  Surprisingly, they did offer a ""meal""--a cold turkey sandwich and some chips, served in a box.  Better than nothing, I suppose.  Just very mediocre all around--average to bad service, tired interior, nothing special about the service."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Forgot to check the dip stick!,"Our pilot announced that we were “slightly low on oil in the left engine.”   So we sat at the gate for over an hour while they remedied the problem.  Shouldn’t have that been noticed by someone other than the pilot?   Because of this delay, we missed our connecting flight to Puerto Plata and lost a day of our resort vacation.  We were rerouted thru Miami and given a hotel voucher at a crappy hotel and food vouchers that did not cover much.  We incurred extra expense for Uber, etc so we could at least enjoy the city.  We ere given conflicting information about when we could recheck our luggage. I’m giving them two stars for not losing our luggage.  We asked for upgrades and were told we couldn’t get any because I’d purchased basic economy tickets.   The agent stated that basic economy tickets, “really only allow you to fly.”   Well, yes, that’s what I wanted to do - just fly to my destination!  Was it our fault no one checked the oil?"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Will not change booking even with their travel advisory,"With travel advisories out, I tried calling them to change ticket to have a different connection then going through Hong Kong. They would not offer any alternative and even then they would not offer a refund. Terrible service, the supervisor started arguing about her interpretation of the travel notice. I will never book with American Airline again in my live."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Left on time!,"Left on time, arrived early!!! Service was good, airplane clean, water was bottled. Same pretzels or biscuits. Nothing really to complain about."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Poor,"We picked United to fly with and I have to say 1or 2 staff were outstanding but the rest were awful and I will never fly with them again , there customer service was rubbish and they were very rude on the plane which was a shame as I expected better from them  , they also managed to loose our bag for 2 hours"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"Great Flight, Clean airplane, Very Punctual. That´s all matters","Great Flight: Clean Airplane, Very Punctual. Crew professional and Polite. That´s all that matters.The Food service aboard is a disgarce (after 9 hours flight all you get for breakfast is just a cold Yogurt and a Granola mini bag). But as mentioned, food is not importan if they get you home on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Horrible Service - American Airlines,"We flew from St. Maarten to Washington, DC with a connecting flight in Charlotte, NC. We made a duty free purchase at the airport in St. Maarten to make sure, it was packaged properly. When we arrived in Charlotte, NC, TSA advised it didn't meet their standard. Our plane arrived late in St. Maarten so we boarded late. It departed late as well, so we missed our flight from Charlotte, NC to Wash, DC. American Airlines did not seem concerned at all. They put us on a later flight, not together.  There were no signs nor announcements that duty free purchases are only good for non stop flights otherwise you have to put it in your luggage at the connecting location.  TSA advised that St. Maarten only cares about making money. We were able to carry the duty free purchase on the plane from St. Maarten to Charlotte, NC. Our luggage made our flight even though we were not on the flight. SCARY!  American Airlines sent me an email basically stating that I should have known about the duty free purchases policy. They took no resposibility for the delayed arrival which was the reason why we missed our connecting flight even if we didn't have an issue with our duty free purchase.I will not fly American Airlines again!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Great flight, wonderful crew","We had a great trip. Our first flight took aff as usual. Our second leg, the pilot came on while we were still at the gate and said he wanted something checked out. That was solved in a timely manner when he came back on, and announced, something was just not working right. He used other words. So twe all exited and walked down a few gates to the exact same type of plane. Wpeveryone had their same seats, and the plane was quickly boarded. The longest part was getting our luggage moved over. But once we were up and out, it was smooth sailing. I applaud the pilot and crew for taking our safety seriously. Another + ..we arrived at CR..no immigration lines, no waiting at all.! Yep, I’m a fan."
n/a,10,Customer satisfaction means nothing to them,"I get it: planes sometimes suffer from mechanical woes. It's what the airline does as in response that's crucial. The two hour delay caused us to miss our connection to Ottawa. AA automatically booked us on the next flight - good. Less good: this new flight left 10 hours after the missed flight. Eight hours in an airport. After much argument, they offered a $12 meal voucher. Way to aim for the minimum!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,WI to AZ,We had a pleasant trip with 2 layovers. No delays. Checked luggage with no charge due to full flights.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Final day in Kauai,"Loved the late night flight 11:44 pm departure , arrives into Phoenix at 8:30am. The flight is nonstop. Booked main cabin restricted fare. The aircraft is Boeing 757-200. General boarding zones. Fee to check luggage or choosing your seat. 1 carry on bag is free. Standard seat and wifi.  Agents were very friendly at the counter.  I didn't use the inflight service.  Slept the whole flight due to the late departure."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,WORST BUNCH OF MONKEYS I HAVE EVER SEEN,Worst customer service I have ever had..I'm calling coorperate.These monkeys have no idea what they are doing..they are rude and hate their jobs. I was treated like absolute garbage and I am so upset about it. I will go out of my way and fly an airline that is more expensive just to not fly this bull of an airline.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!!  RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL STAFF, AWFUL!!!!!","Worst experience ever!!!!!  Flight cancelled with NO EXPLANATION!!!  Spent over 5+ hours total on the phone multiple times trying to rectify multiple issues.  No compensation.  Had to drive all through the night for hours to another airport for a horrible 5AM flight after flight cancelled then had to take 3, yes 3, flights to reach destination.  All of that is get-over-able.  When returning I could not check in online, so I called the airline for another 2+ hour conversation, and was told all was resolved.   THE AIRLINE SCREWED UP MY TICKETS COMING BACK AND SOMEHOW BLAMED ME AND WOULD NOT LISTEN when I tried to talk with the person at the Austin TX airline counter, who was sadly their ""supervisor"".  This awful person HUMILIATED ME IN FRONT OF EVERYONE IN LINE (I WAS ONLY IN LINE BECAUSE AFTER BEING ON THE PHONE FOR THE LAST 2+ HOUR PHONE CALL I STILL COULDN'T GET A BOARDING PASS EVEN THOUGH I WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED).  I have never ever been treated so bad in my 49 years of life!!!!!  This is absolute injustice.  I wrote to customer service and got a lame, gray, muted and uncaring response that didn't address any elements of the complaint.   I wrote to the CEO, no word back from that yet, surprise surprise.    I will never ever ever fly with this airline again, even if I realize it will result in death.  EVER.  Nor will my entire family.  With all the awful treatment by the staff toward customers as noted in the countless awful reviews, I suspect this company will be belly up within a couple years, and they will have no one to blame but themselves.  They definitely lost us as customers.  You can't yell at your customers, blame and humiliate them, particularly when the airline made the mistakes.  It's just not right."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"No complaints, ticked the boxes","No-problem flight. Took off on time and arrived half an hour early. Boarding was straightforward (for once, the employee making announcements at the gate did so in a clear and articulate fashion. Quite a few of them - I mean at all airlines, not particularly AA - seem to gabble, stumble and generally baffle the passengers). We were near the back (row 31) but seats ok (we are not tall). In-flight entertainment also ok (a lot better than BA's version, which is pathetic). Dinner (chicken/barbecue sauce) was quite good, for basic airline food. Ditto red wine. Breakfast (a rather yucky pink yoghurt and some bits and pieces in packets) was pretty horrible. Service was good (again, that's not always the case). So, overall, no complaints, ticked most of the boxes."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Boston to Phoenix round trip was very pleasant,"I used to fly American (and USAir) often, and was, when others were complaining, in general pleased.  More recently I fly them only on occasion, mostly due to price, and their non-refund policy on the lower priced tickets, which, when you are caught in a jam and need to cancel, feels like stealing. However, on this particular trip, we wanted to manage arrival and departure times, avoiding the red eye or a late night arrival.  American offered the best non stop schedule for daytime flying.  We took the chance that we would not have to reschedule, and bought the best tickets we could. It was an excellent trip.  The crew both ways were highly professional, and very nice.  The Airbus was roomy and comfortable.  I am sit 6'2"" and refuse to pay extra for a longer economy seat.  I did not need to.  Despite sitting for 6/5 hours I was fine. The planes boarded well, departed on time, and arrived early for both directions.  2 thumbs up for American."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,WORST FLYING EXPERIENCE EVER!,"When we first booked our trip we had straight flights to Mexico but then it changed & things went very south!!!We are now to fly out of Dayton to Charlotte, then Charlotte to Cancun. Well our 1st flight was cancelled (they blamed weather, but we saw other flights going into Charlotte at the same time as ours or close to it). American Airlines stated they couldn't get us on another flight until SUNDAY (we should be at our resort on Friday). We explained no we will miss 3 days of our vacation. We asked if we could fly out of Columbus since it's close to us. They got us on a plane Saturday morning to Miami then Miami to Cancun (we were happy we only missed one day in Mexico). Well we get to Miami & our flight to Cancun was cancelled due to lack of workers & staff needing rest. We spent hours in line behind 100's of angry passengers because so many other flights were cancelled not just ours because of this issue. Finally after calling customer service and dealing with them in person we got free hotel rooms & a few food vouchers, but here's the kicker. We are now stuck in Miami until MONDAY, now missing 4 days of our vacation in Mexico!! On top of this we waited over 8 hours to get our luggage!! Needless to say our trip home was just as disastrous as the trip there. Cancun to Miami our luggage was lost outside in the pouring down rain, we missed our flight to Columbus due to this. They now got us on another flight & we are now heading to Charlotte then to Columbus.Well...we are now stuck in Charlotte where we had to sleep in the  airport due to them being the rudest people I have ever met, we froze our butts off. American Airlines you royal SUCK!!! Never will we fly your airline again,  your employees are rude and make you feel like just a number. Never will I go into Charlotte or Miami, direct flights only....I will bash your airline to whomever I can...overbooked and short staffed don’t fly with them...you just lost my business!!! I understand flights get cancelled etc but we had 5 cancelled/missed flights due to the airline for one trip! We spent 5 out of 8 days of our vacation in the airport! We spent money that we didn't need to spend on additional hotel rooms, rental cars, food & etc. We had an all inclusive trip with transportation already paid for!!!!"
Date of travel: April 2019,10,A no no company,"Service w ag disgraceful, you will pay everything,  I mean everything.  Lots of restrictions and the crew is cocky and distant. Bathrooms were clean, food crappy, service overall robotic and boring. I never liked American airlines,  now never than ever"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great customer service saved the day,"We woke up on our last day of our European trip to discover overnight out flight out of Venice had been canceled! We saw we had limited options to get back home, so we immediately called customer service and they were able to re-route us so that we actually got home earlier than our original flight. The customer service was great! They even gave us the extra legroom bulkhead seats for free for the cross-Atlantic flight. The in-flight entertainment was one of the best with an abundance of selections, although in a bulkhead seat, the screen is quite far away and people use it as an aisle which is annoying. The food was not memorable, but not bad. The in-flight service was great."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Another great flight on American,"The flight was typically on time.  I almost never have a problem when flying American.  Would like a little more leg room but, the price was great so I guess I shouldn't complain."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Broke plane again,"Boarded flight from PHX -DFW on Feb 16. Sat at gate for two hours with a variety of mechanical issues. Finally got off and was told to see customer service. After waiting in line agent said I needed to call customer service. After waiting on hold for 29 mins was told Customer Service cannot help, I need to go to website. Finally gave up and booked Southwest for a much higher last minute fare.American Airlines is absolutely the worst. Worst maintenance and NO customer service."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Abandoned by American Airlines,"Earlier this month my family and I were traveling from Hong Kong to Denver, and I decided to give Premium Economy in American Airlines a try.  I did not expect it to be as good as Cathay's offering, but for a lower price and the extra space of premium I thought it should be manageable, particularly as I am a Oneworld Emerald Member (Diamond on Cathay) and hence I would have some perks such as lounge access.The result was a complete mess of cancellations and delays, and being routed through London to get from HK to Denver (the wrong way around the planet.)  Most importantly, throughout the customer service from AA has been appalling.  I just tried to ring through to speak to someone again and it appears that no one at AA actually speaks to clients with complaints - they will only communicate by e-mail.A quick rundown of what went wrong on this trip:*  AA cancelled its flight at the last moment due to virus concerns.  Despite the announcement in the online press that mainland flights were cancelled but HK flights were still operating, they cancelled the flight late Saturday and did not try to call or e-mail any of their clients.  Our travel agent had been on the phone with them the afternoon before and they had said all was okay.*  Why did they cancel the flight?  Their pilots all called in sick and effectively refused to fly to HK, even though we are more than 1,000km from Wuhan and have fewer cases of the virus than Japan, Singapore, and other destinations AA continued to fly too.*  With the pilots having ducked their responsibilities at the last moment, did AA work to find other flights for their passengers?  No.  Instead, as near as I can tell, they quickly found seats for their pilots and flight crew already in HK to deadhead out, taking up almost all the spare flight capacity.  While the AA pilots were unwilling to fly themselves, pilots from Cathay, BA, and other airlines continued to due their duty and serve their passengers, and the AA team put their staff at the front of this queue.*  So with this situation and our need to get to the US to visit a sick relative, the only solution was for us to go to the US through London, adding extensive flight time and a long layover in London.*  Their first attempt to do this saw them downgrading us to regular economy.  It was not until we pushed that they got us our premium economy seats.*  At this time I asked, for the first of many times, to speak with the HK country head for AA.  I have never been able to speak to a senior manager at AA throughout this mess despite numerous requests, and the ground staff simply say that they can't do anything.*  When returning from the US we were rerouted onto Cathay, but had to do an AA flight from Denver to LA.  However there was a short weather hold and so the flight was delayed and we would miss our connection.  Trying to change this flight took some two hours, again led to them trying to downgrade us, and saw most of the flight miserable and confused.  AA staff were not communicating amongst themselves and they were ridiculously understaffed.  *  We eventually had to take a United Airlines flight from Denver to LA, so of the four sectors we were supposed to take with AA, we had zero flight time with the airline.  *  Now I am back and I have not been credited with any of my points or miles from the flights.  In trying to get this sorted I find that, and I should not be surprised by now, there is no one I can speak to about the problem.I understand the problems happen.  However, in this case the problem is entirely of AA's own making.  Further, having made a series of decisions they need to support their customers.  Instead they abandoned them.  This was our big adventure to see if AA could hold up as an airline choice for us.  They have failed so badly that not only will I actively avoid AA in future, I am going to spread the word of their ridiculously poor customer service.  If they are going to abuse and abandon their customers in this way they should simply close up.  Avoid AA.  American Airline's management should be embarrassed, and their pilots should be ashamed."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,So much room for improvement,"Flying from STL to PVD through ORD. The night before our AM flight it was snowing in Chicago with very low temps. We checked our reservation in the morning and it says it's on time, yet there is a travel alert throughout the midwest and some people can modify their flights for free. Not us, because we had booked a web awards special with miles. We get to the airport, still says on time, and as we get to our gate, their is an announcement saying to come to the desk because our flight is delayed and we are going to miss our connection. Surprise, not! Our flight to Chicago was delayed multiple hours, We ended up getting on an earlier flight to Chicago which was also delayed, then got on our delayed flight to PVD. Only arrived home a couple hours late, so not too bad.The reason we were upset is because it was so obvious that our flight was going to be delayed, yet American didn't say anything until an hour before we were scheduled to depart therefore making us sit around in the airport unnecessarily. Chicago was not moving very fast and it was clear that until they were operating at full speed, that all flights in STL would also be delayed. They knew this the night before but refused to offer free changes until they knew for certain the flight would be delayed. Here's what we would have preferred:1. Advanced notice that the flight was delayed. Then we could have stayed in our hotel for another few hours instead of getting up early to get to the airport, or:2. An option to rebook because we were not in a rush to get home. We would have been fine rebooking to the next day as we could have stayed another day in St Louis. We know the second one wasn't an option because we had booked a discount ticket which means you cannot change anything but everyone was being delayed and there were definitely other people who needed to get to their destinations faster. Everyone we talked to in the airport at STL was very nice, it's just the overall policy decisions and communication plans, as well as the general disregard for those flying on discount tickets that was annoying.Maybe it's just me, but it seems almost everytime I fly with AA, there is an issue. The flights themselves were great, as were the flight attendants, it's just all the work that goes into getting on the flight that's annoying."
n/a,10,The absolute worst Airline in the Western world,"Once again, American Airlines has been an absolutely horrible experience. This was the last straw and I am never ever going to fly them again. It is well known that on Economy you have to pay for all the things other decent Airlines give for free, like luggage and food.This time they managed to give us seats apart, both in the Middle, even though we travel together. The rude staff did not want to do anything to settle it even though it was clearly a mistake. The plane itself was cramped,  the staff unattentive and ignorant.American is worse than ever."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Palm Springs,"As always, the standard is American. From check in in OMA to admirals lounge in PHX, everything is top notch. On top of everything, the professionals at American are always there for you!  Return flight from PSP to DFW then Omaha was a repeat experience. FLY AMERICAN!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"OK flight from DFW to Maui (OGG), Seat was good, food was not good",Full flight after the new year from DFW to OGG (Maui).  The Business class seat was good and the flight was smooth.  The food for a business class flight was really not good. The salad was way over-dressed.  I had the pasta it was gummy and not flavorful.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Gave seat away,"I am writing this on behalf of my wife who is currently in the air between ORD and CLT - her last leg on a 2-stop itinerary with American Airlines and Iberia between Vienna, Austria and Charlotte, North Carolina.Both of her Iberia legs went fine. No delays. All pretty standard. Iberian BC is nothing worthwhile mentioning and we like the AA envoy seats better by comparison. But hey, safety and schedule matter most, right?As she arrived at ORD to switch to AA18 to CLT and finally be home after 20 hours of travel time, an AA issued boarding pass with express tag awaits her upon deplaning. With the boarding and express pass from AA in hand she runs through immigration, picks up the luggage and drops it back off after customs. All as swiftly as possible at ORD. Most US airports are third-worldish by global comparison, but IAD, PHL, ORD and CLT are among the worst. Anyways, by ORD-Standards the runaround through bus transfers, immigration, luggage, customs, drop-off and security, all go comparatively smoothly today. All just in a little under an hour and she’s at her gate to board the Charlotte flight. So she gets in line with the other passengers and as the ground agent scans her new AA issued boarding pass for flight 18 to CLT, the agent freezes, gets nervous, looks at the floor and states “we have booked you on the next flight”. Baffled, my wife is trying to get someone to explain what happened, but only gets muffled “...gave your seat to someone else...”, “...thought you might not make it anyways...”. “...next flight in 2.5 hours...”.Full it unbelief she asks if her luggage is on that plane and gets no response. For 15 minutes she watches everyone else board the plane, then the doors shut and she is left by herself, with 3 agents at the gate staring at the screen or floor, evading all eye contact. Finally she finds a supervisor who is completely baffled that my wife was holding a valid AA issued boarding pass for flight 18, checks the system on the luggage and finds that the luggage is on that plane. She assumes that my wife just appeared too late at the gate, but when finding out that she had been denied boarding and just left there standing for 15 minutes while the flight boarded, she could not believe it, apologized (first person who did not ignore my wife), and sends her off to the gate where the next flight would take off 2.5 hours later. Only after my wife asked which flight number and if she could get a new boarding pass, was she handed a new boarding pass - somewhere back in 21D. Well, at least she will make it to Charlotte eventually. We had hoped to have a nice evening together, but obviously some disrespectful and selfish, arrogant ground agent hat needed her seat for a colleague. That is how American Airlines treats it’s frequent fliers on international Business Class itineraries. To all other airlines (and shareholders of other airlines): you can cheer and be happy, knowing that AA is absolutely no threat to you. And will never be!"
Date of travel: March 2019,10,Very Irresponsible Airline (Please read to understand my meaning),"You may think I am stupid for giving this airline, which I have had bad experience with, a good review. Our flight was delayed several times, and they had to switch our plane twice. I bought an economy seat in the back, but what I noticed was that my boarding pass did not read seat 30, but seat 3. To think that these people are so much in a hurry that they could actually give me the wrong seat and not see this? You could imagine someone who paid for seat 3 get seat 33 with these kind of workers. I did end up enjoying the first class experience with legroom and nice snacks. I would give a positive rating if this would not happen to anyone else. (This is not within my power, I am just hoping it won't misplace someone in a bad seat). (I am still not sure why I did not look at my boarding pass until I entered the airport)"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Pleasantly surprised,"Having read a mixture of reviews previously, I was hesitant of my first flight with American Airlines. However, I was pleasantly surprised! Boarding was very straight forward, boarding per group (I was group 8 of 9, which is typical!) We were promptly on board the Boeing 787-9 aircraft, which is modern and clean. I was at the rear of economy, and had sufficient room as a 6ft tall person. There was a great selection of films available, the food and drink was decent for airline refreshments, and the staff were super friendly and attentive. The same went for the return flight!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Big giant person!!!,"So I’m in my seat and this woman shows up to seat in the window seat, I turned in my seat and she couldn’t fit, I stood up and she stuffed herself into the seat. The arm rest got stuck and she gave up. I had 1/2 of my seat. Aren’t these people supposed to pay for 2 seats? The only reason you got two stars is thank goodness some folks didn’t show and I got to escape to an exit seat. I paid for a seat, not a half a seat."

Date of travel: January 2020,30,"Ok, but there are better","The timing was just right, although previous experiences make me prefer most of the other coast to coast flyers.  The seat was worth the extra cost of premium.  The crew was not terribly friendly and the drink service was fair to poor.I wouldn’t hesitate to fly them again, but only if a similarly priced airline did not suit my needs."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"On time, uneventful, no hangups","American got this one right in particular because they did not change our seating which had been paid for almost 9 months in advance.  Nice crew, easy flights, luggage came out pretty much on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,American Disgrace,"Booked our flights from OKC to Christchurch, New Zealand and Auckland, New Zealand back to OKC via Qantas. The second to last leg of the trip, Auckland to LAX was a disgrace via American. I had been asking American for months to get bulkhead seating given we had a 8 month old infant and wanted the bassinet. They continually gave me the run-around (mind you, EVERY other leg of this trip we were sat together and on the long legs had bulkhead per Qantas). Finally, day of travel, come to find out our seats are not in a row as a family (rather split between 2 rows) and we are the LAST row in the plane. Not only this, but we were refused family boarding at the gate. There is a HUGE gap between foreign airlines and American airlines in terms of service and how families are treated. American Airlines should be ashamed of splitting us up and denying family boarding - period!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Economy flight 👍,"Unlike United they do not make you cram your purse into your one item (backpack), I prefer to fly American, southwest, United.     Sorry.   I feel United is not that friendly and they are the bag police."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Cramped as usual on the 767,"The amenities on this 767 are terrible....no inseat entertainment to speak of, no outlets and worse of all no room.  While I don't condone hitting the seat in front of me, I can understand the frustration of a passenger with extremely limited room being annoyed by the passenger in front reclining in his face.  It happened to me on the return flight and it certainly is not pleasant.  The flight crew appeared to wish they were somewhere else and service was poor.  The only time they perked up was when they were trying to get you to sign up for a credit card."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"On time, no frills...","The price was reasonable for this flight as was the take-off time.We departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early. The cabin crew were polite. I just cant stand the practice of them trying to solicited their credit cards. I know other airlines do this, but it is annoying, especially if you are trying to catch some rest. There is sufficient room in the seats and a snack & beverage are served. One carry-on is free. $30.00 to check a bag."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Never my first choice but I am guided by price and location,Cramped seating with not very good customer service.  Staff at the gate in St. Thomas were particularly rude and unpleasant.  I try to avoid American Airlines as I have had this issue in the past with them but unfortunately there are limited options for flights to St. Thomas
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Wedding.,Terrible terrible!!800 am flight delayed which caused missing flight to Cancun. Customer service desk misinformed us which caused our flight to change to later in day with arrival to Mexico at midnight!! Traveling with 7 people of which 4 our children! Very rude service. $12.00 food voucher and $75 coupon toward another flight is to make up for arriving at airport to accommodate their schedule yet unable to provide service as promised. DO NOT rely on customer service desk!!  Never again will I fly on American!!
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worst possible service,"Took the short flight to DFW as my hotel was close to this airport, rather than my go to Southwest. This flight is available serveral times a day from TPA. Though I scheduled the first flight out, after a two hour delay, the next one out only left 15 minutes later. On the return flight from Dallas, I scheduled to be back home by a little after 1PM .Here's the catch, this flight was delayed 4 hours. Well at least they are consistent.....they are awful."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,American is a first rate carrier,"This was a 1.5 hour flight so no meals. but we were given pretzels and soda. the boarding was easy, the seat was fine and the trip was uneventful. What more do you need?"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,flight,our flight on American airlines went very well. we boarded quickly and took off right on time and landed early. No problems with luggage or getting through security!
n/a,40,Back to the Rain!,"Trip to see friends and see the sun! Went economy with Booking.com so couldn't choose seat. But ended up getting a great isle seat near the front, maybe because I checked in early. Great flight. No complaints. Earned miles. Will fly with AA again."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Travel economy and don’t sit with your spouse,"We booked very early for this flight, but it didn’t matter. I sat between two strangers and so did my husband. There is no reason why we couldn’t have sat together."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,A whole day of connection,"First we went to Miami and spent the whole day there, this was too long and we had to go to Bayside mall to have lunch and distract a little. The flight to Brazil was in a very small plane. There were no individual TVs and the food was weak."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Long time connection,"From Brasília to Rio de Janeiro where we had to wait for some hours. Anyway, the flight from Rio to NYC was good. The food was ok and there were many movies to see on individual TVs. At JFK Airport there were a long line for immigration and customs."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,If they had a negative stars option.....,"On 2/16 myself and my fiance attempted to fly from Columbus to Miami, 1/3rd of the way into our flight the plane experienced engine problems and had to return to CMH. Then we sat around long enough to miss our connection to Brazil, and then to top it off, the sky bridge on our replacement plane broke. Absolute trash company. Will never use again under any circumstances."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,America Air again leaves high and dry,"2 hour direct flight cancelled 2 days prior to depart and turned into a 10 hour travel day.  Return delayed 2 hours due maintenance issues. I had avoided AA for 3 years,  I’ll do it again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Bob from AA is AMAZING,"Bob that works at GCM AA check-in provided stellar customer service. A flight delay was going to impact my connection and he hunted down the best new flight, advocated for me to be able to get on the flight and escorted me to the gate to make sure I made it. He has helped me like AA again with his courteous and personalized customer service. Thank you Bob! I hope you read this."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Thank you Val in American Airlines customer service in Charlotte NC this was on Tuesday Feb 11th 2020,After learning that my flight to MSP had been delayed and getting me to my destination on later flight would not work we found Val. She was able to redirect us to another airline leaving for MSP and it would arrive with time to spare. She was very professional and had a great attitude the whole time. It’s nice to know that excellent customer service is still around .
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Ranks In The Top Five Best Flying Experiences,"Long lines to get thru security at O'Hare but after that this flying experience was smooth ""sailing""!  Staff on the ground and in the air were efficient and friendly.  Space on board the plane is very tight, unfortunately this is standard operating procedure for most airlines.  This flight left ORD early and we arrived at our destination early!  Nice job overall for American Airlines."
Date of travel: June 2019,10,"Noisy,miserable flight","Clear sky flying,No leg room for any body over 5ft 10in, evertime pilot adjusted wing flaps Plane shook and loud noise. Lot of noise in cabin, attendant had to shout.Most passenger wearing head phones to be able to sleep or concentrate.We were packed in like sardines. No body was able to communicateUnless you yelled. No body bothered to talk to loud to carry on conversationVery cramped for 7hr flight.ended up going to orthopedic doctor fo neck."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Traumatic Flight,"We had a “free flight” on American.   We had to pay seat premiums, their website was down, so we had to pay $50 to have AA  book our seats,  had to pay baggage fees.   When we were boarding they wouldn’t let anybody in group 7,8 and 9 bring on their carry-on luggage.   Got on the plane, we passed 7 overhead bins completely empty, including the one directly over our seat and the one across the aisle.   We got to our destination, and they broke one of our checked bags.   On the return flight, lost cabin pressure, oxygen masks down, rapid descent from 37,000 feet to 10,000 feet (no explanation of what was going on until we started cruising at 10000 feet), AA put us in a room.   Got to the room at 4:00 AM.       AA reissued flight wouldn’t get back until two days later.  Hotel desk said voucher was good for both nights.  Probably got two hours restless sleep.  Called down to front desk to confirmed second night.   They said AA called and cancelled second night for everybody.   I called AA and they still said I was on the plane coming back 31 hours later, but they couldn’t extend voucher on phone.   Had to go back to airport counter to get new vouchers.  Got back to airport at 9AM, counters closed until 11:30.   Got new vouchers and back to hotel.   None worked.   At that point I was done with AA.  Booked SWA back.   Perfect flight.   Will never fly American Airlines again."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,They don’t care,"My husband and I chose American Airlines to fly to Maui because they have the pods available for the long flight from the Midwest, which Delta, our usual airline, doesn’t. We paid THOUSANDS of dollars to make this the nicest trip possible. Having ridden in the pods on Delta internationally, we were excited for the extra luxury and anticipated a relaxing trip.Wrong. First, the pods a very small, and I am a small person. It was an awkward and confusing layout. Hard to get comfortable. The in flight entertainment was limited. I watched the same movie coming and going. Given 3 options for dinner, we were told that they were “sold out” of the best one. How does that happen In first class? What we were given was pretty bad and pretty much shoved at us when the flight attendants got around to it. They asked for drink requests ONCE on the eight hour flight, were crabby, and pretty much spent as much time possible sitting reading their magazines.I am avoiding American Airlines from now on. Delta is sooo much better."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,BETTER THAN I EXPECTED,"Recently flew to San Juan.  My flight originated in GSO, but that's a quick 25 minute hop.The  longer flight was CLT to San Juan.  Flight 1852.   We boarded on time, pushed away on time.   We did sit on the tarmac for 20 or so minutes.   Charlotte is a very busy airport.  Flight to SJ was around three hours.   The equipment we flew in seemed to be a newer aircraft.  No visually prominent signs of age and the plane was very clean.  Great flight crew.   Overall a flight I'd definitely take again."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Seats are way too small on long-haul routes,"We flew overnight for over 8 hours and I was hoping to sleep a little on the flight, which I normally find easy to do.Not this time - no sleep for me. I was in the narrowest seat I've ever had on a long-haul flight. The guy next to me was only slightly over-weight but was still spilling over from his seat several inches into mine and leaning on me heavily because the seats were so narrow. I've flown BA and Virgin recently and I'd say their long-haul seats are wider. Legroom is poor. I'm only 160cm tall, but even so when the person in front reclined their seat, I was left without room and had to recline mine.Food was poor. Plain pasta without much sauce. A bread roll so hard it had the consistency of a baseball. Staff were running out of most drinks.When we got to Heathrow, a load of the luggage was missing and we had to wait 30 mins for the AA desk staff to find it.The next time I fly transatlantic, I'll pay more to go with another airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worst experience of my life,"Worst experience of my life. I completely understand your airline does not control the weather; however, American can certainly control my experience and you feel short in every way. First, the American employees at DCA airport unprofessional, rude, and not knowledgeable. The communication re: status of our delayed/canceled flights was nonexistent and when they did communicate, it was always inaccurate information. A staff member literally walked away in the middle of “helping me” trying to get on standby for a flight stating to his coworker “what’s the point, the flight is full and there’s already 5 people on standby in front of her” and stormed off with not a word said to me. I could go on for hours about the incredibly rude American Airlines staff at the DC airport. 2nd, due to our canceled flight and the weather, AA was not able to get us a flight to our destination but instead was only able to get us on a flight to an airport 120 miles way from our original airport destination, causing us the need to rent a car for $200 and drive 2 hours. For myself and my fiancé both being loyal AA flyers, AA advantage members, and AA barclay credit card holders, you would think at the very least AA would comp us the cost of the rental car for not getting us to our destination. Instead I was met with “no it’s not our fault.” Then, our original flight we were 1st class &our flight we got changed to we were coach. Again, no compensation. To top it all off, they lost my fiancé’s checked luggage. Again, I am well aware the airline does not control the weather but I expected so much more from them and they dropped the balm every step of the way. When we get home from this vacation my fiancé and I will both be canceling our AA barclay credit cards and never flying American again after this experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worst ever 8 hours delayed,"If you are thinking about flying with this company, think twice, I should have learn my lesson awhile ago, I guess not, my flight to Miami from Philadelphia was, for 8 hours, customer service and manager were nasty and rude, no apology or componsation for my flight .I wanted to cancel and just get another flight with another carrier but they refused to reimburse me. I hope they go out of business soon, not good for customers."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Incompetence: Waited 2 1/2 hours for a bag.,"Had a great flight and arrived at 10:21 pm.  More than 2 1/2 hours later, I finally got my bag.  It took the ground crew   1 hour and 30 minutes to scan my bag and another hour to deliver the bag to the carousel.  No one in baggage services could give us a status prior to the scan.  A gentleman who said he was a supervisor gave us the run around for the first 90-minutes.  At one point he told us to take his explanation “or leave it.”  I have never been so appalled.  This is the very type of experience that will stop me from flying American.  There are too many other options and I spend too much money flying to pay for disrespect, lies and sheer incompetence."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,One Delay After Another,"Half hour late boarding in Ontario, CA because of late flight attendant, 45 minutes late boarding out of Dallas because it was “95 degrees in the airplane” when it was 60 degrees outside, 65 minutes waiting at the baggage carousel in Miami and still no luggage. The rep says a few more minutes.  He says that every few minutes."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Yet Again American Airlines Is AWFUL!!!!,"As usual AA disappoints spectacularly!! departing out ofPhilly 10:40am push back out of the gate oops there is a mechanical issue, what you couldn’t have made sure before boarding your plane works?  Ok,  Let’s go back to the gate wait for mechanical to finally show up and yup have to deboard new gate new plane, Great.  New departure time 12:00pm chaos at the new gate, finally at 12:40 they get everyone on the plane, oops another mechanical problem, great news only took 10 min to fix this one (potable water leaking out the plane). Great we push back about 1pm only to find out no flight plan or weights and measures.  Awesome sit on the tar mat for another 45 min.  Finally 3 hours later we might be probably 15th in line for take off.  Great Job AA you a definitely the best at being the worst legacy airline in the country!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Disappointing,"We booked our seats 6 months in advance - 2 seats next to each other in row 4. Due “computer process” our seats were reassigned - 1 in row 4 and 1 in row 1. We needed the steward on board to ask another passenger 2 move. However, there were 3 unoccupied seats in first class. No explanation from staff. No video displays in headrests, like other airlines. Flight was smooth. Pilots and onboard staff were great. Airport staff seemed disorganized and confused."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Safe & Sound but NOT very Comfortable ,"AA economy offering did get us to our destination safely which is the most important thing in travel. That said, it isn’t a very comfortable experience.Although it is known in advance, not being able to sit with your traveling companions does take away from the experience. It doesn’t seem like it would be a great expense to the airline to keep folks together. The in flight entertainment is a great option however on more than one recent flight the sound hasn’t worked for me. The seats seem to be less comfortable all the time. One small glass of water in a 3 hour 20 minute flight is not enough. Air travel in general feels more like a cattle moving experience than something to look forward to."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,I miss US Airways,"We flew RT from Santa Barbara and back on AA with stops in DFW both ways.  It's rare that any airfare comparison shows AA to be even close to competitive with the other choices we have which include Alaska, United and Delta, but for this occasion, AA was in the ball park and the one stop routing was favorable.We sat in first class and ate like back row coach/ economy on the first leg and was offered a bag of chips on the 2nd leg. The food was horrid and I had to wait in line twice for the restroom as passengers from the coach section dominated its use.Tp pay for first class and get less than 2nd class treatment is unacceptable and we shall seek out other options in the future.We loved US Airways before they were merged into AA.  Almost immediately, they were ruined by being morphed into AA mentality of high fees and low services.  Another example of a merger gone bad."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Wings over Paradise,"From check in to landing the service was great.  Starting at curbside check-in the service was great my bag was taken from me put through agriculture and checked to my destination; the porter notified the proper person that I needed a wheelchair.  I was taken to my gate a placed in a position where I was able to  preboard with no problem. The flight crew as attentive and courteous.  Great flight, will be using American as often as I can."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"More, Even Longer Delays","Flight AA1219, 50 minutes late boarding & waiting. Just got told it’s going to be longer. Desk agent says it’s because they are still cooling the cabin & it’s too hot inside to board. They did however, board the crew & military. Too hot? It’s 60 degrees outside. Did they not know this airplane was going to be used today? Nothing they tell us makes sense.  Incompetence & lies."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Long Delays,"25 minutes late boarding.  Waiting for crew member we were told was filling in for a flight attendant who called in sick.  Doesn’t seem plausible that a scheduled crew member waited until the last minute to call in sick.  First class section is like going to a cheap motel when it was advertised as a 5-star hotel.  On the plus side, the flight attendants for us were great.  No complaints about them. Even longer delays on the next leg out of DFW."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,They just don’t care,"As usual, boarding remains an issue.   Passenger stowing more than one item per seat In the overhead and the flights attendant doing everything they can to ignore the passengers during boarding.  We are seriously looking into changingq over to United.   American just does not care about their clients any longer"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always a pleasure,"I had a wonderful trip. The flight crew was very nice and I have to say the seats were comfortable. If I could have changed one thing, it would be the people with the seats in front of me. Yes, fully reclined, which made it hard for me to get up and down. Also, on this trip I found that my Silver membership with British Airlines gets me into their airport club. I am claustrophobic, so first class is the only way you are getting me on a plane. I have had a much better experience with AA and British Airways than some of the other airlines."
n/a,10,Harsh treatment,"My husband and I were just treated unbelievably poorly. We paid extra to make sure we sat together and weren't stuck in the last row since my preferred airline is United. We were told we had to check our bags as we were about to board, but after seated in our 6th row seats we saw several people board after us and walk past us to seats further back with carry on bags larger than ours."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Short flight. But great services,I travel to Medellin for celebrating my 57-year-old birthday.  The aircraft was clean. And the seat very comfortable.  Soon the flight attendant offers me a glass of champagne.  The food was a good one. Very tasty chicken with vegetables. Yummy dessert.    I never expected a good service on a short flight.   Thanks to the crew for enjoying the flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,WORST PREMIUM AIRLINE EVER!,"I paid for a “full fare First Class Ticket” and they wouldn’t let me board early like they used to do in the priority lane. Once in the plane they would NOT give us a cocktail till they got in the air. That is WRONG! There were no shortages of flight attendants they just chose not to serve the passengers. Nasty, Arrogant Crew! All this after we were screwed yesterday BY AA because you cancelled our flights. American Airlines, SADLY, SUCKS!!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Dallas Ground Crew is an example of why this airline will be dead in a few years,"Okay, so we pushed back on time. But everyone knew the weather would keep us on the tarmac for 45 minutes or more. What I witnessed from my crappy little first class seat was a first class sh*t show. This sweet family had, like many of us, raced through the airport [they had a toddler in tow] from one well delayed flight, through the ridiculous train transport to a gate that that been changed (for me without notification.) Dad had waited for their gate checked stroller while mom and grandma got the cranky kid who had likely been awake since 4 am to the gate. Its closed. No we were nowhere near ready ( they were texting my seatmate) so they insisted. Uh uh. American truly did not care about a family it turns out had already been canceled from departure a day earlier. And they weren’t nice about it at all. This airline is consistently hostile toward customers. When i finally got to my welcome dinner in Mexico for the wedding, the whole group was abuzz about how many people, day after day, had been badly treated by American. Lost luggage, luggage unchecked at the destination, my bag went home with another person and i located it on my own. All from Dallas. So my recommendation is to avoid Dallas, and do anything you can to avoid American. And to the Airline? If you like your job, get it together. An ontime push-off is bull. We know it. You know it. But if thats the goal, then learn some kindness. This crap has never happened to me on Jet Blue. Ever. And when something does go wrong of their airline, they are kind and professional. I could hear you guys gossiping."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,No free drinks,"All flights was more or less on time and staff was polite and helpful. The meal of chicken was actually good for airline food but the near frozen bread roll was not good.As always there was far too many things on the tray .The real downside for me was having to pay 5 euros for a spirit. On other airlines,they are free. It just helps me to relax and considering the cost of the flight one drink would be very welcome.On some legs of my flight the entertainment system did not work.On the leg from Miami I had 4 seats to myself and was able to stretch out."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,No issues,"Pretty typical. I understand some infrequent flyers having issues, but this was a pretty typical flight. As usual, the Miami airport is a pain in the neck"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Miami to Costa Rica round Trip,American was on time and the food was greatAfter my FC welcome I feel asleep Lunch was served and very good service Before you know it we smoothly landedGreat service and on time
Date of travel: January 2020,50,AA 173 London Heathrow to Raleigh Durham,"This trip was on a 777-200. There appear to be multiple versions of the actual business class seat on this 777. On previous flights, the configuration in business was the same, 1-2-1, but the actual seat design has been different. This flight had the best design so far. It was easy to recline, lay flat, or just use the foot rest. The service and food were good and the flight attendants were friendly. The departure gate at Heathrow is a bit strange. It is difficult to know exactly where your jetway is because gates seem to merge together. There is also a strange employee checking boarding passes as you approach the gate, but there is no real entrance to a seating area because it is all open space between gates. Other than putting up with Heathrow, everything was great by American Airlines. The inflight entertainment selections do not thrill me, so I always take my MacBook with Apple TV and beats wireless headphones."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Understandable Delay But Could Have Been Handled Better,"The experience started out fine with a smooth boarding. Thought we were ready to go until we were told that we had a weight and balance issue and needed 7 ""volunteers"" to take a later flight. With the strong winds out of the west, we needed to lose some weight so that we'd make it to Dallas and not bust minimums on fuel. I'm a pilot and I totally understand. But right after the statement about needing 7, they changed it to 10. Really gave the impression that they didn't know what they were doing. They offered $700 vouchers and only had two people take them up on it. I think a big part of the issue is that they couldn't tell people whether their flight would be later that day or the next day. That really makes a difference. The lady next to me told the gate agent that she needed to be to Dallas by 5:30 and asked if she could find out when a flight she could get on would arrive and the agent told her that she couldn't provide that information at that time. Again, they should have had their act together better. They also didn't specify until a later announcement that if you did spend the night that they would cover food, lodging and ground transportation. I know that's obvious to some people but not everyone and, frankly, with the way the airlines work these days, I'm not sure I'd have taken that for granted...Right after the first two volunteers left the plane, they upped the offer to $1200. Six more folks took them up on it so I thought we were waiting for two more but they closed the doors and we were backing away from the terminal. Yay! Then the plane stopped. After waiting a few minutes, the pilot came on and told us we had to go back and get two more off. I'm not sure why we left in the first place when we hadn't hit the ten we were told. So back we go. One couple had asked previously about getting to Austin and had been told, like the lady next to me, that they couldn't be told at that time when they'd get on another flight. But nobody else was volunteering so they gate agent worked with them and found them a flight with open seats that met their needs and they got off. So they closed the doors again...and we sat... Seems the gate agent couldn't get the jet bridge to move away from the plane. However, after a few minutes someone figured out something and off we went. The rest of the flight was smooth but long (Those westerly winds were really strong.) and we were about an hour late getting to DFW. So, as I said, I understand the problem but it could have been handled a lot more smoothly, with better communication and it would have resulted in a shorter delay and less frustration with the passengers. If American Airlines wants to be ""Something Special in the Air"" in a positive context, they have more work to do."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Good and bad,"First the good- Both flights going/coming back were on-time and arrived early, so kudo’s for that!Now the bad- seats are super-cramped! I am 5’9’ and have long legs. Luckily it was only a 2 hour flight because there was no room to move, and my knees were hitting the seat in front of me. Also the seat belt going to the bahamas was super-short. I had to ask for a seatbelt extender😩I am of average size, and the one on the returning flight was fine. My fear is that someone might be too embarrassed to ask for a seatbelt extender, and not have one at all. Not good if you hit turbulence in the sky!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,In a league of their own,"American Airlines (AA) is definetly in a league of their own and it is a pretty bad one. Flew from Johannesburg South Africa on British Airways to Heathrow London and was then booked onto AA as code sharing partner for the next leg of the flight to NYK. I have no idea why British Airways would link with AA as their is just no but absolutely not comparison in service. The flight personnel for starters looked like they had just got out of bed, sloppy and just so unfriendly. During the service times if something fell of their carts (which seemed they only had 2 on-board) they would just kick it under the chairs. The meals were bad, very bad - fast food at it's worst. And the air con was put on freezing during the flight. Not a pleasant long-haul experience.When I checked our seat-allocation before the flight I wanted to upgrade the seat by purchasing more leg space. The website would not accept my credit card. I then phoned the AA office in South-Africa and I was told that AA does not accept any credit cards from Africa ( South-Africa) HOW INSANE! British Airways had no problem with accepting South-African credit cards or for that matter any other mainline."
